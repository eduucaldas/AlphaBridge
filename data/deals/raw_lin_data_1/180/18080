nt|gulyas: so 9 to UNIA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Michael Rosenblum|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Mike|pg||
mb|1N|an|9-12|nt|sybarra: not a happy spade break here |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|athene: if you play a 9-12 notrump and you don't mind bending the shape a bit, you open it a lot!|pg||
nt|athene: i would say of any slightly non-standard bid, this has the biggest impact|pg||
nt|athene: because it comes up so much and it changes the whole character of the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: sorry no connection to other table, need to relog|pg||
nt|athene: north just thinking whether slam might be there|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: and it certainly might be|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: south is limited to an extent, perhaps, by failure to double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Brave intervention with 9 high and only 9 cards red vs white.|pg||
nt|athene: but he can still have enough for 6@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kamyk: a¿ mnie z sieci wywali³o po tym poprzednim:)|pg||
nt|athene: also with strong shapely hands people might prefer to start with 2@C rather than double|pg||
nt|athene: so north definitely can't just jump to 4@H |pg||
nt|athene: that would be too lazy|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jkotor: it is called "strefa", and it has many lovers|pg||
nt|jkotor: the problem is with "³apanie strefy"|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|psyck: 4@s in trouble here even if @s broke, as @d's are unfav too|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: with all danger suits lying favorably, this will be home easily|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dzieñ dobry wszystkim to our Polish viewers|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D has this drawback, though|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: results are in, sorry for the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
nt|athene: partner doesn't know you are just making a slam try in hearts :)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 2nd-4th, as usual|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: In this case protected by the fact that pd isn't accepting *any* invitations.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This contract is in jeopardy on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer may get trumps wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: would east bid like this with @HQxx? surely not|pg||
nt|athene: so i think declarer should have got the trumps right anyway|pg||
nt|athene: this is an odd lead though|pg||
nt|athene: @DK looks normal and safe|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, @H3 is odd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H4 would not have been|pg||
nt|athene: east is worried about @DAJ10x or something with declarer, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but that's a bit of a view to take|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jkotor: in my style E gives 2@h transfer with 6@S|pg||
nt|blum1956: It were probablly better to discard boards like this one from the play. Unfortunately that way players will know every board is "interesting" and that will be another game|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: Or just play matchpoints - no dull boards there|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|psyck: he has communication problem on the lead in trying to ruff 2@c's, so playing for suits to break|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jkotor: west can bid now 2N or 2@h, probably 2N showing better hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkotor: 2N or 2@s*|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: may see a spade hit the table from S |pg||
nt|gulyas: I would guess a @H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gulyas: some players say the machine-duplicated hands are rigged, but I think it is only the natural distribution of cards - hand-dealt hands are not able to give you all the probabilities|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not so dull in the other room where the contract is 3@CX|pg||
nt|blum1956: ))|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|gulyas: wow, which way?:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: that might make sense also |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: N-S, going for 1100 I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's another counter-argument to the "discard dull boards" approach|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jkotor: and "strefa" is found|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: all roads lead to a minus score |pg||

mb|1D|nt|gulyas: a good score for the trailing team in the CR|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 1 D promises a diamond suit here|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@d=15+ with 4+@h as mentioned|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@D is down on a @C lead|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, this will be difficult to match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right-sided the slam...|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: Yes indeed, 1100 and 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East was on a guess: which major to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: which after bidding @C's was not led in the other room |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|gulyas: after @Cs were bid and raised, W thought they could not have a slow @C trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D = I have hearts    1@H = I don't have hearts    bridge is fascinating|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kamyk: niestety nie wiem, co oznacza rekontra|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, they have to play it in notrumps now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: trying for 3nt|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats a lot of imps to gain in only 2 boards:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry specs, we can't tell you what 2@S is|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, Polish club in action here|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: The 18+ hand for sure, but ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5 or 7 hand, should have bid the grand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: The have shown all suits by now i guess|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@D and 2@S were mainly natural for change (maybe:))|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: in NT, I only see 7 tricks if clubs are led|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't see a non @c lead this table whereever they end up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 12 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sry, 13|pg||
nt|santyclz: 14|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|bjacobs: E/W playing this match perfectly for 0-28|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably some artificial GF that could be various hands, including the one with a long @C suit I assume|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,   |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW close to slam values, only missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know man has billions of unused brain-cells, but this is too much for a mere mortal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer forgot to unblock @SQ|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|athene: i doubt his opponents will be gloating about that, though|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: otrzyma³em kilka podpowiedzi; najbardziej autorytatywna: maksimum z fitem|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am also playing a relay precision system in the last few years, and I have the same problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet 4 @C some sort of ace asking|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|athene: i assume north started off by relaying for distributioni|pg||
nt|athene: distribution|pg||
nt|athene: and then 3@S was some sort of strength ask, maybe asking for number of controls|pg||
nt|athene: and south has so many, he makes a big bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@S asking controls with a base level of 2|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gulyas: the places where the artificial bids are useful are so rare, that you happen to forget them until they come up again|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think  (since I am blonde) I should stay with some system like 2/1 with gadgets |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have wrong-sided both minors so the only hope is NT|pg||
nt|athene: if north does know how many aces and kings his partner has, he might be thinking about how good slam can be, depending on whether south has the @SA or @HA|pg||
mb|6D|nt|psyck: The memory strain & the frequent intervention by opps are the problems with highly conventional systems...on the other hand they are fun to play & can produce great results on ...|pg||
nt|psyck: suitable hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: that would be my other choice, too:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: 14 IMPs down the drain|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If nothing else, it is good for the match|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: They would still have lost 11 in 5@D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jkotor: lol, bad technique by superstar :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: now do we see a club lead?|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, I enjoy my system as long its something I remember, and I am sure pd remembers, too:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: 4@Sx may complicate things|pg||
nt|gulyas: gets off to the wrong lead again|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: right Daniel,  as long as you and pard play same system much better (no matter what system) |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Was a huge swing in the other match. 5@D-1 and 5@DX=|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: 13 IMPs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|jkotor: starting with K@h gives a chance for 4 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jkotor: now squeeze vs W|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, no reduction|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he is home and dry|pg||
nt|psyck: I wonder if there is an equivalent to the Peter Principle for bridge systems...one expands & complicates ones system until both partners are equally uncomfortable with it...|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think its usually one of the players who says 'I cannot remember this, stop'|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so the raise did not cost much. The board was won/lost in the other room|pg||
mc|11|nt|gulyas: in a perfect world, where everyone has as much time and energy to learn the system as they like, relays are great|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: they have a little break so I will erase previous boards now|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: as soon as somebody is willing to pay me full time, I am willing to learn anything:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: will Kwiecien-Jagnievski reach the grand?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jkotor: choæ z drugiej strony: gdy E ma 5 kierów i singla @d, to raczej starczy mu atutów do bitki|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Without Polish club ... seems unlikely :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@D now|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like the "precision 2 @C"  6+ clubs etc |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Right: what makes 2/1 such a good approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D is game-forcing, which is very good for a hand like this|pg||
nt|blum1956: it depends on whether 2@d is GF|pg||
nt|gulyas: but with a twist, no M allowed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: It's a very tall order to bid a grand slam here|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok so the @H lead is easy |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: now its even harder to guess @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@H must be exclusion now|pg||
nt|blum1956: exclusion Blackwood would be useful|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@H here? ... but there are still holes in spades and clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have to be able to bid exclusion bw somehow, but S is not the one with the big hand, he only sees the 12hcp and a void in pd's suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 3@D showed a good hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done, should bid it now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so Opener must have his values where you need them if no @HA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could Kwiecien not have dloubled 2@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But no harm done|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: 2 no queen?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As it is, he even has wasted @HKQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did 3@D show 4 diamonds?|pg||
nt|gulyas: after N cued instead of 3NT, he surely has lots of extras|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump Q not needed N promising 4 diamonds with 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as 2@D could be 4 cards|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@D has to be 4|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he can see it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South has to commit one way or another ... and it has to be the grand I feel, else why bid 5@h|pg||
nt|blum1956: One needs to count accurately )))|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And be confident that 3@D showed 4-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He'd like to know about @CK of course, but there is no room to ask for it|pg||
nt|blum1956: how many Aces does pd have|pg||
nt|gulyas: pd cued in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, North did promise some kind of club control|pg||
nt|blum1956: He knows after the 4@c cue|pg||
nt|Walddk2: but that could be a singleton|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he has a singleton, he may have the @SQ or the @HA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: Once he bid 5@H, he was committed to following through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's Kwiecien's conclusion too|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: He just needed to think it through|pg||
nt|gulyas: if neither, then the @HKQ, so he has some finesses to take|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The key to this auction was the 3@D bid ... showing 4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Really, this auction is a model of modern bidding|pg||
nt|gulyas: of course, no hurries|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: 2/1, 4 card raise, 2nd round control bids, exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|gulyas: he saved the time in the play:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You could write a whole book about that auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: you don't always need Polish club, see, Roland?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I said Polish Club is needed|pg||
nt|blum1956: When I started to play bridge in the 70s 2@d was nf, ques from 1st round and no exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, that was Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In he other room, the wrong hand asked for keycards|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and South decided not to show his heart void|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You've got to feel for E/W ... haven't put a foot wrong and 41 imps in the hole|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have bid 5NT, 2 keycards + a void|pg||
nt|bjacobs: coulda shoulda|pg||
nt|Walddk2: American slang, yikes|pg||

nt|Walddk2: that would also have been 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then West would be squeezed in the back suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why East should have returned @SQ|pg||

nt|vugraphp1: hello to everyone again!|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: we have two pair with really complicated systems|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
mb|1D|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: ok, thanks Kasia|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: in the meantime, EW did bid 7@C on bd9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT: "a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 20-5 in the other match, playing the same boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 1 @H=spades|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: i hope I will be able to explain to you everything |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: East might have considered hitting 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c a good raise to 3@h|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gulyas: 4@C down 1, and so is every red suit contract NS may try|pg||
nt|gulyas: S was close to a t/o double here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is quite a gamble on a 15 count opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With one more diamond I could understand|pg||
nt|gulyas: the last time I did that, I had 5-5 in the Ms - we collected 800|pg||
nt|gulyas: with all the good boards he had, he should pass this - pd could not move, he only has 15, why do anything?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it does seem a bit masochistic to take another bid here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Partner is happy to defend 4@C, apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: hello again, 3rd segment from 6 in on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: erase them?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 3 @H is "hitting the deck"  saying "enough" |pg||
nt|Walddk2: replay maybe|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|blum1956: Yes/ Even if pd has a heart support which is far from being obvious NS may be short of tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: the grand rolled in in the meantime, for another 12|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H leaves me speechless and that takes a lot|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky somewhat, 4@H is on a finesse after all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One has to delve into his mind to see what we can learn from his thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: Finally on the current board Jagniewski will pay the bill I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Kasia and Joe|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: There is nothing to suggest that 4@H will play well|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe S did bid a t/o double |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He buys a dream dummy and still can't make|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he was considering passing as opposed to bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South doubled 4@C we have an explanation|pg||
nt|gulyas: on a @S lead ducked by S, 4@C is 2 off actually on a trump promotion - no, the @D loser goes away then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he didn't, Kasia?|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats the only possibility I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is bonkers if South did not double 4@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kasia has gone on strike, because we insulted his operating|pg||
nt|gulyas: bd 10 is also playing in 2@S in the meantime|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: W takes advantage of the limited nature of the 1@d bid to show a relatively good hand with great distribution.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: After a lengthy deliberation Jagniewski has decided to play @C7 from the dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: yes yes, replay, sorry:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: Gm (10am here) Roland, Kasia.|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: I know Jagniewski from real life; he is a sensible individual and would not bid 4@H without a double|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|psyck: 3@hx would have fetched a tidy score, but it was normal for W to escape to 4@c with a min opening & a 7 card suit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Rafal is also a nice guy|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and I think he was tossing up between 4@D and 4@H ... don't think it's sensible to pass 4@CX|pg||

nt|gulyas: he went searching for info|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: and figured S has the @SK, and N the A|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: Final board of the set, and well done to our flawless operator Kasia Dufrat|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The jury is out on Board 11 :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so S has to have something for his raise|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: they've turned the board - now N is Wojcicki|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: his only concern is bringing in the clubs for one loser|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And thanks muchly to our flawless commentators Daniel, Michael and Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: ty all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally our appreciation to the Polish Bridge Union (Slawek Latala)   for broadcasting this excellent event|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer response and good hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: "never put an 8-card suit down in dummy" - what about -card suits?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 9-card suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That dummy is absolutely worthless|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garden2005: otwarcia z trzeciej rêki podlegaj¹ regule "w najsilniejszy kolor 4+", w przypadku utrzymania siê przy grze przeciwnika jest to jednoczesnie wskazanie wistu|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muchly!?, minus 1 point to Bill|pg||
nt|blum1956: thx all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Paul Heitner:  There are no 9-card suits.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: now relays?  I will need help here |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6@C is on a finesse, but since its trumps, they will not bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do N-S play Dwururka, Kasia?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Jagniewski did not promise anything .... unless diamonds are trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Nail they play I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: i think they do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deviced by Pazur|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: so you cash the ace first, succeeding against any 3-2 break or singleton king|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: I hope I am not in the red yet:)|pg||
nt|athene: north's hand is worth 7 tricks in diamonds and none in hearts, but on the other hand 4@H is pretty much a command to put the dummy down, so....|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he hoped he might make a trick with a spade ruff|pg||
nt|athene: even a club ruff not inconceivable i suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only consolation is that 5@D does not make either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 3 down vulnerable is not exactly a triumph|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D was much more likely to be doubled|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Event continues in about 20 minutes I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 6-0, this may go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: this will|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2N asks for 3@c to show shortness, 3@h @s sing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pazur in Polish means 'nail'|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me try that again,  2 @S asked for 2n,  so that S cold show shortness.  and 3 @H says spades |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|nt|athene: nothing better than that|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Pazur also devised Dwururka, the double-barreled rifle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: in 2007|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|santyclz: E didn't want to x opposite a weak nt.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: this allows N to bid the nt,  with wastage in spades,   (or place the contract suitably) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a link to Dwururka but not Nail|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next is scheduled to start in about 20 minutes|pg||
