pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Finals lets you access system summary forms for the finalists   click on the team name then appropriate pair|pg||
nt|psyck: Operator will enter the players names once he gets a chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 tricks but the auction was murky and i fancy we are in for some torture|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: my guess is we again have  N:Grue  E:Greco S:Lall W:Hampson|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s7|pc|d7|pg||

nt|wstuart: Probably as it is his only play.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: both play a Big Club   in fact they use the same opening bid descriptions|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wstuart: He can't return to dummy if he plays the J and it loses.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he should have pitched the club from dummy rather than the heart|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: said he made the Bridge play if declarer had 10x|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|pef: east west have a chance to get too high on this hand.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|an|4 or 5 !s|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|royhughes: Is double a transfer to spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stevo:  tough bid  for Justin here with light openings I think nice decision|pg||
nt|pef: double is 4 or 5 spades|pg||
nt|chorush: They are likely playing 1S denies more than 3 hands in a directionless hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: still pass seems rather conservative vul. at imps, but if they play 14-16 nts and he knows partner unlikely|pg||
nt|pef: to have even 3 spades,,,|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|stevo:  hard lead for Brad with partner very unlikly to have 3 hearts since he would have enough points to raise on this auction|pg||
nt|pef: specs seem a little shocked by justin's pass, but there is sound logic behind it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 1NT rebid 11-13|pg||
nt|royhughes: It seems well judged to me|pg||
nt|royhughes: 11 is more common than 13, too|pg||
nt|stevo:  I like pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: need a couple of @s or @d spots to think about bidding|pg||
nt|chorush: I guarantee you Justin is rooting for a not too firendly card lie|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad starts to pull a card . Thinks better of it|pg||
nt|pef: very true.  give dummy the 109 of spades instead of two little and 3nt seems easily worth bidding|pg||
pc|d9|nt|royhughes: The indications are we may have a slow segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: all these players best of friends but the mood is serious|pg||
nt|chorush: Grue-Lall play fairly quickly. Moss Gitelman are more deliberate from what I have seen|pg||

nt|Walddk2: As we don't have full names in profiles, commentators are kindly requested to use surnames|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzff: yea hard to do that when i am so friendly with everyone but Ill do my best|pg||
nt|royhughes: Moss didn't want to give Grue a heart trick, but it might have been better to|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|pef: I see we now have full names--thanks Jan|pg||
nt|stevo:  so can i call him Joe now :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: So can we go to first names again, or stay with surnames?|pg||
nt|stevo:  Boo?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|henryb:  It did not matter, of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  on xruff, W can dump his last @d and hold it to 2|pg||
mb|1D!|an|could be short|nt|marlowepi: no, 250 people yawning "get ON with it"|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision 1@d|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=(10)11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, Marshall, they weren't yawning until you suggested it|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW are playing a strong @C with 2+ @D suits, 14-16 NT I think.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this looks destined for 3nt|pg||
nt|iceking: Greco maybe 2 strong for 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: might just instead jump to 3nt now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  NS Platnick-Diamond also playing Big Club   Wooldridge-Hurd play jazzed up 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: he will think about it for sometime|pg||
nt|cherilou: X and bidding your suit shows this hand to me--about 8 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so 2/1 & not prec for NS then with this pair|pg||
nt|iceking: almost can play 3nt vs zero hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: as it is this will work also |pg||
nt|iceking: but i dont really like this bid|pg||
nt|cherilou: he took a position and will make the contact|pg||
nt|roswolf: i always say thinking a lot leads too often to mistakes -imo this deserves to be a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and their 2@d opener is short @ds and 11-15|pg||
nt|henryb:  The movement to play transfers after overcalls has not yet reached the States|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: other room   1@D(precision)-X-P-3@C//P-3@H-P-3N//all pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he lands on his feey|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: feet|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's slowly getting here, Henry...another 20 years:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: soloway was proselytizing for it decades ago|pg||
nt|wstuart: The 14-16 NT is very popular in the strong @C community these days.  Getting the balanced 16 HCP hands out of 1@C made a lot of difference to the Precision players.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: yes 2@h or 3N look better options|pg||
nt|iceking: he is just 2 good for 2@H|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|wstuart: Note that though the very popular Precision system is just starting to come around to this idea, I believe it first started with Shenkin's @C system in the 1960s and was also part ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: of the Orange @C used by Hamman in Wolff on the Aces teams.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for W to duck @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D to jackis likely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: maybe but 4@H would be worthy of HH himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Wooldridge shows   response to DBL wasn't clearcut  either   2@C vs 3@C|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i overcall with upto bad 18 , so my x & bids are strong, & still this looks too strong for 2@h here|pg||
nt|iceking: yes Hampson must have been close to 3@C bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: but world champs tend to be right more often than not|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see all lines make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course 2@H rebid insufficient --  take away Hampson @CKJ and still game|pg||
nt|psyck: Maybe more likely to bid 3@c against a prec pair like other roon than a 2/1 pair this room, due to the @d holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|iceking: decl afraid @D are 5-1  |pg||
nt|iceking: he has no entry home if he playes 3rounds of @S|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: NS 1N opener is always 14-16|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  j@c must as for @h switch|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: this will be a push 450 coming up in few sec|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is meaningless here  but  i just noticed on their system summary form|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: W knows hearts likely to block|pg||
nt|wstuart: @D is betting that they can't run 5 @H tricks or that S wasn't winning the @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from most holdings that dont block, N would have led one|pg||

nt|stevo:  avoiding losing to stiff q on his left|pg||
nt|royhughes: I liked a club to the jack at T2.|pg||
nt|chorush: The safety play would have been to cross to dummy with a diamond and lead a club toward the jack|pg||
nt|pef: but is that really best, Steve.  doesn't this lose to stiff small on his right|pg||
nt|royhughes: But I thought you need another entry in the weak hand to want to do that|pg||

nt|marlowepi: spade shify should be fairly clear on the auction|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: yes roy|pg||
nt|royhughes: I bet you're right, Steve, otherwise you would have expected 4@c with equal controls (maybe)|pg||
nt|stevo:  The reason I like 3@S is he has so few losers even though hes light on hi cards its close since 2@S is a free bid so that shows decent hand|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge did overcall 1N   he's younger than Hampson|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it may not, right. but isnt it more likely than there is no spade danger?|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|iceking: so is this mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if alert says  short in your suit   or just as Magnus says  mild slam try|pg||
nt|iceking: so north will check keycards now with his maximum|pg||
nt|roswolf: my confidence ebbs away the more north thinks|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have like to show my shortness here, even N did open 1@D its usually the key reach slam show your shortness|pg||
nt|psyck: I play Xfrs after 2N rebid as Inv+ hands too & so this would be a mild slam try|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Platnick  3N north|pg||
nt|iceking: why not just check out keycards |pg||
nt|psyck: N did not check KC to check for trump quality instead maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because keycards won't give enough info|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant believe if 4@S here is slam invit 4nt is 2 play that doesnt make any sense to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this focuses directly on trump suit|pg||
nt|cherilou: 5@S sure seems aggressive when partber probably showed some mild slam interest and you have 2 little @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you want to be in slam opposite  @SAQxxxx  @CA ?|pg||
nt|iceking: north hand is super slammish though he has max in hcp and no jack in hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is utter lunancy if you ask me - but i am not playing for a place in the BermudaBowl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is an awful lot to bundle into a jump that takes us to the 3 level|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: Right Magnus, normal to make a try after this seq|pg||
nt|cherilou: N has minimum for his 2NT bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me IFF [keyword] bidding over 4@S  that 5@S is best bid|pg||
nt|psyck: N has a very good max as 2N is 17-18 for them|pg||
nt|iceking: that will just have to happen then, bypassing rkcb is just crime in my books as there is no defense if you reach silly slam with 2 keycards missing |pg||
nt|psyck: South should have just rebid 4@s on 2N maybe|pg||
nt|cherilou: S had entire 5 level to que bid and didn'r--N should pass 4 @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has no real extras - and his trump suit is not really robust|pg||

nt|roswolf: amazing lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  makes it hard for Wooldrtdge to bid 3N|pg||

nt|andyv:  I thought N would bid 3N with his hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not close for me, 2C is the better suit & more preemptive|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Hurd should try 2N rather than 3@d|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: 4th highest of longest and strongest though|pg||
nt|iceking: @D lead in open room |pg||
nt|cherilou: that usually works the best--S following tried and true|pg||

nt|cherilou: NS still have time to get their @S, 2@H, 3@D and @C|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: this looks best |pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|wstuart: N doesn't have enough to bid 3NT.  But he can make a vlaue showing 3@D which is both safe and allows S to bid on with an above avg hand.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|iceking: now Zagorin needs to go for @S|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like 3@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: someon somewhere did a very long BOREL simulation and found that 4th highest of longest and strongest gain most tricks in any denomination over 51% of the time- a mind-boggling ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: statistic|pg||
nt|iceking: Ten would have been better i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: @S 10 is better|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|henryb:  and how does South guess that North has a club stopper?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem is, there are many hands WITHOUT extras than can make game|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why I prefer 3N...5 card suit and Q@c somewhat protected|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamonds is higher than clubs so cant ask for the stopper|pg||
nt|wstuart: If the t/o DBLer bids 3NT after a 3@D jump, should N think that he is taking is DBL back?|pg||
nt|andyv:  their requirements for dbl may be less once pd is a passed hand, so 3@d may be the saner bid for them.|pg||

nt|andyv:  exciting auction anyway|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|iceking: maybe east has some bid to show @H shortness with both minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = @D|pg||
nt|cherilou: transfer to @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S pass this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not everyone would reach 3N on this lot|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sure|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: and i think might include weak 5@D & 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: then will 3@H show shortage|pg||
nt|iceking: if so then w would not bid 3@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C no super-accept of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might need better @D for 3@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a positive fit perhaps?|pg||
nt|cherilou: does W like or not like @D's with 3@C call--everyone plays one of the 2 methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what is default for "accept"   A/Kx  Hxx  Qxx  |pg||
nt|psyck: If as Al suggests, then E can pass with weak 55 minors here|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|iceking: that doesnt make any sense then they are in 3@C on 5-2fitt with 5-3 @D fitt|pg||
nt|cherilou: have to decide like or don't like no middle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW   1N-3@C = Puppet Stayman   1N-3@D = game force 5+@D & 5+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: remember 1nt = 14-16 0nly so east knows they are light on values for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: vwd|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade best|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for N not to bid, and 2@d would be a spade raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  and answer is no|pg||
nt|wstuart: He's far from cold in practice.  Don't pregloat them.  :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, only question was if he would pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but S doesnt have a clear 3N, and if he bids 2N maybe not all Ns would go, esp NV|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: halfway time limit just sounded|pg||
nt|wstuart: I must say, 3NT was not my first choice of rebid with the S hand.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wstuart: however, I would pass 1NT before rebidding 2@S with that suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ouch|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think 2@s was in the radar|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceking: ok well done no danger go past 3nt now |pg||
nt|cherilou: no, just in case E was 5-5 weak in minors--not on this hand. Now 3@H is shortess and W's red suits have been described|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe i spoke to soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener shows @H holding for 3N    if Qxx is enough that implies  east hold @DAKxxxx   but that holding goes to game without asking|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the long tank suggests a further try may be made|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|cherilou: then 3@C must have been like @D's--only reason to bid again with E|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|iceking: so 4@C looks like rkcb |pg||
nt|roswolf: agree sheri|pg||
nt|iceking: just guessing though|pg||
nt|roswolf: cheri - sorry|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes it does look like KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  3@C said not @D good enough for 3N  and 3@H said i have game force [slam try] with 6+@D and short @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: in that case a quick sign off is in order|pg||
nt|iceking: so east is just overbidding now continue over 3nt|pg||

nt|cherilou: hmmmmm|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: they do appear to be groping around in the dark|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like some misunderstanding |pg||
nt|cherilou: N might lead @HA with @DK|pg||
nt|iceking: it seems like Hampson is responding to rkcb and Greco is just bidding natural 4@C|pg||
nt|psyck: Strange after E knew of @h wastage after 3N on 3@h showing shortness|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoa c'est tres incroyable|pg||
nt|henryb:  clearly declarer needed to play @d first, but that was not at all obvious|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|cherilou: seems pretty crazy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is very hard for East to play a low spade -- we can all see that would beat it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not obvious, but maybe correct. if E has heart ace W will have a spade card so defence wll have the tempo. this may be the layout you have to play for|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cherilou: this bad bid will cost|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: now sit back and wait for the trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have guessed 4@H RKC @C  [bid 4@D to agree that suit]|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see in this bidding 4@H cannot be meant as quebid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  so it could still be beaten, but much much harder|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|iceking: reason is you do not que bid King after pd shows shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge playing 4N West|pg||

nt|psyck: Not good for Diamond team, 6@h would hanve been in trouble on a @s lead other table & the previous deal was an unforced error|pg||

nt|stevo:  tough guess here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|royhughes: In general, opponents bid more with singletons than with doubletons, so I agree with Grue|pg||
nt|chorush: which probabilistically made his play even money|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Grue says it would be a good time to follow suit as fred thinks|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If that is enough to sway the odds I don't know, but a priori it's 52-48 for the drop, so you don't need much info before you finesse|pg||

pc|cT|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: trick still up as Moss thinks|pg||
nt|pef: well presumably north has no five hard suits and only four spades at most and four hearts, so maybe the finesse is mathematically slightly better, but it is a very small amount|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: brad says im not going to play but turns the trick over finally|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Let's agree that Fred has his bid|pg||
mb|3S|an|u called it Stevo|mb|4S|nt|pef: the really favorable spots and positioning of the aces in hearts and clubs means that 4 spades can actually make here|pg||
nt|stevo:  now Brad 5@D i guess|pg||
nt|chorush: The 3NT bidders would have gotten the best of this IMO|pg||
nt|stevo:  Brad will like his clubs here I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad thinking . puts his hand down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yesterday Fred overcalled on a 5 count, at the 1 level right enough, but still. This hand is somewhat better|pg||
nt|pef: as long as gure leads a spade 5 diamonds should be down 1|pg||
nt|royhughes: and continues spades.  |pg||
mb|4N|an|very very slowly|nt|royhughes: or maybe shifts to the king of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  that might be natural here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe Moss thinks *Fred* has the spade stopper?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Fred thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: in the thinker pose!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is this what they call the good/bad 4NT?|pg||

nt|pef: lall should work out to pitch a club here, but under the pressure of the long event?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When did you last see an auction like the one in the closed room?|pg||
nt|stevo:  Joe's double  of 4NT looks ill advised but he didnt think they had a chance to make 5@D either so felt it was safe and wanted a number|pg||
nt|pef: only 16 imps riding on his play|pg||
nt|royhughes: was new to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: has to guess whether Grue 5-4-4 or 5-5-3 but Grues first pitch after the @ss was a @c indicating 5-4-4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: still thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: at the other table in a similar position the defense got it right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: A player can think as long as he wants but there might be time issues and penalties later|pg||
nt|chorush: He needs to throw a club now but on another trump he needs to throw a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: lall apologises to the table . Moss says dont worry about it|pg||
nt|stevo:  right Ira good point|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S knows 3N may be best or only game, but the path there would be murky, and slow bidding might help EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd: bet it's not Michaels|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond will need to show stuff in both suit, probably by pitching middle spade first, and Platnick will have to work out the position and what to hold|pg||

pc|s6|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c7|nt|kit: good technique by declarer is to lead the 2 of diamonds on his next to last diamond -- if opponents miscount, they may think it is your last diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but you might too, and then lead a side suit prematurely:)|pg||
nt|kit: and note that he ruffed with 6 of diamonds, so he may have exactly that in mind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no he was just unvlocking in case the 4 of diamonds was hidden and the trump 8 anbd 9 thus both fell on the first round|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: W planning later discards|pg||
nt|kit: This is not easy at all.  Defense doesn't know if declarer is 2-2 in rounded suits -- he could be 3-1 either way.  Can they communicate?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he knows spade is safe|pg||
nt|andyv:  their carding is standard|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: Vinje signals would have cleared the shapes up long ago|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer has Kxx of clubs, West needs to keep all of his clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: decades ago Helge Vinje devised globals shape signals|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: i think that was his first name, not sure|pg||
nt|kit: When East doesn't pitch either a club or a heart, which he would from 4 of either suit, West should deduce the distribution|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all based on fact that every bridge hand has either one suit with an odd nu,mber of cards, or thgree of them|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  so much for the 2@d theory|pg||
nt|kit: Therefore, West should know that heart pitch is safe|pg||
nt|kit: and he should have pitched heart last turn I think -- make it clear that East has to guard hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: And, when both defenders pitch all their spades, that makes it safe for declarer to cash his last trump.  So better if one of them could have held a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Velcro finally fell off the top of the screen; W and S discussing carding|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  E may think of just keeping parity with dummy here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|royhughes: You're wondering if it's not enough for a positive?|pg||
nt|chorush: it does seem that a 6 card semisolid suit should get a chance to show it|pg||
nt|stevo:  I would have expected a positive in hearts |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad squeezes the bridge of his nose and takes a deeep breath|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: staring at his cards|pg||
nt|stevo:  assuming 2@H is negative what is 3@H|pg||
nt|stevo:  Brad has a hard bid with xx diamonds |pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Last thing you want to do is what happened in the Vandy this year when both teams bid 7@d missing the A@d. Kibs were in shock I can tell you. I got around 721 messages, like "How ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: on earth ...."|pg||
nt|chorush: Problem for Brad is that he may not have any forcing way to raise spades and even if he does the hand may do better in hearts|pg||
nt|stevo:  bidding 7 of ace of trumps is underrated IMO|pg||
nt|stevo:  I think Brad will Blackwood here as nervous as it is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: would have to bid 7@s to have a chance here|pg||
nt|chorush: Spec's have various suggestions for the bidding but most depend on partnership agreements|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: still staring at his cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not play in spades with a club suit like this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trumps surely|pg||

nt|stevo:  2@D = waiting, 2@H = dbl neg, 2@S = 8-10 bal, 2nt = positive in either major but they try to avoid this bid (as you see), 3m = positive in other minor, 3@H = any solid suit|pg||

nt|kit: actually, maybe Diamond can't afford to come down to stiff king of hearts|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cherilou: it was a pre-empt--why does S think he should bid to 5@C when partner didn't?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||

mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: S will have to make do with this lot until a good hand comes along|pg||
nt|kit: if he does, declare can cash ace of clubs, low heart to king and ace, and scores the last trick in hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D has some potential value, takes away support double etc.....the danger in mildish preempts with lots of trumps and no values it that opps might be able yo make whatever they bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and your telling them extent of your fit might drive them there|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S hand almost good enough to open old fashioned 4NT asking for Aces|pg||

nt|kit: Yes Andy.  I think it is good enough.|pg||
nt|kit: so you gamble on the jack of spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was hedging against specs who wanted the J@s:)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this looks a bit high|pg||
nt|kit: but we don't know how they play an opening 4NT -- may have some other meaning|pg||
nt|andyv:  main thing you don't want to do is what happened in the Vandy this year when both teams bid 7@d missing the A@d|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|cherilou: S took the passive action here|pg||
nt|kit: I would never let partner play a 4-4 spade fit with that heart suit.  KQJ10xx is called trumps|pg||
mb|5D|an|1|mb|p|nt|cherilou: NS make 4@D so only 1 or 2 imps either way|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s can make some @D so maybe a small gain|pg||
nt|kit: Now, do they play 6@C is to play?|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|kit: at least Wooldridge thinks so.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he may get overruled here|pg||
nt|kit: But is it to play, or TO PLAY?|pg||
nt|kit: in other words, is it a suggestion or a command?|pg||
nt|andyv:  + side for NS is there are 4 small slams that make|pg||
nt|andyv:  so they just need to stay out of 6@d|pg||
nt|wstuart: I hope Hurd doesn't interpret this as bid 7 with a 3rd round 1@C control.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S should fake-ask for queen of spades, then correct the 5S reply to 6C. maybe that would be the muzzle sequence|pg||
nt|andyv:  a new meaning to walking the dog, Marshall?|pg||
nt|kit: the question is, have they discussed the meaning of 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: If Hurd corrects to 6@H, that will be okay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes my remark was addressed to that in a roundabout way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because there could be two paths to 6C|pg||
nt|lml: oh you mean south|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't think this S will pass 6@H - it wouldn't be natural - he would correct to 6@S which will be sure to be playable.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "we've agreed spades"  _sure but how about clubs, instead, the suit i only bid once"  "no how about hearts instead, the suit i only bid once?"|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d was dbld in OR on 42 and 3 imp gain to Bathurst|pg||
nt|lml: I would open 1C too|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|wstuart: In several of my partnerships, 6@C would be a 3rd rd control ask.|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  we all know that 6@h, 6@s and 6N make|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, 6@s may have saved or gained 2 imps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i were joel, it would be hard. if i dont get to play 6C, he dont get to play 6H:)|pg||
nt|kit: if no ace of hearts lead, makes 7 |pg||
nt|kit: rare that you can discard 6 losing hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes 6H inferior for that reason:)|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|chorush: We can see how declarer can make this but he also has ways to go set\|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stevo:  declarer doesnt know @D are 43 here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|stevo:  he also doesnt know who has 4th @D if they are 43|pg||
nt|chorush: I think lall can beat it with a club now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: welll based on the carding he can assume Lall has the 4th @d|pg||
pc|c8|nt|stevo:  just because the 3 of @D is returned doesnt mean he didnt lie in count so all unclear|pg||
nt|pef: seems like this does set up 5 tricks for the defense|pg||
nt|royhughes: Fred may have gone after spades since there are fewer entries in dummy -- the hearts could wait|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: u calling my boy Jlall a liar !!??|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stevo:  in a warm fuzzy way|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|pef: although now if he guesses it right he can endplay grue|pg||
nt|royhughes: looks like West can be endplayed|pg||
nt|stevo:  he can make on endplay but hes not looking at their hands so very hard|pg||
nt|pef: yes and grue led the j of clubs back to help confused the matter|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes -- a spade finesse may look best|pg||
nt|stevo:  seems double dummy to guess this hand |pg||
nt|royhughes: I think you are right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: everyone leans into the table all at once except moss who leans back and stretches|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's sometimes exciting when you see a way to make it, looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|pef: but as we saw earlier, players at this level REALLY hate to take finesses|pg||

pc|hT|pc|s5|nt|stevo:  perhaps the 8 of clubs is a true card he has a shot|pg||
nt|pef: spade pitch best here as he did|pg||
nt|chorush: Fred may wonder why Joe instaplayed the heart King|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|wstuart: South has an incredibly wide range for his bidding.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: 3@S is a testosterone bid|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@S another agressive action |pg||
nt|cherilou: yes it's a 14-16 NT right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: for both pairs|pg||
nt|cherilou: Mighty big|pg||
nt|iceking: i would not have thought about it have to admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east is clearly contemplating game|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3nhAS NO PLAY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 27  platnick-diamond stay out of trouble  4@S Wooldridge [who thought long time about bidding more]|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3 has no play|pg||
nt|iceking: on a normal @C Jack lead its doomed|pg||
nt|cherilou: or @H lead or @S lead or small @D lead :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: 18 HCP, but the dreaded 4-3-3-3 -- and he is right to open 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind the 18 hcp, I do mind the 2 tens|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: but give Greco   K93  AJ32 98 AQ73   and 4@S looks good   so we shouldn't be too harse about 3@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's a minimum 1N opener|pg||
nt|iceking: even if Hampson had passed 2@S N would bal i believe |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|iceking: then after p p 3@S looks rather normal |pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I thought he might|pg||
nt|wstuart: On an eaerlier hand he opened a 4432 14 count with 1NT now he bids 1NT with a very controllish 18 count|pg||
nt|kit: If you always deduct a point for 4-3-3-3, you won't be far wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: they play 14-16 but apparently not in 4th seat|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wstuart: If you count each ace as 4.5 points you won't be far wrong either.|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  15-17  in 3rd seat vul and all 4th seats|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise 14-16|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all very sensible. but to quote a commentator from the other night:  "all those who have ever gotten a good result at IMPs by downgrading an 18 count, please raise your.....no, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably impossible"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  I don't quote commentators...too much work|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the way I heard Eric Rodwell describe it;  frequent upgrades infrequent downgrades.  Opening a 15-17 N with that hand would very much not be my choice.|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  but merely playing Q@s, cash @h and exit @s was enough to make 3 or am I missing something?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: wd south keeping his eye on the ball|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: thx all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one more deal in this set i believe|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|pef: so far largest swing in the set has been 6 imps, although last board might be double digits|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  big swing on that hand against 1nt at other table|pg||
mb|3N|nt|royhughes: You always like to think there was a way to work it out but sometimes there just wasn't|pg||
nt|pef: ver tense well played set|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|pef: apparently the other hand played in 1nt.  that's a bit odd on 26 combined hcp|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: last deal of this set|pg||
nt|wstuart: Any takers?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: and a feisty bd to finish this set|pg||
nt|kit: West will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: North might try 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: don;t go too far folks, out in the Lobby there is an open bar hosted by BBO, just show them your ticket stub from the VG room. strict 7-drink minimum|pg||
nt|andyv:  a good set so far for Bathurst|pg||
nt|kit: and then?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|iceking: 3nt from S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont like dbl by north butanything is possible now|pg||
nt|iceking: hmm looks like normal 3nt bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@H confirmed 6@H   [5@H was possible]|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: maybe N believes this dbl is pen?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherilou: had W started with 4@H that would have ended the auction--now NS likely to gey to good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: hope not the 2nt bidder always has trump support unless big balanced|pg||
nt|kit: Hurd hoping the surprise heart attack will defeat 3NT|pg||

nt|iceking: thx everyone back in over a hour i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: with no entry N had to decide if his partner had 1 or 2 @S--I think he should get it right when he knows E has 6 @H's|pg||
