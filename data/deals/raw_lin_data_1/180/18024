nt|andyv:  with match this close, I don't think Rubin was changing esp. since his team is ahead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 6 might be a bit off there|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: faces D8, CA, and tosses the rest aside, making 2|pg||

nt|sybarra: is this the right score? |pg||
nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H doesn't fit   anything for either pair|pg||
nt|andyv:  or for any pair that I know of|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: oh its 107|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: really tighten up |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S Size Ask  for  NT invite or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = reject NT invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: goren-donn played 3NT while NS in the other room attempted 6@d in their 6-4 fit and went 1 off|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: I have 9 that's worse than most 7s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but each match playing a different set of boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: phew didn't lose the broadcast this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: network burped|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin still studying dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @DJ: rusinow from 4 or more, standard from 3 or fewer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson asks for another look at the spots for the thousandth time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: spade called, simson asks for another second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs    upside-down: count, attitude, smith      NS  also upside-down suit preference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson has changed his gray polo shirt for a black one|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS part of the winning GNT team...I think 2nd time for them.. from Ohio.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson crosses his arms and sits back in his seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin watching the ceiling as he often does|pg||
nt|andyv:  was Rubin serious about playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson in his thinker pose, elbow on his thigh, hand on his cheek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- did Jacobs concede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no one told me if they did concede|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: of course rubin was not serious about playing standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson replied that he and simson were playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nickell team down 48|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and joked that it would be interesting if they had to switch systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody for EHAA??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I'd be all for EHAA, I could explain the bidding better then having played it myself|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: although I usually play strong club I don't know..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a very fun friday night game   we used to play [very illegal]  one card if i dealt,  one card if partner dealt, opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: all the intricacies of either NS or EW system|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hello specs.  This is the semi finals...first set of what promises to be an exciting match|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW play a precision style club|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: interesting choice to go with a forcing 2@d before bidding hearts.  I don't know if this sequence got the 5-6 message across or not|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a complex system of relays|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: well not quite.  They do play lots of transfers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3c meant as 3-1-4-5|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|joest: hi Kirshna|pg||
nt|joest: Krishna|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||

pc|c3|nt|andyv:  gm Peter and CK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s would have gome down if E gets in with @d to play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should have respected his pd's x after he already bid out his hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: with the hearts ruffing out, probably to declarer's surprise, this will make 6|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Andy - for me just after dinner, and CK prob late night :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: just catching up - welcome|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades dbld looks like 1 down  although it was allowed to make in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: re Susan, lets hope the connection stabilises this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: one can hope, but unlikely|pg||
nt|robinswr: it's nice having more trumps then declerer|pg||
nt|robinswr: and a suit to tap him further|pg||
nt|robinswr: declarer needs to pitch the spades from dummy in order tostop the tap|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW 1@d is 10-15 with 2+@ds|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: it looks like they are better off by not letting 4@S play out|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  14-16|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe only undertricks were makable there in any game there on a normal day|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 2@H  4-11 HCP, 5-7 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: after the interruption the redeal button didnt automatically work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I was busy typing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 15-17 in 3rd seat vul, and all 4th seat|pg||
nt|andyv:  they will find the @s game|pg||
nt|robinswr: some would bid 1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N modified Ogust|pg||
nt|joest: they're in the wrong event if they don't :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, W has quite a pewerful hand, even opp a 14-16 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: much better to support hearts and ignore the spades|pg||
nt|psyck: I agree with supporting @h, though 4 level is strange|pg||
pc|d5|nt|robinswr: only if playing a forcing club system|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 6+@H and   [i think] min|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  low club is winner here|pg||
nt|joest: just gave up on slam. partner would need aperfecto I guess but if the ace of diamonds had been @hKQ....|pg||
nt|andyv:  when NS open 1@d, it's either semi balanced or unbalanced with mainly diamonds or 4-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|psyck: W also happy to hear opps bidding @d (lesser @d wastage with pd)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: garner has the wrong shape, and these are the wrong colors, for saving in 5@d!|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d void is a big minus for slam searching opposite a NT bidder when you have limited values|pg||
nt|joest: if Howard is thinking here we may be in for a looooong session|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will be... both NS are deliberate players|pg||
nt|joest: north more so than south|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @h2 turned quickly, ekeblad: "may I?", johnson: "mais oui!"|pg||
nt|psyck: he can see 4@s, 1@h, 1@d, 5@c for 11 tricks if blakc suits break|pg||

nt|andyv:  nothing wrong with being deliberate although yesterday's match between Aker and Wolfson produced some very long delays|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfd: 2@H 10-15 or 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H   isn't part of Ekeblad system   maybe they really did switch system|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h=5+@hs and 4@c, 10-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   i miscounted @C    10-15  5+@H & 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last board, ekeblad asked to see the final heart trick again, johnson said it didn't matter, played @s3 and conceded @s @H @d @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@c 2+ and not precision|pg||
nt|psyck: NS 2/1 style & EW precision|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: the <aker-team was vslow playing all the way - also in 1. round <.9|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|joest: 1@s = either diamonds or a 1NT response|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: actually over double it's just diamonds, sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: These teams were originally seeded 5th & 10th, but some heavy seeds including Nickell & Gordon fell along the way.|pg||
nt|pelu: NS open on almost all 11 counts - and many distributional 10 counts|pg||
nt|psyck: NS's bidding summary says "Normal 21st century" :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: something to be said for rebidding 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ordinarily 1@s by this pair shows no 4 card major and is similar to forcing NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: consecutive partscores!  good luck partner, I stretched a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  match got tighter as 4@h went down 1 in CR|pg||
nt|robinswr: make the queen of diamonds the king then its clear|pg||
pc|c5|nt|robinswr: the way you show a 2 1/2 spade bid is to bid 2 minor then raise 2@s to three|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  unscrambling the tricks will be the EW task|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, its a bad feeling to go down in 2@S when u r cold for 6@D...|pg||
nt|robinswr: the spades are so weak that if partner has zero or one spade, 2 minor could be better|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am exeggarating, but u do make 6 as the cards lie|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: very optimistic|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  pushed a little too hard on this one|pg||
nt|joest: quite|pg||
nt|pelu: even 4@h need some work|pg||
nt|joest: btw the pass was alerted b/c it said 'lead diamonds'.  A double would have meant 'don't lead diamonds"|pg||
nt|psyck: a simple doubly & raise to 3@h shows W's values for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think their 1@s in comp was either minor, that is why the pass over 4@d|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s was diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: no after thje free 2@H from East W has a GF hand|pg||
nt|joest: we used to call hands like east's "pickles and ice cream"  Some very good things and some very bad things.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all who know the systems for explaining.|pg||
nt|joest: "where do I start" thinks declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: even making five would be a challenge|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: but over 5@C he could (sh) only bid 5@h|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the last score I had was Welland 262-204 over Jacobs.  if Jacobs conceded, no one told me, but it's plausible|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking may endplay E|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: would not be the first time they had|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  his main hope is that all games go down now|pg||
nt|ybob: XX   QXXXX    XXX    AXX  = VERY GOOD SLAM |pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10  helps Ekeblad exit trump|pg||
nt|psyck: if you chose to rebid 2@c, would you bid on after 2@d?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|robinswr: while you only have one diamond loser you have two hearts and the fourth club to get rid of|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|s3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: my own take is that Justin got a little carried away with his hand.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|joest: where the tricks coming from?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gulyas: you can ruff the @Hs and guess the @Cs|pg||
nt|robinswr: however, 6@d would fetch. ruff two hearts in dummy and play trumps you have a club spade sqeeze|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather be in 5@D than in 2@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: you may not have two fast losers but that's not 12 winners|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: and after a free 2@H it was very optimistick to bid 5@C - the void in @S (one of partners suits) not a big value -with only 4 card @h|pg||
nt|psyck: what would double of 1@s by lall have been?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|joest: you'll have to ask him. :)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Simson will get location of @DK correct  so !Q will pin card from West holding to down 1|pg||
nt|robinswr: Q8xx opposite AK2 when the 109 falls, its restricted choice to finesse the 8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Ekeblad might not bid 3@C with just  KK and 4@C|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psyck: I play 3@d on 1@s as Nat, Inv; but the suit not good enuf for that :(|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|gulyas: now he can make with the endplay|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  or he can just 2nd @d and W will be endplayed|pg||

nt|joest: Weinstein with a conservative but reasonable pass|pg||
nt|joest: xxx in lho's suit is a danger sign|pg||
nt|gulyas: N should have discarded on the @CJ and ruff pd's @D winner to play a trump thru|pg||

mb|3C|nt|pelu: 3 level max for EW - I look forward to a battle on 5-level :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  1! may be 4C major with longer side suit 10-15|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@s|pg||
nt|joest: some might try 2NT but that is a HUGE gamble with little reward.  either they double you or if they don't they know how to play the hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  and that won't happen here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson takes his cards out of his shirt pocket, fans them, then passes 2@c|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d would be quite a view playing 2/1 with void in pd's suit & the style of light nv openings played nowadays|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|joest: well now here they do have thirteen tricks|pg||
nt|joest: unfortunately the d has four first|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1NT would not help you get to the correct strain|pg||

nt|andyv:  or can be 12-14 with 5@s and 5-3-3-2 dist.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: I'd prefer that you stay and play the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since 1@S only promises 4 -- Drury promises 4   and Rubin hides his canape suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c is art. GF|pg||

nt|andyv:  sorry, just drury|pg||

nt|andyv:  Steve should cash the A of @c and then lead 2nd @d|pg||
nt|joest: since they play 'normal' signals, weinstein might have overtaken there to prevent an accident|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may decide to play low @d and get @c back|pg||
nt|psyck: there won't be any problems defending this one looking at that dummy anyway|pg||
nt|joest: even if garner leads a spade they can't get everything untangled|pg||
nt|joest: only a trump switch would cost|pg||
nt|joest: this is one of those situation where when I am north and partner huddles forever I ask myself "Should I have overtaken?"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@d after 1NT is would you would bid with x/xx/QJ10xxxx/Kxx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: ok   andy and i have both used our screw up quota    we'll be fine from now on|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: how did you know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not done yet, Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson, laughing: I just hoped it wouldn't!|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard enough trying to remember their systems and what position they are!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director asked ekeblad where he was going, ekeblad: to change my flight home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson still hasn't turned trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow defender throughout this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: unfamiliarity with EW methods and difficulty drawing inferences may contribute|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play udca carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and on cue: if you only had 4@s, what kind of shape could you have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: any longer suit|pg||
nt|joest: uh oh|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|psyck: but donno if I would do it at the table, normal to be worried of misfits & only nv game, also poor @d suit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gulyas: S could make 6@D here again:) as long as no @S was lead either, ofc:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  however if they show AK combo, then first trick is a count request card|pg||
nt|pelu: agree that N sh take @DK + A and play @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: sure made me eat my words|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|joest: defensive moral: when you know what is right, take control and do it|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns, "thanks solly", sits down, carrying fresh coffee as usual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in first 4 boards    Nickell has lost another 13   trails Bathurst by 61|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 2 rounds of @s ... I don't think he can afford a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winner of our match plays Semi-Final against winner of Bathurst v Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: laughter elsewhere in the ballroom|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had an interesting board in the 7th round...20 imps swing for Bathurst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin holding his cards in both hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: folds them again, leans closer to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 4th match on vugraph  so presumably  Jacobs [down 62] conceded to Welland |pg||
nt|andyv:  trying to decide if he can protect against a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, trivial from here if spades behave|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson to ekeblad: go for another smoke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson sighs and leans back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad closes screen to exchange some whispers with simson.  rubin seems not to notice half of dummy had disappeared|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: shuffling his hand, planning his line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: moving one card at a time into order|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  this line is better than 3-2 @s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe his assumption is whoever is ruffing is doing it with the long @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin sips his coffee.   now johnson's turn to tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren-Donn stopped in      4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, if S were 2-2 in the black suits, he could easily be going down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some kind of mixup after a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  S=south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @dq selected|pg||

pc|cK|nt|andyv:  9 tricks pretty easy dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: breaking simson's trance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: different rooms dropped  out this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should have no trouble setting up 2 tricks in @d and @c and should make OT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzfd: did not see rubins spots|pg||
nt|pelu: with @cJ in W 3Nt and 4@H almost same chance|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would think it is not over 4@S, but someone should double this...|pg||

nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Martel-Stansby, Levin-Weinstein)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|andyv:  and went counter to Crane rule...and it worked!|pg||
nt|joest: is one way to make it is what I was going to say :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam only cost 3imp - Rubin didnt find the winning line in 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was Lall's main hope on that hand|pg||
nt|joest: that's a break for Bathurst|pg||
nt|joest: clearing diamonds while you have the spade king protected looks sorta straightforwarfd|pg||
nt|andyv:  here he just needs to play A@h and K@h and then, after pitching 2 spades, it's a matter of making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff a @D now and he can claim with @hs 3-2|pg||

mb|3N|nt|psyck: It has enough Zar Count to open 1@h, if you play that way :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad/simson whispering again.  quiet and hard to overhear.  contrast with johnson|pg||
nt|joest: Howie on firmer groundhere.|pg||

nt|joest: here comes the 2@h pref?|pg||
nt|joest: Justin doesn't know Grue rescued into a three card suit!|pg||
nt|andyv:  Joe will have to stop running sometime|pg||
nt|joest: Of course Joe is known as being quite 'creative' so from Justin's POV, anything can be going on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 1st seat vul & farly balanced hand, my preferance would be for 2@h though, even though i play light in some pdships|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky duplication in @Ss|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: and realistically partner won't rescue himself to the two level on a four card suit -- or at least he shouldn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: no chance in 3nt, 5@D would have some play|pg||
nt|psyck: other table play some 2 suiter 2 level openings, so could not open that hand 1 or 2 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: only good thing here is they will know it will be a push hand with other table failing in game too|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  they should stop in 6 although an accident will get them a lucky result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing  3@S=cue   3N=serious slam interest|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|pelu: yes a wrong claim by Eblad in 4@H - here making 11 - but nprob down 1 by TD|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h not unreasonable and perhaps Justin wanted to see where NS were going to end up|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe declarer could discard @d on the 3rd @h knowing @d fin right on bidding & another discard avaialble on 4th @h|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 6 now|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that would have worked|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: i'm told Welland Jacobs did continue their match -- just not enough vugraph operators for the extra 2 tables|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this looks like it's going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson with his legs crossed, hands folded together holding his cards - typical posture when studying them - then folds his card and takes the thinker pose - typical when studying ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can't get any read whether simson is confident or doubtful in his defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has to duck this |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: covers his face with his hand.  first time I've noticed that|pg||
nt|andyv:  so not sure why he's thinking so long about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he thinks long about everything, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: in defense and in the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren in weird position,  but looks like he's going to make 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: especially in defense.  he has not gotten his share of hands as declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DK still in dummy, trump pulled  to both ways to play @S work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs again.  rubin takes a swig of water|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson leaning back with his eyes closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin stifles a yawn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Goren will play @D??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson rubs his eyes.  ekeblad grabs his hair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: geez  this hand is much tougher single dummy    whodda thunk|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is why they introduced chess clocks:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson shakes his head and finally picks up his cards again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last round Wildavsky took a long time until Doub finally told him to do something.  But that contract was never beatable|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: normally players just sit and stew until the meditator breaks his trance|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: earlier, rubin wrote a note|pg||
nt|robinswr: I'm amazed that Cohen did't ruff with the king|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "if opponents stew on a hand, remind me to wake up. this does not apply if I'm dummy"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops      Hideous Hog:  if you're going to do the wrong thing -- do it quickly|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|andyv:  this was an expensive ruff|pg||
mc|12|nt|joest: Weinstein might just play a spade back here in case garner has two diamond tricks coming and would be endplayed here|pg||
nt|joest: so b/c of the director ruling 4@h was down on board 5|pg||
nt|kit: I think the reason he passed initially was that he was pretty sure N-S would be stopping in 3@C, and then by doubling and bidding 4@H he keeps playing in spades an option if ...|pg||
nt|kit: partner has 5 spades and is short in hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Which makes a lot of sense|pg||
nt|joest: yes it does|pg||
nt|pelu: and better cards :)|pg||
nt|joest: or in the one in twenty when partner passes 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...Justin is a very thoughtful player|pg||
nt|joest: at some point, after the contract is already down one, I think you have to play a card :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is that in the rule book?|pg||
nt|joest: the unwritten one|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: thru 112  Diamond leads Deutsch by 45|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no updates about Welland-Jacobs :(|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: believe it or not, this is the real auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh    should have looked at hands  not just the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: when I enter multiple passes sometimes they don't all go through|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D from Johnson in 3rd seat is standard operating procedure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I need to be more careful to doublecheck|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=@C & @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less than invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D was 2+|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin re: X "I don't know, it's in the notes somewhere"|pg||
nt|robinswr: and when they lead the jack of diamonds you should play the 9 (from 109 doubleton)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: I hope for NS that 3@H now is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@d now|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess they paly negative free bids|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d there would have been a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: true, gives a losing option|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: but dec may have had a count of Souths hand there|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  at least this will be right sided|pg||
nt|joest: Garner did something 'flexible' :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is what u get for opening the S hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: If S - as here - has to X its diff to find a 5-3 fir in @h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  cards sit well for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be boring push|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: I didn't know how to bid it.  I didn't care how you took the X|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: had you covered, put it that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a chance Rubin will finesse twice in @H???|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "probably should be responsive"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: He was hoping Weinstein would have a 3NT call I think -- which he would pass|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfd: as usual, simson asks again to leave trick 1 up for a second.  maybe I should only report when he doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers atop the played trick once it's turned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is good practice    and  automatic pause in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: you want to go smoke?  russ: may as well, never did finish the last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: you're an enabler!|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: I have another partner in mind, once I get rid of him... [rubin and johnson break up laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson sighs.  less inclined to banter than the other three at this table|pg||
nt|andyv:  at the rate of this match, by board 115 we will have all the other vugraph viewers because those matches will be over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we going fast enough to have a rate?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin rocks side to side. turns his head suddenly toward the bidbox|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|robinswr: the problem with opening the south hand is that you have no good rebid over 1@s|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|gulyas: 1NT is ok if allowed by sys|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzfd: did not see which picture card he played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very good chance he'll score both either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: "well... let's start with the ... " [reaches for @HJ]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson counts something out with his fingers, talking to himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem will be if Simson shows @CA   |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns and peeks at the card|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: so now I have it right|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|joest: that's also quite possible kit|pg||
nt|robinswr: I open very light but because of the rebid problem I would not open this|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzfd: actually I think @HQ is better if he can pick that johnson has psyched|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: might be able to "mark" @HK in S hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnson can't have all remaining honors or would have 14-16 NT opener|pg||

pc|h3|nt|andyv:  best to continue @d |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: glad i didn't predict a boring push|pg||
nt|kit: If he bids 3@D transfer and partner bids 3@H, then what does he do?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that may be a speed record for NS|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  and junior players saying to themselves...8 ever, nine never...|pg||
nt|joest: on the 3@CX hand n-s were down 2 in 3NT for a pickup for Wolfson|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: = a jump from 10 meter where u dont know if there are water in tha bassin :)|pg||
nt|psyck: he may have had to invent a 3@s bid if he tried 3@d xfr|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|joest: can start with 3@c transfer and then bid 3@s naturally if he wants to|pg||
nt|kit: I like the idea of transfers there, but on this hand playing normal where 3@H is a natural force works out easier to handle|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|andyv:  there are 12 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson has to take his cards out of the pocket|pg||
nt|joest: double = cards and quite possibly four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this PASS  the trap variety|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: since it's not another relay auction [just yet]|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gulyas: 4@s|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Donn 6N West|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Rubin bidding 3N over presumed 0-5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Russ|pg||
nt|robinswr: some play that 3@c shows a minimum saying nothing about clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: move on, nothing to see here|pg||
nt|psyck: there are tons of variations of Jacoby 2NT played :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  and nice placement of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: "sounds like doug dodged a bullet on this one" [laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: if you misguess @s on this one I'll be very disappointed|pg||
nt|kit: This is an awkward hand for Garner -- he still hasn't shown the diamond suit and slam interest|pg||
nt|pelu: 13 oop 14-16 but 7@D on|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  should make 7 as S will be quickly squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: "let's see how good they are"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: 2@S would have been juuuuicy|pg||
nt|kit: and the excellent slam is missed.|pg||
nt|joest: on the spade layout yes.  6@d would be nice to reach though|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: defense against 2@SX = 1100 or 1400|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|robinswr: but simple Jacoby plays that 3@c shows short spades|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  if they pull 4 rounds of trump, N might only get his 3 spades|pg||
nt|robinswr: short clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 4+4+2+2|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a 1 imp gain for Aker|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: I don't know what he had available.  Would not 3@C have been a transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is tough to reach 6@d when no one bids @ds|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  was S afraid the @h stopper was the K@h and anything he bid would wrong side it?|pg||
nt|psyck: playing rubensohl/rumpelsohl, he could bid 3@c xfr to @d & then bid 3@s|pg||
nt|joest: well there is a complication there too|pg||
mc|11|nt|joest: 3@c is invitational or better.  What if partner crosses you up by 'accepting' with 3NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: opposite short clubs and an unlimited hand east has a fair hand long clubs is good opposite a singleton|pg||

nt|andyv:  20 imps and 6 boards to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ek: when he bid 3NT I was very disappointed; simson: I was very pleased.  should have bid 1@S, harder to get|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would be rude of him|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: he knows pd will not cross when he has AKQJ :)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  many possible shapes  |pg||
nt|joest: Lall opens his flat ten count vulnerable before Garner can open his flat eleven count vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, would have been interesting of @ck value was in @d|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you should go out of your  way to compete against 1nt|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they would have bwooded into 5@S and made that|pg||
nt|psyck: right|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: Which is why I think it is bad to play 3@C transfer invite or better -- partner can't cross you up if 3@D is forced|pg||
nt|joest: he is entitled to accept with a max|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  including 5 card @s suit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you have another chance|pg||
nt|pelu: but when S has AKQJ he could be almost sure on 3@D by pd|pg||
nt|kit: With an invite, I just make an old-fashioned game try -- bid game and try to make it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: "he's reaching for cards - he bid"|pg||

pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad goes through the possibilities for rubin's shape, simson: "I've heard plenty" and passes|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|robinswr: a simple way to bid over 2@s is to play 2NT forces 3@c. for other bids assume partner opened 2NT(15-17) and respond as you would to partner 's 2NT opening |pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@c stayman, 3@D transfer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Weinstein opened 1@D which guarantees unbal hand|pg||

nt|robinswr: when you have long trumps tap declarer|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  Welland, with no vugraph operators to slow them down, finished ahead of everyone...well done.|pg||
nt|andyv:  which is fine as long as you don't lose by 3|pg||
nt|psyck: 10-15, 2+@d's|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: 2 @d ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D inverted raise even in comp|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural?|pg||
nt|andyv:  must be in wrong room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said natural, forcing. forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@d will make this match a lot closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 1-round force  but Johnson might not pass for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson puts his cards back in his shirt pocket|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: will see if he needs them again as the auction progresses|pg||
nt|joest: no where to park that little club in the east hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very similar start in other room  except Garner in South bid 2@C |pg||
nt|gosia: this is the time to bid 7 on a finesse for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: indeed, johnson again fans his hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: undo|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Garner 2@C was @D LR+   so same as Johnson's 2@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if 4@c is keycard now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@H [by either] would be RKC|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so 4@C just a cue|pg||
nt|andyv:  then 4@c just cue|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: NOW  RKC|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...now 4@h is rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson points at cards in his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: see if he shows the Q/extra length|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course he will|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sighs and sets down his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if it was obvious he might have done so by now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is he worried that trump is @S???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing k@s may stop them from 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not on same wavelength re: 4@H may keep them out of 6@D|pg||
nt|gosia: diamonds is trump- afraid to show 1D q with only 9 HCP :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson burying his face in his hand again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if he doesn't, S will still bid 5N (or whatever their K asking sequence is) after response of 2 key cards|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@s on 2@s better|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: when they ask for Kings  it is  , not specific Kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he did deny Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks, simson says "this is blackwood" louder than his usual voice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: "who asked you to talk out loud?" and calls director|pg||
nt|andyv:  did he show 2 controls?|pg||
nt|chip: If 4H was RKC, surprised he didn't show the Q.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hesitation and S's comments could be a problem here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias: you lose most of your rights, have to point out hesitations from the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|andyv:  re re|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: do u often have bad internet-conections?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think this asks   of kings  and 5@S=none|pg||
nt|psyck: difficult to stop below slam now|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H presumably natural, slammish, and a few Q-bids after that|pg||
nt|psyck: S clearly expected 3@s to have more goodies|pg||
nt|robinswr: jump to 4spade is no aces no kings no singletons or voids, good desciption|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: sorry about the net problems|pg||
nt|joest: 3@s doesn't look like a  Q and was alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may just play here|pg||
nt|kit: Pass of the double probably denies club control, and redouble says he has a club control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hope i'm getting this right|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N was serious if 3@s showed @h fit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: 2 dow |pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: 3NT looks pretty non-serious to me|pg||
nt|psyck: redouble 1st round control likely|pg||
nt|gulyas: n|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  i think so but I thought 5N would ask for specific kings but I don't have any notes to support that|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still  i think Simson should have shown the Q    extra length could have been important to Johnson|pg||
nt|gosia: still 13 to Aker|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson agrees that he asked for keycards, simson showed 2 without the Q, johnson asked for kings, and simson showed 0|pg||
nt|kit: Grue is bidding a lot on his 10-count|pg||
nt|joest: i know you have two aces but are there any brakes at all on the West vehicle? :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  since they open most 10 counts not vul, E has to proceed with some caution|pg||
nt|pelu: last chance for Lall|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will certainly bid the slam -- he is thinking grand|pg||
nt|robinswr: over 3spades if you bid 4@c and partner bids 4@s there is no slam|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|joest: opposite a limited opener that is optimistic|pg||
nt|kit: 5NT choice of slams -- worried about protecting his partner's king of clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  Grue's hand already limited to 10-13 range|pg||
nt|andyv:  can Grue pass this?|pg||
nt|kit: you are right -- can't be a grand|pg||
nt|joest: back on board 9 Bathurst-Zagorin also missed 6@d|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: if 1N limited the 10-15 opening to 10-13, this is certainly optimistic bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: the 7@d in B9 = flat in 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: now in fairness if Grue had Qxx of spades we wouldn't be talking this way :)|pg||
nt|joest: not that we would EVER double dummy a hand!|pg||
nt|andyv:  what's that?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: Well, Grue could have Qxx of spades and 3 aces, couldn't he?|pg||
nt|joest: that's a grand!  |pg||
nt|joest: that's the perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I guess that is 1NT opening|pg||
nt|joest: in the real world|pg||
nt|joest: down one|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 1N 14-16, so this was limited to 10-13|pg||
nt|kit: Anybody have any idea why Grue didn't open 2@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hello again :)|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess they prefer better suit quality for 2@c openings. cc only says 6+ 10-15 hcp though.|pg||
nt|pelu: we missed u Susan :)|pg||
nt|joest: so are we frozen or is garner thinking about the opening lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Grue had 2 chances to go anti partnership but score big swing...pass 4@c dbld and pass 5NT |pg||
nt|joest: well let's rule out the latter|pg||
nt|joest: i think that is 100% forcing and he has no idea what lall has|pg||
nt|kit: passing 4@C doubled way to big a position -- could have slam, and 4@C might not be making.|pg||
nt|joest: and this from the high priest of "I will pass a forcing call if it feels right!"  :)|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- but it doesn't feel right|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I didn't say they were right...only that they worked|pg||
nt|kit: does 4@C even make?|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe on trump coup -- but better be playing for it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh good, I got Kit thinking:)|pg||
nt|joest: that's right play for all four trumps on your RIGHT and the guy who double you on the left to have a stiff|pg||
nt|andyv:  what's the problem?|pg||
nt|joest: everybody would play that way|pg||
nt|kit: routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 5N cold...all you have to do is duck the @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  bridge is such an easy game|pg||
nt|kit: rather imaginative double of 4@C byWeinstein btw to get club lead.  Pity it didn't matter.|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime I have lost contact with what is going in real life in Las Vegas|pg||
nt|psyck: I thought life in LV was unreal|pg||
nt|pelu: Andy telling fairy tales|pg||
nt|joest: right now this board is living proof the adage:|pg||
nt|joest: "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"|pg||
nt|andyv:  including most of your money|pg||
nt|pelu: are we waiting for a lead?|pg||
nt|kit: probably a connection problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  they've had a few of those|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe operator catching up with play & will just enret result|pg||
nt|psyck: even if W had a 3rd @s, this would need a non @c lead...|pg||
nt|psyck: oh no, can disc immed|pg||
nt|pelu: only chance to make is: stif @hA and stiff @C on same hand - take out @ss + @Ds and play @H and wait for ruff-discard :)|pg||
nt|joest: we have sent someone into this room to see what's going on|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pelu: yes hard job for Debbie - fast play and many berak-downs|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: looks like an easy 4spades|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: so last hand raises the question   if NS were NOT Vul  would Rubin show his major 2-suiter|pg||
nt|passell: after an invitational auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kareno: More to LOSE when he's vulnerable by not bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|passell: you can be sure the young guys at the other table wont pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2 spades is not forcing|pg||
nt|passell: heart finesse off but both side suits break|pg||
nt|chorush: We need to fix board 29 to NS +90|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impossible to find @C lead for the beat|pg||
nt|passell: with heart lead he must rise to avoid club ruff|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|passell: well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i think that beats |pg||
pc|s3|nt|passell: back to 1 down now|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong 3|pg||
nt|passell: me too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: I dont take the bet :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chorush: why would he do this?|pg||
nt|chorush: I would bet he played a spade|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont trust the play|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: i usually blame  sunspot activity|pg||
nt|pelu: ok tx for an "interesting" evening - close to midnight here - so see u tomorrow :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all the scores are correct for this segment|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, Debbie.  You prevailed against awful conditions!!|pg||
nt|kareno: You did a great job, Debbie!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Next set 3:45?|pg||

nt|andyv:  this is the last board of the first set... a lot of action still left as they play 120 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: are there 13 imps to be had here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  1@c=2+|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = inverted|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+   too numerous to describe|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: Aker put up great battle|pg||
nt|andyv:  there are always 13 imps to be had somewhere|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  but this hand doesn't bode well for the Aker team|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h  ART game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = good @H raise   2@H would be weaker|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to be much weaker although the @h honors are nice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren started with 1N  so that auction began 1 level higher|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner already at 4@C and auction not over|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad said 2@S showed 4, rubin is less sure "I believe a double would show 3, but since I showed 5..."|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3rd session starts at 4:45 Pacific daylight time|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3:45|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: final contract   4@S West|pg||
nt|andyv:  relay now|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT = an initial balanced GF|pg||
nt|joest: both major stopped|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this one may run out of steam |pg||
nt|psyck: nice for N to know S has a non minimum, they should get to 6@c eaily, hopefully not more|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's at 3:45 pacific time|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: 3@s = shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  always a problem how to evaluate shortness when it's the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: Spade shortness will not exactly excite Weinstein|pg||
nt|pelu: often a problem to show shortness with an A|pg||
nt|joest: true but where can partners extra values be that won't produce some reasonableplay for slam?|pg||
nt|pelu: late - again :(:(|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|psyck: if they play minorwood or kickback, N can easily stop in time after finding only 1 side king after key card response|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 10 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|kit: oh he will certainly get them to slam -- the key is to stay out of the bad grand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  KJ@h?  and 6@c may be wrong sided then|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: no 13 imps here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  no, not now for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John  and PLEASE  thank the players for us|pg||
nt|andyv:  great effort by both teams|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d = RKCB|pg||
nt|kit: why wrongsided?  Where would a heart loser go?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Congratulations to the Wolfson team|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks Al and everyone|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT = two without|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@d kickback|pg||
nt|joest: could ask with 5@h now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: which he will -- he needs both kings to bid the grand|pg||
nt|psyck: 5!k would confirm all key cards & trump Q|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d asks about kings generally|pg||
nt|psyck: *5@h|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all, back in an hour|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|joest: 5NT = diamond king|pg||
nt|joest: no heart king|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, that was private|pg||
nt|joest: no spade king|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: nicely done|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: so semi-finals  will be   Diamond v Welland   and  Wolfson v Bathurst|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty John and Al|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: they code naturally with 5NT showing the unbiddable king I guess|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: so a nice auctionto close out the set|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: probably a quick claim|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to Susan our operator and to everyone for their patience|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c 2 way checkback maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: a @h fin would have enabled defense to get @c ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well done|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: I prefer to always have my coding be up the line, as there may be situations where two of the bids don't correspond exctly|pg||
nt|psyck: this shows the advantage of minorwood/kickback for minor fits|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks all & see you shortly in the next set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kit, Jack, CK, Susan and all the specs|pg||
nt|joest: i agre with you but that's not the way they look at it :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Peter!|pg||
