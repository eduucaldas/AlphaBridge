nt|mikam1: Right - Senior :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Both pairs play 2/1|pg||
nt|royhughes: Moss likes shaded 2NT openings -- didn't go for it here|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will Zagorin enter here...and with what?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No, Zagorin is actually 38 - I got all the ages before we started and will try to average them, but Fred, at 46, is the oldest and Justin at 24 the youngest|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: nope...this will not do well|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mikam1: A bit too much opposite Fred's hand anyway!|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: welcome everyone|pg||
mb|1C|nt|daman: and we're off    welcome to the finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this is the third of eight 15 board segments in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|royhughes: An exciting board for us to start with|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi folks|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: welland needs to get on track early even with 60 bds to go|pg||
nt|puncher99: looks like routine 4 heart bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|royhughes: The 1C can be as short as 2 if balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but what does the bidding mean|pg||
nt|chorush: 30 boards to go and trailing by 59, Welland will have to play well and get some breaks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a routine 4@H contract, anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi eric|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing 17-18/9|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Geoffrey, Sigurbjörn and Bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D showed @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: 1N presumably shows 17-18 or 17-19 bal   he would bid 1@h with 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but matches are not playing the same boards|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chorush: Hello Andrew, Glen|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South wil presumably splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi Ira|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty for the explanation|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2H says 6+ clubs, no side suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: south shows diamonds as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley writing long note|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: the diamond team had a big second eighth to take a substantial early lead in the match|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2@S is something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Hello Peter, Chip and Bill|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or not :)|pg||
nt|chorush: Think his hand is really marginal for a splinter|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Bill|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: this may well end in 6@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1S was an artificial game force|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3! SHOWS A GOOD FIT I THINKC|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy may be tempted to explore|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Now notes on Weland side|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tejjyid: maybe, although I think splinters are designed for marginal hands|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: we'll get the names of the players when things get settled|pg||
nt|joest: hello all|pg||
nt|iceking: good afternoon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello to Jack and Magnus|pg||
nt|athene: south went quite quietly here, given he knows his side has the balance of the hcp - but he didn't really have anything sensible to bid|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Magnus|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: BUT bidding a grand may be the only danger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: NS I think unclear on what their bids meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is safe enough will make at least 9 maybe 10|pg||
nt|bessi2: with greco passing 1@c, and considering his @s lead I don't think welland as any reason to misguess @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thought 2S was a relay to 2NT to show hearts and longer diamonds, Welland thought it showed hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy asks Bart if they have agreement about 2NT and Bart says positive|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals  shows session scores    partnership system summary forms accessible from there by clicking on team name|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Still no ruling from committee|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm well i cant see why - they are playing to qualify for the BERMUDA BOWL and this is a very simple sequence|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed and with soft values there was no reason to bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|royhughes: Yes, you don't want to be in 7 because that rates to need at least a finesse, in addition to setting up a long spade|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he does need more controls for slam than is plausible for a strong NT though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: some use splinters as a way to help place a game contract; others as a slam bdding tool|pg||
pc|h2|nt|royhughes: 6C is easy unless clubs are horrible|pg||
nt|compton: 3N sloos to be going to come home here|pg||
nt|compton: looks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chip: Diamond picked up 44 the previous set to turn a small deficient into a good lead.|pg||
nt|royhughes: With the Q10 of spades coming down you may make 7|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: the grand is on because of the favorable spade position|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi William|pg||
nt|athene: NS have changed their system recently haven't they?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i thought these guys were a serious partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wolfson has conceded to Bathurst who will meet the winner of this match to determine USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D an option for north over 1@S instead of double i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chorush: you could contruct xxx AKxx AJx Axx would be plausibile so maybe you are right|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: hi bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: the other room playing in 6@C i am told|pg||
nt|royhughes: The grand is indeed on but a red-suit lead would put declarer to an early decision|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|bessi2: aren't ns a relatively new partnership ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: with the match score in mind i dont think they will bid 7|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer thinks Greco wouldn't underlead a king, he would maybe go up ace and go after the spades, planning to finesse in the other red suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: But the bidding may have shown where the red aces are|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is just the sort of board Welland needs|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they need a few more hours work on their basic system|pg||
nt|compton: there are at least 9 easy now, and maybe 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: The committee by phone is deliberating about a hand from the last qtr where there was a clear GS try and a slow sign off in 6|pg||
nt|iceking: play goes fast so i assume NS are Joe and Justin|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: welland may well pick an overtrick imp or 2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: if they get it right of course:)|pg||
nt|royhughes: ;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thinks Welland showed 7 clubs, stiff spade, and a minimum hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think he's right|pg||
nt|athene: not much for greco to go on; his partner passed up opportunities to double either red suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2 keys, no queen of clubs, and neither red king|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: may be an imp to the leaders|pg||
nt|royhughes: It may be -- or declarer may duck if more worried about Jxxx offside with the king of diamonds onside|pg||
nt|athene: it would be necessary to run this sometimes when east had the @DK but trumps were breaking 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: sorry 4-0|pg||
nt|athene: but better chances from going up with the ace i think|pg||
nt|royhughes: Neither that nor 6-1 diamonds is very likely, so maybe just go for the overtrick!|pg||
nt|royhughes: It must be very close|pg||
nt|royhughes: In fact, with spades coming I think he makes 7 even if he goes up ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup a horrible problem if the grand had been bid|pg||
nt|athene: if your only concern were the overtrick i still am not sure what the best chance is|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes indeed.  In 7 I think I would run the lead and get it over quickly|pg||
nt|athene: so much depends on how likely east is to lead away from the king|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pef: chip, of course is scouting to see who will be USA2.  He's part of the Fleisher team that won last|pg||
nt|pef: year and is USA1|pg||
nt|chip: Hi All.  NS play a strong club system, so a lead directing 1C wasn't an option in third seat, and 2C a bit rich.|pg||
nt|compton: 5 diamonds, 2 clubs, a heart and a spade|pg||
nt|iceking: also this was strong @C action so we can be sure NS are Joe and Justin|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|compton: that sounds like a large amount of imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: GS is grand slam|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
mc|8|nt|compton: i guess the slow signoff got raised and the grand made?|pg||

nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but maybe he keeps that for NV|pg||
nt|athene: no harm in heart to ace, spade just to see if the queen falls, is there?|pg||
nt|compton: ok thanks |pg||
nt|ahollan1: system summary forms for partnerships available by clicking team name at  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Finals|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: slamtime|pg||
nt|athene: more strong clubs, and more vigorous spade interference from EW, i would imagine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ... once we find out who the players are :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not as i saw no|pg||
mb|3C|nt|royhughes: No, but maybe he didn't want to make a mistake!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not easy to reach 6C here|pg||
nt|athene: ahh, ok, 2nt simplifies things|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: many good pairs use some method to distinguish types of raises after a t/o double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-20|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pef: 2h there is a sound+ 2s raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you overbid to 4@H with north trying to induce a phantom sacrifice, but at this vulnerability opps aren't likely to bid 4@S unless they expect to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be duck soup|pg||
nt|bessi2: what system are ns playing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but off to a start|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: either side can easily get too high on this hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1D shows hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: a type of polish club |pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: 3h is already too high for ns, 3s would be too high for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H or 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunate diamond position so maybe four losers here (spade, heart, two diamonds) but perhaps declarer can endplay east?|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being to just take a diamond finesse at a point when east has no trump to return|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you really want to be in slam?|pg||
nt|compton: Hi markshall, yes 6c is breat bidding, hard for Greco to make slam move but if he does, Hampster will bid a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not world's greates spot but trailing team might bid it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry Welland stands to gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: hmm....in that case sure looks like a 1@d opening to me |pg||
nt|bessi2: but maybe 1@d is limited to less than his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will power to 6nt otherwise they need to swiych to sayc|pg||
nt|roswolf: switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Schermer-Chambers tend to open what they consider bad 15's with one of a suit. Greco Hampson play 14-16 so will open 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I usually lead a @S from the East hand; I think it really boils down to style rather than evidence |pg||
nt|chorush: the club posistion is very fortunate so he will have no problem making his contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Sigurbjorn|pg||
nt|compton: ok, so now i am hearing that Welland would win the 11 imps if Shermer Chambers were allowed to bid seven|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson asks if 4@d would still be KC  . Yes|pg||
nt|compton: on this hand, as expected, greco made no slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Hello Sigurbjorn|pg||
nt|marlowepi: team with a lead will often overbid to protect against a swing away...but there are many assumptions involved, often tenuous|pg||
nt|compton: the appeal must have been an appeal by welland team to restore thier table result|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: the match is 39 but might be 28|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 1N-3H doesnt get you to slam, nothing will. just not eenough ammo|pg||
nt|compton: as expected on this hand, greco made no slam try|pg||
nt|compton: the doubleton diamond, the J109 of spades and the club break |pg||
nt|athene: heart lead necessary to beat 6@D, i guess|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pef: michael rosenberg pointed out that e/w actually can make 3s because of the really fortunate club position|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don;t think my keyboard can do justice to your name, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ö|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson deliberating|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but making club JT the queen and it would be more fetching|pg||
nt|daman: on balance    I am not fond of the 2NT opener    too many prime cards|pg||
nt|iceking: impossible to find game in minor here after 2nt opening|pg||
nt|athene: no sorry he only has 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but of course 5minor better than 3nt :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: a trump is east's only safe lead here|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "always bid 4H - you get 100% sympathy and 0% blame" - i agree|pg||
nt|athene: now west knows his partner is likely to have vulnerable holdings in all the side suits and will think which to play through to get him off the endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok they may keep their system:)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: NS just have to avoid panicking and trying to cash diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: no, michael's right (of course)|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure - what about if the defence force dummy with a third round of hearts immediately?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, both minors are sort of "frozen". They can't play diamonds and if they rise A of clubs, declarer gets to pitch his D's|pg||
nt|pef: although two more hearts here makes it difficult|pg||
nt|smoller: I am not so sure of 3@S - look like declarer cant manage 3 times hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the standard defence when you see a threatening side suit in dummy is to force dummy|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, it was a close decision for W with Qx of hearts, but the rest of his hand is good for offense.|pg||
nt|pef: simple looking actually quite complicated|pg||
nt|chip: And 2H was most often a 3 trump raise.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: We shall have to think of it as a NT opening with a stif honor..not quite right, but functional...|pg||
nt|iceking: duck this 2 times and hope Hampson has 6@S without @D ace |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: Schermer also in 5@C|pg||
nt|compton: so first two boards will be a push i expect|pg||
nt|compton: hampson would like to play on an elimination line to make the hand when both spades off and club loser, but eventually his plan will be foiled by the club queen popping up, which ...|pg||
nt|compton: we can all see, but he cannot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a line that declarer might take that lets @CQ score?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Very quiet here . I expect this wont be the same jovial set I had with the other match|pg||
nt|iceking: nothing else to play for really |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|pef: well greco found by far the best continuation|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pef: and so did hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: a club switch would be my choice but i can see the cards|pg||
nt|bessi2: an informed source told me that welland just likes to conceal :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: there sure ain't nothing wrong with that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some questions about how balanced "balanced" has to be|pg||
nt|roswolf: no void perhaps!?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I routinely bid this way with 5-4|pg||
nt|roswolf: routinely OMG|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|compton: now six easy for us to see and bid|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: ok so best for declarer is trump to ace, club, i guess|pg||
nt|chip: If they tap the dummy, as they are doing, can kill the club suit due to dummy's poor spade spots (not second entry to dummy).|pg||
nt|athene: but he's short of an entry to dummy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|roswolf: west prefers red|pg||
nt|athene: west should have won the first trick and played a diamond giving his partner a trump exit|pg||
nt|athene: now east is immediately endplayed in three suits|pg||
nt|royhughes: That would have been a great play|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the suicidial endplay|pg||
nt|royhughes: Ducking is sort of normal|pg||
nt|athene: even on that better defence declarer could have prevailed but it would have been much harder|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but east will not be amused|pg||
nt|athene: it is sort of instinctive to duck the first round from Axx of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was just too hard to see that this was an exceptional circumstance|pg||
nt|royhughes: The best chance here is a club back, I think. |pg||
nt|royhughes: Then declarer could maybe go wrong if he guessed horribly|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer knows east is in trouble|pg||
nt|athene: the longer east pauses here the more obvious he makes it that he has honours in all the suits|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @S53 just not doing the job|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunate, perhaps, for NS that they *don't* open a strong club with this south hand|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: even with 2-2 break|pg||
nt|bessi2: that makes 9|pg||

nt|pelu: and nice 4@s in EW on lemited values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zagorin: "just keep passing Kev, I think they'll get too high"|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes, aces and trumps and a good fit|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2D!|an|!hs|nt|royhughes: I think EW can make 6 with some good guesses|pg||
mb|d|nt|mikam1: Really good guesses!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can but they can't bid it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bathurst asks about DBL and Brad points to his @d bid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: 2@S seems like a big underbid|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Unless 2@D was a transfer or something...which I doubt|pg||
nt|royhughes: It does, especially if it is the weakest action over double|pg||
nt|mikam1: I believe EW are having a misunderstanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: What was 2@D Jan?|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: The board says 2D showed hearts, which explains 2@s|pg||
nt|mikam1: Something really went wrong here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: It looked to me as if Bathurst wrote a @h symbol on the notepad, but I'm not positive|pg||
nt|royhughes: So this is a big swing to Diamond, no matter how the play goes|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: if 2@D = transfer to @H then stange that he didnt bid 3@S next round|pg||
nt|mikam1: Definitely a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe West thought he showed a good spade raise, and East thought he showed hearts|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|royhughes: That seems more likely than a bad error in judgement|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mikam1: Seems unlikely you'd want to play 2@D showing hearts after the negative double|pg||
nt|royhughes: Some people do, though -- I used to|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|royhughes: We played 'Rubens transfers' and they remained on after negative double or 1N by responder|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c8|nt|pelu: so 2@D = @hs for E and @S for W :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: but this sh be a standard situation for EW|pg||
nt|royhughes: It sure is easy to get coventions wrong though, especially when they are on and when they are off|pg||
nt|pelu: if 2@D = 10+ and @s-support for West then he has shown his hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mikam1: missed the discussion a bit (computer troubles), but seems like 2@D showing hearts is not as useful after a neg. double,no?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure trhey dont agree on 2@D - and we cant tell hwo i wrong :(|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|royhughes: Not as useful as over a pass, but not an unreasonable way to play, in my opinion|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well, the mixup will cost here|pg||
mc|6|nt|royhughes: As is often the case, all EW had to do was know their methods, whatever they were|pg||

nt|chorush: think he made 3 but I may have miscounted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: you are correct, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some discussion as to whether 8 or 9 tricks|pg||
nt|compton: flat boards not what welland bramley need|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Some jokes about whether this hand shoulda been played after the committee ruling|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has the sort of hand one can open for a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: instructive defensive problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: another slam|pg||
nt|iceking: names are clear now. EW are Hampson-Greco  NS are Joe Grue-Justin L|pg||
nt|athene: if they had, surely west would have overcalled in spades, and then they would have maybe avoided 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 14-16 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1nt 14-16 or just an upgrade?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think they open 1C on 17 and 1D on 11-13|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chip: 1C is 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced.|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H is 8-11 pretty much any hand i think|pg||
nt|pef: greco/hampson play 14-16 nts (sometimes 13, occasionally 0+ in third seat nv :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: some players like overcalling 3@h with this hand, I prefer Hampson's style|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit less secure than the previous hand|pg||
nt|compton: redouble now by Greco wil show 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D opener also convenient for N|pg||
nt|compton: and bramley may just bust four spades, but perhaps, also just try to cue bid something and explore|pg||
nt|athene: it's rare you actually want people to bid when you open a strong club, but sometimes it does help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=North MUST be Joe Grue|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  8-11  not 5 spades|pg||
nt|iceking: without a doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well now south must try for the slam bonus|pg||
nt|compton: jumping to 4S not really possible with only four spades, my bad |pg||
nt|compton: support redouble from hampson|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 1D as precision, S cant be sure they dont belong in that suit:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson asked  about the 2@d bid before dbling|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pef: so he opened their strong 1c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: 2@s -100 seems likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: This seems to be Puppet Stayman, asking for 5-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the idea is when responder is so limited it's easy to sort out quickly if it's a game or slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: and of course most positives to a strong club are in this range|pg||
nt|bessi2: to answer why.. I guess I like my preempts to be classic|pg||
nt|daman: Hampson opened a similar hand 1NT in the semis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a form of Big Club  same opening bid structures|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: 2@s is makeable though|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, it does|pg||
nt|daman: that lead might have skewered the King|pg||
nt|athene: south knows his opps have bid game with at most half the hcp and (he thinks) no more than an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|iceking: 11-12 tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: so he just wants to get the trumps out the way|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Bramley clarifies only 4@S    but thought forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Not sure Bramley was expecting that|pg||
nt|compton: natural followups, no doubt 2S was supposed to be forcing as rule is usually cue of 2D is forcing to suit agreement (meaning a a raise)|pg||
nt|athene: given 1nt was in third seat NV|pg||
pc|sK|nt|compton: agree, Bramley thought north would bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though another cuebid was available as a safety play:)|pg||
nt|compton: tricky to make any game, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the 2nd cue would need to be @H    3@D would sound too natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without heart lead, working on clubs may get job done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley taking his time|pg||
nt|compton: 3N is possible with 8 easy top tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt he played low|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge is easy, clubs 4-4, so 9 easy tricks in NT, 10 without a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt isnt the most scientific bid and seems to have depressed south into passing - for what it was worth i would have bid 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace might have been findable there perhaps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: 3@S showed hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: One advantage is that West has not disclosed his 4 spades|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has the option of leading the @HJ second time playing north for @H9x|pg||
nt|bessi2: plus there are advantages.. 3@h bid makes it more likely for the opps to find finesses more easily if needed|pg||
nt|bessi2: but the line to make is unlikely.. ace @d AK @h ruff @h  @s to king ruff another @h out with a minor|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The EW auction gives decalarer a big clue...|pg||
nt|bessi2: east could just as easily have a stiff @h as a stiff @s|pg||
nt|chorush: Sigurbjorn is suggesting getting to hand and leading the spade J. Not a normal play, but behind by a lot, who  knows?|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess @SKxx with south and small singleton with north was possible|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceking: it would be clear error play low @S from dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chip: not sure about the followups here. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: all bids got notes but can't read them from here, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: Well, 9 tricks for NS are easy, its holding EW to 4 that requires a bit of luck.|pg||
nt|athene: he won't want to lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|athene: i assume dummy has shown exactly four hearts|pg||
nt|compton: 4S seems dicey with trump lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, that's an option created by the trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok, he isn't put to the test there|pg||
nt|royhughes: Bramley may have been thinking partner could have Axx|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he just went up with the ace to make sure of club ruffs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: bramley felt his partner might have led from @HAxx but he would not have led from @HQxx, so finessing against dummy couldn't really gain|pg||
nt|royhughes: and that playing 3 rounds of trumps would be better than blocking them|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: he won't want to lead a club, did someone say that?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no "just as easily" an 8 card fit is more leikle to be 4-1 than a 6 card fit 6-1|pg||
nt|compton: and trumps 4-2, if trumps 3-3 likely 4S manageable, not sure yet though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: ok, well he didn't mind leading from a 4-card suit headed by the ace :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   best to take only 9 tricks to make Welland feel better for passing|pg||
nt|compton: UDCA by Greco showing even clubs|pg||
nt|compton: 2S will score 4spades in south, a ruff in north at least one club and one heart, and one diamond so no problem with making 2S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson massaging his head|pg||
nt|compton: hampson definitely not running his hand throuhg his hair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chris  that's cold     funny   but cold|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: He lost it all after last set|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: many would not want to lead that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chorush: Again, Greco-Hampson will open the North hand 1NT so South may be tempted to get above the 2 level|pg||
nt|iceking: we are probably little behind in the play Greco took 12 tricks i am sure|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|d3|nt|mikam1: Michaels is not a bad idea with a great hand like this|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, and you can see what Lall was excited about when his partner asked which minor he had|pg||
nt|pelu: yes u can just bid on time more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A slam hand played at the 1 level is one for the Hall of Horrors|pg||
nt|mikam1: and the biggest danger is short spades in partner's hand|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps they don't play Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they don't, double is an option|pg||
nt|mikam1: agreed Roland|pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT might be interest in a minor game and 3@C used as pass or correct.  South would thus have known that partner had some values.|pg||
nt|royhughes: This doesn't feel like a great time to defend the 1@s overcall, but I have sympathy|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|mikam1: I'm told they play Astro...in that case perhaps double was better, but the bidding could become awkward|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bramley on his way to showing 17-19 balanced|pg||
nt|bessi2: hardly too unhappy either... after all they were missing a keycard and the Q of trumps|pg||
nt|compton: i bet greco hampson not discussing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C covers all balanced hands that don't open some number of NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|royhughes: Hampson Greco play a kind of Precision, with 1D 2+ cards|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would not be opposed to overcalling 2@d there... but very few would agree with that :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: west perhaps a little good for 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told the slam was bid in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: On the prior hand NS got to 5D in the other room, which required a different king of luck: hearts running, and perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: welland psyched a positive to a strong club?|pg||
nt|athene: that's usually sort of a bad thing to do :)|pg||
nt|pef: perhaps 1h is their negative response|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@C is just natural with transfer responses?|pg||
nt|chip: 1c isn't strong, it is most often 11-13 balanced. Here it is the strong balanced version. 1H showed 4+ spades|pg||
nt|pef: ok, the annotation to 1c says strong|pg||
nt|athene: i can imagine someone semi-psyching 1@H transfer in response to a [semi-]natural 1@C|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: at matchpoints you will get lots of takers|pg||
nt|chorush: I would agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not what NS were hoping for|pg||
nt|compton: 1N will make 2 diamonds and 2 hearts and one spade for sure, battle for 7 tricks, feels like victory belongs to EW but 1N is very hard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thanks welland for the dummy|pg||
nt|compton: i see a third heart trick|pg||
nt|daman: @C slam on this|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though 2@H was michaels i.e. could have either minor|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure if 2@H is Micheals or Ghestem |pg||
nt|athene: it would be easier if he had shown both suits; then he could follow up with 3@H showing something like this hand|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed |pg||
nt|athene: now it's a bit harder because if he bids 3@H he hasn't shown his minor yet|pg||
mb|6C|nt|athene: but if he jumped to 4@C or something that really ought to be extra length|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|iceking: informed 2@H Micheals 2nt shows values|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: 20 years ago I would have said it is crazy|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: Spades are very well places, but defence can set up a diamond ruff or a a promotion in clubs|pg||
nt|pef: he's actually cold for this, isn't he?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems very comfortable as well|pg||
nt|compton: interesting here after heart jack is passed and club is switched two, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: blockage|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes, I'll leave the overtrick analysis to you guys|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told that 2nt was asking for the minor but also showing some values|pg||
nt|athene: (i presume north could bid 3@C as pass/correct therefore)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chip: In principle 1c is balanced or clubs, but they like to do it on 5-3-3-2 hands of 17-19 even with a 5 card major.|pg||
nt|pef: both spades onside, it seems like it took a diamond lead to beat it|pg||
nt|roswolf: no automatic transfer to 4@S i am pleased to see - which is the usual occurence with these sequences|pg||
nt|daman: free finesse|pg||
nt|iceking: this is a great spot and possible swing |pg||
nt|joest: do we know who South is/|pg||
nt|joest: thanks! :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: two entries to dummy|pg||
nt|bessi2: this shouldn't take too long|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and thus big heart first time as u say|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: i guess you do something in spades|pg||
nt|bessi2: but the pass is certainly better on this hand, declarer much more likely to find the @c if overcalled|pg||
nt|compton: North hand squeal home with a long spade for 7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asks to see the trick again|pg||
nt|compton: now two wounds of clubs, bramley guessing to duck first club switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Are you doing your elmer fudd impersonation Chris?|pg||
nt|compton: but i guess if greco merely returns diamonds will make 7 tricks his way, one heart, 3 diamonds one spade and two clubs down one|pg||
nt|compton: yes, i am lisping away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention of Smith Echoes for Greco-Hampson in their system summary or 2010 convention card|pg||
nt|compton: no simithing with honors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: trick still up . Greco thinking|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: it's not a hugely exciting board at imps :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy 11 rather than 12 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I hate Precision|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|athene: @DQ, heart ruff entries for two spade finesses|pg||
nt|bessi2: ducking looks right to me|pg||
nt|joest: Justin Lall|pg||
pc|sA|nt|compton: bramley now alive in 1N if greco plays another club, if diamond switch, down one |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|chip: not easy for the defense to get this right with the E hand hidden. Now makable I think.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wouldn't a club switch have beaten it?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|smoller: South could have played clubs to beat it (I guess)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: he might play a few tricks out, see if he is allowed to steal an 11th|pg||
nt|athene: nice to have solid trumps down to the 6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: suit pref K|pg||
nt|compton: good switch, helped by the rule of 11, greco can tell hampson's diamonds will set up|pg||
nt|compton: this hand sprains the brain now, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: also E knows W has 4 spades, so probably longer Ds on the lead|pg||
nt|compton: three rounds of hearts by bramley? or duck a spade?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: yes there should be a trump promotion|pg||
nt|pef: yes, then the 9 of spades comes into play|pg||
nt|chorush: he can discard on J of spades if not covered|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bessi2: but a little complicated hand... 3 rounds of @s discarding @d is possible|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pef: rather unlikely this will be duplicated in the closed room :)|pg||
nt|compton: fourth heart in dummy looks to squeeze south|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chip: needs to finesse the spade 10 now, and knows he needs that. Heart ruff and another finesse, easy game.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|chip: I predict they will have the same auction -)|pg||
nt|compton: meanwhile 3N came home on last board in open room and welland loses 10 imps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|smoller: :)|pg||
nt|pef: this is the kind of auctions you used to see Chinese high ranking party members achieve in the worldwide pairs :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: squeeze later:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bessi2: if he misguesses clubs.. the defence still must switch to trump then seems to me|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfh: BTW Chris. Just so u dont think its some random VG operator hassling you. Check the name :)|pg||
nt|compton: you guys change back and fourth, operator has good last name for bridge|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: welland referring to the fact that 1@D is nebulous so you really don't know which minor to attack on this auction|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: right |pg||
nt|chorush: I think spade is better|pg||
nt|chorush: but I dont think anything works|pg||
nt|bessi2: what am I babbling... trump switch leads to an easy make|pg||
nt|chorush: on a spade, he ruffs wth the 9 andleads a club. West wins and forces with a diamond|pg||

nt|Walddk2: With a score of 89% you mean?|pg||
nt|pef: exactly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: alerted 2c|pg||
nt|roswolf: the slam made on 78|pg||
nt|athene: it was reasonable bid i think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: I believe achieving an above average board against them in a club game led to "re-education"|pg||
nt|athene: light-ish 1@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 11-13 is the low range for 1@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: no room for usual 2-suiter scheme over 2@C really as you need 2nt natural, for one thing|pg||
nt|pef: platnick is probably feeling pretty pleased about his 1n making 2 in the closed room since a club or heart lead beats 1nt several|pg||
nt|athene: west probably wouldn't treat his hand as a red 2-suiter even if he had the opportunity, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: playable in spades too|pg||
nt|pef: what would you guys bid with bramley's hand here?|pg||
nt|bessi2: unlucky break for the welland team on board 78|pg||
nt|compton: have to stay low ew on this one as it looks like 3M is limit of hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|royhughes: Bramley showed hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland keeps his dbl cards out so he can use them quickly :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3  [our 4@S]  Gitelman-Moss stole the hand in 3@C|pg||
nt|joest: i agree|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: very light 1@S for second seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont know if it was unlucky roy didnt have to bid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: well that wasn't his best choice|pg||
nt|athene: well he has 11, if you count the @HJ twice|pg||
nt|athene: personally i wouldn't even count it once|pg||
nt|royhughes: Don't blame you|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C shows 5 hearts doesn't it?|pg||
nt|bessi2: of course not.. but slam was an underdog|pg||
nt|athene: or it is just a game-forcing relay|pg||
nt|bessi2: ns clearly play a very sound opening bid style|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and South's pass has probbaly kept EW out of game, paradoxically|pg||
nt|chorush: I will predict Welland-Bramley get to 3NT which happens to amke|pg||
nt|compton: now perhaps pass showing no club control, but i prefer just bidding your major suits a la meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: double is 5-7 hcp or so normally in strong club systems|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: which serves them good here... considering what might happen if south had opened 1@s, it seemed to me ew would most likely reach 3N|pg||
nt|iceking: 1@C strong, dbl looks like 5-7hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: pass looked as a great winner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D obviously hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: which ended up wagging iys tail|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Any EW balancing auction would "overbid" to the cold game|pg||
nt|athene: but for most pairs it tends to be at least "vaguely" takeout shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal  [that becomes 18+ bal 4th seat and 3rd vul]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=any 5-7 hcp|pg||
nt|athene: it's a tricky area, not all that well-defined, but some might pass 1@S with that north hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: uts|pg||
nt|iceking: unlucky hand with @D ruff |pg||
nt|athene: sorry with south|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i don't see why he had to bid so fast|pg||
nt|chip: I think Greco will take expection to this.  On the prior deal EW bid 1C (strong) -1D-1N and lost 7 IMPS|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy starting to warp a bit in view of the match score|pg||
nt|royhughes: Presumably this shows a balanced hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: if diamonds are the longest suit, he must be balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: a disciplined 3@H WOULD ALLOW NORTH TO SQUIRM OUT|pg||
nt|athene: i know NS play some odd stuff - maybe 1@S - 2@D is hearts actually|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has a hand that has little desire to be declarer, so pass convenient|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2@H nf|pg||
nt|iceking: oh didnt lead it |pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: if you aren't going to pass, why not 3@C and play 3n if partner hasn't got four spades|pg||
nt|pef: the spots might be good enough for him to survive this|pg||
nt|chip: He wanted to be declarer to avoid a club lead through, and he did get a friendly lead. Still, 3c then 3S was an attractive alternative (and with the KQ of clubs a questionable ...|pg||
nt|chip: value, an invitational 3s is not unreasonable either)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the problem with 3@C is, if partner bids 3@H (as expected), you can't really bid 3@S because that endplays him if he hasn't got four spades (he can't bid 3NT himself)|pg||
nt|pef: I've noticed that a lot of foreign pairs play 2n forcing (by the east hand) in this situation asking for a description of major lengths|pg||
nt|athene: you could just bid 3@C then 3NT over 3@H hoping partner reads that as showing four sapdes|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
nt|athene: even 4@S is too high :) and bramley is thinking about slam|pg||
nt|bessi2: he must be thinking about either 3@s or 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can seriously be thinking about 3@HXX|pg||
nt|compton: hampson goes low with 2H garbage stayman, he did well, if he had gone with redouble, restayman, he might have gotten too high|pg||
nt|joest: sorry?  Thanks for the club king AND the diamond queen AND the diamond jack! :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: south is going to commit to game|pg||
nt|athene: but has three possible strains in mind - notrumps, hearts, diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: if you do it this way -- need a mechanism so responder can declare with @C stopper|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: now 3nt likely to play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: blood may flow here but whose it is not certain|pg||
nt|bessi2: 3N non serious I imagine looking at his hand|pg||
nt|athene: probably just 4@S-1, flat board|pg||
nt|bessi2: Bramley has to close up shop now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: retransfer to @H|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think 4@h from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is i think a very practical contract|pg||
nt|iceking: then he will thank Greco not leading his stiff|pg||
nt|daman: @D leadwould have worked|pg||
nt|joest: thanks are in order there, yes|pg||
mc|11|nt|roswolf: but we meander on|pg||
pg||
qx|c6|st||md|4SAKHJ9843DAT87CT3,ST862HAT5DJ2CK985,SJ4HK76DKQ63CA742,SQ9753HQ2D954CQJ6|sv|e|nt|pef: wasn't that a misclaim?|pg||
nt|athene: just the @SK10xxx - is that enough?|pg||
nt|smoller: Down 2?|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow a freak|pg||
nt|bessi2: my oh my.. this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: nice flat hand here ;)|pg||
nt|compton: wild hand here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LTC suggests invite, and with probably best lead on the way, prudent decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: looked like down 1|pg||
nt|pef: Did I miss something, wasn't that down 1?|pg||
nt|chip: 4S making looks pretty normal.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry, fat fingers, corrected now|pg||
nt|chorush: Here is the kind of hand Welland wants. Good grand. Can they reach it?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: double from north, then 4@C if that's still a splinter for them over a double|pg||
nt|roswolf: where will the music stop on this one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has a great hand but what do you do with it?|pg||
nt|compton: bramley choses pass, |pg||
nt|compton: welland will have to bid something|pg||
nt|compton: because it is his turn|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: Yes, Welland has more spades than usual|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C - 3@C and finish, i guess?|pg||
nt|bessi2: a bidding test for ns here.. can they reach the grand|pg||
nt|compton: there we go|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Stuck in the match I would open 4@h with @s|pg||
nt|compton: NS will now bid to 4H but can EW |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass cool if 56, as pd will expect any discrepancy in length to be heart-heavy....but only by one card|pg||
nt|compton: judge not to bid on?|pg||
nt|compton: only 8 card diamond fit EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco thinking|pg||
nt|compton: so should eventually stop and pop 4H, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, anything but pass would be quite a gamble. listen first|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bessi2: I like Welland's style here.. although I prefer opening 1@s myself|pg||
nt|iceking: here Joe can just raise to 4@H as 1@H is limited|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thin double means welland likely to get trumps right|pg||
nt|athene: he will see from the opening lead that north hasn't got @CAK so he really should have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|chip: They also opened 1S in the other room, but didn't double. Question about no 4C splinter, but perhaps that is not on after a double.|pg||
nt|roswolf: may play 3nt rather than 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: many would raise the spades with that hand|pg||
nt|compton: double is fairly normal over one diamond, but pass with opponents vul v. not is good choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still, just an overtrick this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C could be bid and let through on the lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp facing a PH|pg||
nt|compton: play in 4H may be interesting, |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy taking his time|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: THESE GUYS GO FOR THE MAX|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco maybe is treating it as too good for 2@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: is 2@h w2 I wonder... seem to recall a pair playing it 10-13... and he might have decided his hand qualified...|pg||
nt|chorush: As I recollect, they use multi for "bad" weak 2's and their weak 2's are fairly decent|pg||
nt|bessi2: i am told it IS 10-13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Schermer offered to explain but Gitelman declined so I don't know what it is|pg||
nt|chorush: they may have changed; that is what they used to do|pg||
nt|chorush: they need to have a bid here that sets ttumps in a forcing manner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: since this qualifies pretty much for a 1@H opening...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: misunderstanding over 3@C perhaps?|pg||
nt|pef: looks like guessing the spade will now be a lot more important than an overtrick|pg||
nt|chip: If 3C is a game try, seems like an overbid with all that junk.  5c looks like exclusion, but can't be. Maybe a delayed splinter?|pg||
nt|athene: welland has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart starts to put out 5D card then corrects to 5S|pg||
nt|athene: he should be making whatever his weakest bid is - maybe he thought 3@C showed a minimum here (2nt system on) but bramley thought otherwise|pg||
nt|chip: Looks like they may well get to clubs or a slam.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@H  may proke them into it|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoke|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely double 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: with a trick ineach major|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if south intends his bid as a sort of "non-forcing spade raise"|pg||
nt|athene: north must surely be wondering about that as he has a pretty easy pass otherwise?|pg||
nt|compton: Roy will likely choose pass|pg||
nt|compton: greco makes takeout double, bramley jumps to 4H?  and pass pass double again, all pass, ???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: One of the reasons why Roy huddled might be so that grecos bid doesnt come fast|pg||
nt|iceking: playing natural methods you cant bid this way obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of Big Club  1M-4M is very wide range    as you see here  can be opening bid with 3M and no slam interest|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tejjyid: 4N KC in @C solves most of Souths problems|pg||
nt|iceking: and this is ofcourse one of the big advantages playing strong @C system|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: by "non-forcing raise" i mean it's an offer to play but opener can go back to spades if he really hates hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@S is what i would bid but i am a coward |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|royhughes: 4@s is a decent spot too|pg||
nt|chorush: except if he thinks N is 6-4 he would have a potential pointed suit loser|pg||
nt|bessi2: maybe 4@d is just that|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 4D WAS rkc for clubs and 5D showed 2 with a void|pg||
nt|bessi2: i think he will bid 7@h now.. just a prediction :)|pg||
nt|compton: heart blockage means nine tricks north south I THINK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: roy isnt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with all of the transfers that welland-bramley play   a bit surprising they don't use them over 1@D-X|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ten?|pg||
nt|compton: bramley now beginning to smell a rat, but he still thinks roy has 3 hearts for pass of 1H, |pg||
nt|compton: 3H by Bart all pass? guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: bramley deliberating|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dain bramage --  Greco didn't DBL 1@D   [thanks josh]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Dain Curse|pg||
nt|compton: i guess there are three spade tricks available in 4H because of favorable heart blockage and ace j x of spades with east, thanks to peter friedland for that analysis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bessi2: oh well|pg||
nt|chorush: If I am correct (and I doubt it) that would ask for the club Q|pg||
nt|bessi2: that would be my guess as well|pg||
nt|joest: i'm thinking whether there is somesafety play here to limit to 2 losers but I can't see it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chip: Should note that this is a complicated new system for bramley, though 4N makes a lot more sense. Now will presumably guess the spade as noted to win a (scary) IMP|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but this is safe enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson: passed me in exclusion again?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told the other room chose the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|royhughes: I only see 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|compton: welland will not raise LOL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco does a dbl take when thetray comes back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland passed . Greco shrugs his shoulders and passes|pg||
nt|athene: of course south could have the right 14 or 15 count and slam could still be there, but it's very unlikely, and the idea is you get much more advantage from just bidding game ...|pg||
nt|athene: quickly|pg||
nt|joest: 2 trump losers|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|royhughes: 8 tricks on top plus extras ruffing|pg||
nt|royhughes: which the defence is out to stop!|pg||
nt|royhughes: this may be complicated|pg||
nt|athene: yes, only one obvious loser but it's all about winners|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer doesn't have 11|pg||
nt|athene: no way to ruff a heart then take a double ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: north has too many trumps for that|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm another illusion of a hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence will have to be careful|pg||
nt|royhughes: How do you plan this?  I think you try to make declarer's hand high, since it has the long heart.  So maybe up queen at T1 and play hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm sure Greco is thinking more deeply than that!|pg||
nt|chorush: if this speculation is correct, I expect 7 clubs from north. If it is not correct that wont happen|pg||
nt|bessi2: I am starting to think 2! isn't 10-13.. if it is.. then south should have bid 7@h over 5@d it seems to me|pg||
nt|joest: if that had lost to the ten, and he had seen the dreaded low heart on his next play up.....|pg||
nt|daman: Diamond leads now|pg||
nt|daman: won 12 on Board 3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: ace and another trump and declarer has to decide whether to try to make it (hearts from the top) or cater for 3-0 hearts and duck one|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be -1|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry of course ducking a heart would be cold for 11 tricks, he is only in 5 :)|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if east is going to attack a minor suit, diamonds is the one to go for|pg||
nt|athene: he has too many clubs to hope to set up tricks there|pg||
nt|compton: greco did well |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S playing it awfully close to the vest with his hand, esp stuck 50|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy didnt hesitate after the first round and that was to counter Greco's long pause|pg||
nt|compton: it seems like even a heart lead does not prevent declarer from ruffing one spade, taking 5 hearts, one club and a high spade trick and a long spade for 10|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: 11|pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: board 5 though strong for Bathurst possible gain there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the slam hand   Gitelman overcalled 1@S    and that ended the auction|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: We'll have to wait for the book to undersatnd this auction...|pg||
nt|chorush: true|pg||
nt|compton: 170 with club over spade up|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: a spec says he plays QC (he aint led from Jxxxx) and then a heart to the 8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: many pairs play after 1major - 2nt, 3@C is any min and perhaps welland thought that applied here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pef: claim?|pg||
nt|pef: I think we probably missed a bit of the play :)|pg||
nt|chip: just the trumps.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe we missed the bit where north switched to a trump at trick 3 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: got behind with slow response|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Schermer thought everything after 4C was cuebidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: hopefully Eric can inform us.. I am quite curious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Chambers admitted he had no idea what Schermer had after he showed 6-4, still no explanation for 2H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: operator just entered Gitelman's opening bid as South with    3N|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|royhughes: a heart finesse is maybe a good idea at t2|pg||
nt|athene: now he'll hope north had @HKJx or @HQJx originally|pg||
nt|royhughes: it loses an entry for the ruffs, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd i think it is always off but the defence needs care|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's difficult because you want to throw a diamond on the 13th spade (which won't be good as the cards lie)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: not sure about that play|pg||
nt|chorush: the right technical line here is interesting. Should clubs be 5-1 he can still make on 4-4 spades|pg||
nt|iceking: thats like 15-16imp gain then|pg||
pc|hT|nt|royhughes: But that requires trumps to be drawn|pg||
nt|compton: can hampson score his "long heart" LOL?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco nods his head at the @s play from dummy before rising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred's 3N described as 6-5 Majors, less than opening bid      that's a new one for me|pg||
pc|hK|nt|compton: eventually greco will play heart king, but he has spade count|pg||
nt|daman: much too strong for a simple overcall|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|royhughes: I didn't see any way for Greco to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: now doomed and a possible game swing for welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: the roof now falls in|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure that was correct though.. heart to K.. what if west had 2@c and 3@h|pg||
nt|daman: unless Al Roth was his partner|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h9|pc|c9|nt|royhughes: down 2, i think|pg||
nt|athene: east can't really have @CAK, @SQ, @HA, @DK (16 count) so diamond back would be the quick way to beat the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably -2 actually|pg||
nt|athene: but this is fine - north can see there is no rush|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: well he loses one more trick; not exactly the roof falling in|pg||
nt|athene: he was always sure to go one down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland apologizes for his play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco-Hampson taking a break|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe fatigue setting in|pg||
nt|compton: feels like 790 in open room after 3N pass 4H double all apss!!!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: so    3N-P-4@H-X//all pass   East on lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: if declarer had better hearts in hand he would just have drawn trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|compton: all the imps for diamond|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: East on board 3 definitely underbid, facing a strong spade raise|pg||
mc|10|nt|chorush: Notice that had someone shown out on the second club he would still have succeeded with spades 4-4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director call concerning meaning of auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: How was defence damaged?|pg||
nt|chorush: defense could only be damaged if there was a hesitation at some point|pg||
nt|chorush: their opening lead was meaningless|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: apparently Chambers made a comment that he was bidding over anything but 6H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss feels the 6H bid was out of tempo and that 7H was suggested by the BIT over 6H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: a very loud argument w/ lots of yelling, director warning just given|pg||
pg||
