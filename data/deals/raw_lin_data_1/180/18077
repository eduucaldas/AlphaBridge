mb|p|nt|gulyas: hello Kasia|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi there|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|sybarra: we see 2 nt iw wk, both minors |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Holy cow, it's in Polish|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that is played often in conjuction with multi/tartan or muiderberg systems |pg||
nt|gulyas: who would have thought:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: N-S one of the top pairs in Poland who do not play Polish Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's more like 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Iin Nail 1C= 15+ hcp with less than 4 hearts. 1D= 15+ hcp with 4H or more. 1H/S capped to 14HCP|pg||

nt|Walddk2: As long as opener does not raise with 3 cards, they can stay|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nice summary|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is not making, to put it mildly|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they can get all the ruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: in Polad 2nt is usually minors but 7-11 - they're playing 11-14|pg||

pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: How did 4@H make I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North must surely have started with two top clubs|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|psyck: he has communication problem on the lead in trying to ruff 2@c's, so playing for suits to break|pg||

nt|gulyas: 3@D now|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like the "precision 2 @C"  6+ clubs etc |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Right: what makes 2/1 such a good approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D is game-forcing, which is very good for a hand like this|pg||
nt|blum1956: it depends on whether 2@d is GF|pg||
nt|gulyas: but with a twist, no M allowed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: It's a very tall order to bid a grand slam here|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 5@H here? ... but there are still holes in spades and clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have to be able to bid exclusion bw somehow, but S is not the one with the big hand, he only sees the 12hcp and a void in pd's suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 3@D showed a good hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: so Opener must have his values where you need them if no @HA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: 2 no queen?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As it is, he even has wasted @HKQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did 3@D show 4 diamonds?|pg||
nt|gulyas: after N cued instead of 3NT, he surely has lots of extras|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump Q not needed N promising 4 diamonds with 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as 2@D could be 4 cards|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@D has to be 4|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he can see it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South has to commit one way or another ... and it has to be the grand I feel, else why bid 5@h|pg||
nt|blum1956: One needs to count accurately )))|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And be confident that 3@D showed 4-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He'd like to know about @CK of course, but there is no room to ask for it|pg||
nt|blum1956: how many Aces does pd have|pg||
nt|gulyas: pd cued in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, North did promise some kind of club control|pg||
nt|blum1956: He knows after the 4@c cue|pg||
nt|Walddk2: but that could be a singleton|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he has a singleton, he may have the @SQ or the @HA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d9|pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: Once he bid 5@H, he was committed to following through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's Kwiecien's conclusion too|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: He just needed to think it through|pg||
nt|gulyas: if neither, then the @HKQ, so he has some finesses to take|pg||

pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: Really, this auction is a model of modern bidding|pg||

nt|blum1956: When I started to play bridge in the 70s 2@d was nf, ques from 1st round and no exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, that was Bill|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 15+ with clubs or 18+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: but sometimes you have a 90% chance for 3 overtricks, and 10% for going down if you go for it|pg||

nt|blum1956: In Russia we call it: after 1@c-(1NT) bid as i9f it was your partner who did open 1NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 20-5 in the other match, playing the same boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 1 @H=spades|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: i hope I will be able to explain to you everything |pg||
mb|3C|an|4!h less than inv|nt|bjacobs: East might have considered hitting 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c a good raise to 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@C down 1, and so is every red suit contract NS may try|pg||
nt|gulyas: S was close to a t/o double here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is quite a gamble on a 15 count opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With one more diamond I could understand|pg||
nt|gulyas: the last time I did that, I had 5-5 in the Ms - we collected 800|pg||
nt|gulyas: with all the good boards he had, he should pass this - pd could not move, he only has 15, why do anything?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it does seem a bit masochistic to take another bid here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Partner is happy to defend 4@C, apparently|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: and 3 @H is "hitting the deck"  saying "enough" |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|blum1956: Yes/ Even if pd has a heart support which is far from being obvious NS may be short of tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: the grand rolled in in the meantime, for another 12|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H leaves me speechless and that takes a lot|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky somewhat, 4@H is on a finesse after all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One has to delve into his mind to see what we can learn from his thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: Finally on the current board Jagniewski will pay the bill I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: There is nothing to suggest that 4@H will play well|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe S did bid a t/o double |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He buys a dream dummy and still can't make|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he was considering passing as opposed to bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South doubled 4@C we have an explanation|pg||
nt|gulyas: on a @S lead ducked by S, 4@C is 2 off actually on a trump promotion - no, the @D loser goes away then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he didn't, Kasia?|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats the only possibility I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is bonkers if South did not double 4@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kasia has gone on strike, because we insulted his operating|pg||
nt|gulyas: bd 10 is also playing in 2@S in the meantime|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: After a lengthy deliberation Jagniewski has decided to play @C7 from the dummy|pg||

pc|h7|pc|c2|pc|d8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Pazur in Polish means 'nail'|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me try that again,  2 @S asked for 2n,  so that S cold show shortness.  and 3 @H says spades |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Pazur also devised Dwururka, the double-barreled rifle|pg||
