nt|pef: level|pg||
mb|3H!|an|ART, LR+|nt|chip: I suspect the 3N response showed a mini splinter and N showed perhaps 9-11 with a stiff club. over that, a last train 4H by S would be enough as he needs the right max|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: so perhaps 3h here is also a mini splinter?|pg||
nt|chip: but I could be wrong about what the auction meant.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: apparently it's just a limit raise according to the note.|pg||

nt|chip: Note that here S didn't even try, which is perhaps too conservative if 3H was LR or better. Here CA, HA, SK is a great slam.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: on this board in the closed room bart bramley opened his favorite convention, flannery 2d and raised 2h to 3, one too high|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss held the A of clubs back until he'd put all the other cards down, then added it, laughing|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|chip: A bit strong, but still worth it to open 3C I think with both majors weak and at favorable (as Kit says, you get 2-1 odds: two opponents to bother versus one partner)|pg||

nt|chip: That is weird. ART?|pg||
nt|pef: did 2c promise values?  I can't believe that's true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: not alerted, and Schermer asked and Gitelman wrote a bunch of stuff that of course I can't read|pg||
nt|pef: I guess Fred thinks he can make 3nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Also, Schermer alerted 2@d and wrote something that I also can't read |pg||
nt|pef: will schermer express a different opinion with a double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|pef: so likely an even better result for e/w here, especially is schermer leads his partner's suit and doesn;t get clever with a club lead|pg||

nt|pef: welcome to marge gwozdzinsky |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer says he did say that 2@d was a transfer to hearts, but he said could have a longer side suit. Director has been called|pg||
nt|pef: well it was certainly longer :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Gitelman reviews auction and says that he was told 2@d showed hearts - Schermer said might have been 4 hearts and longer side suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Gitelman says wouldn't have bid as he did if not told hearts. Chambers says he thinks it's natural|pg||
nt|chip: this will be a 10 IMP swing to EW for the moment. If 2d explained a H's may well be overturned.|pg||

pc|h8|pc|c8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|pef: yes it's true that schermer led a heart as though his partner had hearts, but at this level pairs are supposed to know their methods|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|pef: so there may be a case for an adjustment although it's likely to get complicated.  was fred's bid reasonable, for example.  did chambers just forgot their methods|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hT|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|pc|h6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|pef: if their methods are that 2d was natural and schermer forgot with the misalert then there probably will be an adjustment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Players discussing with director. Director asks whether that's their agreement and Schermer says he thinks it is and Chambers says he thinks not by passed hand|pg||
nt|pef: although director will weigh whether fred's bid was reasonable even if he was given misinformation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Gitelman explains that he thought if East had hearts then his partner couldn't have the bad runout hand because he wouldn't have hearts, so had to have values|pg||
