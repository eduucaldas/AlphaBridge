mb|p!|nt|pef: that was a 12-14 (or so) weak nt by wooldridge|pg||
mb|p!|mb|r|mb|p|nt|pef: the pass by north probably forced a redouble by south|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: they have two eight card fits but hurd decided to sit knowing they have at least close to half the deck|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: so this will be exciting|pg||
nt|barnets: wk no trumpers play a goo system of runouts|pg||
nt|pef: he starts with 6 tricks, but e/w can get 7 |pg||
nt|barnets: i would have bid with north|pg||
nt|puncher99: welcome spectators commentators and operator|pg||
nt|barnets: does not need big swings 60 up|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: rdbl alerted....  also|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, I was wrong, they actually play a 14-16 hcp 1nt|pg||
nt|pef: that's why north passed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|barnets: ok take it back|pg||
nt|pef: counting the south hand as being in the 14-16 hcp range is pretty generous|pg||

pc|c8|nt|puncher99: prob 7 imp pickup vrs spade partial at other table|pg||
nt|pef: why 7? this is going to be +200 probably.  that's only 2 imps|pg||
nt|puncher99: yes but other table rates to b 140|pg||
nt|pef: other table was +130 e/w|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|barnets: even 14-16 xx too risky at score|pg||
nt|pef: is he had played the ace quickly, there is a chance the queen of spades would have been misguessed.  that's extremely unlikely now|pg||
nt|pef: weinstein needs to return a red suit here|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: simson asks for another look at the spots for the thousandth time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: spade called, simson asks for another second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs    upside-down: count, attitude, smith      NS  also upside-down suit preference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson has changed his gray polo shirt for a black one|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS part of the winning GNT team...I think 2nd time for them.. from Ohio.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson crosses his arms and sits back in his seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin watching the ceiling as he often does|pg||
nt|andyv:  was Rubin serious about playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson in his thinker pose, elbow on his thigh, hand on his cheek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- did Jacobs concede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no one told me if they did concede|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: of course rubin was not serious about playing standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson replied that he and simson were playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nickell team down 48|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and joked that it would be interesting if they had to switch systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody for EHAA??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I'd be all for EHAA, I could explain the bidding better then having played it myself|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: although I usually play strong club I don't know..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a very fun friday night game   we used to play [very illegal]  one card if i dealt,  one card if partner dealt, opponent's card if they dealt|pg||

nt|peachy: Hi Karen, Shir |pg||
nt|psyck: you, about 5 big swings or twice as many partial swings|pg||
nt|passell: the lucky diamond position will help declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW play a precision style club|pg||
nt|peachy: -ley|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Not unexpected double from south.  Will east stick it?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  Grue and Lall are playing Precision, hence the 1@d opening http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=738&pid=155|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|joest: interesting choice to go with a forcing 2@d before bidding hearts.  I don't know if this sequence got the 5-6 message across or not|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a complex system of relays|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: well not quite.  They do play lots of transfers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3c meant as 3-1-4-5|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: no other info|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kareno: If no double, then perhaps the double of 3nt was an error :)  |pg||
nt|passell: he can make declarer guess if he cashes diamond and leads a low heart|pg||
nt|psyck: some may use drury here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: might have been better with the ruffs |pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: I guess garner has seen weinstein's lead directing doubles before :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW 1@d is 10-15 with 2+@ds|pg||
nt|passell: 2 spades not so constructive by passed hand|pg||
nt|joest: when you open all 11 counts though, I find that the standards for Drury drop accordingly :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not clear 2@S still constructive BPH, may not be able to risk pass of 1NT showing non-const raise.|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D was a sage contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: it looks like they are better off by not letting 4@S play out|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't mind the 1nt bid - it's a value bid, though partner may assume you have stoppers.|pg||
nt|pbundy: sage or not, marshall - my guess is the play will go more slowly in the open room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  14-16|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe only undertricks were makable there in any game there on a normal day|pg||
nt|joest: would everyone open 2@c.  I understand it; I understand 1@s too|pg||
nt|joest: now if it goes "double I have nothing" this could go all pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: good morning to all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if photos are current, all the Bathurst team look young|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H  4-11 HCP, 5-7 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: after the interruption the redeal button didnt automatically work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I was busy typing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 15-17 in 3rd seat vul, and all 4th seat|pg||
nt|andyv:  they will find the @s game|pg||
nt|robinswr: some would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|passell: I dont like to open 2clubs on minimum hand like that  but it is the winner  assures getting to 4hearts|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N modified Ogust|pg||
nt|joest: they're in the wrong event if they don't :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, W has quite a pewerful hand, even opp a 14-16 hand|pg||
nt|psyck: double = double negative (bust) & pass= semi positive here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so I'm not the only one whose pds have the W hand when I finally get a biggie.  W will make a weakness-showing noise here.  I would open 1@S as E, need room to describe here.|pg||
nt|joest: the selfrescue will strike gold|pg||
nt|joest: but it is a throw of the dice|pg||
nt|passell: I agree|pg||
nt|passell: garner may run to clubs and hit gold|pg||
nt|joest: "it's one level higher' always runs through my head|pg||
nt|passell: a red suit leat will hurt 2spades  club not as much|pg||
nt|joest: as against that, it's almost sure RHO 'has you' on this auction|pg||
nt|passell: I like crash vs 2clubs   gets 2 suiters in play|pg||
nt|joest: but that's because you're an animal Mike!  :)|pg||
nt|passell: dbl would show reds or blacks  easy to find fit|pg||
nt|joest: but i like it too I do confess |pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S was probably making, so no big deal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|robinswr: much better to support hearts and ignore the spades|pg||
nt|psyck: I agree with supporting @h, though 4 level is strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: only if playing a forcing club system|pg||
nt|peachy: NS methods include: We will open most 11 counts and many distributional 10 counts. We will open 1C with a balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary ...|pg||
nt|peachy: clubs. We open 1D with semi- balanced or unbalanced hands with primary diamonds or 4-5 in the minors. |pg||
nt|joest: most pairs have not prepared adequate defenses vs. 2@c interference soI agree with the philosophy|pg||
nt|passell: can still play 2 of a major natural  only lose 2dia |pg||
mb|p!|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 6+@H and   [i think] min|pg||
nt|jcwla: How animalistic it is depends on the hands one chooses to use it on.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West must be wondering whether he has picked up the wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|passell: diamond lead was best  this was second best|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table they opened east's hand with a strong 1@c and south entered at the one level|pg||
nt|jcwla: For those who thank God for small favors, the @S8 drops singleton.|pg||
nt|passell: doesnt matter |pg||
nt|passell: I think he will get a diamond in the end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  amazingly similar to his hand on the previous deal|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: i'm trying to judge how well 4@h plays if they get there next door|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i double the double:)|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|pbundy: i was going to say; the ace would not be my choice here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi john:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: everytime i try to speak things happen. Is it a sign I should shut up?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  low club is winner here|pg||
nt|joest: just gave up on slam. partner would need aperfecto I guess but if the ace of diamonds had been @hKQ....|pg||
nt|andyv:  when NS open 1@d, it's either semi balanced or unbalanced with mainly diamonds or 4-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|psyck: W also happy to hear opps bidding @d (lesser @d wastage with pd)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ace has things going for it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|joest: garner has the wrong shape, and these are the wrong colors, for saving in 5@d!|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d void is a big minus for slam searching opposite a NT bidder when you have limited values|pg||
nt|joest: if Howard is thinking here we may be in for a looooong session|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will be... both NS are deliberate players|pg||
nt|joest: north more so than south|pg||
nt|granguru: hi Marshall|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|passell: 4 hearts plays well lose 1 heart 1 dia |pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfd: @h2 turned quickly, ekeblad: "may I?", johnson: "mais oui!"|pg||
nt|psyck: he can see 4@s, 1@h, 1@d, 5@c for 11 tricks if blakc suits break|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine 1nt showed hearts, given the rest of the auction.|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we see a ht lead here?|pg||
nt|joest: now comes the @CK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: 8 is probably suit pref for @hs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  kibitzers tell me Lall is still a junior|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome to Joe Shair from the USA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: This is a very unfriendly hand for declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: yeah with the heart jack dropping you are in good shape|pg||
nt|joest: garner's long huddle over 2@s may tip Hurd to the fact that Garner has a club side suit (apart from theplay inthe club suit itself)|pg||
nt|passell: looks like only 1 down|pg||
nt|joest: if they start diamonds now, they may be able to get another|pg||
pc|h3|nt|passell: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: That's the North Pole...|pg||
nt|peachy: He arrived in a sled, there is  still snow in santyclz land|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ran out in the desert, that's why I was late.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|robinswr: easy hand just needs both aces on sides|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|psyck: so just took a lil time to see if he had to do anything in case trumps badly placed|pg||
nt|peachy: Weistein might duck this, I guess he is thinking of it anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: kib noted that must duck, squeezed otherwise. |pg||
nt|kareno: North must duck the heart |pg||
nt|peachy: I feel sorry for the operators, internet service glitches :(|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: or that is what I think, glittches in any case|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pbundy: true that he can guarantee getting rid of a club loser, marshall|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|passell: king of spades then heart|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|robinswr: or KQ of spades on sides|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades 1 dia 1 heart  down 1|pg||
nt|joest: and a club|pg||
nt|passell: I hate dbl as negative there  like pass to show bad hand  dbl for values   you get a lot more penalties that way|pg||
nt|joest: they reached 4@h in the open room|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: y, some chances with @cA off|pg||
nt|kareno: Two rounds of clubs will finish north now.|pg||
nt|joest: and if opener reopens with double,what does that mean the way you play?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein playing 4@H North|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  24 to be precise|pg||
nt|gulyas: W endplayed sort of, if he took the @HA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  he better play low @c then:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's Howie Weinstein    Steve Weinstein already going to Eindhoven for 2011 Bermuda Bowl as part of Team Fleisher [USA1 from 2010 Trials]|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect west to work this out - there's no reason not to play two rounds of clubs first.|pg||
nt|peachy: The intuitive action was to duck the heart, for a putz like me.   Wiser guys also knew the reason why|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you just duck on principle.  This would be such a case.  You don't know but you fear for your vulnerable major suit holdings.|pg||
nt|kareno: If south held the hearts along with his clubs, the squeeze would require a different way of cashing tricks, but the heart duck would also, I believe, be required.|pg||

nt|barnets: dec only had 8 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|pef: had to beat from the west side, actually, you need a spade lead, then the j of spades back unblocking the 10, then a heart shift to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: but dec has no ninth trcik peter|pg||
nt|barnets: only 3 clubs and 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: oh, good point, barnet, only 5 diamonds in dummy|pg||

nt|andyv:  nothing wrong with being deliberate although yesterday's match between Aker and Wolfson produced some very long delays|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe Grue needed a mirror for that one :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: still making 4, as he has no way to play a @C up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, interesting that 10 tricks avail w/o dummy entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: 2@H 10-15 or 11-15|pg||
nt|passell: take out  that way if the weak hand has a stack you can get penalties|pg||
nt|kit: what does West discard though?  It is tricky|pg||
mb|2C!|an|10-15 6+c|nt|ahollan1: 2@H   isn't part of Ekeblad system   maybe they really did switch system|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h=5+@hs and 4@c, 10-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   i miscounted @C    10-15  5+@H & 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last board, ekeblad asked to see the final heart trick again, johnson said it didn't matter, played @s3 and conceded @s @H @d @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@c 2+ and not precision|pg||
nt|psyck: NS 2/1 style & EW precision|pg||
nt|kareno: We get to see all four hands!|pg||
nt|sybarra: great lead director overcall |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not)|pg||
nt|peachy: you said it faster, Karen :)|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL indeed!|pg||
nt|jpes: we don't seem to have missed many boards|pg||
nt|joest: so that might be a small gain for Wolfson|pg||
nt|joest: 2+ for 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the <aker-team was vslow playing all the way - also in 1. round <.9|pg||
nt|kareno: No squeeze in the OR as north ducked the heart.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not quite as good a 7@d sac as we saw last segment.|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand, no way to start a segment, coming from behind|pg||
nt|passell: look at this hand for instance|pg||
nt|pbundy: the precision 2@C opener may preclude wolfson from bidding his spades here|pg||
mb|2D|an|forcing art|nt|joest: 1@h = spades|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@S here takeout of @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, did it really end up with 11?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@s = either diamonds or a 1NT response|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s looks like takeout|pg||
nt|joest: Doubld = 3 spades|pg||
mb|2S|an|decent hand no 4 card maj|nt|joest: actually over double it's just diamonds, sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: These teams were originally seeded 5th & 10th, but some heavy seeds including Nickell & Gordon fell along the way.|pg||
nt|pelu: NS open on almost all 11 counts - and many distributional 10 counts|pg||
nt|psyck: NS's bidding summary says "Normal 21st century" :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: something to be said for rebidding 2@c|pg||
nt|passell: garner claimed too soon I think he was going 1 down if he played it out|pg||
mb|d|an|cant shut me out twice!|nt|andyv:  ordinarily 1@s by this pair shows no 4 card major and is similar to forcing NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe played spades and would have made his contract if a) spades broke or b) south held hearts and clubs and was squeezed on the third spade.|pg||
nt|kareno: 5nt would be choice of slams I think.  two places to play.|pg||
nt|kareno: Susan, can you tell us why 2@h was Alerted?|pg||
nt|peachy: Borth knows enough not to pick NT :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h apparently showed diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d shows hearts - some sort of criss-cross I guess.  And now I can't guess what 5nt means.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most consider me a very aggressive bidder, but i don't see a big upside in opening an 8 loser hand with no features, in a suit you don;t want led. it is even a minimum drury facing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|granguru: anyhow NS cant make more than 2@S here|pg||
mb|2N!|an|2nt asking|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: consecutive partscores!  good luck partner, I stretched a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  match got tighter as 4@h went down 1 in CR|pg||
nt|robinswr: make the queen of diamonds the king then its clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: the way you show a 2 1/2 spade bid is to bid 2 minor then raise 2@s to three|pg||
nt|santyclz: Effective preempting!|pg||
nt|jpes: this a b|pg||
nt|jpes: ockbuster result for wolfson|pg||
mb|3C|an|min for the auction|nt|marlowepi: but opening hands like N has been the norm in this match, even vul. apparently not this time though|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  unscrambling the tricks will be the EW task|pg||
nt|pbundy: not a hand which e/w wish to get too high|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: well, its a bad feeling to go down in 2@S when u r cold for 6@D...|pg||
nt|robinswr: the spades are so weak that if partner has zero or one spade, 2 minor could be better|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am exeggarating, but u do make 6 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|joest: so Wolfson did pick up 4 on that last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i may have misclicked on a card on that hand|pg||
nt|passell: yes  down 1  after the heart lead|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room a natural 1@c opener, a weak 2@s response and a takeout double. Not clear they will be in game after that start|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: very optimistic|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table s just bid 4@d.|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen will show 3-card limit raise, easy acceptance with the 5-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: YES|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs to lead @DA to beat this|pg||
nt|psyck: @d ruff not easy to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sorry about the caps :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  pushed a little too hard on this one|pg||
nt|joest: quite|pg||
nt|pelu: even 4@h need some work|pg||
nt|joest: btw the pass was alerted b/c it said 'lead diamonds'.  A double would have meant 'don't lead diamonds"|pg||
nt|psyck: a simple doubly & raise to 3@h shows W's values for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think their 1@s in comp was either minor, that is why the pass over 4@d|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s was diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: no after thje free 2@H from East W has a GF hand|pg||
nt|joest: we used to call hands like east's "pickles and ice cream"  Some very good things and some very bad things.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all who know the systems for explaining.|pg||
nt|joest: "where do I start" thinks declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: even making five would be a challenge|pg||
nt|kareno: So presumably this auction shows red suits.  Two places to play and clubs was excluded by the 6@d bid.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trump lead as expected|pg||
nt|kit: ace of diamonds is killer, but trump looks logical|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3 unsupported aces, so lead other suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has a slight guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but over 5@C he could (sh) only bid 5@h|pg||
nt|passell: looks like he will get this home with both red suits behaving|pg||
nt|psyck: not clear E should have blasted to game here either|pg||
nt|granguru: I am against 4333 weak openings..|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Larry asked if he could ask about shortness|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - i am guessing this is definitely too high on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen that is'|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  7@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the last score I had was Welland 262-204 over Jacobs.  if Jacobs conceded, no one told me, but it's plausible|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking may endplay E|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: would not be the first time they had|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room|pg||
nt|pbundy: although........the spade suit blocks, so if joe goes right in diamonds, he will score his game|pg||
nt|pbundy: uhoh..........  |pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  his main hope is that all games go down now|pg||
nt|ybob: XX   QXXXX    XXX    AXX  = VERY GOOD SLAM |pg||
nt|gulyas: now only needs the @DJ onside, and that works|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  ruffing finesse possibility in @c|pg||
nt|kit: Somehow when you have 3 aces it doesn't look like it will be necessary to get a ruff in your hand to defeat 4@S|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|peachy: I definitely like 5D better|pg||
nt|passell: it is there style   you were young once also|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: weren't we all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  playing @d works better but is it clear cut?|pg||
nt|granguru: 9 tricks |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it doesnt block if N leads one of his higher, ones, as he should with this many points|pg||
nt|kit: he also has to go right in spades -- Can't Wolfson have AK?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen staring at the trick . finally turns it over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but as you say, it makes anyway with view in Ds. the Q is whether W will view ciorrectly given what he knows|pg||
nt|kit: Of course after this lead, Wolfson may not lead back a spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think W should go right in spades. S did not overcall|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: @H10  helps Ekeblad exit trump|pg||
nt|psyck: if you chose to rebid 2@c, would you bid on after 2@d?|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@C 5@D and a 1@H.. so everything depends on finding @DQ and @S position...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: To see the bidding at the other table, hover your mouse pointer over the other table score.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: 3nt made in the OR.  Apparently they failed to cash out (including diamonds) after declarer surrendered a spade.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he wouldnt always overcall with AK, but he might|pg||
nt|pbundy: but would south overcall with AKJxxx and out?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: ruffing finesse in clubs awkward since hearts need to be set up|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|kit: would he?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: addressed|pg||
nt|pbundy: i certainly would think a heart will come back now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|robinswr: while you only have one diamond loser you have two hearts and the fourth club to get rid of|pg||
nt|kit: yep -- the lead fooled Wolfson|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Wolfson may judge that ruffing finesse is off since Lall didn'tplay ace|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|psyck: yes & this has decent chances too|pg||
nt|joest: on a trump switch this looks like it comes up short|pg||
nt|passell: trump shift now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can it be beaten with a trump lead?|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: declarers only real chances were 1. opps do not play trump 2. if they do, @c 33|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well it's either blasting 4@H or "blasting" 3@H - hard to believe opposite a free 2@H bid that game would not have chances (if not cold) - so I totally agree with the 4@H bid.  |pg||
nt|joest: weinstein knows garner has 3 spades and 3 diamonds.  If he has 2 hearts and five clubs, that gives declarer 3=5=4=1 pattern and all the more reason  to led trumps now|pg||
nt|kit: However, declarer still has to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - i am guessing that joe will hope to run the clubs - thus play a diamond to the ace after cashing the clubQ|pg||
nt|pbundy: then he can't not get diamonds right|pg||
nt|granguru: why not?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|joest: my own take is that Justin got a little carried away with his hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will make with both hearts onside.  Nice contract, well played.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: win it or duck it?|pg||
nt|psyck: Vul, i may have tried 4@h too, but NV 3@h seems to express the hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: Grue saying he wasnt misguessing spades|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  lowest @d|pg||
nt|pbundy: "not quickly" perhaps an understatement!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Spec wondering about a club lead last hand.  Declarer would have to make first heart play at trick 2 in that case.|pg||

nt|joest: 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and that won't happen here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some might have tried a 1nt overcall.|pg||

nt|sybarra: 4 @H is pass or correct,  a bit rambuncious maybe|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  UDCA = upside down count attitude|pg||
nt|gulyas: agressive x by Grue, may get punished here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: since 1@S only promises 4 -- Drury promises 4   and Rubin hides his canape suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c is art. GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not by passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, just drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad trying to get director to turn dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1NT was ok, but should have bid 3@D then, meaning inv with @Ds, which he had|pg||
nt|psyck: I like that better Daniel|pg||
nt|peachy: Oft'repeated little sayiong , attributed to (I think) Jan Martel:  Operator is like a loongtailed cat in a small room full of rocking chairs.|pg||
nt|kit: Tough hand for E-W.  Opponents have 8-card fit, but they don't.|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is only off 5 tops|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  you would not expect both reds 3-3 on this auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  this shouldn't take too long|pg||
nt|andyv:  Steve should cash the A of @c and then lead 2nd @d|pg||
nt|joest: since they play 'normal' signals, weinstein might have overtaken there to prevent an accident|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may decide to play low @d and get @c back|pg||
nt|psyck: there won't be any problems defending this one looking at that dummy anyway|pg||
nt|joest: even if garner leads a spade they can't get everything untangled|pg||
nt|joest: only a trump switch would cost|pg||
nt|joest: this is one of those situation where when I am north and partner huddles forever I ask myself "Should I have overtaken?"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@d after 1NT is would you would bid with x/xx/QJ10xxxx/Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: this hand will not pose a great challenge|pg||
nt|kit: Wolfson works out that his partner has 3 hearts since opponents landed in diamonds, so not right to compete to 3@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: after S x-ed 2nt, N should have whacked this|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson still hasn't turned trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow defender throughout this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: unfamiliarity with EW methods and difficulty drawing inferences may contribute|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play udca carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and on cue: if you only had 4@s, what kind of shape could you have?|pg||

nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|psyck: but donno if I would do it at the table, normal to be worried of misfits & only nv game, also poor @d suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|gulyas: S could make 6@D here again:) as long as no @S was lead either, ofc:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  however if they show AK combo, then first trick is a count request card|pg||
nt|pelu: agree that N sh take @DK + A and play @C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some danger that declarer will finesse in @h, expecting Cohen to be more shape suitable|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes.  i am guessing that joe would have doubled had their lead not been so healthy|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|psyck: sure made me eat my words|pg||
nt|jpes: dcl got a little help with the lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|kareno: Only a trick high :)  With the diamond break.|pg||
nt|kareno: Garner expected more values from his adversely vulnerable partner.|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you have to resist using those weapons :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: defensive moral: when you know what is right, take control and do it|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: for me "all" the blame on N|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: I don't think we will ever get to a point where declarer can take a heart finesse profitably -- about those trumps|pg||
nt|pbundy: or - perhaps doubled|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns, "thanks solly", sits down, carrying fresh coffee as usual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in first 4 boards    Nickell has lost another 13   trails Bathurst by 61|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 2 rounds of @s ... I don't think he can afford a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winner of our match plays Semi-Final against winner of Bathurst v Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: laughter elsewhere in the ballroom|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had an interesting board in the 7th round...20 imps swing for Bathurst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin holding his cards in both hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: folds them again, leans closer to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 4th match on vugraph  so presumably  Jacobs [down 62] conceded to Welland |pg||
nt|andyv:  trying to decide if he can protect against a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, trivial from here if spades behave|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson to ekeblad: go for another smoke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson sighs and leans back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad closes screen to exchange some whispers with simson.  rubin seems not to notice half of dummy had disappeared|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: shuffling his hand, planning his line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: moving one card at a time into order|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|h4|mc|6|nt|andyv:  this line is better than 3-2 @s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe his assumption is whoever is ruffing is doing it with the long @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin sips his coffee.   now johnson's turn to tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren-Donn stopped in      4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, if S were 2-2 in the black suits, he could easily be going down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some kind of mixup after a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  S=south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @dq selected|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trailing by 50, N was especially reluctant to pass even though with that LTC and no real shape and a shortish suit it could easily be right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Larry says good dbl to grue|pg||
pg||

nt|barnets: 6@D good contract|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|barnets: and can be made|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pef: 6 diamonds is a reasonably decent slam, here, not clear how it failed in the closed room, so a very good chance to a pickup to wolfson here|pg||
nt|pef: I think should be made with diamonds splitting|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|barnets: in other room west misguessed the trump q|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|barnets: losing to souths Q|pg||
nt|pef: diamonds may actually never get mentioned at this table|pg||
nt|barnets: on the @H 10 lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|pef: of course I could be wrong :)|pg||
nt|barnets: seems a big position to take|pg||
nt|pef: much better contract played from the east side.  then you don't have to immediately decide what to do on a heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: east bid 3@C not 3@D not sure why|pg||
nt|barnets: it is not too hard from either side|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: well now he's thinking about things|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: just gess trumps|pg||
mb|6D|nt|barnets: the heart suit will come in later|pg||
nt|barnets: good bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: thts my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: curious that he misguessed diamonds after a likely heart lead from shortness|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room north led @H 10|pg||
nt|barnets: I think that maybe helped dec|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: unlikely north had 2 singletons|pg||
nt|barnets: but he misguessed diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|barnets: here he is more likely to misguess perhaps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was thinking he could also play @SA  @H @H @H ruff then @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: oppos say "very carefully played", "you get a star for that"|pg||
nt|joest: well so far this is high level ping pong|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS just have to shake this off|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like 2 game swing in 3 and 4|pg||
nt|joest: each pair has tossed one board so we can start over :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: there are 116 boards to go|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Private messages are appreciated, but please understand that commentators may not have time to respond to all of them. No offence intended|pg||
nt|gulyas: some say that 3@D would not have been invitational - but then what do u bid in 2/1? 2nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: pitch in the wrong hand :(|pg||
nt|peachy: If you'd like to watch both tables at the same time, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|peachy: Wooldridge has had an absolutely spectacular year|pg||
nt|peachy: and the the rest are no duffers|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pbundy: that last board could result in a pickup for wolfson, also |pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  there will a lot of those before this match is over...both teams are very aggressive|pg||
nt|robinswr: in the open room north bid 4spades after raise|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d = 4+  typically unbalanced|pg||
nt|pbundy: the wolfson team is hungry for imps and may well double on the same auction|pg||
mb|3C|an|preemptive|nt|andyv:  ok, super safe I guess:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: "all 19 people watching appreciated that"|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's because Walter isn't up here watching:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if u r weak and pd rebids his suit, with a bad hand u pass|pg||
nt|passell: the spade response will give away the show  make 4spades easier|pg||
nt|joest: there are some who don't play double here as penalty.   I don't get that I'm afraid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some have been asking for more info about the players - here is a link to some info on Justin Lall http://justinlall.wordpress.com/about/|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, 3@C not everyone's  cup of tea!|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: probably need to open 3C on that with a big lead, because foes probably will|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Wolfson asks Grue about the dbl told responsive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or did you mean this hand?|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@C, 5@C, pass?|pg||
nt|kit: or maybe because he thinks it is the best bid|pg||
nt|pbundy: no - last hand marshall|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|psyck: EW just tried 6@h a deal too earlyslam |pg||
nt|joest: actually I've played that double =4 and 2@s = 5 with some folks|pg||
nt|psyck: double is commonly used to show 4+@s's here|pg||
nt|jcwla: And a hand with some values.|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like they play that way here too Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it will also make the play in 2@s easier Mike :)|pg||
nt|passell: play dbl is a better hand than 2spades  they must not|pg||
nt|joest: interesting|pg||
nt|granguru: vulnerability asks for precaution|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: 1C = can be a balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary clubs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=790&pid=302|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s info |pg||
nt|kareno: Polish style, getting more and more popular.  Thanks :)|pg||
nt|jpes: they put away a multi world champion away in 120 bds|pg||
nt|passell: looks like 3 is all they can make with the diamond position|pg||
nt|kit: transfer to clubs -- just what Lall wanted to hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  re|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: network burped again.  overloaded with 8 consoles running|pg||
mb|4D|nt|gulyas: Lall gets what he deserves fl|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  something on Joe Grue http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/joegrue.pdf|pg||
nt|gulyas: for opening 1nt|pg||
nt|granguru: now @D will be found|pg||
nt|kit: this double is pretty risky with club void -- partner could easily be passing on wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: one has to know how high 2spades is forcing to (can you pass 4@s)|pg||
nt|passell: goood non heart ace lead|pg||
nt|passell: great stop by woolridge here|pg||
nt|joest: not everyone would make a takeout double as east|pg||
nt|passell: should easily take 5 spades in his hand 1 ruff in dummy and 2 aces|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@D tough to find out|pg||
nt|kit: not tough now -- East has enough to just bid it.|pg||
nt|granguru: and probably under 50% chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i find the first double by E surprising|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Lall had asked Larry about his 3@c bid before the second dbl|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|andyv:  maybe net is talking a smoking break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: leave these out for a minute, just going to think for a little while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: internet is new toy in las vegas|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad thumps the table|pg||
nt|psyck: limit raise or better, foring to 3@h only for me|pg||
nt|robinswr: forcing passes is a compicated subject|pg||
nt|peachy: Sometimes overloading the 1C opener can be a disadvantage, preempts make it really uncomfortable|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  9 tricks pretty easy dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: breaking simson's trance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: different rooms dropped  out this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should have no trouble setting up 2 tricks in @d and @c and should make OT|pg||
nt|kareno: Plenty high enough.  Wonder what 1@s was - diamonds?|pg||
nt|kareno: Usually diamonds, I'm told, thanks to a spec.|pg||
nt|granguru: needs @D2-2 i believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: did not see rubins spots|pg||
nt|pelu: with @cJ in W 3Nt and 4@H almost same chance|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe one more in the wash if he gets a @h or something|pg||
nt|gulyas: he had an easy 1@D opening, no rebid problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|joest: lall needs the heart king as an entry to diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: now up to 9 tricks with the dia ruffing out|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: if the pass denies a club control, that makes things look better to Lall|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: They are probably too high already|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes raise @s or rebid 1@s over @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or presumably rause 1NT to 2NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  raise|pg||
nt|psyck: It was the exactly wrong vul to experiment with something fancy too|pg||
nt|kit: This isn't so good for defense -- if Cohen wins ace and gives ruff, defense won't get spade trick|pg||
nt|granguru: maybe can survive a 3-1 in some otherwise normal distributions.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Grue thanks partner for the dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: he may be playing to not set up @d now, disc 1@s on @c & ruff one|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 3@c is puppet and 3N is 5@h (flip flopping with 3@h to show no 4 or 5 card major)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would think it is not over 4@S, but someone should double this...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: Rubin has problems in 4@H (Board 3) :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@h seems about the limit here.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: then he needs to guess both maj finesses right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Cohen sees that giving ruff won't work|pg||
nt|kit: Now it is clear declarer started with stiffqueen of clubs, since no second club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer now has a ruffing entry to the long @c|pg||
nt|kit: But if Cohen leads queen of dimonds now, the suit is blocked!|pg||
nt|kit: and the defense gets both the ruff and the spade trick to set the contract|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d then was xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|joest: weinstein led 5th best so the odds favored Jx or 10x with Garner|pg||
nt|kit: could get dimonds wrong -- and probably will|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: Very creative lead by Lall, wanting to lead through dummy's strength.|pg||
nt|gulyas: the obv 10 imps to Bathurst on 78 to extend the lead|pg||
nt|kit: since heart lead surely singleton|pg||
pc|d5|nt|joest: 4 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts|pg||
nt|joest: so guess theheart|pg||
nt|pbundy: why, kit?|pg||
nt|kit: South has 4hearts, 6 clubs, ......|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Grue puts his hand down and starts thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: WHY O WHY do they always play the 10?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk5: The winner (on Tuesday) will be USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Martel-Stansby, Levin-Weinstein)|pg||
nt|kit: but he fell from grace|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no he didnt say that. I am just editorializing if thats a word|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a word|pg||
nt|pbundy: but kit - would north have led a stiff heart with Qxx of diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Wolfson thinking now|pg||
nt|kit: why wouldn't he lead the singleton?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Specs were calling for a low @c.|pg||
nt|passell: yes  percentage play  he didnt think north had ak of hearts|pg||
nt|joest: so now we're back to 110.  Precision bidding|pg||
nt|joest: right + north opened the bidding|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  and went counter to Crane rule...and it worked!|pg||
nt|joest: is one way to make it is what I was going to say :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam only cost 3imp - Rubin didnt find the winning line in 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was Lall's main hope on that hand|pg||
nt|joest: that's a break for Bathurst|pg||
nt|joest: clearing diamonds while you have the spade king protected looks sorta straightforwarfd|pg||
nt|andyv:  here he just needs to play A@h and K@h and then, after pitching 2 spades, it's a matter of making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff a @D now and he can claim with @hs 3-2|pg||
nt|joest: sorry I'm busy playing 3NT!|pg||
nt|andyv:  did you make it?|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: i just claimed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: did u make it ?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|pelu: slow - again -new smart keyboard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, everyone, ruff a @d first|pg||
nt|psyck: he is just thinking of 41 @h here, cold 10 at least with 32 as pointed out|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: @d must have been unblocked|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|mc|11|nt|psyck: I would opened 2@h, surprised to see W passed other table|pg||
nt|psyck: operator may miss spots sometimes|pg||

nt|barnets: seems hard to make 3N|pg||
nt|pef: good n/s result on this board.  3n looks like it should be beaten either with a club lead or when east get's in, the J of clubs seems like the right card to return for a surround ...|pg||
nt|pef: play|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|barnets: if not impossible|pg||
nt|pef: hey, you have 4 spades, 4 diamonds, and 2 hearts after taking the spade finesse--easy as pie|pg||
nt|barnets: actually east made a big mistake|pg||
nt|pef: in the closed room east returned a low club after winning the spade, seems like a tired play|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|barnets: and on winning the @SK played the @C 3 bck|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: and not the!J|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: when I got punted this last time computer automatically reconnected to a different network.  this one might be more stable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great pinochle meld for Ekeblad|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andyv:  6+@cs, 11-15|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: just thinking|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he has choice of showing 55 game force or Asking|pg||
nt|joest: north-south are in 4@c doubled on that hand in the open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart lead not impeded by trump Qxx on this auction, because N knows they have enough clubs to make that suit probably futile. source of tricks would be hearts one way or another|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|andyv:  2N asks and is GF|pg||
nt|kit: big rebid problems if open 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  precision 1@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 1D, 1+ and 11-15 or so|pg||
nt|sybarra: best to find @H's instead of clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: they may not enjoy the trump break then|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 2N forces 3@C   to play 3@C of show game force 55|pg||
nt|joest: do you bid spades or go for the penalty pass|pg||
nt|robinswr: partnership decides whether you open 1@h or 2@h I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|kit: this distorts the shape somewhat, but is a better picture of the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Actually, 2+ diamonds according to their card|pg||
nt|joest: 2@d = 0 or 1 control|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  now GF 5-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=5+@H & 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: bigtrain [Johnson] hand is HUGE now|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd pass with this vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: at this vul, pass ok|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would open 2@H in red, especially with this wonderful 6322|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was just the bid Weinsteing wanted to hear |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like NS are playing raise of 4th suit shows 4 cards in the suit|pg||
nt|kit: have to play that, as can have heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: It has enough Zar Count to open 1@h, if you play that way :)|pg||
nt|joest: no way|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|joest: Garner had to raise to 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad/simson whispering again.  quiet and hard to overhear.  contrast with johnson|pg||
nt|joest: Howie on firmer groundhere.|pg||

nt|joest: here comes the 2@h pref?|pg||
nt|joest: Justin doesn't know Grue rescued into a three card suit!|pg||
nt|andyv:  Joe will have to stop running sometime|pg||
nt|joest: Of course Joe is known as being quite 'creative' so from Justin's POV, anything can be going on|pg||
nt|kit: headed for 5@D|pg||
nt|kit: If club lead to king, very interesting question whether East should return jack or low|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and stiff lead can be a way to camouflage Qxx:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen says " a real opening bid . not the crap you put down!!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: screen down Wolfson asking grue questions|pg||
nt|kit: Should go up king of hearts to conceal ace from East.  Then cross to diamond, and take spade finesse.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: we might play it here |pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d ambitious with @s wastage|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: 1st seat vul & farly balanced hand, my preferance would be for 2@h though, even though i play light in some pdships|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky duplication in @Ss|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South thought he was too good for 3@d over 2@c is following it through|pg||
nt|kit: Safety play in diamonds is to play ace first -- but there is more to thehand than just the diamond suit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|joest: and realistically partner won't rescue himself to the two level on a four card suit -- or at least he shouldn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: no chance in 3nt, 5@D would have some play|pg||
nt|psyck: other table play some 2 suiter 2 level openings, so could not open that hand 1 or 2 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: only good thing here is they will know it will be a push hand with other table failing in game too|pg||
nt|sybarra: or here |pg||
nt|sybarra: is 4 @H makeable?   |pg||
nt|sybarra: terrible lead problem for E |pg||
nt|peachy: lots of work, abd I think too much, so no|pg||
nt|kareno: Depends the lead and the defense.  With diamond lead, I think yes.  Ruff diamond, ruff club, two rounds of hearts, then clubs.  West must follow and spades go away.|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs saying spade lead,  but I dont see the kjx hand leading a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: on the get go |pg||
nt|kareno: Highly unlikely lead IMO|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt 14-16 in 1st and 2nd.|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they incorporate more nt ranges than normal into 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: operator can you check to be sure Garner pased|pg||
nt|passell: dont believe he passed|pg||
nt|joest: he knows they have 29HCP or so.  I doubt this|pg||
nt|psyck: if it was 22-23, as N has, surely strange pass|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  they should stop in 6 although an accident will get them a lucky result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing  3@S=cue   3N=serious slam interest|pg||
nt|joest: this will have a steep price tag|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will pretty much need to ruff 2spades in his hand, so will at some point take diamond finesse and then hope for 2-2.|pg||
nt|pbundy: exactly; good play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 4@S = RKC|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad has to lean forward to hear simson.  here in the crows nest I have no chance to eavesdrop|pg||
nt|sybarra: if so perhaps we ask where the mirrors are |pg||
nt|kareno: This cannot fetch.|pg||
nt|peachy: D lead likely coming so Karen's estimate could be true|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 2-2, he can ruff 3 @Cs in hand, and discard the 5th if necessary|pg||
nt|kit: he will ruff -- holding onto ace for control|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will ruff and lead a club, giving himself communication and cutting enemy communication for possible heart ruff at same time.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if @d are 2-2, which he does not know, he has 11 easy tricks |pg||
nt|kit: Interesting choice of 4 of spades lead rather than an honor|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hurd - Woolridge system summary form:  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=653&pid=167|pg||
nt|passell: if it was 19 20  strange pass|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if they can bid Exclusion here|pg||
nt|kit: Can't hurt to try the jack.  Sometimes opening leader gets a bit too clever and underleads KQ, thinking it is safe|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, its free|pg||
nt|kit: now a club, Larry.  Don't make my analysis look bad.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: Oops, lead coming from West, not so likely....!|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm afraid south interpreted north's cuebid as support showing.|pg||

nt|sybarra: (or should I say certainly disappointed?)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Garner - Weinstein:  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=790&pid=302|pg||
nt|kit: I think Grue had to play 2 of spades for club shift -- |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think so with pd having a known suit |pg||
nt|jpes: its interesting how hard they work on part score hands|pg||
nt|joest: no it's 23-24|pg||
nt|kit: this is good hand for smith/suit preference|pg||
nt|kit: as he did it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hard time dealing with this computer. Bear with me :)|pg||
nt|kit: If Lall cashes kingof clubs, does he then lead jack or low?|pg||
nt|pbundy: jack of clubs?|pg||
nt|kit: low is right if declarer has 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Has slid J to the end|pg||
nt|kit: jack is right if partner does -- but then declarer still has guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thinking|pg||
nt|kit: in fact, he might lead a deceptive low club now, as declarer "knows" hewould lead jack if he had it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: keeps pulling out the Jack and sliding it around in his hand . At the end again . Puts his hand down and starts thinking|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  at least @s suit is sitting right as is @c Q|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ = better @Hs than @s|pg||
nt|joest: on board 4 north-south did cash out effectively against 4@s unlike here|pg||
nt|kit: thank you|pg||
nt|gulyas: I did take 3 tricks in AKT vs void in a suit contract the other day:)|pg||
nt|kit: and so he did!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|robinswr: very slow here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  logical to play a @c early as some danger of an opposing @h ruff if you use the @h entries early|pg||
nt|kit: Logical return.  I think he should finesse the queen.|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the void in hand ofc|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slight clue that the @dK is offside is that East did not lead one initially despite knowing declarer is 3 suited|pg||
nt|kit: the point is that he will have to ruff a spade, so sort of pretend the 4 of diamonds is gone|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jpes: the Q@D to make S worry|pg||
nt|santyclz: Kaplan was an early advocate of fighting for part scores at imps.|pg||
nt|peachy: The "nickels and dimes" do add up|pg||
nt|peachy: in a 120 board match|pg||
nt|santyclz: In one of the segments in the quarters, after 6 bds Bathurst had picked up 25 partscore imps from Nickell.|pg||
nt|peachy: I hope this is not an impending crash. The operators have had to suffer enough of those already|pg||
nt|jpes: garner is trying to see what he can do with J87@D in Wooldridge hand|pg||
nt|joest: 22-23 sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: well, someone missaw the bidding, either South or the operator|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  5@c queen ask, |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: who's on lead? ok, tell me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Exclusion not really needed if 3@S promised @SAce|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: basically he was cuebidding after I chose.  he showed 0 or 3 keycards and no queen of trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asking simson as the auction proceeded, rubin just waited for the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: I showed @h and I liked my hand for slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be much faster to play than 7@h where restricted choice would come into play|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: and he's leading a minor again!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sassed rubin about the @c lead last time|pg||
nt|kit: but Wolfson got it right!|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5332 bad for NT  or  5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson's cards in his shirt pocket again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oper, undo pls|pg||
nt|kit: which more likely.  Singleton king or singleton small (with 2 small cards there)?|pg||

nt|gulyas: this should go for 500|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Qx a good holding for declarer at NT|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: I have a weak NT with 5 spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: no wait! it's my lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thru 115   Bathurst over Nickell by 55|pg||
nt|andyv:  4 rounds of @hs and either AK of @s and ruff or take finesse works|pg||

nt|pelu: yes a wrong claim by Eblad in 4@H - here making 11 - but nprob down 1 by TD|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  4@h not unreasonable and perhaps Justin wanted to see where NS were going to end up|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe declarer could discard @d on the 3rd @h knowing @d fin right on bidding & another discard avaialble on 4th @h|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 6 now|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that would have worked|pg||
nt|granguru: interesting viewpoint Kit..but Jxxx is even worst|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  on 81 NS are in 4@h at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: small break|pg||
nt|psyck: Nice to have a side 9 card fit in 4@h i guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we have a WBF convention card for NS http://usbf.org/docs/2011usbc/WBF%20cards/WolfsonCohenWBFCCE.pdf|pg||
nt|psyck: that CC may be more helpful than their system summary which does not say anything much more than "Normal 21st century"|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes unfortunately for most pairs all we have is a system summary|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: why is it worse?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: i'm told Welland Jacobs did continue their match -- just not enough vugraph operators for the extra 2 tables|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this looks like it's going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson with his legs crossed, hands folded together holding his cards - typical posture when studying them - then folds his card and takes the thinker pose - typical when studying ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can't get any read whether simson is confident or doubtful in his defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has to duck this |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: covers his face with his hand.  first time I've noticed that|pg||
nt|andyv:  so not sure why he's thinking so long about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he thinks long about everything, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: in defense and in the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren in weird position,  but looks like he's going to make 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: especially in defense.  he has not gotten his share of hands as declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DK still in dummy, trump pulled  to both ways to play @S work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs again.  rubin takes a swig of water|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson leaning back with his eyes closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin stifles a yawn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Goren will play @D??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson rubs his eyes.  ekeblad grabs his hair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: geez  this hand is much tougher single dummy    whodda thunk|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is why they introduced chess clocks:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson shakes his head and finally picks up his cards again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last round Wildavsky took a long time until Doub finally told him to do something.  But that contract was never beatable|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: normally players just sit and stew until the meditator breaks his trance|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|andyv:  this was an expensive ruff|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein might just play a spade back here in case garner has two diamond tricks coming and would be endplayed here|pg||
nt|joest: so b/c of the director ruling 4@h was down on board 5|pg||
nt|kit: I think the reason he passed initially was that he was pretty sure N-S would be stopping in 3@C, and then by doubling and bidding 4@H he keeps playing in spades an option if ...|pg||
nt|kit: partner has 5 spades and is short in hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Which makes a lot of sense|pg||
nt|joest: yes it does|pg||
nt|pelu: and better cards :)|pg||
nt|joest: or in the one in twenty when partner passes 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...Justin is a very thoughtful player|pg||
nt|joest: at some point, after the contract is already down one, I think you have to play a card :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is that in the rule book?|pg||
nt|joest: the unwritten one|pg||
nt|pelu: come on - the 'hole world' wont u to play NOW:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: break  -2|pg||
nt|robinswr: with Kx you should cover any honor|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pbundy: i must admit i am generally loathe to lead from Jxxx.  often picks up a suit declarer cannot do on his own|pg||
nt|granguru: usually it gives unexpected tricks to declarer.. and the J is finessed on later rounds...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: not cashing the spade sqeuals on the @h king|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: draw trump, 4.  I'll be right back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren got it wrong    go figure|pg||
nt|andyv:  much tougher for Doug that it was for us seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson shakes his head.  simson: no he couldn't do it! I'm so sorry.  kept trying to figure out a trump coup|pg||
nt|andyv:  than|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and for Russ & Barry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: is there anything I could have done to help you?|pg||
nt|andyv:  great partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  yell  DON'T RUFF|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you lead the deuce [4]. I should have trusted you had the J.  you did the best you could. I tried my best|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: if he had @SA, why didn't he just play @SA @SK ruff a spade?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to play   Bathurst over Nickell by 46|pg||

mb|3S|nt|pef: n/s get 4 diamonds a heart and 5 spades without too much work|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pef: at least, might even make 5|pg||
nt|barnets: asked what 2N shows by east|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|barnets: really dont know|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe a weak 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: good bad 2nt clubs is what's on garners paper|pg||
nt|barnets: to diff between wk and strong 3@C bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: south maybe should have passed 41Sx in other room|pg||
nt|barnets: for a good chance at plus|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: 8 to go here, not over yet|pg||
nt|gulyas: 11 to Bathurst and they are in the lead!|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps they play some kind of serious-non serious 3NT -- always dangerous if not 100% clear when 3NT might be natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it is locking up - sorry  3nt was right|pg||
nt|joest: did we just miss board 67?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, I did too|pg||
nt|joest: boring hand anyway|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, next|pg||
nt|psyck: hope the break helps them do justice to this hand|pg||
nt|kit: with only 4 spades, that isn't enough fast tricks even if you strike gold -- that's the point.|pg||
mb|2C!|an|10-15 6+ !cs|nt|ahollan1: thru 112  Diamond leads Deutsch by 45|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks simson his shape, "so I could have drawn trumps!".  johnson: "there were easier ways to play that"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no updates about Welland-Jacobs :(|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, didn't miss much.|pg||
nt|pbundy: not shockingly, bathurst picked up a game swing on the 3nt with the heart ace lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 2+|pg||
nt|sybarra: the other table was in 3@h+1|pg||
nt|jpes: there was definitely a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slam on @h finesse|pg||
mb|2S!|an|Nat nf . up to invitational|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad shakes his head, "coulda made 5"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  too many possible shapes to list|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no no no no|pg||
nt|andyv:  2+ @cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 6@D on a finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  news of long @c in the North had does not improve the chance of finding N with the @hK|pg||
nt|psyck: They are bidding as per their system summary for sure|pg||
nt|gulyas: will it go x all pass?|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen not making it easy for opponents.  Taking advantage of favorable vul and partner being passed hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: does larry think joe is psyching - or - for real?|pg||
nt|kit: this keeps N-S out of spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: I would be surprised if Lall doubles|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzfd: believe it or not, this is the real auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh    should have looked at hands  not just the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: when I enter multiple passes sometimes they don't all go through|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D from Johnson in 3rd seat is standard operating procedure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I need to be more careful to doublecheck|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s coming in and how high now?|pg||
nt|kit: Wolfson thinking:  what about me?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Wolfson asking about 3@h . Joe makes a sour face and says Natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Doesnt sound convincing though|pg||
nt|pbundy: would you guys be 2@S bidders?  or pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors 2S can be very effective|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I would always bid at this vul|pg||
nt|granguru: Lall showed a 6-5 ...if @H is a nat bid.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=@C & @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less than invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D was 2+|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin re: X "I don't know, it's in the notes somewhere"|pg||
nt|robinswr: and when they lead the jack of diamonds you should play the 9 (from 109 doubleton)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough call, you know if you x your pd is going to bid @Hs.|pg||
nt|psyck: Lall just takes a practical approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I hope for NS that 3@H now is forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s cannot make.  diamonds loses only 3 tricks so cheap at any level.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: well, ...|pg||
nt|granguru: I would bid also..they might make a game more easily w/o entering |pg||
nt|kit: Just the bid to confuse partner|pg||
nt|granguru: also true|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  3@d now|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess they paly negative free bids|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d there would have been a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: true, gives a losing option|pg||
nt|jpes: lall must have known Grue was broke to go so quietly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: lall looking around|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: If 4NT is Blackwood, Lall might have bid that|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen now thinks Grue has psyched.  But what will Wolfson think?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems that NS have the agreement  -- at least at these colors -- that N double is natural to prevent psych ?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck: but dec may have had a count of Souths hand there|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead worth another trick.|pg||
nt|joest: 4@c double on 65 went down 1 vs the 110 hre so that was a push|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|joest: this isn't right either b/c the 1NT range is 14-16 but I believe 2@s is the final contract|pg||
nt|joest: hi kit|pg||
nt|passell: hi kit   18 point nt here for weinstein   2nt for meckstroth|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@c-1@s-1N-2@h-2@s maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: not sure of auctions, but did raise to 3nt on 66|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  at least this will be right sided|pg||
nt|joest: Garner did something 'flexible' :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is what u get for opening the S hand|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s does make on heart finesse.|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will have difficulty leading a @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess not|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: If S - as here - has to X its diff to find a 5-3 fir in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  cards sit well for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be boring push|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: I didn't know how to bid it.  I didn't care how you took the X|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: had you covered, put it that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a chance Rubin will finesse twice in @H???|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "probably should be responsive"|pg||
nt|kareno: Hafta underlead the spade :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: walk on the wild side|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: He was hoping Weinstein would have a 3NT call I think -- which he would pass|pg||
nt|passell: 1c 1sp 2nt|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: stiff trump on ruff ouch|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzfd: as usual, simson asks again to leave trick 1 up for a second.  maybe I should only report when he doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers atop the played trick once it's turned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is good practice    and  automatic pause in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: you want to go smoke?  russ: may as well, never did finish the last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: you're an enabler!|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: I have another partner in mind, once I get rid of him... [rubin and johnson break up laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson sighs.  less inclined to banter than the other three at this table|pg||
nt|andyv:  at the rate of this match, by board 115 we will have all the other vugraph viewers because those matches will be over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we going fast enough to have a rate?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin rocks side to side. turns his head suddenly toward the bidbox|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|robinswr: the problem with opening the south hand is that you have no good rebid over 1@s|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D opening here is   semi- balanced or unbalanced hands with primary diamonds or 4-5 in the minors. |pg||
nt|kit: Actually, I think 4@S might have made!|pg||
nt|kit: 9 of clubs suit-preference|pg||
nt|marlowepi: think so too|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Grue puts his hand down on the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe make 5|pg||
nt|granguru: 5@S 4@D (or even 5) 1@H..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|pbundy: joe may wonder if justin has a diamond at all|pg||
nt|pbundy: here's hoping............|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: 1NT is ok if allowed by sys|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzfd: did not see which picture card he played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very good chance he'll score both either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: "well... let's start with the ... " [reaches for @HJ]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson counts something out with his fingers, talking to himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem will be if Simson shows @CA   |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns and peeks at the card|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: so now I have it right|pg||
nt|passell: looks like he will take a lot of thricks|pg||
nt|kit: just trusting partner's suit-preference signal|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest: that's also quite possible kit|pg||
nt|robinswr: I open very light but because of the rebid problem I would not open this|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs requires two cards onside.  hearts requires ace onside BUT also ten to fall.  I'd need a computer for that one.|pg||
nt|kit: should he come back with king of hearts or club ruff?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfd: actually I think @HQ is better if he can pick that johnson has psyched|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: might be able to "mark" @HK in S hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnson can't have all remaining honors or would have 14-16 NT opener|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Wolfson shows his hand. Now negotiating|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Now playing it out with open cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen says nice shift BTW|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  best to continue @d |pg||
nt|marlowepi: claim rather premature|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|nt|kit: I think this is right -- doesn't want to give opponents a chance to discard a diamond|pg||
nt|psyck: spec suhhests: 1C 1H (spades) 1N (17-19 bal) 2H 2S|pg||
nt|joest: more likely is a 1@c opener and a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|passell: yes he did well|pg||
nt|psyck: their CC says: A 1NT rebid shows 17-19 after 1  1 or 1. |pg||
nt|kit: right -- West does have an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: you are probably right|pg||
nt|passell: yes surely that is correct  we missed the 1 club opener in front of him|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks Mike|pg||
nt|kit: and while North hand is too strong for 1NT opening, the overcall on 18 is reasonable|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|psyck: he may have had to invent a 3@s bid if he tried 3@d xfr|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|joest: can start with 3@c transfer and then bid 3@s naturally if he wants to|pg||
nt|kit: I like the idea of transfers there, but on this hand playing normal where 3@H is a natural force works out easier to handle|pg||
nt|joest: it's good bidding to avoid 3NT on thsi one|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||

mb|4D|nt|andyv:  there are 12 tricks in NT|pg||

nt|joest: double = cards and quite possibly four spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: this PASS  the trap variety|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: since it's not another relay auction [just yet]|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s does show extras|pg||

mb|4H|an|huh?|nt|gulyas: 4@s|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 5|pg||
nt|kareno: You specs had better hold onto your seats!!  This is bridge at its best.|pg||
nt|peachy: 1NT = 14-16, 3H = 5-4 or 4-5 minors with singl H|pg||
nt|gulyas: Bathurst lead back up to 51 in the meantime with small gains|pg||
nt|granguru: or just cue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H?|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H= I can also cue a singleton|pg||
nt|marlowepi: transfer one of several options over iovercall to raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I played a ton of sets against Wolfson Cohen . THEY PLAY NOTHING|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: Donn 6N West|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should move after 3N bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rubin bidding 3N over presumed 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-4|pg||
nt|passell: yes great to get to 4hearts   almost impossible unless opponents in bidding|pg||
nt|joest: and now a master solvers problem for Weinstein. He will 'punt' with 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: they have 2 7-card major-suit fits -- spades doesn't do as well this time|pg||
nt|joest: no ability to clearly grab it with 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: results are right, bidding may not be|pg||
nt|joest: 4@c is reasonable too|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@D or 4@C maybe|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H must be some kind of spade raise if auction is to be believed|pg||
nt|kit: It could be an intentional psych, but would he then follow with 4@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Wolfson points at 4@h and whispers something to Grue|pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: why psych when you have the boss suit?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am waiting for the Real Auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Russ|pg||
nt|robinswr: some play that 3@c shows a minimum saying nothing about clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: move on, nothing to see here|pg||
nt|psyck: there are tons of variations of Jacoby 2NT played :)|pg||
nt|jpes: hurd has his work cut out - |pg||
nt|passell: yes hate 4clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c could wait|pg||
nt|kit: this will get the heart preference|pg||
nt|kit: Wolfson not taking a joke|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 3@h apparently a singleton heart with three spades and minors.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator will keep us posted on the post mortem:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  and nice placement of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: "sounds like doug dodged a bullet on this one" [laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: if you misguess @s on this one I'll be very disappointed|pg||
nt|kit: This is an awkward hand for Garner -- he still hasn't shown the diamond suit and slam interest|pg||
nt|pelu: 13 oop 14-16 but 7@D on|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that convention was named after the late and great Grant Baze|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 4333 opposite a 14-16 pt nt.|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl will be helpful|pg||
nt|kit: then Weinstein might punt again with 4@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: another boring hand, a Q of overtricks here|pg||
nt|kit: Lall leading from 3-card suit instead of 4-card suit, since morelikely to find partner with 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: just not this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 2 of us|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  should make 7 as S will be quickly squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: "let's see how good they are"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: 2@S would have been juuuuicy|pg||
nt|kit: and the excellent slam is missed.|pg||
nt|joest: on the spade layout yes.  6@d would be nice to reach though|pg||
nt|santyclz: They're not shy.|pg||
nt|jpes: with 3 @C tricks it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, it looks like it|pg||
nt|peachy: The red color increases the boldness of even putzes like me at IMPs :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Also with no spots, 8 cards 6 and below.  |pg||
nt|joest: Barcelona, Paris, Normandy, Avignon|pg||
nt|jpes: weinstein's @D signal will be a little late|pg||
nt|joest: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can i go too|pg||
nt|joest: i'm looking forward to it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: great trip, enjoy|pg||

nt|joest: is 4@c support?|pg||
nt|kit: But they will get to 5@S, and now maybe doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: or even 3@S, but 4@C looks more accurate|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades looks like a make also|pg||
nt|kit: And with KJ doubleton, I think Garner will pick 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c not cue i think after delayed @h preferance|pg||
mb|5S|nt|yorkbeach:  their big gain this set was on 78, where East at the other table did not give West his @d ruff (suit was AJ stiff facing Kxxxxx)|pg||
nt|kit: not that dull for declarer -- he will try to find best way to take 4 club tricks for sure, as that gives him 9.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, may cash @cA & lead up to J|pg||
nt|kit: doesn't really have entries for that|pg||
nt|kit: I think just ace of clubs, jack of clubs -- can't really handle 4 clubs to Q10 in West hand.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: defense against 2@SX = 1100 or 1400|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
nt|psyck: so, just an optional playing strain|pg||
nt|joest: hey i'm just asking.  I confess I'm not sure.|pg||
nt|psyck: so far , so good|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C certainly not Q -- they don't have a trump suit yet|pg||
nt|joest: WEinstein seems out of bids by now it seems to me|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|kit: However, he may think 4@H is a Q.  I don't think it should be|pg||
nt|joest: after a 3@h pref?|pg||
nt|joest: I think this is a great auction : provided it now goes pass :)|pg||
nt|kit: My belief is that 4 of a previously bid major is always an offer to play unless that is just plain impossible|pg||
nt|passell: I agree Kit|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they  have done well so far, but they may still feel some of the bids are ambiguous|pg||
nt|joest: ditto|pg||
nt|passell: especially the second time he bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Might not always be perfect, but avoids a lot of possible mixups|pg||
nt|joest: then in the bar we can argue over what is "just plain impossible"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: you need to frame a question if you expect a reply :)|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, private|pg||
nt|kit: I think they know what the bids mean -- Weinstein is just thinking about slam in clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: arent we all, even when playing? :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: larry decided he didn't want to play with one trump as declarer|pg||
nt|kit: But he passed 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Wolfson reaches for the cards then Grue points to the 5@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen says he hasnt psyched in 30 years!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: but simple Jacoby plays that 3@c shows short spades|pg||
nt|santyclz: You could try tapping your foot...|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: unlikely slam knows off dia and heart |pg||
nt|kit: I do not understand this play at all.  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzfd: getting higher|pg||
nt|joest: Howie can see there will be problems with the expected diamondlead.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  if they pull 4 rounds of trump, N might only get his 3 spades|pg||
nt|robinswr: short clubs|pg||
nt|pbundy: is this super deep psyching - figuring the opps will never let you play 5@H unmolested?|pg||
nt|kit: so if auction is to be believed, Cohen rebid his singleton, then sat it there until doubled.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: everyone laffing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "there's something happening here, but you don;t know what it is, do you Mr. Jones?"|pg||
nt|pbundy: if so - bravo to larry|pg||
nt|kit: Meanwhile, Wolfson hasn't made this yet|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, i was thinking just that, kit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen says. I want to know from the master ( Grue)  If this auction has merit|pg||
nt|pbundy: i still think he'll have an easier time at this than larry would have at 5@H, however|pg||
nt|kit: He is cold with spade to ace, spade to king, heart -- but he might do something else.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzfd: 4+4+2+2|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a 1 imp gain for Aker|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|joest: this is a good slam if the club queen were onside|pg||
nt|kit: wonder what 4NT was.  I guess Garner thought it RKC for hearts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|passell: cold if he guesses clubs|pg||
nt|joest: the good news is that 5@c was probably down as well|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h was that magic moment|pg||
nt|passell: he well might |pg||
nt|jcwla: Very well might.|pg||
nt|kit: the queen of clubs is onside-- if you are gib, that is|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if the @d length known may make him get it right|pg||
nt|joest: GIB is a great player|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's always on some side|pg||
nt|passell: slightly anti percentage but dia length might help|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what he had available.  Would not 3@C have been a transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is tough to reach 6@d when no one bids @ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: crunch time in trumps|pg||
nt|pbundy: uh oh is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Wolfson says lets see if I can make it. So Grue says. Does that mean you have play?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|joest: he has to cross twice in spades to make the 'big' club play|pg||
nt|joest: and will be fortunate to find long clubs with long spades|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  was S afraid the @h stopper was the K@h and anything he bid would wrong side it?|pg||
nt|psyck: playing rubensohl/rumpelsohl, he could bid 3@c xfr to @d & then bid 3@s|pg||
nt|joest: well there is a complication there too|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: 3@c is invitational or better.  What if partner crosses you up by 'accepting' with 3NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: opposite short clubs and an unlimited hand east has a fair hand long clubs is good opposite a singleton|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|passell: 5 -1 spades is never fortunate|pg||
pc|s9|nt|granguru: asking a @C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: since playing West for queen of clubs loses opportunity to pick up stiff queen, I see no reasonto do that|pg||
nt|pbundy: very nice diamond cash from justin|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|kit: East did splinter, but Wolfson may have forgotten|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: all double dummy.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|passell: might play 3nt at other table for a push|pg||
nt|kit: Well, if they are to play in clubs then 6@C is better contract than 5@C, as it is potential 4 or 6 hand|pg||
nt|kit: why nice diamond cash?  He was lucky it held.|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzfd: larry asks me what I was thinking :) I said I thought he missed something|pg||

nt|pef: yes, to those asking mini, even though it forces to game--meant to distinguish types of splinters|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|pef: just about that, although I suppose with hearts 3-0 you might need a teensy bit more in terms of suit splits|pg||
nt|pef: 3n asking which shortness|pg||
nt|barnets: think they will bid it|pg||
mb|4H!|an|spade shortness|mb|p|nt|pef: so when he finds spade shortness, he might push on his hand|pg||

nt|pef: 4h showing spade shortness|pg||
mb|4S|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|barnets: maybe RKC|pg||
nt|pef: at the other table they overcalled 1s with east's hand and south just bid 4h.  Even though he was playing opposite|pg||
nt|barnets: 0 keys|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: q ask|pg||
nt|pef: a limited partner (didn't open a strong 1c), that strikes me as far too pessimistic when you had a descriptive 3s bid available|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ek: when he bid 3NT I was very disappointed; simson: I was very pleased.  should have bid 1@S, harder to get|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would be rude of him|pg||
nt|santyclz: When you're hot...|pg||
nt|joest: north opened 1NT in theother room|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hoped @CK completed the suit.|pg||
nt|psyck: lead will not be a problem in 3n then|pg||
nt|kit: if East had held Q10xx of clubs, that line would get only2 club tricks and probably lead to defeat.|pg||
nt|kit: what if declarer had stiff Q or K?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: he knows pd will not cross when he has AKQJ :)|pg||
nt|kareno: My bridge kibitzing cat, Stella, just jumped into my lap :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: right, sorry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  many possible shapes  |pg||
nt|joest: Lall opens his flat ten count vulnerable before Garner can open his flat eleven count vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, would have been interesting of @ck value was in @d|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you should go out of your  way to compete against 1nt|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they would have bwooded into 5@S and made that|pg||
nt|psyck: right|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Which is why I think it is bad to play 3@C transfer invite or better -- partner can't cross you up if 3@D is forced|pg||
nt|joest: he is entitled to accept with a max|pg||
nt|passell: probably going 3 down in 3nt unless inspired guess in clubs at other table|pg||
nt|joest: options are: 1) transfer to spades; 2) use Garbage stayman but risk rotting in 2@h or 3) Stayman and then 2@s which is game invitational|pg||
nt|passell: like the 3rd option|pg||
nt|joest: opposite 14-16?|pg||
nt|passell: gets both majors in and values|pg||
nt|kit: Wooldridge perhaps doesn't have a good way to enter with this shape -- or just chooses not to.|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein mulling over which one of the three doors to open :)|pg||
nt|kit: How do they play 2@C, then 2@S Jack?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: talking about the fact that Lall splintered in @s |pg||
mb|4H!|nt|andyv:  including 5 card @s suit|pg||
nt|psyck: he may have chosen to to at the vul even if he had a minor/major bids available|pg||
nt|gulyas: now you know Kit why they are so far behind:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: will you let her type, Karen ?|pg||
nt|passell: can beat 4spades with dia lead then under lead in clubs for ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: constructive; GI  Partner has rights over 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you have another chance|pg||
nt|pelu: but when S has AKQJ he could be almost sure on 3@D by pd|pg||
nt|kit: With an invite, I just make an old-fashioned game try -- bid game and try to make it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Her spelling is not as good as her analysis :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@d transfer 1@h 2 or 3 with a weak nt.|pg||
nt|pbundy: am i the only one to think this is waaaaaaaay too good a hand for 4@H?|pg||
nt|kit: This would have been a good time to splinter|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfd: "he's reaching for cards - he bid"|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to have worked pretty well for you last week, Kit:)|pg||
nt|psyck: Looks like the connections will be a recurring problem today|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably heard your comments re great bridge |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: there is a lot to be said for that kit.  And it solves the problem we are discussing in some transfer lebensohl methods|pg||
nt|gulyas: another push probably|pg||
nt|passell: going low|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  spades play well for N|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad goes through the possibilities for rubin's shape, simson: "I've heard plenty" and passes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: nothing in this room is hot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a clue there was the lead|pg||
mc|12|nt|robinswr: a simple way to bid over 2@s is to play 2NT forces 3@c. for other bids assume partner opened 2NT(15-17) and respond as you would to partner 's 2NT opening |pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@c stayman, 3@D transfer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East held a singleton club, he would probably have had a 5-card suit somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen Says I hope you have @hs . i say he is hoping you do. Cohen says good slam|pg||
nt|kit: problem with bidding 4@H, in addition to a possible missed slam, is that if opponents accept the transfer and bid 4@S you have no idea what to do.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: smoke break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: North is larry Cohen from the real deal fame|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and of course the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|pbundy: for some who have asked - n/s are not playing any form of big club or precision|pg||

nt|psyck: np Susan, at least we got back immediately|pg||

nt|kit: but maybe he will find something imaginative|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=738&pid=155|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm not sure anyone has stats on the style, but my gut feeling is it pays more than loses|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck: a hand where NS should not let 5 level belong to the opps|pg||
nt|joest: 'walking the dog' as they say|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the answer is.....3@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N used to be semi-force  but yesterday operator alerted as Forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said semi|pg||
nt|andyv:  they have it marked as semi forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: with the transfer to opps known suit generally acting as a stayman substitute|pg||
nt|jpes: look at the score|pg||
nt|kit: With his strong spade holding, Hurd forgets about a possible 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|joest: i like 1NT frankly even though it might not work wellhere|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: John wasn't operator yesterday :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s info |pg||
nt|passell: may cause a dbl part score swing however|pg||
nt|kit: he can back in with 2@H okay|pg||
nt|joest: but Howie may boost to 3@c first|pg||
nt|kit: or double if takeout|pg||
nt|passell: unless north bids 3clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Very interesting that Grue didn't open in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yep   i was very surprised yesterday|pg||
nt|peachy: Polish style 1C, natural, or bal 11-14 or bal 18-19|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: N-S should not be bidding to 5@S -- goes for 300, while 5@H might not be making -- it is on diamond guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may be a mistake to bid the E hand slowly if NS can get their @c suit in|pg||
nt|peachy: let me clarify on the club, kib says it is not polish style.. This is what it "is" : balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: somewhat symmetric -- both contract have 4 top losers, both off queen of trumps, and both pick up the queen|pg||
nt|joest: West wants to reopen with double|pg||
nt|passell: likely wants to bid 3dia  not suspecting 4 hearts from partner|pg||
nt|kit: prefer double to 3@D (assuming it is takeout) -- keeps more options open|pg||
nt|passell: agreed  but a little disaster prone without discussion|pg||
nt|joest: it is amazing how people bid on less and less yet more and more doubles are takeout :)|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe West should have made his takeout double at the 2-level?|pg||
nt|joest: not sure a double of 2@c sounds takeout to me Kit, after partner bids 1NT announcing their spades|pg||
nt|passell: I prefer neg dbl with the east hand  then if partner bids 2clubs can bid 2nt|pg||
nt|kit: depends on agreements, that's all.  I would bet they would play it as takeout|pg||
nt|joest: that would made this a much easier hand Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Which declarer will get right when finding South has stiff heart|pg||
nt|peachy: With the current proliferation of light opening style (11, and many 10 pointers even if balanced/ish) and then light responding style, one can easily get robbed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, everyone opens |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i can understand not opening 4333 12 counts in 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, with 2 12 point hands they stopped low|pg||
nt|gulyas: 8 tricks maybe the limit here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you open agressively in first seat, you can afford to be more conservative in third |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: things don't sit well for declarer|pg||
nt|kit: were never going anywhere after South passed (with 11, not 12)|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops, sry, right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a lot of Precision pairs open almost every flat 11 or 12|pg||

nt|granguru: reduced to nothing after this lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kareno: 2@c may have shown hearts in their transfer style.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Everyone opens, everyone overcalls, nobody x's for penalty.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's a different game|pg||
nt|passell: would bid 1nt with a little worse hand with those holdings|pg||

nt|kit: The slow approach worked, talking Weinstein into doubling|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry that was e/w |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: Okay, now we know that 2@c showed hearts - transfer bypassing their diamond suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: they are in 2 h by n, losing the play|pg||
pc|h5|nt|joest: Wooldridge saved a part score swing there|pg||
nt|kit: this could be interesting if defense takes 4 black winners and then spade and ruff with 7 of diamonds|pg||
nt|passell: been too high before  the real trouble is missing game when partner has a decent 14 or 15 and a stiff spade|pg||
nt|psyck: EW open most 10 too :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: my calculator has blown a fuse:)|pg||
nt|kit: If they had been pushed to 2@S, that might have gone down on bad lie of cards.  1@S will make for sure.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|robinswr: hurd has to play this carefully since spades are 4-2|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|psyck: i would not have expected them to get to 5 w/o knowing their side @c fit against an NV game|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, mis-saw auction|pg||
nt|kit: Once again, leading away from an honor when no expected need to do so -- this time he is lucky, as it is only an overtrick|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|jpes: those @D have to get set up|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl hook in @ds is one line|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein went right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if system allowed West to open 1@h, there is a case for that - not when playing 5-card majors|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|passell: the opponents also rarely lead my hearts even though it could be the weakness|pg||

pc|s6|nt|gulyas: strange|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 4 now|pg||
nt|psyck: too bad we do not get to see his line after a @h or @c continuation|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: much of the time, set up sidetricks before the trumps are all gone|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, kit, or somebody who sees faster than I, what was the justification for this line|pg||
nt|jpes: i think declarer has erred|pg||
nt|kit: here we go -- the uppercut is coming|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: he can open a 4-card major in 3rd seat if he wants, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play precision, less likely to open 4 cards in 3rd seat playing prec than playing standard|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@d and @d is 2nd but still have to guess what @d to put in when W ducks|pg||
nt|gosia: now clubs will put pressure on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: % play with all the spots is push Q push T|pg||
nt|joest: Chris Willenken points out that fouru black winners + another spade ruffed with the @D7 makes declarer guess the diamond her|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: and there we are|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  seems a bit better than 75%|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says: played for Hx of Diamonds onside, with the Heart length, rathen than 3-3 diamonds|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|peachy: Other suggestions: Human error.          Opps too much I give up.        |pg||
pc|dA|nt|passell: he will get this right |pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: South has presumably 6 clubs and 2 spades|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: Declarer expecting Lall to hold ace of hearts since Grue didn't open|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7 was the limit, just made|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|kit: He needs queen of hearts on|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  so dbl hook it is and a push board|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein could be 5=3=2=3 or 5=2=3=3|pg||
nt|passell: no one would lead third spade with 2 small diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: So give South 3 hearts-- ergo 2dimonds|pg||
nt|passell: maybe|pg||
nt|kit: why not?  Might need to kill spade discard.  Declarer could just be off third round heart trick|pg||
nt|passell: true|pg||
nt|joest: east-west in a comfortable 2@h next door |pg||
nt|passell: lose 3 or 7 depending on guess|pg||

mb|4H|an|alerted by cohen but not wolfson|nt|ahollan1: Weinstein opened 1@D which guarantees unbal hand|pg||
nt|kit: This may be a difficult slam to avoid -- big spade duplication|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have long trumps tap declarer|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = majors, much to Garner's surprise|pg||
nt|pbundy: at these colors particularly, this looks like a 4@H call to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Welland, with no vugraph operators to slow them down, finished ahead of everyone...well done.|pg||
nt|andyv:  which is fine as long as you don't lose by 3|pg||
nt|psyck: 10-15, 2+@d's|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how system makes a difference on that decision.|pg||
nt|kit: Routine 4@H opener.  Questionn is what does Grue do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: 2 @d ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D inverted raise even in comp|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural?|pg||
nt|andyv:  must be in wrong room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said natural, forcing. forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@d will make this match a lot closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 1-round force  but Johnson might not pass for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson puts his cards back in his shirt pocket|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: will see if he needs them again as the auction progresses|pg||
nt|joest: no where to park that little club in the east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If he doubles, it is takeout|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: very similar start in other room  except Garner in South bid 2@C |pg||
nt|gosia: this is the time to bid 7 on a finesse for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: indeed, johnson again fans his hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: undo|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: Four more hands today,  matches continue tomorrow 10AM Pacific Time|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Garner 2@C was @D LR+   so same as Johnson's 2@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if 4@c is keycard now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@H [by either] would be RKC|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a great pen X anyway|pg||
nt|pbundy: might only have 3 cashers.  and - he does - but his partner has some stuff for him.|pg||
nt|kit: 4 possible cashers -- wish all my penalty doubles were that good|pg||
nt|pbundy: tho as kit says - can't double for penalty anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Grue asks Wolfson if it is the only way to open 4@h . Wolfson says they play Namyats|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with only three spades, and E a passed hand, I think the pass is the indicated call. but when up 50 you often factor in what you think might happen at otther table with hungry opps|pg||
nt|kit: why shouldn't partner have some stuff for him?  Just as likely as dummy having that stuff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: so 4@C just a cue|pg||
nt|andyv:  then 4@c just cue|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: NOW  RKC|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...now 4@h is rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson points at cards in his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: see if he shows the Q/extra length|pg||
nt|jpes: 60 bds a day is taking a toll|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: of course he will|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sighs and sets down his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if it was obvious he might have done so by now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is he worried that trump is @S???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing k@s may stop them from 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not on same wavelength re: 4@H may keep them out of 6@D|pg||
nt|gosia: diamonds is trump- afraid to show 1D q with only 9 HCP :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson burying his face in his hand again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if he doesn't, S will still bid 5N (or whatever their K asking sequence is) after response of 2 key cards|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@s on 2@s better|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when they ask for Kings  it is  , not specific Kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he did deny Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks, simson says "this is blackwood" louder than his usual voice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: "who asked you to talk out loud?" and calls director|pg||
nt|andyv:  did he show 2 controls?|pg||
nt|chip: If 4H was RKC, surprised he didn't show the Q.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hesitation and S's comments could be a problem here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias: you lose most of your rights, have to point out hesitations from the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|andyv:  re re|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: do u often have bad internet-conections?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|gulyas: with both minors placed well, he is making 10|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think this asks   of kings  and 5@S=none|pg||
nt|psyck: difficult to stop below slam now|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H presumably natural, slammish, and a few Q-bids after that|pg||
nt|psyck: S clearly expected 3@s to have more goodies|pg||
nt|robinswr: jump to 4spade is no aces no kings no singletons or voids, good desciption|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: sorry about the net problems|pg||
nt|joest: 3@s doesn't look like a  Q and was alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may just play here|pg||
nt|kit: Pass of the double probably denies club control, and redouble says he has a club control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hope i'm getting this right|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N was serious if 3@s showed @h fit|pg||
nt|kit: interesting opening lead choice.  I think most would have led a high club.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gulyas: 2 dow |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: 3NT looks pretty non-serious to me|pg||
nt|psyck: redouble 1st round control likely|pg||
nt|gulyas: n|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  i think so but I thought 5N would ask for specific kings but I don't have any notes to support that|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still  i think Simson should have shown the Q    extra length could have been important to Johnson|pg||
nt|gosia: still 13 to Aker|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson agrees that he asked for keycards, simson showed 2 without the Q, johnson asked for kings, and simson showed 0|pg||
nt|kit: Grue is bidding a lot on his 10-count|pg||
nt|joest: i know you have two aces but are there any brakes at all on the West vehicle? :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  since they open most 10 counts not vul, E has to proceed with some caution|pg||
nt|pelu: last chance for Lall|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will certainly bid the slam -- he is thinking grand|pg||
nt|robinswr: over 3spades if you bid 4@c and partner bids 4@s there is no slam|pg||
nt|kit: Oh I agree with the pass.  But if double were penalties, I would happily double.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|nt|joest: opposite a limited opener that is optimistic|pg||
nt|kit: 5NT choice of slams -- worried about protecting his partner's king of clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  Grue's hand already limited to 10-13 range|pg||
nt|andyv:  can Grue pass this?|pg||
nt|kit: you are right -- can't be a grand|pg||
nt|joest: back on board 9 Bathurst-Zagorin also missed 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: The other semifinal match shows a score gap also, about the same as here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - unlikely to finesse th 9 on the 3rd @c|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: if 1N limited the 10-15 opening to 10-13, this is certainly optimistic bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: the 7@d in B9 = flat in 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: now in fairness if Grue had Qxx of spades we wouldn't be talking this way :)|pg||
nt|joest: not that we would EVER double dummy a hand!|pg||
nt|andyv:  what's that?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gulyas: could end up with 11 unless they cash the @Hs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: we like it when you are happy:)|pg||
nt|pbundy: and i would double if double for penalty, too, kit.  just saying it's moot as it is not an option|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Well, Grue could have Qxx of spades and 3 aces, couldn't he?|pg||
nt|joest: that's a grand!  |pg||
nt|joest: that's the perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I guess that is 1NT opening|pg||
nt|joest: in the real world|pg||
nt|joest: down one|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 1N 14-16, so this was limited to 10-13|pg||
nt|kit: Anybody have any idea why Grue didn't open 2@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hello again :)|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess they prefer better suit quality for 2@c openings. cc only says 6+ 10-15 hcp though.|pg||
nt|pelu: we missed u Susan :)|pg||
nt|joest: so are we frozen or is garner thinking about the opening lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Grue had 2 chances to go anti partnership but score big swing...pass 4@c dbld and pass 5NT |pg||
nt|joest: well let's rule out the latter|pg||
nt|joest: i think that is 100% forcing and he has no idea what lall has|pg||
nt|kit: passing 4@C doubled way to big a position -- could have slam, and 4@C might not be making.|pg||
nt|joest: and this from the high priest of "I will pass a forcing call if it feels right!"  :)|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- but it doesn't feel right|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I didn't say they were right...only that they worked|pg||
nt|kit: does 4@C even make?|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe on trump coup -- but better be playing for it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh good, I got Kit thinking:)|pg||
nt|joest: that's right play for all four trumps on your RIGHT and the guy who double you on the left to have a stiff|pg||
nt|andyv:  what's the problem?|pg||
nt|joest: everybody would play that way|pg||
nt|kit: routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 5N cold...all you have to do is duck the @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  bridge is such an easy game|pg||
nt|kit: rather imaginative double of 4@C byWeinstein btw to get club lead.  Pity it didn't matter.|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime I have lost contact with what is going in real life in Las Vegas|pg||
nt|psyck: I thought life in LV was unreal|pg||
nt|pelu: Andy telling fairy tales|pg||
nt|joest: right now this board is living proof the adage:|pg||
nt|joest: "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"|pg||
nt|andyv:  including most of your money|pg||
nt|pelu: are we waiting for a lead?|pg||
nt|kit: probably a connection problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  they've had a few of those|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe operator catching up with play & will just enret result|pg||
nt|psyck: even if W had a 3rd @s, this would need a non @c lead...|pg||
nt|psyck: oh no, can disc immed|pg||
nt|pelu: only chance to make is: stif @hA and stiff @C on same hand - take out @ss + @Ds and play @H and wait for ruff-discard :)|pg||
nt|joest: we have sent someone into this room to see what's going on|pg||

mb|2S|an|strong GF|nt|joest: two schools of thought on splintering with stiff aces|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: simson still 100% at asking to see the spots on trick 1|pg||
nt|psyck: operator entering the auctions which were missed out during the disconnection|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South did not want to hear 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: anyone like NAMYATS instead of 2@c by W here?|pg||
nt|kit: Spade lead clearly ends it.  Stiff diamond lead works well also|pg||
nt|passell: what are your thoughts kit?|pg||
nt|kit: my thoughts are splinter if at all possible|pg||
nt|kit: Not the kind he will enjoy|pg||
nt|psyck: less effective 2N after opps have exchanged info|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it looks like 2NT directly over 1@d would have ben @c + @H and delayed bid is the minors|pg||
mb|3N|an|non serious|nt|andyv:  one imp to Wolfson...lead should be 9 with 2 to go|pg||
nt|kit: On this hand 4@H is the winner.  But interchange West's minors, and 3NT is the winner.  Would be nice if there was a way to tell.|pg||
nt|passell: or both stiff dia lead then spade shift|pg||
nt|passell: yes I agree  diagnosing shortness is one of the keys to slam bidding|pg||
nt|kit: was going to be a dull 4@S contract, but Cohen introduced some excitement|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South seems to have other ideas|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: reasonable game on slim values, unfortunate trump break|pg||
nt|kit: Note Cohen's crafty redouble -- making sure his partner plays the bloodbath|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I play it the classical style, showing AK to 7+ cards, about 8.5 trick hand with no 2 quick losers in 2 side suits...which fits here|pg||
nt|gulyas: too strong for that I think|pg||
nt|psyck: this will not help make up the deficit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  getting 2@s ruffs now|pg||
nt|kit: Big misfire on the opening lead.  I'm really surprised,|pg||
nt|kit: so they blunder into 4@S -- will make I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N was reluctant to pass, he must have been hankering to go to the well again in hearts. |pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead seems logical -- safest, and maybe dummy has rufing value|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|passell: now will get everything|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs seem to think too strong too|pg||
nt|kit: On this auction, the trump should have been jumping out of Gure's hand.|pg||
nt|kit: this makes life easier for declarer -- now he doesn't have to guess which red-suit finesse to take with his one dummy entry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as against that, the NS defensive prospects may need very parsimonious management, and spade queen is a nice card for pd to have. only 2 HCP and out nOT leading a trump may help ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him score it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Coughing factory here . Lotsa Katz and Cohen remarks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: if partnerhas queen of spades, it will drop|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: with 4 to play  Diamond leads Deutsch by 54 |pg||

nt|passell: even guessing hearts sneaking a diamond entry isnt enough|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|kit: tough to guess hearts with no hand entry, and no way to handle 4-1 split anyway|pg||

pc|c7|nt|pbundy: even if larry cohen is in retirement - he would not lead the deuce of diamonds there :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the ace of @cs was cashed not the trump at trick 2  so no rounds of trump til now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|passell: 1 more for declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders must take care not to set up long @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: with the @SK in east hand|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North to reopen with a X?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: Garner has a pretty good hand here off this auction|pg||
nt|kit: always good when opponents don't score any imps|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some might open 1@D here with prepared 2@C rebid.|pg||
nt|passell: looks like they are making the last hand in the other room   played from other side with club lead|pg||
nt|passell: cashed a heart sneaked a diamond to hand  now restricked choice  4h 4dia 2 aces|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe 3@D|pg||
nt|kit: Simple 3@H for me -- why complicate the issue?|pg||
nt|joest: I'm guessing a straightforward 3@h or a bold 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|passell: I like 4dia |pg||
nt|joest: I didn't think of it! :)|pg||
nt|kit: this is just an overbid IMO.  If partner rejects 3@H invite,game won't be good|pg||
nt|passell: compromise between 3dia and 4hearts  gets to game in best fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely we will be catching up now |pg||
nt|kit: best fit isn't important -- hearts has to be adequate|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: that was a screeching halt.  ekeblad asks johnson's range, simson: what seat was he in? then 14-16|pg||
nt|gulyas: not after the last disaster:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with 17 hcp, Russ has nowhere to go.|pg||
nt|kit: of course he will|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: Can beat it 3 with that lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: gets a better fit this time|pg||
mb|4S|nt|passell: yes 3 diamonds and trust partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: had a chance in OR - played by W and @D-lead - to Q and a @h on @DA, but wrong guess in @C|pg||
nt|psyck: 55 is sure tempting to enter, though vul & suits not great|pg||
nt|robinswr: its clear to enter with 55 also clear if 5431|pg||
nt|joest: well kit you seem to have hit the nail on the head on this hand|pg||
nt|passell: if partners dia Q were somewhere else game would have been good and it would have been missed going low|pg||
nt|kit: Actually a pretty good slam with spades on the right, but nearly impossible to diagnose|pg||
mb|6H|nt|pelu: defense can now take the first 4 trick|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Susan u had a hard time - hope for better connection in next segment|pg||
nt|psyck: lots of interesting & swingy deals, hopefully several more of such to come|pg||
nt|gulyas: good bid I think, and a partscore swing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South gives his partner a lot of leeway|pg||
nt|gulyas: in fact, you can make 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: important to remember that partner also knows they pay that vul game bonus -- if he rejects the invite -- ugh|pg||
nt|gulyas: he was also there the last time:)|pg||
nt|kit: Larry hates to let opponents play at the 2-level|pg||
nt|pbundy: nice choice by LC|pg||
nt|pbundy: as long as wolfson doesn't take another call................|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Wolfson not ready to give up|pg||
nt|kit: Well they got there.  But Wolfson had to take a huge risk bidding 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Showing grue his hand but still hasnt passed|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen had easy acceptance.  He had shown zero so far.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: now they are laffing|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes - and he should remember that twice, larry passed and then bid the minimum over the 2nd double. how much can he have?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stuck fifty-some, pedal to the metal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Even thinking is an overbid here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen says he was waiting for the 6 @s bid. Obv doesnt know who huddled|pg||
nt|kit: After the expected spade lead, he will win, pull trumps, and eliminate spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Lall thinking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can meld his sixty queens, so may score 1040|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: oh my -- this lead might beat the slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  with the @sA likely to be right on the bidding, you want to be in game|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: operator job is hard enough without computer glitches|pg||

nt|passell: welland making a charge in the other match|pg||

nt|kit: If Cohen fears a singleton ....|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: W would have bid 3C|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|joest: 3 more to Wolfson for that third undertrick on board 73|pg||
nt|passell: a missed chance for wolfson on last hand as ekeblad didnt take restricted choice play in hearts went 2 down  |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Mrs. Miller|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s6|nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you hope that the opponents have 10 points in that suit and that the ten points would only take one trick|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: My guess is that Lall thought for a while on the lead, so not likely a singleton.  If it had come faster ........|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no thought at all at trick one|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|jcwla: I'm sticking with 3@D - involves pd in both decisions, second choice 3@H, then 4@D (level more imp to solicit pd's input than strain), 4@H last of all.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck: penultimate deal of this set.  Thanks to my co-commentators Steve & Daniel.  Good job by our operator under trying conditions.  Thanks to the kibs for joining us & for their ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: Last of the set, back at 3:45.  Thanks to all|pg||
nt|kit: only if North bid 3@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most play bid in new lower-ranking suit than opener's weak-2 suit by partner shows lead-direction with support. called often "McCabe"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Larry says next time lead faster and i might play you for a singleton!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i prefer the label "Mrs. Miller" (reference to great Robert Altman western)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: are there 13 imps to be had here?|pg||

mb|1S|an|with thought|nt|andyv:  1@c=2+|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = inverted|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+   too numerous to describe|pg||
nt|kit: is 1NTneg double for minors?|pg||
nt|joest: no it's natural.  stoppers be damned!  :)|pg||
nt|kit: Wolfson can't complain about the deals -- they have been lively enough to pick up the 60 IMPs if things had gone better.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: Aker put up great battle|pg||
nt|andyv:  there are always 13 imps to be had somewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since W did show support but didnt bid 3C, probably not a singleton|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  but this hand doesn't bode well for the Aker team|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h  ART game force|pg||
nt|passell: meckwell style  they also dont promise stoppers  just points|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT here means what?|pg||
nt|joest: to play it would seem like|pg||
nt|kit: Simple 2@D call looks right to me.  Why not?|pg||
nt|joest: Garner could have five diamonds here|pg||
nt|passell: means I misbid the 1st time|pg||
nt|joest: all balanced hands open 1@c|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would make a neg X missing a @H.  |pg||
nt|passell: yes  I like neg dbl  extra values make up for missing heart|pg||
nt|kit: so, is double takeout (after having shown spade strength)?|pg||
nt|passell: great reopener after previous board by Larry   needed to be rewarded|pg||
nt|marlowepi: indeed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = good @H raise   2@H would be weaker|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to be much weaker although the @h honors are nice|pg||

nt|gosia: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner already at 4@C and auction not over|pg||

nt|joest: 2NT = an initial balanced GF|pg||

nt|passell: have to cash a major ace to beat 5 diamonds by south|pg||
nt|joest: on for 130 and selling for 110|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this one may run out of steam |pg||
nt|psyck: nice for N to know S has a non minimum, they should get to 6@c eaily, hopefully not more|pg||

nt|gulyas: coming with 2@S|pg||
nt|passell: how bad could game be  against any dummy he might get ?|pg||
nt|kit: See -- Cohen doesn't sell at 2-level|pg||
mb|4H|nt|joest: 3@s = shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  always a problem how to evaluate shortness when it's the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: Spade shortness will not exactly excite Weinstein|pg||
nt|pelu: often a problem to show shortness with an A|pg||
nt|joest: true but where can partners extra values be that won't produce some reasonableplay for slam?|pg||
nt|pelu: late - again :(:(|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|psyck: if they play minorwood or kickback, N can easily stop in time after finding only 1 side king after key card response|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 10 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|kit: oh he will certainly get them to slam -- the key is to stay out of the bad grand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  KJ@h?  and 6@c may be wrong sided then|pg||
nt|jcwla: Felt boxed into corner here.  As for 2NT to play on opps' fit auction, more power to you.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: no 13 imps here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Susan, great job.|pg||
nt|passell: probably lose 2 imps  50 to 130|pg||
nt|kit: Is there some reason Weinstein could have bid 2@D Jack?|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to Susan our operator!  and thanks kibs.  Last hand of the set.  Next one starts after about a 20 minute break (I think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  no, not now for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John  and PLEASE  thank the players for us|pg||
nt|andyv:  great effort by both teams|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d = RKCB|pg||
nt|kit: why wrongsided?  Where would a heart loser go?|pg||
nt|joest: well they invert so to show @ds he would bid 2@h|pg||
nt|joest: but it's not GF so he could have done that|pg||
nt|joest: a lot of it turns on what the respective meanings of double and 2NT would be in his balancing situation|pg||
nt|joest: but it certainly doesn't seem like you should sell.  WE may land in the wrong spot but I would commit an error of commission rather than omission|pg||
nt|passell: yes if 1nt doesnt show a stopper then dbl has to be take out|pg||
nt|granguru: 5@C going down because of the @C distibution|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H might be won|pg||
nt|kit: doubt if 4@H can handle either|pg||
mb|p|an|very slowly|nt|andyv:  Congratulations to the Wolfson team|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks Al and everyone|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT = two without|pg||
nt|granguru: although almost sure to go down also|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: 4@d kickback|pg||
nt|joest: could ask with 5@h now|pg||
nt|kit: Wolfson may think his opponents have found a big fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: Grue doesn't, either?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: which he will -- he needs both kings to bid the grand|pg||
nt|psyck: 5!k would confirm all key cards & trump Q|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d asks about kings generally|pg||
nt|psyck: *5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you right, scheduled restart in 25 minutes from now|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will see you all then :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: break after this hand|pg||
nt|jpes: good night all - it  is late on the east coast|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks to all commentators, Joe Shair, Kit Woolsey, Jim Pestaner, and to all spectaros who are the sole reason for these shows. Thanks|pg||
nt|jcwla: With the whole hand in the minors this is a time I would have started with 1@D leaving @C to be mentioned in some comp auctions.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Cohen says he wants to think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all, back in an hour|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming, spectators, you make it all worthwhile!|pg||
nt|peachy: Expecially thanking you for your comments and other messages|pg||
nt|peachy: during the break, standings will be posted here for both matches http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals|pg||
nt|peachy: Sorry about the internet service problems, let us hope no more of it :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at least one off in trumps and top tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d shows a distributional hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: 5NT = diamond king|pg||
nt|joest: no heart king|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, that was private|pg||
nt|joest: no spade king|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: nicely done|pg||
nt|passell: great deceptive play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wolfson gave it a shot for a swing|pg||
nt|granguru: @CA @HKQ @CK @CJ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: so semi-finals  will be   Diamond v Welland   and  Wolfson v Bathurst|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty John and Al|pg||
nt|jcwla: For those for whom it doesn't, then. :)|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|passell: now plus 140|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|kit: they code naturally with 5NT showing the unbiddable king I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Lall sits up at the ]sight of the 9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: so a nice auctionto close out the set|pg||
nt|peachy: Spectator messages are always appreciated to keep us on the straight and narrow :)|pg||
nt|kit: he will cash 2 hearts, then AKQ of clubs, but he will be out of control.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: probably a quick claim|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to Susan our operator and to everyone for their patience|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c 2 way checkback maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: a @h fin would have enabled defense to get @c ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: I prefer to always have my coding be up the line, as there may be situations where two of the bids don't correspond exctly|pg||
nt|psyck: this shows the advantage of minorwood/kickback for minor fits|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks all & see you shortly in the next set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kit, Jack, CK, Susan and all the specs|pg||
nt|joest: i agre with you but that's not the way they look at it :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Peter!|pg||
nt|passell: thnx all great job by our operator|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C not terrible if clubs 3-2 -- however .....|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|joest: thanks all   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a lot down now|pg||
nt|passell: after J of clubs and Q from wolfson migta been time to abandon|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen's club play order should have suit-preference connotations|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: same other table too, nicely done by both declarers|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Or sometimes -- awake.  Last night we did a segment with 11 partscores...|pg||
nt|kit: why wouldn't Wolfson play queen from Q109?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, that too,|pg||
nt|peachy: Halftime results http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1, top left.  Also, there are daily bulletins on the menu on the left. Enjoy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|passell: like ly 3 down drawing trump and spade shift|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3 down?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty all specs for joining us on what turned out to be the closest match in this round.|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: a pleasure whatever the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson looks at me|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: why don't we check with our partners?, and walter obliges|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: good night everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: semis start tomorrow 10 am PDT / 1700 GMT|pg||
nt|kit: Well maybenot -- kingof spades, and spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he perhaps should have played S for stiff heart|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Cohen can maybe work out Wolfson has jack of spades since Wolfson never pitched a spade|pg||
nt|passell: he might get a late heart trick unless defense perfect|pg||
nt|gulyas: he did|pg||
nt|kit: sorry -- that wolfson pitched only 1 spade|pg||
nt|passell: I think he will get a late heart for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no rush for heart king|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|gulyas: exciting set, ty for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: bye|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: yes this makes|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: we will re-convene after a while:)|pg||
