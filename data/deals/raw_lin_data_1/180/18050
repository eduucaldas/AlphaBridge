mb|1D!|an|Precision|mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  will get to 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|robinswr: diamond and platnick play forcing club so their openings are light|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: lucky club position|pg||
mb|2H|an|4 !hs|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|robinswr: they play support doubles where redouble shows three hearts and 2@h shows four|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, for NS this is a rather normal opening. Hands fit poorly, but the friendly club lie makes up for it.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|chip: I think the raise would almost always show 4 even without the double.|pg||
nt|robinswr: however, a more normal auction would start with a strong 1nt from north|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, but same contract and result I suspect.|pg||
nt|ady: and a sure push|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|robinswr: needs singleton diamond|pg||
nt|robinswr: I bet that in the next 29 boards there will be 60 imps to be picked up . the question is will they and how much will they lose on other boards|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chip: One good thing for the Welland team, is that the systems at each table rather differ: strong club by NS and 2+ club with transfers EW, Fairly standard by both pairs in the other ...|pg||

mc|10|nt|chip: Still, while that can help to overcome a large lead, much better not to be 59 down.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: welcome everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: this is the third of eight 15 board segments in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|royhughes: An exciting board for us to start with|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi folks|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: welland needs to get on track early even with 60 bds to go|pg||
nt|puncher99: looks like routine 4 heart bid|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|royhughes: The 1C can be as short as 2 if balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but what does the bidding mean|pg||
nt|chorush: 30 boards to go and trailing by 59, Welland will have to play well and get some breaks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a routine 4@H contract, anyway|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfh: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi eric|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing 17-18/9|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Geoffrey, Sigurbj√∂rn and Bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D showed @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: 1N presumably shows 17-18 or 17-19 bal   he would bid 1@h with 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but matches are not playing the same boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Hello Andrew, Glen|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South wil presumably splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi Ira|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: ty for the explanation|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2H says 6+ clubs, no side suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: south shows diamonds as well?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: the diamond team had a big second eighth to take a substantial early lead in the match|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2@S is something cunning|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello Peter, Chip and Bill|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or not :)|pg||
nt|chorush: Think his hand is really marginal for a splinter|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: this may well end in 6@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1S was an artificial game force|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3! SHOWS A GOOD FIT I THINKC|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy may be tempted to explore|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: maybe, although I think splinters are designed for marginal hands|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: BUT bidding a grand may be the only danger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: NS I think unclear on what their bids meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is safe enough will make at least 9 maybe 10|pg||
nt|bessi2: with greco passing 1@c, and considering his @s lead I don't think welland as any reason to misguess @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thought 2S was a relay to 2NT to show hearts and longer diamonds, Welland thought it showed hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|roswolf: hmm well i cant see why - they are playing to qualify for the BERMUDA BOWL and this is a very simple sequence|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, you don't want to be in 7 because that rates to need at least a finesse, in addition to setting up a long spade|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he does need more controls for slam than is plausible for a strong NT though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: some use splinters as a way to help place a game contract; others as a slam bdding tool|pg||
pc|dA|nt|royhughes: 6C is easy unless clubs are horrible|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|chip: Diamond picked up 44 the previous set to turn a small deficient into a good lead.|pg||
nt|royhughes: With the Q10 of spades coming down you may make 7|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: the grand is on because of the favorable spade position|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi William|pg||
nt|athene: NS have changed their system recently haven't they?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i thought these guys were a serious partnership|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|chorush: you could contruct xxx AKxx AJx Axx would be plausibile so maybe you are right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: hi bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: the other room playing in 6@C i am told|pg||
nt|royhughes: The grand is indeed on but a red-suit lead would put declarer to an early decision|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|bessi2: aren't ns a relatively new partnership ?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: with the match score in mind i dont think they will bid 7|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer thinks Greco wouldn't underlead a king, he would maybe go up ace and go after the spades, planning to finesse in the other red suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: But the bidding may have shown where the red aces are|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is just the sort of board Welland needs|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they need a few more hours work on their basic system|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: welland may well pick an overtrick imp or 2|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: EW also play light opening bids, 1C is 2+ either balanced (11-13 or 17-19), or has clubs.|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you open 14-16, your 1club can be 11-13 or even 10|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|robinswr: bramley will lead a spade, since he has no idea what his partner has in the minors he could even have 5 diamonds|pg||

nt|chip: note that if the 7 and 3 of spades were switched, the 6 lead would cost a trick.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like coming home|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I dont like 3rd leads   this happens quite frequently|pg||
nt|robinswr: i wonder if wellend should have played a higher club on the second round|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 2nd best was led|pg||
nt|chip: YEs, 6 top tricks now, and EW run out of safe leads quickly. I guess if W gets in and leads a club that might squeeze declarer a little.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|robinswr: they lead attitude against notrump|pg||
nt|chip: 3rd best would be fine here. 2nd is even more likely to blow a trick.|pg||
nt|robinswr: 10872 8 would work|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: just has to play Q@D   |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|chip: I play attitude also, but first priority is to not blow tricks (still the 6 is pretty low, and not actually a trick here, and may help partner judge not to continue spades. They ...|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|chip: Declarer will now build his 7th trick in D's, but is on track to lose an imp or 2 to the other room result. 2/board is what Welland needs.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks in same contract in CR a good return|pg||
nt|chip: E knows his partner likely has QJ of H (that gives him 11 and declarer 15).|pg||
nt|robinswr: unless wellend opened a ten count. (wellend is always willing to do something unusual|pg||

nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but maybe he keeps that for NV|pg||
nt|athene: no harm in heart to ace, spade just to see if the queen falls, is there?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: slamtime|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not as i saw no|pg||
mb|1H|nt|royhughes: No, but maybe he didn't want to make a mistake!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: many good pairs use some method to distinguish types of raises after a t/o double|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pef: 2h there is a sound+ 2s raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you overbid to 4@H with north trying to induce a phantom sacrifice, but at this vulnerability opps aren't likely to bid 4@S unless they expect to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be duck soup|pg||
nt|bessi2: what system are ns playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: either side can easily get too high on this hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1D shows hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: a type of polish club |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 3h is already too high for ns, 3s would be too high for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H or 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunate diamond position so maybe four losers here (spade, heart, two diamonds) but perhaps declarer can endplay east?|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being to just take a diamond finesse at a point when east has no trump to return|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: hmm....in that case sure looks like a 1@d opening to me |pg||
nt|bessi2: but maybe 1@d is limited to less than his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will power to 6nt otherwise they need to swiych to sayc|pg||
nt|roswolf: switch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chorush: Schermer-Chambers tend to open what they consider bad 15's with one of a suit. Greco Hampson play 14-16 so will open 1NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbj√∂rn|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I usually lead a @S from the East hand; I think it really boils down to style rather than evidence |pg||
nt|chorush: the club posistion is very fortunate so he will have no problem making his contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Sigurbjorn|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chorush: Hello Sigurbjorn|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pef: michael rosenberg pointed out that e/w actually can make 3s because of the really fortunate club position|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don;t think my keyboard can do justice to your name, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: √∂|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: a trump is east's only safe lead here|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "always bid 4H - you get 100% sympathy and 0% blame" - i agree|pg||
nt|athene: now west knows his partner is likely to have vulnerable holdings in all the side suits and will think which to play through to get him off the endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok they may keep their system:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: NS just have to avoid panicking and trying to cash diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: no, michael's right (of course)|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure - what about if the defence force dummy with a third round of hearts immediately?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, both minors are sort of "frozen". They can't play diamonds and if they rise A of clubs, declarer gets to pitch his D's|pg||
nt|pef: although two more hearts here makes it difficult|pg||
nt|smoller: I am not so sure of 3@S - look like declarer cant manage 3 times hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the standard defence when you see a threatening side suit in dummy is to force dummy|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, it was a close decision for W with Qx of hearts, but the rest of his hand is good for offense.|pg||
nt|pef: simple looking actually quite complicated|pg||
nt|chip: And 2H was most often a 3 trump raise.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: We shall have to think of it as a NT opening with a stif honor..not quite right, but functional...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|pef: well greco found by far the best continuation|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pef: and so did hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: a club switch would be my choice but i can see the cards|pg||
nt|bessi2: an informed source told me that welland just likes to conceal :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: there sure ain't nothing wrong with that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some questions about how balanced "balanced" has to be|pg||
nt|roswolf: no void perhaps!?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I routinely bid this way with 5-4|pg||
nt|roswolf: routinely OMG|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|athene: ok so best for declarer is trump to ace, club, i guess|pg||
nt|chip: If they tap the dummy, as they are doing, can kill the club suit due to dummy's poor spade spots (not second entry to dummy).|pg||
nt|athene: but he's short of an entry to dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: west prefers red|pg||
nt|athene: west should have won the first trick and played a diamond giving his partner a trump exit|pg||
nt|athene: now east is immediately endplayed in three suits|pg||
nt|royhughes: That would have been a great play|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the suicidial endplay|pg||
nt|royhughes: Ducking is sort of normal|pg||
nt|athene: even on that better defence declarer could have prevailed but it would have been much harder|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but east will not be amused|pg||
nt|athene: it is sort of instinctive to duck the first round from Axx of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was just too hard to see that this was an exceptional circumstance|pg||
nt|royhughes: The best chance here is a club back, I think. |pg||
nt|royhughes: Then declarer could maybe go wrong if he guessed horribly|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer knows east is in trouble|pg||
nt|athene: the longer east pauses here the more obvious he makes it that he has honours in all the suits|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes, @S53 just not doing the job|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: even with 2-2 break|pg||
nt|bessi2: that makes 9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: so on a club return declarer will pitch diamond from dummy on the @CK and just go for diamond ruff|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|pef: well that beats it quickly|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|royhughes: Bill, that was well analyzed -- I've never seen that play before (taking ace at T1)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: defending 1NT is quite hard work - too many possibilities to work through |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|smoller: a bit amazing they can find out to eliminate club tricks this way - very well done|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chorush: will be an overtick imp most likely|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|chip: He did well to pass over 2S, (3D down 1 on a H ruff), though he might have pushed S to 3, particularly if he bid 3D over 1N.|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ady: sorry down 1 in 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|robinswr: if you're going to bid over 1NT best to bid 3@d. 2@d allows them to find their fits more easily|pg||

nt|chorush: think he made 3 but I may have miscounted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: you are correct, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some discussion as to whether 8 or 9 tricks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: instructive defensive problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: another slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 14-16 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1nt 14-16 or just an upgrade?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think they open 1C on 17 and 1D on 11-13|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chip: 1C is 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced.|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H is 8-11 pretty much any hand i think|pg||
nt|pef: greco/hampson play 14-16 nts (sometimes 13, occasionally 0+ in third seat nv :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: some players like overcalling 3@h with this hand, I prefer Hampson's style|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit less secure than the previous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  8-11  not 5 spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: well now south must try for the slam bonus|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pef: so he opened their strong 1c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bessi2: 2@s -100 seems likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: This seems to be Puppet Stayman, asking for 5-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the idea is when responder is so limited it's easy to sort out quickly if it's a game or slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: and of course most positives to a strong club are in this range|pg||
nt|bessi2: to answer why.. I guess I like my preempts to be classic|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: 2@s is makeable though|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, it does|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Bridge is easy, clubs 4-4, so 9 easy tricks in NT, 10 without a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt isnt the most scientific bid and seems to have depressed south into passing - for what it was worth i would have bid 4@C|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S showed hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: One advantage is that West has not disclosed his 4 spades|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has the option of leading the @HJ second time playing north for @H9x|pg||
nt|bessi2: plus there are advantages.. 3@h bid makes it more likely for the opps to find finesses more easily if needed|pg||
nt|bessi2: but the line to make is unlikely.. ace @d AK @h ruff @h  @s to king ruff another @h out with a minor|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The EW auction gives decalarer a big clue...|pg||
nt|bessi2: east could just as easily have a stiff @h as a stiff @s|pg||
nt|chorush: Sigurbjorn is suggesting getting to hand and leading the spade J. Not a normal play, but behind by a lot, who  knows?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|chip: not sure about the followups here. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: all bids got notes but can't read them from here, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: Well, 9 tricks for NS are easy, its holding EW to 4 that requires a bit of luck.|pg||
nt|athene: he won't want to lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|athene: i assume dummy has shown exactly four hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|royhughes: Yes, that's an option created by the trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok, he isn't put to the test there|pg||
nt|royhughes: Bramley may have been thinking partner could have Axx|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: bramley felt his partner might have led from @HAxx but he would not have led from @HQxx, so finessing against dummy couldn't really gain|pg||

nt|roswolf: no automatic transfer to 4@S i am pleased to see - which is the usual occurence with these sequences|pg||

nt|bessi2: this shouldn't take too long|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: i guess you do something in spades|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|athene: yes there should be a trump promotion|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: alerted 2c|pg||
nt|roswolf: the slam made on 78|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: I believe achieving an above average board against them in a club game led to "re-education"|pg||
nt|athene: light-ish 1@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 11-13 is the low range for 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no room for usual 2-suiter scheme over 2@C really as you need 2nt natural, for one thing|pg||
nt|pef: platnick is probably feeling pretty pleased about his 1n making 2 in the closed room since a club or heart lead beats 1nt several|pg||
nt|athene: west probably wouldn't treat his hand as a red 2-suiter even if he had the opportunity, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: playable in spades too|pg||
nt|pef: what would you guys bid with bramley's hand here?|pg||
nt|bessi2: unlucky break for the welland team on board 78|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|royhughes: Bramley showed hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: very light 1@S for second seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont know if it was unlucky roy didnt have to bid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: well that wasn't his best choice|pg||
nt|athene: well he has 11, if you count the @HJ twice|pg||
nt|athene: personally i wouldn't even count it once|pg||
nt|royhughes: Don't blame you|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C shows 5 hearts doesn't it?|pg||
nt|bessi2: of course not.. but slam was an underdog|pg||
nt|athene: or it is just a game-forcing relay|pg||
nt|bessi2: ns clearly play a very sound opening bid style|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and South's pass has probbaly kept EW out of game, paradoxically|pg||
nt|chorush: I will predict Welland-Bramley get to 3NT which happens to amke|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: which serves them good here... considering what might happen if south had opened 1@s, it seemed to me ew would most likely reach 3N|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|smoller: pass looked as a great winner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D obviously hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: which ended up wagging iys tail|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Any EW balancing auction would "overbid" to the cold game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: uts|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: i don't see why he had to bid so fast|pg||
nt|chip: I think Greco will take expection to this.  On the prior deal EW bid 1C (strong) -1D-1N and lost 7 IMPS|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy starting to warp a bit in view of the match score|pg||
nt|royhughes: Presumably this shows a balanced hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: if diamonds are the longest suit, he must be balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: a disciplined 3@H WOULD ALLOW NORTH TO SQUIRM OUT|pg||
nt|athene: i know NS play some odd stuff - maybe 1@S - 2@D is hearts actually|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: if you aren't going to pass, why not 3@C and play 3n if partner hasn't got four spades|pg||
nt|pef: the spots might be good enough for him to survive this|pg||
nt|chip: He wanted to be declarer to avoid a club lead through, and he did get a friendly lead. Still, 3c then 3S was an attractive alternative (and with the KQ of clubs a questionable ...|pg||
nt|chip: value, an invitational 3s is not unreasonable either)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the problem with 3@C is, if partner bids 3@H (as expected), you can't really bid 3@S because that endplays him if he hasn't got four spades (he can't bid 3NT himself)|pg||
nt|pef: I've noticed that a lot of foreign pairs play 2n forcing (by the east hand) in this situation asking for a description of major lengths|pg||
nt|athene: you could just bid 3@C then 3NT over 3@H hoping partner reads that as showing four sapdes|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
nt|athene: even 4@S is too high :) and bramley is thinking about slam|pg||
nt|bessi2: he must be thinking about either 3@s or 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can seriously be thinking about 3@HXX|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: south is going to commit to game|pg||
nt|athene: but has three possible strains in mind - notrumps, hearts, diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: now 3nt likely to play|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood may flow here but whose it is not certain|pg||
nt|bessi2: 3N non serious I imagine looking at his hand|pg||
nt|athene: probably just 4@S-1, flat board|pg||
nt|bessi2: Bramley has to close up shop now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: retransfer to @H|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think 4@h from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is i think a very practical contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: but we meander on|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pef: I think the positioning of the ace of diamonds and the doubleton in the north hand means that 4s is going down even double dummy here|pg||
nt|pef: interestingly in the closed room e/w stopped in 2nt|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: AN ADVENTUROUS WAY TO ACHIEVE A PUSH|pg||
nt|athene: bramley just thinks ok, i only need pd to have some honours in his suits, like @SKQ @DAQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks very dangerous|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: the hands fit well - that @HJ turns out to be worth a good bit after all!|pg||
nt|royhughes: the diamond lead threatens a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: certainly no trump finesse now|pg||
nt|royhughes: stops declarer from picking up the trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: 3NT interesting contract; club lead you can just lead diamonds towards dummy and finesse spades|pg||
nt|athene: try for 1 club, 4 diamonds, 1 heart and 3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: of course much harder on a heart lead but how is that getting found?|pg||
nt|chip: Also, EW seem to only have 9 tricks, though winning the first D not best. NS do need to remove the heart at some point. to beat this.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pef: I think he can pretty much lead anything now and beat this|pg||
nt|athene: i have noticed several times in this event the precision 2@C opener has caused quite a few problems for opps|pg||
nt|athene: quite a limited bid when you play it as 6+ clubs so responder doesn't usually have huge problems with the lost space, but opps do|pg||
nt|chip: If N ruffs this, then needs to lead a heart back.|pg||
nt|pef: while we are waiting, perhaps the vugraph operator can let us know if there was any interesting discussion over the bidding of the previous board?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: There was none...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I showed 5152 with a minimum minimum I didn't like|pg||
nt|chorush: In the other room they will certainly open 1 spade|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: I guess roy's response was routine|pg||
nt|athene: i assume bramley didn't open 1@S because he didn't want to wrongside 3nt (partner likely to respond 1nt)|pg||
nt|athene: so he just hides the fifth spade and treats his hand as strong bal|pg||
nt|pef: I think ruffing here was a mistake.  if he playslow and north ruffs, as chip said, north now has to play a heart back--at least there was a chance of going wrong, now almost none|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: My old eyes just can't read most of the notes.  Maybe I should ask them all to print and in crayon|pg||
nt|chip: Now defense is in better shape as declarer can't take another spade finesse. Probably best to throw a D.|pg||
nt|pef: bramley welland play 1c is either natural or various nt ranges, possibly with 5 card majors.  one of the ranges is 17-19 which is what he had|pg||
nt|athene: oh right |pg||
nt|athene: so systemically he couldn't open it 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: or at least he had the option of 1@C anyway|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, and routine for them to open a club with a 5 card major and a 5-3-3-2 hand if out of their 1N opening range (14-16)|pg||
nt|pef: correct (according to their system notes)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco fans his hand, folds it, puts it down and leans back|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: north might imagine his partner has another club honour and not the @HQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the defence mustnt be too active|pg||
nt|bessi2: The dbl of 3@h made his hand worse.. 4@d was an overbid in my opinion after having shown interest with 3@s.. but knowing the intricacies of their system I can't say for sure|pg||
nt|bessi2: NOT knowing their system i mean to say|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bessi2: ahh.. a spec suggests 4@d forced 4@h... end signal|pg||
nt|athene: right could be|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 4D apparently generally asked about the quality of the hand, and 4H was yuck|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and this will drift down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|athene: ..ok, he finds the heart lead anyway - not much else to do by that point|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that the @C10 might be showing a heart card|pg||
nt|athene: an amusing possibility here is @DJ, ruffed by north, then @HK |pg||
nt|athene: east ruffs and plays @SA and @SJ and north can win but then has to lead into dummy, or north can unblock and let his partner win the last club|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|roswolf: wow a freak|pg||
nt|bessi2: my oh my.. this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: nice flat hand here ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: looked like down 1|pg||
nt|pef: Did I miss something, wasn't that down 1?|pg||
nt|chip: 4S making looks pretty normal.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry, fat fingers, corrected now|pg||
nt|chorush: Here is the kind of hand Welland wants. Good grand. Can they reach it?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|athene: double from north, then 4@C if that's still a splinter for them over a double|pg||
nt|roswolf: where will the music stop on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: Yes, Welland has more spades than usual|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C - 3@C and finish, i guess?|pg||
nt|bessi2: a bidding test for ns here.. can they reach the grand|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bessi2: I like Welland's style here.. although I prefer opening 1@s myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thin double means welland likely to get trumps right|pg||
nt|athene: he will see from the opening lead that north hasn't got @CAK so he really should have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|chip: They also opened 1S in the other room, but didn't double. Question about no 4C splinter, but perhaps that is not on after a double.|pg||
nt|roswolf: may play 3nt rather than 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: many would raise the spades with that hand|pg||
mb|4C!|an|6-4|nt|athene: still, just an overtrick this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C could be bid and let through on the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: THESE GUYS GO FOR THE MAX|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco maybe is treating it as too good for 2@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: is 2@h w2 I wonder... seem to recall a pair playing it 10-13... and he might have decided his hand qualified...|pg||
nt|chorush: As I recollect, they use multi for "bad" weak 2's and their weak 2's are fairly decent|pg||
nt|bessi2: i am told it IS 10-13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Schermer offered to explain but Gitelman declined so I don't know what it is|pg||
nt|chorush: they may have changed; that is what they used to do|pg||
nt|chorush: they need to have a bid here that sets ttumps in a forcing manner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: since this qualifies pretty much for a 1@H opening...|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: misunderstanding over 3@C perhaps?|pg||
nt|pef: looks like guessing the spade will now be a lot more important than an overtrick|pg||
nt|chip: If 3C is a game try, seems like an overbid with all that junk.  5c looks like exclusion, but can't be. Maybe a delayed splinter?|pg||
nt|athene: welland has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart starts to put out 5D card then corrects to 5S|pg||
nt|athene: he should be making whatever his weakest bid is - maybe he thought 3@C showed a minimum here (2nt system on) but bramley thought otherwise|pg||
nt|chip: Looks like they may well get to clubs or a slam.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@H  may proke them into it|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoke|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely double 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: with a trick ineach major|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if south intends his bid as a sort of "non-forcing spade raise"|pg||
nt|athene: north must surely be wondering about that as he has a pretty easy pass otherwise?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 4N KC in @C solves most of Souths problems|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|athene: by "non-forcing raise" i mean it's an offer to play but opener can go back to spades if he really hates hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@S is what i would bid but i am a coward |pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 4@s is a decent spot too|pg||
nt|chorush: except if he thinks N is 6-4 he would have a potential pointed suit loser|pg||
nt|bessi2: maybe 4@d is just that|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 4D WAS rkc for clubs and 5D showed 2 with a void|pg||
nt|bessi2: i think he will bid 7@h now.. just a prediction :)|pg||
mb|5S!|nt|roswolf: roy isnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: oh well|pg||
nt|chorush: If I am correct (and I doubt it) that would ask for the club Q|pg||
nt|bessi2: that would be my guess as well|pg||
mb|6H|nt|chip: Should note that this is a complicated new system for bramley, though 4N makes a lot more sense. Now will presumably guess the spade as noted to win a (scary) IMP|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but this is safe enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson: passed me in exclusion again?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told the other room chose the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|royhughes: I only see 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 8 tricks on top plus extras ruffing|pg||
nt|royhughes: which the defence is out to stop!|pg||
nt|royhughes: this may be complicated|pg||
nt|athene: yes, only one obvious loser but it's all about winners|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer doesn't have 11|pg||
nt|athene: no way to ruff a heart then take a double ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: north has too many trumps for that|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm another illusion of a hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence will have to be careful|pg||
nt|royhughes: How do you plan this?  I think you try to make declarer's hand high, since it has the long heart.  So maybe up queen at T1 and play hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm sure Greco is thinking more deeply than that!|pg||
nt|chorush: if this speculation is correct, I expect 7 clubs from north. If it is not correct that wont happen|pg||
nt|bessi2: I am starting to think 2! isn't 10-13.. if it is.. then south should have bid 7@h over 5@d it seems to me|pg||
mb|7H|nt|athene: ace and another trump and declarer has to decide whether to try to make it (hearts from the top) or cater for 3-0 hearts and duck one|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be -1|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry of course ducking a heart would be cold for 11 tricks, he is only in 5 :)|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if east is going to attack a minor suit, diamonds is the one to go for|pg||
nt|athene: he has too many clubs to hope to set up tricks there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: We'll have to wait for the book to undersatnd this auction...|pg||
nt|chorush: true|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: a spec says he plays QC (he aint led from Jxxxx) and then a heart to the 8|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: many pairs play after 1major - 2nt, 3@C is any min and perhaps welland thought that applied here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pef: claim?|pg||
nt|pef: I think we probably missed a bit of the play :)|pg||
nt|chip: just the trumps.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe we missed the bit where north switched to a trump at trick 3 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: got behind with slow response|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Schermer thought everything after 4C was cuebidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: hopefully Eric can inform us.. I am quite curious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Chambers admitted he had no idea what Schermer had after he showed 6-4, still no explanation for 2H|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|h6|nt|royhughes: a heart finesse is maybe a good idea at t2|pg||
nt|athene: now he'll hope north had @HKJx or @HQJx originally|pg||
nt|royhughes: it loses an entry for the ruffs, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd i think it is always off but the defence needs care|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's difficult because you want to throw a diamond on the 13th spade (which won't be good as the cards lie)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: not sure about that play|pg||
nt|chorush: the right technical line here is interesting. Should clubs be 5-1 he can still make on 4-4 spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|royhughes: But that requires trumps to be drawn|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|h8|nt|royhughes: I didn't see any way for Greco to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: now doomed and a possible game swing for welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: the roof now falls in|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure that was correct though.. heart to K.. what if west had 2@c and 3@h|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|pc|h2|nt|royhughes: down 2, i think|pg||
nt|athene: east can't really have @CAK, @SQ, @HA, @DK (16 count) so diamond back would be the quick way to beat the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably -2 actually|pg||
nt|athene: but this is fine - north can see there is no rush|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: well he loses one more trick; not exactly the roof falling in|pg||
nt|athene: he was always sure to go one down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland apologizes for his play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco-Hampson taking a break|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe fatigue setting in|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|athene: if declarer had better hearts in hand he would just have drawn trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
mc|13|nt|chorush: Notice that had someone shown out on the second club he would still have succeeded with spades 4-4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director call concerning meaning of auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: How was defence damaged?|pg||
nt|chorush: defense could only be damaged if there was a hesitation at some point|pg||
nt|chorush: their opening lead was meaningless|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: apparently Chambers made a comment that he was bidding over anything but 6H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss feels the 6H bid was out of tempo and that 7H was suggested by the BIT over 6H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: a very loud argument w/ lots of yelling, director warning just given|pg||

nt|roswolf: YES|pg||
nt|roswolf: are the players back yet eric|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: yes but director consulting about time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: playing boards out of order so this board will be up in a second|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the previous bd 6@SX-4 was the result welland gaining 11 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: now resuming on correct board|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pef: greco/hampson play both multi and weak 2 bids|pg||
nt|pef: 2h is a sound weak 2 bid by their standards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: After Greco cashed his aces he cont diamonds, roy won spade to dummy finess claim|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt perhaps from north now?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's not the right vulnerability for that sort of bid|pg||
nt|athene: double would work out very nicely but i think many would do that at imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks natural but roy may try something tactical|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco will be looking at a pretty good hand and nowhere obvious to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: welland will surely make a bid showing his Majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry i *don't* think many would do that at imps :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: south should pass and leave the dice to fall where they will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: for specs, BIT = break in temp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: tempo|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: platnik did quite a lot of bidding in the other room? did diamond ever promise any values?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't blame Hampson for pulling, clarifying his hand type|pg||
nt|roswolf: now blood may flow|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: maybe decent 18 count is worth a go at game when partner has four spades|pg||
nt|athene: welland  playing his partner for nothing|pg||
nt|athene: 800 is there for the taking|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandbagging!?|pg||
nt|athene: (heart lead, south gets in with the @HK and leads a spade to get a ruff there)|pg||
nt|roswolf: greco hasnt passed yet and nor has south|pg||
nt|royhughes: I would expect Greco to pass -- he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|athene: well greco can choose which way round to put his pass card but i don't see that he has any other room to exercise judgement|pg||
nt|royhughes: I agree, but he must be thinking about something|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: often a minor overcall over a weak-2 shows both minors|pg||
nt|athene: because otherwise you would double or bid notrumps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: so greco might be thinking that his partner could have clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't pull to 4@C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: bramley doesn't double again because he just doesn't want to hear 4@D from partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes roy i think chickened out|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: of course he wouldn't have been ecstatic to hear 2nt lebensohl then 3@D after the first double, but it's a bit more manageable a level lower i guess|pg||
nt|bessi2: a heart to the 10 would be a clever move|pg||
nt|bessi2: and as a spec suggests.. @c to the 9 might be even better|pg||
nt|bessi2: or J|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|smoller: Seems best not to lead the singleton club|pg||
nt|chip: A bit surprised S raised with weak hearts and a soft hand, but guess he didn't want to defend 2S and hoped to make it harder (which it did)|pg||
nt|chip: Good decision by Welland to bid 4S, would not be so great if partner were 3-1-3-6.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy gets the screen closed again and asks Jeff something, Jeff reading roys note and writing a response|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: another question from roy and a response|pg||
nt|pef: making 5 in the closed room was pretty impressive|pg||
nt|chip: perhaps after a stiff club lead?|pg||

nt|chip: I disagree, he seems well short of a bid. His hand is better suited to pass, planning to bid 3S over the DBL. Look how strong his partner is and 4S isn't cold.|pg||
nt|pef: n/s is making the call|pg||
nt|athene: one thing worth a mention about the general tactics here - the more active and aggressive your opps, the more you have to really know when your partner's bids promise things and ...|pg||
nt|athene: how much they promise|pg||
nt|roswolf: another action hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hang on to your hats|pg||
nt|athene: because you will often face these "should i believe opps or partner?" situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: regarding that 7@h hand.. how do you guys feel about south's comment about bidding over 6@h.. I think such comments are a good thing.. others disagree|pg||
nt|chorush: This ooks like a flat 4S |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: fit jump would be useful here|pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe -- the South hand isn't a classic for it|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should buy the contract because of the @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director question about tempo on previous hand, both before about double and pass over 4D|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM INTERESTING|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wondered if NS felt they might have doubled 4@D if the pass was quicker|pg||
nt|athene: north will not stop bidding over 4@S if his partner has shown some sort of good heart raise|pg||
nt|athene: he has the sixth heart AND the spade void|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW have a chance to beat 5H on a diamond ruff, I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think he they should have axed anyway so arguably no damage|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's hard to stop to double 4@S on the NS cards|pg||
nt|athene: a lot might depend here on whether south can show specifically a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: well evereyone has stopped it seems|pg||
nt|athene: or just some "good raise"|pg||
nt|athene: facing the former, north might not go to the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: facing the latter he surely will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director looking at previous hand to see if tempo influenced Hampson's pull of the X to 4D|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, 2@D is normally a 3-card raise i assume|pg||
nt|athene: now north might bid 3@S trying to show his hand and get his partner involved over 4@S|pg||
nt|royhughes: Who is screenmate with whom here?  And Hampson tell who was taking time?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson and Bramley are screenmates|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well see a tactical(ie pyschic) bid|pg||
nt|athene: a bid of 4minor from north should be much more concentration in that minor - north doesn't want to emphasize either minor, he just wants to say "i have a 6th heart and a spade ...|pg||
nt|athene: void"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, the comment appears to have created a problem for him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: South said he was bidding over anything BUT 6H, that seemed to be the source of the argument|pg||
nt|bessi2: ahh  sry.. i misread it.. |pg||
nt|chorush: I think it is a good thing with screens. Sometimes you are always going to bid a slam but you are testing the water for a grand. It is a good idea to tell your screenmate this lest ...|pg||
nt|chorush: your partner sign off at five level slowly|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pef: did they put the board aside?|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, but N or S? anyway next hand|pg||
nt|pef: according to the vugraph operation, Geoff Hampson called the td|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Director took the board...|pg||
nt|chip: As I noted earlier, 4s would not be a winning action if partner had long clubs and only 3S. Slow 4C might suggest that, but really in this auction doesn't point to anything much ...|pg||
nt|chip: specific (and could be N who was thinking)|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt looks ok over 1@S?|pg||
nt|royhughes: It wasn't clear to me who was taking time after 3@d on the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: ok, not sure 3@D will get the job done|pg||
nt|roswolf: slowly slowly catchee monkey thinks north|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't know welland's plan for future rounds of bidding here|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: Yes Chip. N could be thinking, bur hardly possible|pg||
nt|pef: north balanced with 1nt in the closed room and bought it there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry about spelling of Geoff|pg||
nt|royhughes: He's starting by just showing his 2nd suit (2D was artificial)|pg||
nt|athene: well yes but 2@D was a heart raise i assume|pg||
nt|royhughes: Right|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the last bd welland gained 2 imps - for the moment|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: maybe he just felt he was a bit short of tricks for 1nt vulnerable|pg||
nt|chip: Started same way in the other room, and N balanced with 1N as here, buying it.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Everyone's bidding the other side's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if partner has a dead minimum you could lose quite a lot of hundreds|pg||
nt|pef: not buying it here, though|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks reasonable to me|pg||
nt|pef: me too, will hampson now enter the fray?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, quite reasonable, and likely successful.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: South asks west a question|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like 3@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: snickering from both Welland and Greco|pg||
nt|athene: right now everyone knows (or thinks he knows) it's a double fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the auction has created the fog of war|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: wow this will be won by who has enough bottle|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes, it's a double fit but with losers in the long suits|pg||
nt|athene: bramley might have been better off to jump, but he probably thinks there is good chances 6@D or even 7@D is on|pg||
nt|athene: just give partner @HA, @DAK and there you are|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this will win about 6 imps for welland|pg||
nt|pef: assuming he guesses spades--pretty shocking if he doesn't on this auciton|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: he needs them badly|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, Bramley has an awfully good offensive hand for the auction -- really impossible to double 4S|pg||
nt|royhughes: It will also be hard to find the diamond ruff, if NS play 5H|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will have the final decision|pg||
nt|royhughes: 5@D is better as the EW cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not so sure about that|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought east already has his @D10 lined up against a heart contract|pg||
nt|bessi2: ns clearly don't play gazilli or sth akin to that convention|pg||
nt|bessi2: I shudder at the thought of bidding 3@c with a hand like this|pg||
nt|chorush: But if Chambers said what he said then he effectively convicted himself if there was a BIT|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|royhughes: Oh, right, I had the wrong player on lead.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|royhughes: I thought Welland might have completed his description by doubling 4C|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm now south needs to judge|pg||
nt|royhughes: That might have slowed his partner down|pg||
nt|bessi2: this should make easily enough.. fetch one @d ruff in dummy for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|athene: if the defence begin with three rounds of hearts, declarer will throw the @CQ?|pg||
nt|smoller: no spades guess if they set up his heartsuit|pg||

nt|pef: looks like the director ruled that 4s making 4 was ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: No ruled yet, but until it i changed I was told to put it in|pg||
nt|chip: Still a long way to go in this match. I have seen leads twice this large lost.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, certainly you don't lead the singleton with an ace in your hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: n/s lucky to get a push|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|bessi2: a spec asks if ew have formally protested 7@h.. seems to me like they have|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: yes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tejjyid: presumably the director has ruled or will rule & there will be an appeal later|pg||
nt|chorush: The procedure is that the director will make a ruling, if he has not already. At that point, either side can (and probably will) appeal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director ruled that 7H stood|pg||
nt|chorush: One would hope that if there is an appeal, it will occur after the 7th segment, although in the past they have often decided to wait and see if a score change would affect the ...|pg||
nt|chorush: match. I hate that.|pg||
nt|bessi2: the losing side of the ruling can reserve their right to appeal if the result matters.. or am I mistaken ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry, my misunderstanding, no ruling as of yet|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: usually on BIT the director likes to consult a bit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|chorush: The directorial staff will rule first.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right of appeal is enshrined in regulations, I don;t think anyone has to reserve it|pg||

nt|bessi2: often much longer,  if, for example, it is uncertain who was thinking,  if i am not mistaken|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director inquiring about meaning of the auction of the 7H hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2H is 10-13 promising 6, 2NT inquiry|pg||
nt|chorush: If the auction was cue-bidding after 4 diamonds I don't understand 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|bessi2: in that case I think 7@h should be allowed|pg||
nt|drewsky: correct, but even if it was certain who was thinking, there is NO infraction if 15 seconds or less.|pg||

nt|royhughes: 1D shows hearts -- I wonder what is happening|pg||
nt|athene: ok, welland forgot the system or is slightly psyching again?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N/S said the entire auction was slow; E/W felt that 6H was considerably slower than the previous bids|pg||
nt|drewsky: The final ruling will be based on how long the hesitation was...if under 15 seconds, 7@H will stand, and if over 15 seconds, then it will be changed to 6@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: it felt like that to me as well... I expected a director call|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: definitely going against the field to pass that north hand|pg||
nt|pef: in the closed room schermer did not open the bidding as north.  schermer/chambers must be about the only pair in this event who wouldn't open the north hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't like that overcall very much I must say|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy is in wild man mode|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the hippy table - put some flowers in your hair and ignore conventional behaviour|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: psychic probably|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't know what system options are for North|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@D shows hearts, that explains why greco isn't attempting to show a major 2-suiter :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: so they missed a game that looks like it will probably make despite the bad club break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: hamp witing note for Welland|pg||
nt|chip: For Greco this is a good opening bid. Would certainly open if spade Q were the J, and probably if it were the 10.|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl shows 3@H?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS IS A MURKY AUCTION|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2NT a spade raise, like previous board|pg||
nt|athene: east has a pretty good hand for a passed hand, in a way|pg||
nt|roswolf: UNCLEAR|pg||
nt|royhughes: I suspect 2N says there may be game|pg||
nt|athene: but then again in another way he has a pretty bad hand :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, East has a good hand for having passed, but maybe a bad one for having bid a vulnerable spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes being talked out of game is a hideous sin|pg||
nt|athene: he will expect his partner to have a singleton heart but that isn't marvellous|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's ok as at least hearts aren't getting overruffed, as north has 4 (ha, ha)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Game is borderline: spades come and hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|royhughes: Are you allowed to psyche an artificial bid in this event?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: both east and west know north may be at it |pg||
nt|athene: but you don't really want to have to try to ruff 3 hearts in the west hand|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is the one with the big spades|pg||
nt|chorush: To be clear Drew, that is the director's ruling, not the ruling of a potential appeals committee|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pef: even for roy I find it hard to believe the 3n call|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, by anyone.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N & S both writing notes for opps|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chip: Perhaps 3D was ART, asking.|pg||
nt|chip: Seems odd for Hampson to choose hearts, and looks like this can be beater by either tapping the dummy twice, or leading trumps.|pg||
nt|pef: 4h can be beaten fairly easily by forcing dummy to ruff a diamond.  but somewehre in the auciton hampson may have shown spade support|pg||
nt|pef: aren't we starting to run into time problems here?|pg||
nt|chip: yes|pg||
nt|pef: what's the time limit?  2 hours and 10 minutes or something like that?|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, 2:27 in the morning here :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: i agree with all specs who say the sequence is nizarre/strange/funny - it is awful by aspiring world champions|pg||
nt|roswolf: bizarre|pg||
nt|roswolf: but then who am i to quarrell|pg||
nt|bessi2: hampson's intention may be to bid 6@d if his pd bids 5@c maybe ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: 6@c i mean|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they are the current WC'S but aspire to be the next ones|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: 1@H natural and forcing 1 round, maybe be only 4 hearts with a long suit, i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: *with a longer suit|pg||

nt|drewsky: Ira, welland-bramley do not play a strong club|pg||
nt|chorush: Let me amend that. they do play that a one club opening followed by 1NT is 18 or so|pg||
pc|c6|nt|royhughes: Nice club spots for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: another welland 3 imp pickup on 71 2@S-2 in the other room|pg||
nt|drewsky: Mr. Shermer has seen Mr. Moss's 1@C openers before :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: nice lead by Schermer|pg||
nt|bessi2: the best lead in fact.. when in with a @h he can play another club freezing the 3rd club trick  unless he wants to cash it and free north's remaining @c|pg||
nt|chorush: they have a good chance to beat this. Declarer is likely to win the club K in hand to play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|bessi2: welll.. not quite accurate on my part.. moss can lead low @h towards the 10 twice, forcing an entry|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|roswolf: they have the momentum|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|drewsky: Although the scorebaord shows Daimond up by 24 IMPS, the actual margin is really 35 as the director ruled 7@H back to 6@H|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|royhughes: Tricky 3N to play on a diamond lead I think.  I think I win the king and run a club spot|pg||
nt|athene: i win in dummy and bash out @SKAx|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bessi2: if he does that... lead low @h twice towards the 10 he will always makes.. 2 @h 3@c 2@s and then throw south in with a @s or @d|pg||
nt|bessi2: sry.. correction.. he will have to play !Jack on the second round of the suit|pg||

pc|cA|nt|bessi2: interesting play problem in the other room in 1N.. north overcalled 1@h and then rattled off 5@c tricks.. should Welland go for the make playing north with A@s and singleton @d or ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: try to reduce the number of -100|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: everyone approves of Fred's bidding|pg||

nt|royhughes: I meant clubs are 75% if you have enough entries, and you may be one short|pg||
nt|roswolf: that bidding was routine|pg||
nt|athene: it's good to overcall very aggressively over a precision-style 1@D because it's tactically vulnerable to intervention|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pef: that's a lot of passing with a near solid 7 card suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like his opening I must say|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|chorush: Schermer can now see how to beat this|pg||
nt|chorush: and the Welland-Bramley 1C followed by 1NT will gain imps again.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|royhughes: Hampson had to consider partner having Jx in trump|pg||
nt|athene: must lose three diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|athene: even if you managed to get some sort of elimination position, west can just stick up the @DJ so you are totally doomed|pg||
nt|athene: no way you can duck a diamond to east and endplay him|pg||
nt|athene: and you are short of about half-a dozen entries to strip the rounded suits anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west have to be awake when declarer plays a diamond off the board|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't see any way either.  And Hampson can rise with the jack if you get close|pg||
nt|royhughes: But Welland will give it a try, I'm sure|pg||
nt|athene: he'll use an entry to run the @CQ i guess - the king might be onside after all|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: welland trying a swindle|pg||
nt|royhughes: This looks dangerous to me -- might he not run into a diamond ruff on a hand that was makeable?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but roy is well versed in judging the table vibes|pg||
nt|royhughes: and I'm not sure -- maybe it's fairly safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially he puts max pressure on opps when others dont|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|royhughes: If East could put up a doubleton honor, take a ruff and exit in hearts, that would be one down if he had the club king|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bessi2: @h2 presumably shows @d interest|pg||
nt|drewsky: The defense has to 'strip squeeze declarer to beat it 2 tricks|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|athene: you get extra style points for ruffing a winner to achieve some strategic end|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is bridge jim but not as we know it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bessi2: pd will seldom have a solid 21 count there|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: if welland knew 4@H would end the auction he might well have preferred that|pg||
nt|roswolf: last board coming up|pg||
nt|bessi2: ah now.. my eyes are deceiving me again.. @d not running|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|royhughes: Maybe a safer line is just to play hearts, willing to lose 3 trumps and a spade|pg||
nt|athene: he's going to try to ruff a spade in dummy|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2C is cold this way|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pef: making 4 is pretty impressive|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|royhughes: and will make 3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: your analysis is as optimistic as your overcalling :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chorush: still going to make it|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chorush: maybe not|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chorush: I would have expected him to lead second spade and riff out spades; if they didnt break then squeeze|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: on the movie  the 6@H hand is showing a push|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: Welland gained 5 imps on 102  |pg||
nt|chip: yes, so 11 back to Diamond for the 7H hand, and 5 to Welland for making 1N with QJxx of D's.|pg||
nt|chip: making the margin 30.|pg||
nt|robinswr: if it is 90% clear to bid 7@h based on the auction then the committee will allow it|pg||

mc|8|nt|ady: in the CR  there was a 2@H opening  followed by 4@C showing 6-5    surely all responder had to do was rkc  and then  and then 5NT to ask about K@C?|pg||
nt|chip: not 100% they showed 6-5. also, the auction was a bit confused after the 4C bid.|pg||
nt|ady: yes   4@D   and then 6@D by opener wirh 2 small|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D   sorry|pg||
nt|robinswr: a good rule is that you can't start the 8th quarter intil the 7th quarter is completed|pg||
nt|ady: thats the completion of our set  so thx all|pg||
nt|robinswr: 27 or 16 is not that big of a lead|pg||
nt|ady: Welland in with a chance|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I have been told that there will be an appeal about board 96 (where the director rolled 7@H back to 6); the committee is being formed and will hear from the players before we start ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: the final segment. The director will come and tell the players the result of the appeal as soon as he knows it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: In the other match, Wolfson has withdrawn|pg||

nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Roy and Bill for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: welland definitely still in the match|pg||
nt|royhughes: And thank you, Geoffrey -- this was a fun segment|pg||
nt|athene: plenty of time yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 15 mins approx|pg||
nt|athene: but he was scared his partner was not going to stop over 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley: if you raise we're in slam|pg||
nt|chorush: srry I am half asleep|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: so with one board to go we're down to 27 imp difference with 76 boards to go|pg||
nt|pef: the match will resume very soon--in theory at 6:15, but maybe there will be a slightly longer break than that|pg||
nt|pef: thanks to the earlier commentators, chip martel, bill frisby, roland wald and others|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: thx to eric and all my fellow commentators and the specs who i trust have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|bessi2: he made an action bid and was trying to rescue himself.. sure.. no one has ever done that before|pg||
nt|bessi2: my oh my... not the best play by Welland to go down in 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now roy might pass this|pg||
nt|roswolf: but some specs vote against|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|athene: tactical (and somewhat odd) 1nt from welland|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: most have some sort of bid for that north hand, like 3@S, say |pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect his pard makes all appropriate allowances|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I don't think it was alerted as forcing unless I missed it|pg||
nt|athene: well if 4@D is a cue it's an overbid|pg||
nt|royhughes: If Welland is cuebidding up the line, he has denied a club control :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now roy will lurch in-perhaps not|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pef: possibly 1s denied as many as 4 spades there|pg||
nt|royhughes: something is rotten|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: after bd 73 welland leading the set 27-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is excessive althiugh the club hole has been highlighted |pg||
nt|roswolf: well diamond has had much the best of this set|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a 60 imp lead is unlikely to be pulled back|pg||
nt|passell: both matches  |pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: Welland's operations will have to more successful if they wish to mount a comeback the last 30 boards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all for now|pg||
nt|bessi2: thx all.. been a pleasure|pg||
nt|darrene:  Cheers guys|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: will leave this room open until other room finishes|pg||
nt|bessi2: at first glance it seems like this will be a flat board|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|robinswr: lead five-card suit. if you don't have one then lead partner's five-card suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: 8 tricks.. I can't see a 9th anywhere|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: yes, west should be able to find the club lead, i think|pg||
nt|athene: on this auction|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS are fortunate hearts break|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pef: so a normal pretty dull contract to end this set|pg||
nt|pef: the heart overcall may gain declarer a trick, actually|pg||
nt|pef: unless greco leads a diamond instead of his partner's suit|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec ducks a diamond and def cash 3 hearts south gets squeezed in blacks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: WEst also |pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: yep, hard not to lead partners vul. overcall suit when you have 3 of them|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pef: very quick claim because they are a couple minutes over the time limit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: In the other match, Wolfson has withdrawn, so tomorrow's final will be Bathurst against the winner of this match. |pg||
nt|chorush: A lot of specs are asking about a potential appeal. A quick recap. NS bid to 7H on board 96 but the director found that !) there had beeen a hesitation before 6H was bid and 2) ...|pg||
nt|chorush: that the hesitation might have influenced South to bid 7H. 7H made but the result was retrned to 6H makeing 7. The board will probably be appealed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: The ruling is being appealed. It will be heard as soon as this table has finished play. We will start play in the final segment after the committee has heard from the players and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the director will tell the players the result of the appeal as soon as it is decided|pg||
nt|robinswr: too important points don't huddle and then sign off. If you're going to bid 7 bid 7 right away|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: if you keep on stopping in 5 of a major, eventually fate will get tired and rebuke you|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think West plays a diamond hoping for the ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 74 east is playing in 1@H|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bessi2: Schermer better not play his pd for J109xx in @h|pg||
nt|robinswr: he now has an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|robinswr: entry to his hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: weak hand with diamond entry is playing it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|royhughes: because it could go away if declarer is 5512|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|henryb:  interesting problem because if declarer had @cK he would have 9 trucks unless the defense already has 5|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bessi2: gitelman could just as easily have 2335 as his actual shape.. but then perhaps his play so far is suspect|pg||
nt|robinswr: must play a spade now|pg||
nt|bessi2: still.. they must not cash their hearts|pg||
nt|bessi2: that's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|bessi2: tricky hand for the defenders|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s3|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bessi2: north can play @s now or ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead signals where the jack of hearts lead is either top of three or four + to the QJxx|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chorush: good play|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he can make it|pg||
nt|bessi2: ahh.. strip squeeze if @s now.. informed to me |pg||
pc|c6|nt|chorush: but stil makes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  but another way to give 9th trick|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|royhughes: Thanks again, everyone -- see you later|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: see you all in a few|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|barnets: could not beat it after the third heart|pg||
nt|robinswr: thats what i play the jack of hearts lead is|pg||
nt|bessi2: nicely done by gitelman|pg||
mc|9|nt|henryb:  Chamber's @dJ play gave contract|pg||
nt|barnets: unless return diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: only play|pg||
nt|bessi2: creating a little daylight before last segment|pg||
