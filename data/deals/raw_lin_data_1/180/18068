nt|joest: welcome to the last set of the trials where Team Diamond needs a fantastic comeback |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time for sure :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Which did you want first, the auction or the names/|pg||
nt|barnets: 4 losers in 4@S|pg||
nt|joest: this is fine :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so this couldbe a great result n/s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: When I saw that the hand I had in wasn't right, I said "the hand doesn't match the auction" and Hampson said something like "that isn't surprising" :)|pg||
nt|joest: i see three barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|joest: sorry a heart already led|pg||
nt|joest: sorry about that|pg||
nt|joest: yeah the penalty pass is certainly the down 81 bid|pg||
nt|barnets: and so the normal result was 4@S down 1 in the open|pg||
nt|joest: declarer looks to have 5 tricks coming|pg||
nt|barnets: this could be fun to watch|pg||
nt|joest: win 12 out of the gate will at least retain some kibitzers! :)|pg||
nt|joest: i think when they went for 1000 redoubled last set a lot of fans headed to the exits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I haven't been able to follow the play - I know that Greco led a trump and Lall won the first two tricks and the defense the third and declarer 4th and then played a cloub to the t ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: and J and Hampson led a high spade and a low spade and Lall ruffed with @h A and played a @d|pg||

mb|1C|an|str|nt|joest: one huge problem: to pick up 81, you have to be dealt 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: hi henry join the fun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to the camp|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: 2@d = one major|pg||
nt|joest: you couldn't tell that by looking at north's handcould you?|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h was pass or correct|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson: "I do have some support ... you said 2@d was weak, didn't you?" lots of laughter (both were clear that 2@d was 1 Major|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: if they had somehow made 4@s in the closed room this result might have made a big difference|pg||
nt|joest: btw for those looking for even a rough resemblance between bids taken and hands held this set: you are in for a disappointment|pg||
nt|henryb:  at least by N-S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, that's why I checked Greco's hand on the first board when I had the wrong hands, even though the bidding looked bizarre :)|pg||
nt|joest: yes.  sorry that's what I meant henry|pg||
nt|joest: Lall's final pass also explained by +81.  Does not want to go for a   and a nonvul game swing is only 6|pg||
nt|joest: at least that's my guess|pg||
nt|joest: plus what could he do/|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: so   buckle up, wear a helmet  and probably shouldn't let children watch|pg||

nt|joest: yeah|pg||
nt|barnets: with south holding 4 trumps|pg||
nt|joest: particularly if it has taken you, Barnet, this long to analyze it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't @SJ  down 3?|pg||

nt|iceking: are we sure they were playing 2nt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Grue and Lall won again in 2006|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW play precision; NS 2/1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: checking to see if 4M makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  re|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: no, 250 people yawning "get ON with it"|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision 1@d|pg||
nt|pef: I'm trying to find out|pg||
nt|puncher99: ew looking for swing  hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 9 trix|pg||
nt|andyv:  first half of this day has gone very well for the Bathurst team|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mikam1: EW system notes say 2/1 GF, so I think 3N was the contract|pg||
nt|pef: that was my guess also|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will Diamond compete here?|pg||
nt|iceking: will north gamble on 3nt here |pg||
nt|iceking: can he compete isnt 3@H forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Contract is corrected on B61|pg||
nt|mikam1: Problem is...his bid may be forcing (or at least invitational)|pg||
nt|psyck: System summary said Precision for EW & 2/1 for NS|pg||
nt|mikam1: Thanks Eric|pg||
nt|psyck: Standard carding for both|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=(10)11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, Marshall, they weren't yawning until you suggested it|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW are playing a strong @C with 2+ @D suits, 14-16 NT I think.|pg||
nt|iceking: cant play 3@H invitation here i think|pg||
nt|psyck: 14-16 NT here|pg||
nt|mikam1: So 13 imps to Diamond...what the doctor ordered so to speak|pg||
nt|iceking: N will bid 3nt i think|pg||
nt|pef: e/w can make 4h, but doesn't seem likely they will get there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|pef: I think north will pass|pg||
nt|iceking: and wrong again|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks destined for 3nt|pg||
nt|iceking: Greco maybe 2 strong for 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: might just instead jump to 3nt now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  NS Platnick-Diamond also playing Big Club   Wooldridge-Hurd play jazzed up 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: he will think about it for sometime|pg||
nt|cherilou: X and bidding your suit shows this hand to me--about 8 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so 2/1 & not prec for NS then with this pair|pg||
nt|iceking: almost can play 3nt vs zero hcp|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceking: he doesnt need much xx xx xx aqtxxxx and game good chance|pg||
nt|pef: so this should reverse the gain of the first board as e/w are in 4h in the closed room (or so I am told)|pg||
nt|mikam1: EW can make 4@H, so good bid by South...stole the pot|pg||
nt|iceking: or x xxx xx aqtxxxx even better|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: as it is this will work also |pg||
nt|iceking: but i dont really like this bid|pg||
nt|cherilou: he took a position and will make the contact|pg||
nt|roswolf: i always say thinking a lot leads too often to mistakes -imo this deserves to be a disaster|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
nt|cherilou: The players on both teams are former juniors---speaks so well of the future of bridge in US|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you want system cards, EW http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=761&pid=813|pg||
nt|cherilou: All ther players|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=809&pid=608|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Diamond will try ...2@C....new minor forcing   a form of checkback|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  speaks well of bridge in general|pg||
nt|pelu: do u se the defense against 4@S? very nice in OR: 3x @c, in on @SK and the 4. C set up @SJ|pg||
nt|daman: yes      but a routine defense|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes look for 4-3 @s fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E thought he was safe bidding 3N belatedly, since he hadnt bid it earlier. but that is not clear at all, as pass by W demonstrated|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  and their 2@d opener is short @ds and 11-15|pg||
nt|henryb:  The movement to play transfers after overcalls has not yet reached the States|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other room   1@D(precision)-X-P-3@C//P-3@H-P-3N//all pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he lands on his feey|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: feet|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's slowly getting here, Henry...another 20 years:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: soloway was proselytizing for it decades ago|pg||
nt|wstuart: The 14-16 NT is very popular in the strong @C community these days.  Getting the balanced 16 HCP hands out of 1@C made a lot of difference to the Precision players.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes 2@h or 3N look better options|pg||
nt|iceking: he is just 2 good for 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: And Hurd-Woolridge did just that in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad says who would actually play me to open longer minor!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wstuart: Note that though the very popular Precision system is just starting to come around to this idea, I believe it first started with Shenkin's @C system in the 1960s and was also part ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: of the Orange @C used by Hamman in Wolff on the Aces teams.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for W to duck @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D to jackis likely|pg||
nt|puncher99: welcome to all the spectators commentators and operator|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Glenn|pg||
nt|puncher99: hi|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: maybe but 4@H would be worthy of HH himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Wooldridge shows   response to DBL wasn't clearcut  either   2@C vs 3@C|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i overcall with upto bad 18 , so my x & bids are strong, & still this looks too strong for 2@h here|pg||
nt|iceking: yes Hampson must have been close to 3@C bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: but world champs tend to be right more often than not|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see all lines make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course 2@H rebid insufficient --  take away Hampson @CKJ and still game|pg||
nt|psyck: Maybe more likely to bid 3@c against a prec pair like other roon than a 2/1 pair this room, due to the @d holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|iceking: decl afraid @D are 5-1  |pg||
nt|iceking: he has no entry home if he playes 3rounds of @S|pg||
nt|pef: likely to make 4 odd here, so should be an 11 imp gain back to bathurst|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: on this level - yes - but still nice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Thanks pard|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mikam1: Those imps are going right back|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  curious|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told 2@C artificially shows all invites|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do most play that 2@d denies 4@H and 3@s?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East has both|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mikam1: or most of them :)|pg||
nt|daman: I think the defense can only manage 5 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4  [since 1@H denied 5+]|pg||
nt|pef: they corrected the first board, diamond was indeed in 3nt|pg||
nt|mikam1: So this segment off with a bang|pg||
nt|pef: specs are wondering if 4h could have been beaten by repeated trump leads|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to play transfers here over 3@C then with weak hand you can compete|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What did they really play on 61, 2 or 3NT?|pg||
nt|iceking: 3nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss asks NT range told 15-17|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: NS 1N opener is always 14-16|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hearts not much to crow about, but E angling for W to bid 3N, as spade holding may be tenuous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@S=waiting, not natural|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D was a relay|pg||
nt|puncher99: looks flat for 420 unless spade finn|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: Rusinow leads probably|pg||
nt|jade: and that way its not his fault |pg||
nt|pelu: can u see the winning line? after 3x@C play 3x@D and discard a @C - @H to King and a small @S from dummy|pg||
nt|cherilou: should be 6 imps to Diamond who need 50 more|pg||
nt|royhughes: hi everyone|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: S playing W for 2452|pg||
nt|mikam1: agreed Magnus|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must be my eyes then. I am sure I saw 2NT at some point|pg||
nt|daman: they have their rally caps on|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred sits up|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  j@c must as for @h switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Lall returning his lowest spade, so if his partner has 5 he will know they run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grue-lall  rusinow vs nt & suit    greco-hampson rusinow vs nt     |pg||
nt|marlowepi: also the 7 cant be a power spot|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson can also see it is lowest spade, and if spades 4-4 it can't hurt him to put up the queen|pg||
nt|kit: that is what Hampson is thinking about -- does he trust the 3 of spades?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: fingering the 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: in the air|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: ballllk|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred says hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge had pulled the 4  back into his hand before deciding to play it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  opening style must be very aggressive for West to stop out of vulnerable game facing an opening bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|iceking: this will be a push 450 coming up in few sec|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is meaningless here  but  i just noticed on their system summary form|pg||
nt|jade: Q@S = 9, low @S = 10 or 11|pg||
nt|pef: yes, operator was trying to catch up and later corrected it, roland|pg||
nt|mikam1: So many sequences where transfers give you just a little extra room that's needed|pg||
nt|iceking: i play transfers after 3@C dbl p but i see its probably good here also|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks|pg||
nt|iceking: so something to think about |pg||
nt|mikam1: I actually play them on this sequence|pg||
nt|mikam1: But not so many others|pg||
nt|iceking: yes seems very right when i think about it |pg||
pc|cK|nt|jade: though pitching a @H costs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hurd playing 5@C East|pg||
nt|kit: Grue doesn't know the overall position, and from his point of view a club is safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but the real question i show can it help|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is how|pg||
nt|mikam1: here it feels "free"...although you lose your natural 3@D bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: it m,ay seem as if E overbid with 3H, but he was hoping for a plausible magic hand opposite, such as:  KTx   AT   Txxx   Kxxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred leans back in his chair|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: now leans into the table and studies|pg||
nt|puncher99: good declarer play giving opps chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: fingering his played cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: now fans his hand out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: and puts in back on the table and rests his elbow on the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad looks quizzical|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: wooldridge staring hard at the dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: hurd \just doesnt care :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  regarding systems:  both play 5 card majors (unless they switch seats again)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad now staring into space wondering whats going on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: now focused back on the table while Fred continues to think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: W knows hearts likely to block|pg||
nt|wstuart: @D is betting that they can't run 5 @H tricks or that S wasn't winning the @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from most holdings that dont block, N would have led one|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now he has to guess - what kind of @H blockage is most likely.|pg||
nt|iceking: specially after 3@C you have alot of room|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Note that a heart was discarded from dummy to try to talk opponents out of a diamond shift|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: precision    they open all 11 pointers|pg||
nt|daman: sorta endplayed now|pg||
nt|pelu: and on this layout u cant defeat 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|robinswr: this is why you bid 3@c over 1nt and don't make a one-suited bid |pg||
nt|iceking: same after 2@C prec opening dbl pass you can play transfer only takes away the 2@D respond|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, on 3@c you can bid xfr with inv + hand, on others, more gf hands|pg||
nt|mikam1: If one can remember everything...you can play 3@S shows diamonds (but obviously only with a good hand)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mikam1: making 4 here one way or another|pg||
nt|mikam1: Sorry - 3|pg||
nt|pef: I'm a bit surprised he took the diamond finesse, but will still make 3 and that's still 11 imps|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@S playing transfers would be no major so either @D or stopper asking i assume |pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|mikam1: right Peter|pg||
nt|iceking: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|pef: hi, kit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikam1: Hi Kit!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d5|nt|psyck:  on 3@d intervention on 1NT, 3M can be played as flop flop|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h position very kind|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: 8 red tricks - but thats double dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: 90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  the @h pitch was interesting...I wonder why not @d|pg||
nt|psyck: *flip flop :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: But if Grue had held Qxx of clubs, that might not have worked so well -- could have been throwing away the ninth trick|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@C not very interesting always on even you dont get anything right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: looks like 4 losers still|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd thinking |pg||

nt|marlowepi: or did you mean Qxxx|pg||
nt|mikam1: So 2 double digit swings right out of the box|pg||
nt|pelu: agre - and the play with odds is in 3Nt a @H to 10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 6@h or NT with a safety play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   1st/2nd/3rd not vul   15-17  3rd vul/4th|pg||
nt|kit: but if declarer is playing clubs from the top to keep Lall off lead and Grue has Qxx, then it could matter.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but if N has Qxx, always making on D shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  47 should be pick up for Diamond as 5@c looks like it may be going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in OR, N led K@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had S been a PH, or had EW not been vul, there might have been stronger inferences leading to the overtrick line|pg||
nt|wstuart: As a bit of color, John and Brian were teammates of mine many years ago in the world junior championships.  John was affectionately named Blackwood and Brian went by Tuna.  If I ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: forget and refer to them by these names, please forgive me.  ;)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a max for their NT structure|pg||
nt|iceking: yes not like 2session yesterday first 6 boards were push|pg||
nt|puncher99: now this is an action hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|iceking: again someone at the table has zero hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get pulverised|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: I think south will raise here|pg||
nt|pef: on the last board playing transfers would have been especially good if you wanted to play 4h as it's hard to lead a trump when you are void in them|pg||
nt|mikam1: no one ever really passes 2N when it's close, do they?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: Too bad the hand is marred by the @sT|pg||
nt|kit: East hand difficult to bid opposite 14-16 1NT|pg||
nt|pef: yes, vul. at imps, I bet he will |pg||
nt|iceking: how strong is 2nt 20-21|pg||
nt|puncher99: dont think Brad is passing|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 6H maybe down on D lead|pg||
nt|puncher99: hard to stay just in 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 2@C dbl does not make|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c some artificial runout, @c & another maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but N could lead a heart from dummy to find bad but good news|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge holds up 6 fingers at the 2H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: what did they call you?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Mr. Stuart|pg||
nt|wstuart: I'm not sure I can tell you in polite company.  :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Bad break in the HC points for EW here|pg||
nt|ritong: hi kit|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Kit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome|pg||
nt|puncher99: hi|pg||
nt|cherilou: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|royhughes: Brad is trying hard to find some IMPs|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 140 in @ss|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: drat no blood today|pg||
nt|iceking: 19-20 i been told |pg||
nt|marlowepi: using how many hands?:)|pg||
nt|puncher99: with no opp bidd ns will do real well just to stop in 6|pg||
nt|ritong: so down 2 saves some|pg||
nt|andyv:  good start as long as they don't cash their 7 winners|pg||
nt|kit: Problem is that they are both trying on the same hand.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: if north had passed bidding would have ended there|pg||
nt|mikam1: See, I told you...no one ever passes|pg||
nt|pef: well declarer has 8 tricks with the j of spades onside.  can he possibly find a ninth?|pg||
nt|iceking: then iam not sure S should raise here looks very much against the odds 2 me|pg||
nt|mikam1: this shouldn't make...even with the spade jack on...as far as I can tell|pg||
nt|pef: yeah if 19-20 raising with a 4333 hand with a queen and two jacks looks too hungry even vul. at imps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jade: opposite almost any range, really|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting to see whether West ducks the @cQ smoothly|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W lucky, with this shape, to be able to develop the hand slowly against NV opps|pg||
nt|iceking: when you have 20hcp vs 4 it usually doesnt play as good as 12 vs 12|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will not make much difference with the @dA onside but will get South worried|pg||
nt|daman: they led a low @D in the OR|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West finds the club duck, it will be hard for declarer to finesse hearts twice|pg||
nt|cherilou: it will be hard for declarer to make his contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but East will have a tough lead after scoring a heart|pg||
nt|pelu: D 2 to 10 and K, then @H10 to K and A, @C to J and Q, @DJ (nice try) but S ducked - and no problem with the contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these are desperate waters, but i think the best way to fetch a swing is to open 1H as usual and hope the swing can be generated later. swimming against current to be making a call ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that locks you into declaring when almost surely W should declare|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|iceking: 2@C showed @C and higher and W passed accepted @C as trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  heading toward 3N|pg||
nt|kit: Grue might double this -- invittional auction, and he has heart stack|pg||
nt|kit: He didn't seem to give it much thought -- but that kind of double can really pay off.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2NT= 19-20(21)|pg||
nt|mikam1: If the diamond ten was elsewhere maybe...but here...defense would have to mess up|pg||
nt|daman: if you ducked the @C against my Mother she would play the AK and drop your Queen and smile|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: tough to punish opp  when  vul   especially vs not vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad staring at the walls again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred meditating|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: not keen on the 5 spot lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: why not? He doesn't know Hampson has 5-bagger.|pg||
nt|jade: would you have doubled, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I like to think that I would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you lead into he bid major, you dont have a four bagger, so dont squander spots that mght grow up|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW  did make 5@c for a push on 47|pg||
nt|jade: That is a tough contract to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  the best way to get some big swings is to get lucky|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right but best way to bend luck is to court percemntages|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wstuart: It's interesting but impotant to note that after a 1@D response, 2@D was not forcing.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S hand not a joy to lead from|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  am I crazy, or is 6@c cold E-W?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both|pg||
nt|andyv:  not crazy, just hard to get to|pg||
nt|henryb:  I mean with clubs 3-2 and diamonds 4-3|pg||
nt|andyv:  be nice, marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is the standard answer i receive when i start a question that way, just paying it forward:)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Platnick should know shortly not to throw a heart I think, and that's all that really matters|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred asking questions|pg||
nt|puncher99: at this point in the Match Brad may even x 6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: how would they show @C and lower?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "counting flowers on the wall....playing solitaire till dawn, with a deck of 51..."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I predict this goes down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd studying|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, cross to spade then low hearts|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cherilou: then she must have ducked a lot of Q's at the table|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iceking: still north has a hell of a def vs 2@C but maybe afraid pd has stiff for his takout dbl|pg||
nt|kit: I do think that doubling is a winner on balance with his hand, but I don't know if I would have found it at the table.|pg||
nt|mikam1: He knows the heart layout right now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: she did|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: what about the @d ruff possibility?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade then low heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: uppercut tha tis|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  can E afford to show the @c support and bypass 3N?|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|mikam1: It's conceivable he'll have to unblock the diamond king in some endings|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|puncher99: if he x 6 prob no way declarer would go rite|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd studying now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Room silent|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is why it was right to lead a spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  big swing here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: @d length could have been the other way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then a heart -- if W follows, you have a decision, but take the extra chance play of W showiung out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: fred drops the @hs on the table and claims 2 down|pg||
nt|royhughes: Wooldridge defends safely, and why not|pg||
nt|andyv:  106 good example...E opened a reasoable hand and ended up losing 12 imps at the one level|pg||
nt|kit: This must be frustrating to Hurd, looking at that spade suit.|pg||
mc|7|nt|pef: winning the ace there seems wrong, certainly trivial to beat 3nt if he had ducked|pg||
nt|iceking: wasnt @S 3 then @S 2 udca so Diamond should duck here|pg||

nt|pef: 3 imps for diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Yes, that really happened...|pg||
mb|r|nt|marlowepi: yes, bundle it into a 1H rebid, or dedicated a second round jump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Grue suddenly playing vanape:):)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brad Moss will NOT open the north hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: canape|pg||
nt|jade: I do not believe we should pass when we could be cold for a game and go down in 1N|pg||
nt|kit: the lack of HCP for the opening bid is compensated for by the strong heart suit :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is 1NT showing @c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I dont like the 1NT opening . Brad knows they will open 1NT at the other table in range|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd asks about the rdbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: cant see fred's answer|pg||
nt|royhughes: More action from Brad -- sometimes partnerships have difficulty over opposing redoubles|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: writing a note|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would open 1S as E as path to swing. actually very close to it anyway|pg||
nt|kit: does everybody know if North passed whether it would be penalties or non-committal?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: is 2NT still Lebensohl?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wstuart: Does anyone know if 2@C is GF over 1@D here?|pg||
nt|jade: how much will greco bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd writing a note|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherilou: W could bid 1NT but it's a very soft 15--I like his choice|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will be thinking slam now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or he'll be thinking pinochle deck|pg||
nt|kit: Greco is done -- why would he bid anything more?|pg||
nt|kit: Best is to pretend redouble didn't happen, as they apparently do.|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's a good thing to know.  In my partnerships, all passes of redoubles are penalty except 1 something dbl redbl pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge indicates an alert for 2nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  now they've created the action they want|pg||
nt|kit: Actually 4@H is a lucky make I believe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge asks about rdbl . Told strong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has 7 LTC, no rebid problem, a suit that might produce many tricks, and some defense. only inches  away from an opener anyway, and -- contrary to prevailing superstition -- 2nd ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seat is a great position to open light, expecially in extremis|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: n/s might get too high on this one|pg||
nt|mikam1: hard bidding here for south|pg||
nt|psyck: may not hurt to get too high, 6@d has play :)|pg||
nt|kit: it isn't too high if you guess the  jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|mikam1: If he bids 2N and partner raises, he doesn't know whether to bid on|pg||
nt|pef: 6d looks attractive, but declarer will need to guess the j of diamonds and a bit more|pg||
nt|mikam1: What would you bid here Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: on North hand?|pg||
nt|mikam1: 2N has the advantage of being lowest|pg||
nt|pef: south hand, kit|pg||
nt|kit: 31D seems clear for now, assuming 2@C is GF which I'm sure it is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Contract was 3NT on B61, not 2NT ... corrected on movie.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Need to create little swings|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps back to Bathurst on board 107|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge indicating a shrug when asked about pass. Now writing a long note and the tray passes|pg||
nt|kit: Well, maybe not on spade leads -- South hand gets tapped, so oligatory finesse in hearts won't do the trick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@h = balanced minimum|pg||
nt|jade: though 4 x 1 might discourage him a bit|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 2@c was 2 over 1|pg||
nt|puncher99: 2d is?|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Edgar Kaplan professed NT overcall should be BETTER than Strong NT opener|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thinking, yes, but not salivating. if N has heart pictures there might not be enough trics|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, it looks tough to handle|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge emphatically alerts rdbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: pulls to 31d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  Joel will have to bid something now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss thinking|pg||
nt|kit: redouble might well show 4 hearts -- usually in scrambling auctions redouble emphasizes highest suit.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|iceking: i think its close call dbl isnt that pretty either|pg||
nt|iceking: but it is more save|pg||
nt|mikam1: This is the problem|pg||
nt|pef: some people play that you have to rebid 2d (with the north hand) if your diamonds are queen fifth or better|pg||
nt|mikam1: with 2N|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d would be 3 cards as no inv min earlier?|pg||
nt|kit: although actually 2NT makes good sense -- might get a club preference, and can now follow with 4@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: transfer to @hs or minors|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mikam1: Now sort of forced to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|puncher99: i guess ur not allowed to jump over transfer bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: basically it is unfashionable to take penalties from very good players - they are mere mortals after all but their reps often save them|pg||
nt|mikam1: or not :)|pg||
nt|pef: an optional force :)|pg||
nt|pef: so this is another potential swing board|pg||
nt|andyv:  or could it be 2 places to play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW  upside-down count & attitude    NS standard carding|pg||
nt|pef: hampson and greco are on their way to slam in the open room|pg||
nt|kit: Unless the North hand has shown a minimal opener, which doesn't seem to be the case, South's pass of 3NT is quite conservative -- but right this time.|pg||
nt|pef: hey, you just said that 6d might make, kit|pg||
nt|kit: might and would are two different things|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'd be surprised to see 6@D make on this one|pg||
nt|pef: me too|pg||
nt|psyck: a swing coming up for sure either way|pg||
nt|kit: in fact, from declarer's point of view even 3NT isn't cold|pg||
nt|mikam1: In fact, they're in 6@D in open room|pg||
nt|mikam1: true Kit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If 4@C were forcing (which I think it should be), that would have been Lall's best call toset the trump suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that seems the right auction|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: everyone giggling|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge thinking|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: now that is just ridiculous.  The whole key to getting back a lot of IMPs is to put pressure on opponents and get all plus scores|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we all have two places to play. our lives, and our imaginations|pg||
nt|puncher99: wow|pg||
nt|andyv:  any choice but K?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad says i prob shoulda bid 3NT but i figured that everyone would expect that|pg||
nt|puncher99: fred gets uit right|pg||
nt|puncher99: it|pg||
nt|cherilou: not to me--now Fred may spear @SK|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice to see Brad playing to the audience|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad says normally very sound but here he could have a 17 count|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mikam1: now, however............|pg||
nt|pef: indeed they are in 6d in the open room.  they got a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: whole table cracks up|pg||
pc|c5|nt|iceking: its interesting what W should bid here and iam sure experience told Hampson dbl was better |pg||
nt|andyv:  playing limited opening bids, he may not have wanted any accidents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with that @S holding in dummy  attitude/count don't seem to apply   should @S2 show suit preference |pg||
nt|marlowepi: even SP seems otiose looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Should is always a very dangerous word when you change the meanings of signals on the fly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was the most non-committal one i could think of|pg||
nt|kit: I think that a signal should always have its default meaning unless the kibitzers 5 tables away and the janitor know it doesn't.|pg||
nt|andyv:  their notes say trick one exceptions on lead showing AK but don't tell you what the exceptions are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it right to define @S2 as suit pref   when dummy holding rules out need for attitude/count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at least that way default is not yours in de postmortem:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise UCDA and primary attitude signals|pg||
nt|jade: Whatever is the most meaningful signal to the person playing the card|pg||
nt|kit: the most meaningful signal is the one partner is sure to interpret correctly|pg||
nt|jade: exactly|pg||
nt|andyv:  told it was standard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2@s direct would be superaccept|pg||
nt|puncher99: or bid 2n over transfer|pg||

nt|puncher99: Joel thinks Fred has the j10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: now serious again|pg||
nt|kit: Another swing on 108 -- at this rate, they will make up the deficit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: can 4 @hs be made here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hampson's 2@s bid carried the day on that one|pg||
nt|puncher99: not with 3 spade plays|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: ahhh true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: fred says wellllll|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|wstuart: I hear that 2@C was 1 rd force initially, but I don't know they're system after that point.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: is it so clear that the spade suit is known?  Gee, I'll bet none of us have ever overcalled on AKJx.|pg||
nt|jade: That good?|pg||
nt|jade: Sometimes I might have AKTx|pg||
nt|jade: or worse...|pg||
nt|kit: But my point is, if East has overcalled on a 4-bagger then he doesn't know that the play is intended as suit-preference|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some play ace attitude king count or the like|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer unfortunate that short diamonds on his left and short hearts on his right|pg||
nt|jade: Why is it necessary to change here? There was also an auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if in effect here, affect the pertinence of some of our observationbs|pg||
nt|jade: touche|pg||
nt|puncher99: i admit its tuff to defend like tht|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wstuart: *their|pg||
nt|cherilou: a couple BIG results in OR|pg||
pc|c2|nt|robinswr:  1@d pass 2@c is a very difficult auction in standard as you can see from this article http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202008-10a.aspx|pg||
nt|pef: spade to king and float the 9 of diamonds?|pg||
nt|kit: probably spade to king and ride 9 of diamonds now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|puncher99: i play it like Brad is doing|pg||
nt|puncher99: keep lefty on lead|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kit: Not clear to Greco whether to ruff this since he is rufing air|pg||
nt|compton: hello all, did not realize that i am a live commentator|pg||
nt|andyv:  better then a dead one, Chris|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can take 7 trump tricks, 1 heart, and 2 diamond -- he need onemore trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c continuation and @s shift seems best here but hard to find at table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad thinking|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: E playing with fire|pg||
nt|wstuart: Risky line of play?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to say the least|pg||
nt|wstuart: the @H hook is 50%, East thinks he can improve on that because....  if S didn't lead one to start, maybe they either can't take 4+ @S tricks or he wont' lead them again.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade shify should be fairly clear on the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS do play udca so 4@h may have encouraged this line of play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S can count eight trix for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there's a lot you don;t realize:):) welcome amigo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I think the Q was played trick one|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pef: now spade k and a diamond?|pg||
nt|puncher99: thx for explanations|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: this seems strange|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cherilou: N made normal lead--hard to find a @D|pg||
nt|daman: he has to ruff this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  DD 11 was possible by finessing the @cQ but not even thinking doing that at IMPs |pg||
nt|daman: what is he thinking I wonder?|pg||
nt|pelu: but on @D-lead and @S back u need to finess in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff with 6 or 9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably the X showed the minors|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so North is not overrufing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  he is thinking of ruffing with the A|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: so ruff with @SA!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  he worked it out|pg||
nt|pef: he may have just held himself to 3|pg||
nt|kit: I think he miscounted his tricks|pg||
nt|pef: seemed like 5 was cold for awhile|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes--and seems odd to worry about the @S 7 here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: surely N doesn not have ALL the hearts, so only chance is that N has Axx of spades|pg||
nt|pef: he had at least 3 spades, 3 hearts, 3 diamond, and 2 clubs by my primitive counting system|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: Now he can ruff one heart low, 2 hearts high, and the ace of diamonds lives, so he will make|pg||
nt|jade: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|kit: he had for sure 3 spades, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad nods his head up and down like he was expecting that|pg||
nt|puncher99: must play q here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: BBO selling Brad Moss bobblehead souvenirs:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: LOL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: That is the line of the tournament!! wish I had thought of it!|pg||
nt|puncher99: beware of geeks bearing gifts is the motto here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: equine safety play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad now puts his cards down and puts his hand to his face|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: now leaning into the table staring at dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge and hurd studying|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred resting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad says oh well sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: after informing the opps that a 17 count wasnt too likely at thi spoint|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|kit: the good news for him is that he will drop the jack of diamonds, unless he again miscounts his tricks|pg||
nt|pef: seems like bathurst doesn't deserve to be gaining imps on this board, but likely they will|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|pef: surely they will now that we see the result|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|nt|iceking: Mike Passell knows this pair well and says Grecos style with W hand would probably be 1nt overcall, so often even pdship like this ew who played toghether for many years see things ...|pg||
nt|iceking: different |pg||
nt|mikam1: Well, not clear Peter...6@D is no lock|pg||
nt|kit: well they did get to a much better contract|pg||
nt|pef: unless he now takes a diamond finesse and goes down 1 to still gain 2 imps, that would be bizarre|pg||
nt|mikam1: Of course for all South knew, partner could have had the same hand with QJTxx of diamonds...then.........|pg||
nt|pef: true, as we all agreed, but I thought their auction was better in the open room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: I think Greco had to not ruff to defeat the contract -- not sure|pg||
nt|kit: looks like just nerves -- if hecounts his tricks right he wouldn't be thinking at all here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mikam1: That's why he was worth another bid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i wonder if N can snaggle a funny position against E who has both majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad staring at the wall again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: asks Wooldrisge a question about last hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  after 4 volatile boards, the set is even at 3-3...not what Diamond needs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Mood is much more Jovial than the last set|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge did overcall 1N   he's younger than Hampson|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it may not, right. but isnt it more likely than there is no spade danger?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: South had this thumb on low spade for quite a while before he played it|pg||
nt|henryb:  East refused the @h finesse at the other table also|pg||
nt|wstuart: nice to have some way of making a dist 3 card limit on this hand|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|marlowepi: rsearch project for a graduate student|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after opening PASS, Moss did get to 5@C on 49|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Lall glad he has good spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: the question now is, will Zagorin-Bathurst be able to handle that kind of disaster psychologically|pg||
nt|cherilou: unlucky to have 3@H losers here |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like South could not bid 2@c naturally|pg||
nt|cherilou: would you play X as form of stayman or just cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge does a fist pump to indicate str nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Does another to ask about the dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: close to 4S by W but no cigar unless defence careless i think|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: othewise opening 1C at these colors would be inviting army ants|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Some folks play 2NT as LR+ and 3+ trumps.  That has a lot going for it if you can move the natural 2NT bids into another auction.|pg||
nt|pef: uhoh, has to play 3nt again|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West ducks the question|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: both NS players alert the rdbl and write notes|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is time for the cheery laughter|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: transfer over 2N rebid??|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 4@D autosplinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s wont go overboard here - he says confidently|pg||
nt|iceking: if they play like that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H length purely coincidental|pg||
nt|pef: or not, actually 5c seems like a better game|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: Yed-now will Smolen come into play |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred writes a note|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d xfer to @h and can be a variety of hands, including @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N rebid shows 17/18|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is not enjoying this development|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: no Smolen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd waves his pass card toward the 2H to indicate an alert|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred said he bid 3@h to see if Brad could still show both minors|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred says TY|pg||
nt|ritong: not a bad flop for moss|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: now @D shortness|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder if 1@S showed an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|pef: I know 5c goes down, specs.  but it is a better game than 3nt on a heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  frustrating hand for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt seem right to sell somehow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W not in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad fingering cards|pg||
nt|puncher99: not when ur stuck 54 imps|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceking: so is this mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if alert says  short in your suit   or just as Magnus says  mild slam try|pg||
nt|iceking: so north will check keycards now with his maximum|pg||
nt|roswolf: my confidence ebbs away the more north thinks|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have like to show my shortness here, even N did open 1@D its usually the key reach slam show your shortness|pg||
nt|psyck: I play Xfrs after 2N rebid as Inv+ hands too & so this would be a mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diamond platnick will have strong 1@C auction   that will give them more room to explore|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, outside @c suit, the rest of hand does not look like it will fair well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Board-a-Match type of decision|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: lack of imagination is a blessing|pg||
nt|iceking: dont understand this bid at all|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@S may well now be bid:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick  3N north|pg||
nt|iceking: why not just check out keycards |pg||
nt|psyck: N did not check KC to check for trump quality instead maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because keycards won't give enough info|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant believe if 4@S here is slam invit 4nt is 2 play that doesnt make any sense to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this focuses directly on trump suit|pg||
nt|cherilou: 5@S sure seems aggressive when partber probably showed some mild slam interest and you have 2 little @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you want to be in slam opposite  @SAQxxxx  @CA ?|pg||
nt|iceking: north hand is super slammish though he has max in hcp and no jack in hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is utter lunancy if you ask me - but i am not playing for a place in the BermudaBowl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is an awful lot to bundle into a jump that takes us to the 3 level|pg||
nt|kit: The double of 2@D ends any chance that Platnick could find a brilliant heart lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@C = I like to play in major - 4@D: I have 3-3 (or 4-4)|pg||
nt|cherilou: will set it 2 now|pg||
nt|cherilou: S gets @S ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: Right Magnus, normal to make a try after this seq|pg||
nt|cherilou: N has minimum for his 2NT bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me IFF [keyword] bidding over 4@S  that 5@S is best bid|pg||
nt|psyck: N has a very good max as 2N is 17-18 for them|pg||
nt|iceking: that will just have to happen then, bypassing rkcb is just crime in my books as there is no defense if you reach silly slam with 2 keycards missing |pg||
nt|psyck: South should have just rebid 4@s on 2N maybe|pg||
nt|cherilou: S had entire 5 level to que bid and didn'r--N should pass 4 @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has no real extras - and his trump suit is not really robust|pg||
nt|iceking: its little soft not try for slam with south hand i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry entire FOUR leve;|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pef: the trick was to play 3nt from the north hand, as platnick would be hard pressed to find a heart lead from his hand|pg||
nt|kit: Potential swing -- played from South side, heart lead would have happened|pg||
pc|dT|nt|iceking: anyway they are at save level|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment but a scary few minutes|pg||
nt|pef: plus bathurst may be a better counter :)|pg||
nt|kit: and it did in the other room, so will be more IMPs for Bathurst|pg||
nt|mikam1: Every hand an adventure here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 imps back to Bathurst on Board 109|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: safe sry|pg||
nt|jade: Fast hand|pg||
nt|jade: for about two tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the limited nature of 1@H  meant Lall wasn't tempted to explore slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S can only be motivated by possibility of a 4S save. but why not bring both blacks into pictures. enhances chance of club lead etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  also the limited nature of Justin's hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: Looks like a good spot.  One possible line: 2 rounds of trumps, take 1 spade ruff, run the clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: have to play a @d first no?|pg||
nt|puncher99: obv play to play the suit u dont want played|pg||
nt|royhughes: sorry, my line no good|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I think a diamond first|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I htink thats Fred's plan|pg||
nt|kit: need 4 clu tricks, 5 heart tricks, 1 spde trick. How to get them without something bad happening?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd thinking|pg||
nt|royhughes: You want to keep in touch with dummy's clubs and yet still score 2 ruffs.  I think Fred's line does it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: somber again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad has his hands up to his cheeks with a silly devilish grin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: now starts playing with dummy's discards|pg||
nt|kit: Now he is in position to take 2 top trumps, then run clubs pitching his diamond, and crossruff|pg||
nt|cherilou: that's a good plan|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: i like LR+, but only with 4+ trumps|pg||
nt|kit: 6 heart tricks, 2 diamonds, 1 spade.  Is there a tenth?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit unlucky that all the hearts are offside|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: after the bidding N know that S has doubleton @S - Nice lead|pg||
nt|cherilou: after he sees dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: this defense would defeat even with a @H H in dummy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|iceking: now @S to ace @D to dummy and @S to ten|pg||
nt|cherilou: 2nd hand of the five we've watched where bad bid caused no harm. |pg||
nt|jade: I would have chosen 2C|pg||
nt|ferlema: some more photos from last set in www.confsudbridge.org|pg||
nt|andyv:  doing so also gives additional info to opps when it's unlikely that you will win auction|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wstuart: Not really.  You make 2NT LR or slammins and put the bal min @S GFs into another sequence.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: kit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry private|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: he is still okay -- can take same 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pef: yeah, must be you, mike, for 30 boards in a row yesterday, it was mainly a tense fight over part score swings.  here we have one game/slam swing after another|pg||
pc|s7|nt|iceking: ugh|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: halfway point of time just expired|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that;s true in general, but if your reason for bidding is hoping to fetch a good save, why not expand the search?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|puncher99: fred worried about 4 1 trump|pg||
nt|cherilou: yep|pg||
nt|kit: he isn't worried about 4-1 -- he can't very well make on 4-1 -- or can he?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad says "I hope you are pitchin g" on the @s play as fred reflects for a couple of seconds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|kit: now heart shift limits him to one ruf, and the diamond ruff will be 4 tricks for the defense -- 2 clubs, 1 spade, 1 ruff|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jade: I also think 2@C chews up more real estate|pg||
nt|kit: But the spade shift might not work so well|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer can get back to his hand via spade ruffs, and take 7 trumps, 1 spade, 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred sits up|pg||
nt|ritong: if @cs come in, i think he can cope with 4/1|pg||
nt|puncher99: stiff honor on his right the only bad lie|pg||
nt|cherilou: back to practical approach|pg||
pc|hT|nt|iceking: this should have been a rather simple safety play |pg||
nt|pelu: dont help to discard @SJ on @DQ - the 4, @s will forde dummy to ruff with the @HH|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: grue (laughing): back to this position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would @D play work if  greco shape was  5314|pg||
nt|jade: I am not sure I would have chosen this line|pg||
nt|kit: no.  I don't understand why he didn't just ruff club, queen of spades, spade ruff, draw trumps, claim|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|iceking: anyway didnt matter this time|pg||

nt|cherilou: excellant NS result|pg||
nt|puncher99: Brad thinks maybe i should overcall 4 hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd bid 4@c a little slowly and now Fred thinking|pg||
mb|4C|nt|iceking: bidding will end here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and then you can start your actual bidding at the four level:)|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@C nominally 11-15 with primary @C.|pg||
nt|kit: Gitelman will probably shove 4@D lead-director|pg||
nt|puncher99: he better block the 4heart bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: reaching for the box|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 49  Moss went down in 5@C|pg||
nt|pef: well he could have cashed one spade and thrown platnick in with a heart for the spade return after cashing one more club first, but really unlikely to be that hungry at imps|pg||
nt|cherilou: I think he should bid a lot of @h|pg||
nt|kit: This just forces Wooldridge to bid the slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: 5hearts is about rite|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge squirms in his chair |pg||
nt|kit: Which Moss might double to prevent his partner from saving|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: ew range varies  4th & 3rd vul = 15-17  otherwise 14-16      ns always 14-16|pg||
nt|iceking: @D lead looks normal here|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS will get to 3N here|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he has that|pg||
nt|pef: yet another wild board for our observation|pg||
nt|kit: apparently West doesn't have a bid to show weak hand with long spades immediately|pg||
nt|puncher99: theres a saying in bridge tht 6diams always makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i guess not|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing lead|pg||
nt|jade: DO we know the line he took?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  makes it hard for Wooldrtdge to bid 3N|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think the only consideration is whether to open 1@H or 2@C.  Openeing the bidding is a certainty with the east hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought N would bid 3N with his hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not close for me, 2C is the better suit & more preemptive|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Hurd should try 2N rather than 3@d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially whn 7 is cold|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: no thought by moss at all and Fred shrugs and pulls his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4th highest of longest and strongest though|pg||
nt|iceking: @D lead in open room |pg||
nt|cherilou: that usually works the best--S following tried and true|pg||
nt|iceking: this lead might not matter though|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS still have time to get their @S, 2@H, 3@D and @C|pg||
nt|kit: you can see it from the movie Jade|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that this hand might have created a swing if EW were silent|pg||
nt|royhughes: Wooldridge probably would like to do what they did in the other room, but who knows what this is?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i remember reading about rubber bridge games in england   there was a cash pool for winning 1st round of a suit with the 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd says GL|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iceking: this looks best |pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is something to be said for a 1N rebid by W|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson might have rebid 1NT with his spade stopper|pg||
nt|jade: true enough, just wondered if it was anything unusual|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|puncher99: plays better thn 6c|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|wstuart: N doesn't have enough to bid 3NT.  But he can make a vlaue showing 3@D which is both safe and allows S to bid on with an above avg hand.|pg||
nt|pef: 4 of either major is a tricky proposition, but 4h might fetch without a trump lead losing only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|mikam1: is this auction forcing?|pg||
nt|kit: Even with lucky spade lie 3@S looks to be limit -- but hearts plays very well unless South finds an impossible trump lead|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, agreed Peter|pg||
nt|psyck: NF auction|pg||
nt|psyck: normally correcting a suit at 3 level is frc, but not in this case with limited hands|pg||
nt|pef: and the lead is up to 56 imps now|pg||
nt|mikam1: in spades you're quite lucky not to have a trump loser, but still might not make game|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a piano hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec points out that Grue led @h in OR and that may have been difference in setting 95|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: now Zagorin needs to go for @S|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like 3@D|pg||
nt|pef: on a diamond lead I don't see any way to make 4 spades|pg||
nt|cherilou: easy @H game both bidding and play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: someon somewhere did a very long BOREL simulation and found that 4th highest of longest and strongest gain most tricks in any denomination over 51% of the time- a mind-boggling ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: statistic|pg||
nt|iceking: Ten would have been better i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: @S 10 is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid = 11-13 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: for example, if E has a bad hand with long mediocre hearts, he could bid 2H over 1N but will probably pass 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  biggest difference seems that Greco ruffed air here on @d and Hurd was able to ruff K@d|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a mixup -- apparently Lall thought his double of 2@D was penalties, Grue did not think so.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes new partnerships dont discuss what auctions mean at such high levels:)|pg||
nt|jade: Or maybe given his hand, he hoped it was takeout|pg||
nt|kit: and it will be an expensive mixup, as they don't have anything close to a home.|pg||
nt|kit: but in hearts you have 3 trump losers, yet can make game on no trump lead I believe|pg||
nt|mikam1: well, at least he'll go plus|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  and how does South guess that North has a club stopper?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem is, there are many hands WITHOUT extras than can make game|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why I prefer 3N...5 card suit and Q@c somewhat protected|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamonds is higher than clubs so cant ask for the stopper|pg||
nt|wstuart: If the t/o DBLer bids 3NT after a 3@D jump, should N think that he is taking is DBL back?|pg||
nt|andyv:  their requirements for dbl may be less once pd is a passed hand, so 3@d may be the saner bid for them.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2N is plenty on N hand. there are holes everywhere|pg||
nt|kit: but will Greco know to pass now, or will he think his partner has a stiff heart?|pg||
nt|jade: it will be expensive if Eric passes|pg||
nt|kit: Everybody plays these doubles as takeout, it seems, so partner never knows when they can pass.|pg||
nt|jade: and even then, Joe might get out for down 3|pg||
nt|jade: or 4|pg||
nt|jade: or 5|pg||
nt|jade: I think he will get out for down 2|pg||
nt|kit: I believe this sort of low-level double should always have at least a doubleton in their suit, so partner can pass with 4.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Lall's first pass apparently showed 1 spade, as he could have XXed to show 2 (per Grue)|pg||
nt|kit: I'm not so sure he will make this -- we can see how to make it, but he doesn't know QJ of spades is doubleton|pg||
nt|mikam1: Each EW player had a tough decision here...Diamond does have playability for hearts|pg||
nt|kit: so he will be trying for something else|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: surprised he hooked|pg||
nt|ritong: 7@h looks like 5 down|pg||
nt|kit: That spade finesse not clear at all -- what if Moss has stiff club and now leads it|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 6 by my count|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iceking: so 3@S 2@H 2@D for onedown|pg||
nt|cherilou: Now 3@S, 2@H and 2@D|pg||
nt|cherilou: E just can't get to 7 before NS do|pg||
nt|roswolf: a small gain for diamond|pg||
nt|cherilou: He should play @SA first-so can't return a @C when someone has 1|pg||
mc|12|nt|pef: he might try to ruff a diamond and lose 2 hearts, a spade and a diamond given how good his spade spots are|pg||
nt|pef: that works also, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge leans in and claims|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, @s ruff|pg||
pg||

nt|barnets: 4@S  agood stop|pg||
nt|henryb:  this time with less success|pg||
nt|joest: do we know what 2@d is?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D not much more than a finesse|pg||
nt|joest: so Greco has a   of good cards.  VAlue of KQ of clubs unknown at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess alert  is 2@D nat denying 6@S   but just a guess|pg||
nt|chorush: needs spades 3-2 and the diamond Q on and no wierd distribution enabling ruffs|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest: not clear Hampson has shown diamonds yet|pg||
nt|joest: not clear to me I should say|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|barnets: maybe not sorry|pg||
nt|joest: west may get squeezed in the reds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 111  Wooldridge in 6@S     Moss leads   ..... @H7|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson looks as if 4@s surprised him, now reviewing the auction, leaning back and thinking|pg||
nt|joest: Lall gets to lead the deuce from an eight card suit again!  looking for a ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: translation  111 = kool push|pg||
nt|joest: last set he underled AKQJxxxx and found declarer's ten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when was last time you NEVER bid with an 8-bagger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with outside ace|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: after consulting with W, S just showed his hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  Moss frozen on trick 7|pg||
nt|mikam1: the other room stopped in 3@H, so 1 imp|pg||
nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=11-15 HCP, 4415  minus 1 card|pg||
nt|pef: they stopped in 3h in the open room, did not get a trump lead, so will make 4 most likely to gain 1 imp|pg||
nt|kit: Playing ace and queen of spades would lose only if East had Kxx of spades and a stiff club.  Which is more likely?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: not sure why their requirements for a TWO-level X would be lower when pd is a PH...might be just the opposite|pg||
nt|cherilou: both rooms "guessed" to bid 6@S--and guessed right|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: ah the dreaded precision 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 50  vs 4@H  wooldridge in west returned trump when in with @CK and @SA   moss trying the sominex coup  but it won't work|pg||
nt|kit: And another potential slam hand rears it's ugly head|pg||
nt|royhughes: finesse loses to Kx offside with clubs 4-1, primarily|pg||
nt|andyv:  comic NT strikes again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: dunno if thats the right psych having seen Brad in action :P|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe a case of 2NT cuebid|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2N asks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: invitational+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N=4405|pg||
nt|psyck: min?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: max would optionally bid 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: this lead yesterday to a bad slam missing a cashing AK being bid - only thing was the opps didnt find the lead|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so this could be better than min also|pg||
nt|cherilou: One of the main threads running through this Trials ---lost opportunities|pg||
nt|wstuart: S still ahs to be able to compete iwth short @C there.|pg||
nt|pef: 3c invitational in clubs?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: well slam is better on these hands might be bid as well|pg||
nt|wstuart: You will die the death of 1000 cuts if you only play for games opposite a PH.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=11-13 bal|pg||
nt|mikam1: This looks like another 3N...nine tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd asking questions. Fred writing a note|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe he can talk Wooldridge into doubling 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably best this set they don't ask too many questions|pg||
mb|p|an|nope|nt|wstuart: (death of 100 cuts being losing the match 5-6 IMPs at a time)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge alerted pass and hurd alerted dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|cherilou: yes--I like this slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: DBL probably both minors here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is this a scramble or a transfer to clubs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't think that looking at his @s holding|pg||
nt|henryb:  DBL is "I had a trap pass over 1@s|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sry 2NT probably both minors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  which might have made a good investment for E to pass|pg||
nt|henryb:  either that or "I have a weak hand with long clubs"|pg||
nt|mikam1: probably puppet|pg||
nt|kit: puppet Stayman I would guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: correction   3N did show max   3@C rebid with all minimum hands    [thanks mike]|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is appears to be a squeeze on 50|pg||
nt|pef: ah, of course|pg||
nt|pef: thought for a moment they played weak nts, actually 14-16|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know about 2N facing an unpassed hand. that opening is a slam-killer, and goddess knows they need to put points in the board. |pg||
nt|puncher99: im with you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Last time I saw a hand like this where this pair needed a swing ... Brad opened 1NT with 7solid @h and then responded 2@d to stayman ... No 4 card major|pg||
nt|puncher99: u just got to a great slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: and ur on ur comeback|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge thinking|pg||
nt|kit: Wooldridge won't be expecting an out and out psych at this vulnerability -- just something off-shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: W has a lot of useful cards, even with his @d wastage|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this is a slam try sequence i am told|pg||
nt|wstuart: Some play Lebensohl on some of the t/o DBL auctoins, such as (1@S)-P-(2@S)-DBL-(P)  but I don't know that many would play it on this auction.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Of course, given that west is likely to have long @S, short @H and a good hand, easts 2NT as natural and forward going has a lot going for it, too.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it doesnt look like a hand that yearns to play in NT to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the answer is....:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a grammar squeeze?|pg||
nt|jade: 9, 10 or 11?|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to find safest way to take 4 club tricks.  Anybody know what that is here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss thinking|pg||
nt|cherilou: Fred's happy|pg||
nt|puncher99: oh no|pg||
nt|andyv:  can Brad sit for it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: no one sent for him|pg||
nt|kit: Problem is, Brad also won't expect the out and out psych|pg||
nt|puncher99: he wants to win  12 imps he will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad muttering to himself and chuckling|pg||
nt|kit: He redoubles for rescue, and the play it there is my prediction|pg||
nt|puncher99: wpw|pg||
nt|puncher99: wow|pg||
nt|cherilou: I'm with you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: still down 1|pg||
nt|puncher99: its like the beaver in backgammon|pg||
nt|cherilou: win 2 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: cant make unless they crash @cs|pg||
mb|r|nt|mikam1: Kit, any chance you would have opened 2@S as South here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: too tuf though :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some discussion, Diamond thought 2S would be minors and 2NT was natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  which sounds right|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will play ace of clubs first, guarding against 4 clubs in North hand|pg||
nt|kit: it is down 1 -- provided there isn't a crash in the club suit!|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, a 200 save against a NV game|pg||
nt|andyv:  Joel may get out now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: considering a hog move|pg||
nt|ritong: bidding one more @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: at least they tried|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 6@H in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some relayers reverse   here 4@C puppet 4@D then 4@H slam try    others use direct bid as slam try  "puppet" to signoff|pg||
nt|cherilou: They bid it in open room so we'll see some imps|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe Hampson should have been more agressive here|pg||
nt|iceking: KJ of @C just has to be gold|pg||
nt|cherilou: @C J is a huge card|pg||
nt|roswolf: BATHURST BACK INTO THE LEAD|pg||
nt|marlowepi: king|pg||
nt|jade: my mom plays low to the 8\|pg||
nt|kit: I think club to 10, but not at all sure.|pg||
nt|jade: I have seen good players actually lead the 10 here|pg||
nt|pef: there is always a chance kit will preempt, particularly nv vs. vul. :)|pg||
nt|kit: is there any chance I wouldn't have :)|pg||
nt|kit: Fred working out the numbers, deciding if better to run to 3@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: why wouldnt he pass and try to make it?  has 8 AND an ACE|pg||
nt|ritong: he has six tricks.|pg||
nt|cherilou: not if down 1--but yes if down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge shaking his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad got a goofy smile on his face|pg||
nt|ritong: if moss brings zero, 3@c costs less|pg||
nt|kit: high diamond lead, ruff, jack of clubs, and ........|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: and they finally let it go|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  leads 3rd and low against suits|pg||
nt|cherilou: Diamond team hoping to have more action hands--score this set 7-5 hard to make up 50 with these hands |pg||
nt|daman: they blew 10 IMPs on 78|pg||
nt|cherilou: S leads 3rd from his 6 card suit. Popular carding here in US--you're 2nd and 4th?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so is is showing 6 or could it be 4?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  more familar with 2nd and 4th|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or 3rd & 5th|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least the lead is easy|pg||
nt|puncher99: joel gets these positions rite|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: out of turn, too|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad apologizes!|pg||
nt|puncher99: hes used to it|pg||
nt|andyv:  all those writing K@c, go back to sleep|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|mikam1: They did in the other room...and blew out the opponents|pg||
nt|kit: if I mis-sorted my hand I might not|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jade: after crossing.....|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a real problem for South on the jack of clubs back, isn't it?|pg||
nt|kit: you bet it is|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, in the end, a 2 imp gain for EW|pg||
nt|puncher99: hes the one player on this team who  makes the rite play a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred leans into table |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: this might well be making|pg||
nt|kit: and here we are!|pg||
nt|puncher99: i bet he gets it rite|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Now Wooldridge has the goofy smile|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: pulls an honor puts it back|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|henryb:  If double is a trap, surely 2@s should be natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: shaking his head'|pg||
nt|ritong: well north has either @c A or @h A|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pef: to give you some idea of kit's partnership style.  his regular partner, fred steward held jx xx k10xx qxxxx nv vs vul and opened 3c earlier in this tournament|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|wstuart: That also makes sense.|pg||
nt|kit: Would have been more interesting on heart lead.  If defenders could make declarer think hearts 5-3, declarer could not afford to lose a club trick -- so might go down trying for ...|pg||
nt|kit: diamonds 3-3 and then spade finesse.|pg||
nt|mikam1: I TOLD you these preempts work Kit|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jade: 48 imp lead now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still 60 boards to play tomorrow|pg||
nt|pef: was that routine, kit?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|puncher99: 760|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: but it could be a trap with only 4S. and since S not likely to open fourbagger at these colors, not sure that is the best treatment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i mean|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think if someone offered Platnkc -2 here he would jump on it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Diamond: We haven't discussed this auction. Obviously.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Good spade suit, white vs. red...believe it or not, even I might have done that one :0|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  you know things are going right when you make a poor lead and might only lose and imp or two|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we think declarer should have avoided the trump promotion?|pg||
nt|daman: this is really quite bizarre|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West had kept a lower heart, he would be able to set up the fifth spade|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|mikam1: So this will be 11 imps to the trailing team|pg||
nt|kit: I do preempt a lot, but I really think it should be right for any style on that South hand|pg||
nt|psyck: Even not playing Muiderberg or something, many would open 2@s here, with the vul, good suit, & side distribution|pg||
nt|pef: of course they don't always work.  I lost a vanderbilt match to the diamond team when hampson, holding aq10xxx of clubs nv vs vul did not open 3c when my teammate did.  3c ...|pg||
nt|pef: propelled them into a horrible vul. 3nt that was unbeatable.  without the preempt we avoided 3nt on our balanced 17 vs. 6|pg||
nt|psyck: some like to treat 5 card suit with a side 4 carder as a 6 card suit...|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i fulfill the first part of that on a regular basis|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: wait hopefully for the second part|pg||

nt|barnets: they were in 2@CX|pg||
nt|joest: on the prior board whre Lall never bid with his eight card suit|pg||

nt|wstuart: Yep|pg||
nt|jade: true enough|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 boards in closed room taking over 75 minutes to play|pg||
nt|jade: are they breathing?|pg||
nt|kit: but I would probably pass|pg||
nt|pef: back down to 46 imps in this ping pong segment|pg||
nt|andyv:  back to the oracle|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad says LETS GO|pg||
nt|cherilou: quite creative by Fred|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mikam1: Well, NS have a slam...probably unbiddable, except by accident|pg||
nt|puncher99: dont let them off the mat|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: another bidding test but easier to pass this time|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt  is 14-16hcp |pg||
nt|cherilou: this would be excellent slam if W's red suits reversed|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting auction anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=4/5@S|pg||
nt|kit: Quite a North hand -- opening bid on your right, and you nearly have slam in your own hand.|pg||
nt|mikam1: or the opponents helping out|pg||
nt|pef: six hearts is awfully good on this hand, is it possible to reach?|pg||
nt|psyck: Specs cannot complain about non swingy hands anyway|pg||
nt|royhughes: There was no red suit squeeze at the end, but close|pg||
nt|puncher99: play for the antiswing?|pg||
nt|kit: surprised Gitelman didn't trick everybody and open 1@S here|pg||
nt|cherilou: They've picked up 31 in 7 boards--need 50 now in 8 boards--seems impossible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred says he shoulda played a low @h instead of Q . Hurd informs him he had the 10 and the 9|pg||
mb|3H!|an|after long huddle|nt|puncher99: 41|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I think the note says 1-4-4-4|pg||
nt|cherilou: 44-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: maybe east has some bid to show @H shortness with both minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = @D|pg||
nt|cherilou: transfer to @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S pass this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not everyone would reach 3N on this lot|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sure|pg||
nt|mikam1: North has to guess how high to push, unlikely to get any help from partner|pg||
nt|kit: sure it is possible to reach -- North might just up and bid it.|pg||
nt|mikam1: true Kit...as I said, partner is not going to be assisting|pg||
nt|psyck: don't get dealt 2 loser hands daily after all|pg||
nt|mikam1: interesting to note....both tables are at the exact same point in the auction :)|pg||
nt|kit: hope for king of clubs in partner's hand, or no club lead and enough of some red suit in partner's hand to be able to draw trumps and discard club losers|pg||
nt|pef: suppose bathurst bids 5h here, is the king of clubs in the south hand enough to bid 6 on?|pg||
nt|mikam1: North thinking right here after 1@S-2@S-3@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: and i think might include weak 5@D & 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: then will 3@H show shortage|pg||
nt|iceking: if so then w would not bid 3@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C no super-accept of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might need better @D for 3@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a positive fit perhaps?|pg||
nt|cherilou: does W like or not like @D's with 3@C call--everyone plays one of the 2 methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what is default for "accept"   A/Kx  Hxx  Qxx  |pg||
nt|psyck: If as Al suggests, then E can pass with weak 55 minors here|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|iceking: that doesnt make any sense then they are in 3@C on 5-2fitt with 5-3 @D fitt|pg||
nt|cherilou: have to decide like or don't like no middle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW   1N-3@C = Puppet Stayman   1N-3@D = game force 5+@D & 5+@C|pg||
nt|kit: South won't be bidding anything whatever North does -- North will have to gamble it himself|pg||
nt|pef: he took the low road|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: remember 1nt = 14-16 0nly so east knows they are light on values for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S probably exactly 3@S|pg||
nt|mikam1: yup|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nothing hand here, everyone to the fpyer where BBO is providing an Open Bar. just hum a few bars and the band will fake it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: vwd|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade best|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for N not to bid, and 2@d would be a spade raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  and answer is no|pg||
nt|wstuart: He's far from cold in practice.  Don't pregloat them.  :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, only question was if he would pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but S doesnt have a clear 3N, and if he bids 2N maybe not all Ns would go, esp NV|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: halfway time limit just sounded|pg||
nt|wstuart: I must say, 3NT was not my first choice of rebid with the S hand.|pg||
nt|puncher99: 41 imps they have picked up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: pretty sure that its 1-4-4-4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes perhaps 1S is the swing bid here....catch:   xx   Axx    Axxxxxx  x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad puts down stiff @s|pg||
nt|kit: Well, 4@S sure won't make.  At least 3NT requires the defense to dosomething right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: saves the last 3 for later|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wstuart: however, I would pass 1NT before rebidding 2@S with that suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ouch|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think 2@s was in the radar|pg||
nt|pef: greco still pondering |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be hard work for declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad leaves the room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: asks if opps mind|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: told no|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iceking: ok well done no danger go past 3nt now |pg||
nt|cherilou: no, just in case E was 5-5 weak in minors--not on this hand. Now 3@H is shortess and W's red suits have been described|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe i spoke to soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener shows @H holding for 3N    if Qxx is enough that implies  east hold @DAKxxxx   but that holding goes to game without asking|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the long tank suggests a further try may be made|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room|pg||
nt|mikam1: You "could" bid 4@S followed by 5@H...then blame partner for leaving you short of slam :)|pg||
nt|pef: or go down on a really bad day|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: I think that is too conservative.  5@H big favorite to make.  I like 4@S by North.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bathurst would like 23 more nothing boards|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cherilou: then 3@C must have been like @D's--only reason to bid again with E|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was hoping for a fourth spade in dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: Zagorin and Bathurst was junior partners back in 1995, 1997 Zagorin played Junior WC with Kasper Konow (Denmark) and was No 8! - no international play the next 10 years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bad Thurst will be addressed at Open Bar|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs saying 8 boards may be enough|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|iceking: so 4@C looks like rkcb |pg||
nt|roswolf: agree sheri|pg||
nt|iceking: just guessing though|pg||
nt|roswolf: cheri - sorry|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes it does look like KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  3@C said not @D good enough for 3N  and 3@H said i have game force [slam try] with 6+@D and short @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: in that case a quick sign off is in order|pg||
nt|iceking: so east is just overbidding now continue over 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 4@h rkc|pg||
nt|cherilou: hmmmmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right sided:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 2@s just min. hand/2@h?|pg||
nt|kit: This is a good example of the power of double showing 4or 5 spades -- East is on lead vs. spades.|pg||
nt|robinswr: I don't think you should Michaels when your major is longer than your minor|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|pef: steve robinson has just joined us, welcome, steve|pg||
nt|mikam1: "You had 3 trumps and the club king...how could you pass"!!|pg||
nt|kit: sensible line of play,but won't do well here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|puncher99: looks like lose 2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|kit: Normally I would agree Steve, but when you can drive to the 5-level on your own there is not difference between a major and a minor.|pg||
nt|mikam1: But if you don't bid Michaels, you have to double...then it can get messy,no?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N goes for the simple approach of "we will beat it if pd has what i want". |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|roswolf: they do appear to be groping around in the dark|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like some misunderstanding |pg||
nt|cherilou: N might lead @HA with @DK|pg||
nt|iceking: it seems like Hampson is responding to rkcb and Greco is just bidding natural 4@C|pg||
nt|psyck: Strange after E knew of @h wastage after 3N on 3@h showing shortness|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoa c'est tres incroyable|pg||
nt|henryb:  clearly declarer needed to play @d first, but that was not at all obvious|pg||
nt|pelu: Bathurst won Junior WC bronze 2003 in Paris - on that team also Hurd, Grue and Wooldrige!|pg||
nt|puncher99: lo spade now|pg||
nt|cherilou: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: !|pg||
nt|puncher99: if u want to go for a swing|pg||
nt|kit: Now if it goes queen and a spade, North should dump the queen of hearts!|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would you like to swing on a star?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: alternative with same rationale is the other ace|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cherilou: seems pretty crazy|pg||
nt|cherilou: already have the swing playing in NT|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is very hard for East to play a low spade -- we can all see that would beat it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not obvious, but maybe correct. if E has heart ace W will have a spade card so defence wll have the tempo. this may be the layout you have to play for|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  like me you refer to juniors - I cannot quite get used to the new WBF term youth|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  GIB said 2 off initially and is still saying 2 off|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cherilou: this bad bid will cost|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: now sit back and wait for the trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have guessed 4@H RKC @C  [bid 4@D to agree that suit]|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see in this bidding 4@H cannot be meant as quebid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  so it could still be beaten, but much much harder|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|iceking: reason is you do not que bid King after pd shows shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge playing 4N West|pg||
nt|iceking: aha so maybe 4@H was rkcb|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more sensible contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec surprised E did not lead from his substantially stronger minor|pg||
nt|pef: greco still contemplating the state of the universe :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4-3 fits are very difficult to play and defend|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jade: hand is getting more interesting|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is why we have ben talking about other things :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: what swing.  3NT routine contract, as proven by other table result|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: unlike yesterday when both tables were in big time trouble, today things are moving along at a good clip|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yesterday, Fred Gitelman overcalled 1@S with a big hand (and side suit of AKQJx of clubs)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|kit: why?  doesn't declarer always have 4 spades, 3 clubs, 2 dimonds, 1 heart at least?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: something for them to talk about |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could go 3 down now if South rises|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad said he couldnt decide what singleton to show|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: bathurst gallops away|pg||
nt|jade: and then you are always annoyed when you pitch the wrong card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D or 1N?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess there was a problem...and N was declarer|pg||
nt|kit: and the bragging rights bank when he goes wrong there :)|pg||
nt|jade: that adds to the irriatation bank, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I know it can always be beaten, but I still say it is harder|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think North should do at least that...sure, on a bad day you go minus, but.....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|iceking: seems like Greco just forgot 4@H was RKCB with @D as trumps i been told|pg||
nt|pef: greco just found a 4nt call |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S denies 4@H unless game force|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 1NT overcall, and will likely reach 4@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for discussion  if  2 suits potential trump  can you RKC in both of the suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I guess this is some kind of strong spade raise|pg||
nt|pef: maybe planning to convert partner's 5 of a minor to 5h |pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: the dam has burst - i venture to suggest e/w are on tilt|pg||
nt|iceking: its very easy to forget your system i do that also often |pg||
nt|psyck: Not good for Diamond team, 6@h would hanve been in trouble on a @s lead other table & the previous deal was an unforced error|pg||
nt|cherilou: W had 2 ways to avoid @D loser--lead Q hoping RHO had singleton J or hope LHO had singleton K. Neither happening this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: that double looks fairly crazy too|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: looks rather normal dbl to me i guess iam crazy then:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = @S raise   not sure if singleton promised|pg||
nt|jade: I get yelled at when I play that way|pg||
nt|kit: Meanwhile, E-W arebeing stolen from here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred thinking|pg||
mb|6S|nt|yorkbeach:  not sure about the X|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to say where E or W could have come in |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2H promises some variety of unbalanced spade raise|pg||
nt|kit: I think it is important to have ways to bid a hand like West's vs. a Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|kit: getting to 5@H down 1 never looks good, but missing a laydown slam is just as costly|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now Hampson is in the tank over 5@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like a single suited hand to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes, playability in the 3 highest ranking suits should always be showable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually   2@H may be   natural or invitational @S raise|pg||
nt|jade: Ok, what would you have done, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: Personally, I play 1NT shows a 4-card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d showing 5+@d and 4@h would have been effective here (10-13hcp)|pg||
nt|kit: since that is probably the most awkward hand type|pg||
nt|jade: 2@D = majors, Kit|pg||
nt|kit: no, 2@D natural.  Double with both majors.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Raptor NT overcalls Kit?|pg||

pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: somebody doesnt like leading from Jxxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost time to claim|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad says if you make it you have your bids|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred thanks him|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cherilou: leading Q hoping for singleton J also works when K doesn;t cover--so it is winning play more often|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think you need to steady the ship|pg||
nt|iceking: remember here east isnt limited he could still have up good hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might fall here|pg||
nt|cherilou: I like X--already a passed hand and has 9 cards in the red suits--seems normal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asking about 3@C bid...|pg||
nt|mikam1: agreed Kit|pg||
nt|pef: I sort of like that auction--maybe that gets partner to realize that a key card in either minor is enough for slam|pg||
nt|mikam1: Looks like a close game here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: what do you guys think?|pg||
nt|mikam1: but with hearts 3-3 I think it will make|pg||
nt|kit: opening bid puts red kings likely onside, which makes the play easier|pg||
nt|mikam1: Certainly a reasonable try Peter...I would have bid 4@S, but admit I didn't think of 4N|pg||
nt|pef: hampson still in the tank|pg||
nt|pef: I didn't either, Mike, but it looks like a really sensible way to try to get partner to cooperate|pg||
nt|mikam1: not any more...he passed|pg||
nt|pef: ah well, at least he gets bonus points for not stopping in 4h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad indicates 4-4 with his fingers|pg||
nt|puncher99: surprised he didnt bid 2s|pg||
nt|andyv:  who?|pg||
nt|puncher99: Brad|pg||
nt|cherilou: not the dummy Fred was looking for........|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: not clear 3 small is a better bargain|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't know if you can beat 3N without a heart lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|iceking: Greco seen enuff bidding time to dbl|pg||
nt|kit: I prefer 4@S to 4NT -- I think that implies the spade void.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe one should show diamonds and the other clubs once you correct to 5@H|pg||
nt|puncher99: if tht is super acc of transfer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|iceking: will Hampson lead trump maybe|pg||
nt|iceking: often right after bidding like this|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will certainly calm any berves that e/w may have|pg||
nt|cherilou: but only X'ing 4@S because partner acted earlier :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok touche|pg||
nt|iceking: and you cant blame S try for game here|pg||
nt|iceking: duck or cover with @S jack and then duck maybe|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west's double didnt augur well for a game contract|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  saved a lot of money that way, Jade|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iceking: other then @S 4-1 and @H king offside the hand breaks well|pg||
nt|henryb:  the other room is playing 2@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: declarer planning to ruff one club in short hand and pitch the other on the jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like he has to play ace and a spade now to hold this to 4, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|kit: will come to 5 spade tricks, 2 diamonds, 2 hearts, and 1 club on decent splits|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherilou: if 3@C was game try I hate N's 4@S bid|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: rehi everybody, my computer crashed|pg||
nt|andyv:  stop dropping it|pg||
nt|jade: gave the other table a chance to catch up electronicly|pg||
nt|andyv:  here the dbl looks like a one trick set unless @ss are misguessed by declarer.|pg||
nt|jade: Personally I appreciated the opportunity to grab a drink from the bar|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: wish I'd gotten one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did you pay for it?|pg||
nt|kit: Greco-Hampson did very well to get to 4@H after they had made 5 consecutive passes|pg||
nt|andyv:  whether he guesses or not, it's a good save against what appears to be a cold 4@h contract|pg||
nt|jade: hell no. I am the entertainment here at the local establishment|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  that will be no picnic|pg||
nt|henryb:  by North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the same board!!        [give praise and pass the ammunition]|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good to see that the players have made the step up to open level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  claim coming|pg||
nt|andyv:  moot point now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mikam1: Walter Johnson made a good point on the slam hand...4@S allows an encouraging 4N bid by partner|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@h 5@d 1@s =12|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|royhughes: indeed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfh: started to play it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: then reconsidered twice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: apologizes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  and apparently it was a picnis :)|pg||
nt|kit: assuming 4NT would be encouraging as opposed to asking what the minor is|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cherilou: when E Xed 3@H I'd be hoping to make 3|pg||
nt|iceking: yes N with min hcp and probably some bad breaks probably should have given up in 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond is playing 3@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe they don't have one for a 5 card suit:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: he keeps doing it to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Fred frustrated by the tempo|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  spec says N got a @c lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  I guess he invited E to the picnic|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably exhausted now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|iceking: can he escape one down here |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
nt|pef: right, probably not something that even a really experienced partnership had necessarily discussed in advance|pg||
nt|mikam1: all of these things require deep discussion - as Peter says|pg||
nt|robinswr: after 1@s - 2@s, pass some play that 2NT shows values and 3@c is weak pass or correct. I assume that the same logic would apply after 4@s|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry, most of the play was lost while I was restarting and reconnecting|pg||
nt|jade: there is a divine entity|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think Eric is trying to catch up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: the last three tricks consisted of Grue ruffing a heart on the board and then correctly finessing trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  possibly their supper accepts are only 17 but just guessing here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, fortunately the Bermuda Bowl itself isn;t grueling|pg||

mb|2C|an|majors|nt|roswolf: hmm another action hand|pg||
nt|puncher99: when u got 5 trump and it may b transfer i think u would give super acc|pg||

nt|andyv:  can they keep out of 6@cs?|pg||
mb|2H!|an|limit or better in !cs|nt|iceking: 2@S enuff|pg||

nt|mikam1: And don't tell me colors are for children|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: notes and fingerpointing all over the place|pg||
nt|royhughes: The EW hands are funny -- 6D has a decent chance, but not 6C|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d would be a great contract except for one small problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can keept them, out of 6C|pg||
nt|puncher99: u can make 6 diams|pg||
nt|andyv:  and could make dbl dummy|pg||
mb|3S!|an|more note writing|nt|andyv:  uninformative auction in OR and E chose the more aggressive @c lead rather than either short suit sequence|pg||
nt|pef: will zagorin bid 2nt?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Zagorin might boost this|pg||
nt|kit: unlikely to go for a number, but might just be going down|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think the T9 of clubs is enough for a raise|pg||
nt|kit: Still, I think raise is probably winner since partner is limited -- if partner weren't unlimited, too dangerous to raise since he might bid too much|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like 3nt will likely fetch despite only 23 hcp|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i think double has a lot of merit. Here it landed in the optimum spot while 4H was down on a 5-0. In these times of frisky preempts there is often an easy penalty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about 6D|pg||
nt|royhughes: How can you make 6D on a spade lead?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: exactly|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  NS in 4@s undbld in OR on 54|pg||
nt|jade: That's not straying, that's a tactical diversion|pg||
nt|andyv:  with all th quacks, Joe probably trying to get his best suit in|pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Greco should do here.  He has a lot of defense.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a nice one with that @C suit   [and partner NOT having @S length]|pg||
nt|kit: And it isn't 100% that his partner has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jade: timing is everything|pg||
nt|kit: So he may well pass the double|pg||
nt|jade: Do you like the 2@C opener, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I seem to remember that spades outrank the red suits but clubs don't.|pg||
nt|jade: That doesn't really answer the question|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 4@h makes, dbl will only cost 3 imps to EW|pg||
nt|kit: I think it does|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy maybe but too tuff|pg||
nt|puncher99: club lead beats 6diams|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|royhughes: but on 2 rounds of hearts no problem: cross to club 9 and pick up the trumps!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: any lead beats 6@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: just cant continue @hs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 6@d|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kit: Zagorin close to a 2NT call, but not quite there|pg||
nt|mikam1: low road again|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think I would have Kit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: unless you're play that 2@s shows a weak raise and 2@c or 2@H shows a 7-9 raise|pg||
nt|mikam1: But certainly pass is reasonable|pg||
nt|pef: platnick/diamond lead lower of touching honors |pg||
nt|kit: If they bid the slam, Hurd will defintely save|pg||
nt|kit: How can he not with no defense and a 3-loser hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure good save even against EW ga,me|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes indeed -- invest a 50 or 2 and prevent a disaster|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge was the one thinking till now and finally passes|pg||
nt|puncher99: fred should b scared to bid 5s|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: @HK lead won't be optimal, so good pull :)|pg||
nt|kit: ace of clubs likely lead|pg||
nt|jade: Well, you got the A part right|pg||
nt|kit: Will certainly shift to it|pg||
nt|puncher99: u got backup with diam ace|pg||
mb|p!|an|forcing?|nt|iceking: so 3nt-3 most likely|pg||
nt|kit: the danger is that partner can be lighter than normal for the 1NT bid, since otherwise he would have to go to the 2-level on some flat 5-count|pg||
nt|puncher99: lead tht lo club|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if you play that X and then converting 4@c or 4@d to 4@h does not show extras, I guess you can do it|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry I missed a junior WC-gold 2001 in Brazil for Hurd, Grue and Wooldrige :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|jade: One of those "If I get out of this alive, God, I will never do it again" moments|pg||
nt|kit: looks like declarer can get 6 trump tricks and 1 diamond trick is all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentators in other room predicted 3rd seat 1@C from Brad Moss,  who opened 1@S|pg||
nt|jade: What options is Eric considering?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I can't tell but he clearly was having a hard choice in the auction and another one here|pg||
nt|andyv:  they'll bid this and I'm afraid the career of the commentators will be over shortly|pg||
nt|puncher99: Brad never concedes|pg||
nt|puncher99: Fred should know the club ace rates to b on table|pg||
nt|puncher99: he mite come up with lo club lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: does anyone know if they add 2 to the team, I think both of these are 4 handed|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all are 6 handed,  th specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd wrestling with the screen which keeps threatening to fall down|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, I suppose you're right|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: only consolation is it may be a push|pg||
nt|iceking: yes its very normal result |pg||
nt|ahollan1: is duck here double dummy??|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it looks daftbut has some merit i suppose|pg||
nt|iceking: duck what|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS has 25 points--a push seems likely|pg||
nt|kit: I am surprised he risked passing.  Puts a lot of pressure on partner|pg||
mb|d|nt|puncher99: u know ur  pard is biddin a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he is considering that his partner might have a singleton diamond, so ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|daman: EW had disasters on 78 and 82   otherwise they would be down a mere 40 IMPs at this point |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: looking at the movie the match appears to be over|pg||
nt|puncher99: u never know  john may finn Fred for heart j|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  taking no chances but costing 5 imps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: again the 2@S was the warning bell - especially with the spades under the bidder|pg||
nt|iceking: though if N had opened 1@D bidding could have gone:: 1@D-p-1@H-1@S-2@C-p-3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: betting Hampson would overtake if duck -- but  this way easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick also opened 1N|pg||
nt|cherilou: W could have @C Q doubleton or third--then still make 3NT|pg||
nt|iceking: not very interesting the play here |pg||
nt|roswolf: on 24 3@S went off 1 so only a 2 imp loss|pg||
pc|c8|nt|puncher99: its pecentage play|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he decided that since he bid 5@H his partner would save unless reasonably confident of defeating the slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: surprised Brad passed 6 hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: But I think this defense makes more sense|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: if the opening bid had been 1 of a minor, the1NT response to takeout double is more likely to have full values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see how pass over 6C could be forcing. to do that wouldnt N have jad to bid 5C on his previous turn?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd alerted his pass|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: problem now is he has to play something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  4@H West|pg||
nt|kit: might have been better to duck the diamond|pg||
nt|jade: I agree|pg||
nt|kit: it doesn't really cost a trick even if declarer has a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: feeling endplayed 5 times is actually good thing when defending at the 4 level|pg||
nt|kit: Holding 4 aces is usually a good start when defending at the 4-level doubled.|pg||
nt|jade: I was considering exiting a low @H|pg||
nt|jade: actually still am|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson's carding of high spade and high-low in trumps would appear to indicate the king of hearts|pg||
nt|jade: @S might finesse partner|pg||
nt|jade: In this case either low or high is the same. But if Hampson has Kxx @H a low @H is better|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: wow   DIamond raised to 3N immediately    @H lead from Hurd|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: Brad may have passed to pretend he had a void, to get the opponents to save over a grand if his partner bid it.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|kit: not often opponents open in your solid 8-bagger|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is a bidding problem we dont get too often|pg||
nt|kit: Responding on a yarb is okay if you can respond 1 of a major, but if you have to bid1NT to respond it is better to keep quiet|pg||
nt|pef: well that's interesting. on board 70 west did raise the 1s opening bid to 2 and bought it there|pg||
nt|daman: 2 IMPs here    and IMP there    they all add up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal [but not 19-20]|pg||
nt|iceking: dull 4@S coming up|pg||
nt|pef: who should have bid again north/south?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfh: snickers around the table|pg||
nt|kit: neither -- what's wrong with defending 2@S?|pg||
nt|pef: 2s is probably down 2|pg||
nt|pef: and it is vul. so I guess kit's right|pg||
nt|mikam1: or three...and opps are vulnerable|pg||
nt|pef: as always :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 not 5+@S|pg||
nt|jade: I keep thinking "OR" as Operating Room.....maybe not so far from reality |pg||
mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd: if it's not natural, he's not going to make it|pg||
nt|kit: After 2 rounds of spades, the discarding will be very difficult on the run of the diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S splinter|pg||
nt|kit: It will be tough to stay out of game after the light opening bid by West|pg||
nt|pelu: but Diamond-Platnick has also played junior for US - won gold back in 1991 i Ann arbor |pg||
nt|puncher99: 4sx?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H could work out very badly, and i dont see the upside for a swing. you might get pd off effective lead onto hopeless one|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jade: at least when they were a lot younger|pg||
nt|kit: If Greco had overcalled 1@S, he would have quickly been in 4@S doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss  3N North|pg||
nt|jade: interesting|pg||
nt|kit: And the splinter keeps them out of the bad 3NT contract and into the decent (but unlucky) 5@C contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-(1@D)    EW never bid @S but Hurd led them|pg||
nt|kit: The double may say:  I can't stand a heart lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  why unfortunate?|pg||
nt|jade: not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: hard to believe he passed   even with a limited system|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW are playing Precision, which limits East's hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree - I would have bid too|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont trust that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with S playing it, is there a clear way to set 5@c?|pg||
nt|daman: they used drury in the OR    with a limited system|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the low lead from an odd number|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: S knows 3N may be best or only game, but the path there would be murky, and slow bidding might help EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd: bet it's not Michaels|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond will need to show stuff in both suit, probably by pitching middle spade first, and Platnick will have to work out the position and what to hold|pg||
nt|puncher99: give him the hawaii trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there once was a day when precision 1@C got some respect from opponents    but just 1 day|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe  DBL =  i|pg||
nt|iceking: did not think they would get to 5th level here NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like to bid more   [inversion]|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C will not make on any normal club play|pg||
nt|pef: pretty impossible on the east hand|pg||
nt|mikam1: Really light for some of us :)|pg||
nt|pef: closer to a weak 2 bid for some of us :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  entering 800 territory now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge thinking|pg||
nt|royhughes: He might be thinking "Why should I be defending 3Hx when we have a big lead?"|pg||
mb|p|an|with a shrug|nt|psyck: I play a defense to 1@c were every bid including pass & double has to be alerted :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass would show a defensive hand|pg||

pc|cT|nt|kit: heart shift would be double-dummy|pg||
nt|kit: you guys are looking at all 4 hands.  Lall isn't.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has to take a deep position in the @c suit|pg||
nt|jade: I understand|pg||
nt|kit: he will either play low to the 10 or low to the ace.  Both fail.|pg||
nt|kit: Only question is down 1 or2 -- will declarer judge from the auction to take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will Platnick guess the hearts and hold it to down one?|pg||
nt|royhughes: Really well.  A bit tired running after Evan all the time.|pg||

nt|royhughes: Keep it up Barry, you're doing great|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: maybe players were asking questions??|pg||

nt|iceking: ok np|pg||

nt|iceking: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C was off the wall if you ask me|pg||
nt|iceking: yes not a fan either|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, too balanced non offensive hand  for 4@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry ... missed the play with screen lockup|pg||
nt|jade: just thinking about if there is a double dummy line|pg||
nt|cherilou: best color commentary there is|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's such a surreal situation here, it's hard to think of things to say|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2500 kibs at this stage is pretty hardcore|pg||
pc|s3|nt|iceking: np|pg||
nt|roswolf: only the 500|pg||
nt|andyv:  now can't make with 2 @s taps|pg||
nt|puncher99: he beat his partner to the x|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yorkbeach:  are they playing that 1NT would show 5@s?|pg||
nt|daman: EW are a bit shell shocked from the hands today|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mikam1: Hehe...on board 71, South had a chance to let the opponents play in 1@H!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: getting a lot of Sport analogies like Nascar and the probowl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: even got one guy to say we all want to see good bridge !! well card play maybe :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|pef: well we were all wrong on board 71.  playing a strong club they stopped in 1s|pg||
nt|pef: that's because the jxxxx of hearts overcalled 1h!|pg||
nt|mikam1: Woolridge overcalled, yes....and not unreasonably|pg||
nt|mikam1: an 8 count with Jxxxxx - aggressive, but ok|pg||
nt|pef: because you want a heart lead?|pg||
nt|pef: I suppose you might|pg||
nt|kit: Assuming stand signals, I see no reason why South should shift to a spade -- North did discard 10 of spades first.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Why he should or shouldn't?|pg||
nt|kit: why he shouldn't|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
nt|kit: when you can't work out the hand, follow partner's signal.  He may know something you don't.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Partner said to do it, so you do it....I'm with you|pg||
nt|cherilou: even tho he's -800 he might have created a game swing if opps went to 5@C---easy route in other room to 3NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: good technique by declarer is to lead the 2 of diamonds on his next to last diamond -- if opponents miscount, they may think it is your last diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but you might too, and then lead a side suit prematurely:)|pg||
nt|kit: and note that he ruffed with 6 of diamonds, so he may have exactly that in mind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no he was just unvlocking in case the 4 of diamonds was hidden and the trump 8 anbd 9 thus both fell on the first round|pg||
nt|pelu: pass = Poker|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mikam1: so....he shifted to a diamond  :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Someone asked about the 2@h bid.  I really don't have much idea what the best thing to do is.  Maybe just pass and hope they go down in something.  But 2H could have created ...|pg||
nt|royhughes: something good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad tables his hand and claims |pg||
mc|5|nt|marlowepi: W planning later discards|pg||
nt|kit: This is not easy at all.  Defense doesn't know if declarer is 2-2 in rounded suits -- he could be 3-1 either way.  Can they communicate?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he knows spade is safe|pg||
nt|andyv:  their carding is standard|pg||
nt|jade: and that pesky A@D  and a ruff|pg||
nt|kit: I have no problem overriding partner's signal when I can work out the hand and know it is right, but South can't do that here.|pg||

nt|iceking: didnt like 5@C either|pg||
nt|andyv:  you let @c ride|pg||
nt|kit: That's what GIB would do|pg||
nt|kit: actually the high diamond from the doubleton made it more likely that hearts were 3-2|pg||
nt|mikam1: We've quieted down considerably...the lead remains at 44|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Ill bet Hurd guesses which major|pg||
nt|andyv:  leaping michaels?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: leaping Michaels but how many weak 2@d bids are there?|pg||
nt|royhughes: The weak two in diamonds makes it tough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: seen it plenty over MAJORS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: weak 2D is an unjustly maligned tool|pg||
nt|andyv:  wasn't opened in OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: they couldnt|pg||
nt|cherilou: hooray! old-fashioned weak 2@D bid strikes!|pg||
mb|6C|nt|marlowepi: S will have to make do with this lot until a good hand comes along|pg||
nt|kit: if he does, declare can cash ace of clubs, low heart to king and ace, and scores the last trick in hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D has some potential value, takes away support double etc.....the danger in mildish preempts with lots of trumps and no values it that opps might be able yo make whatever they bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and your telling them extent of your fit might drive them there|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  European championships go on for almaost 2 weeks for example|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss and gitelman have no reason to think they havent picked up imps|pg||
nt|puncher99: as i used to say  wheres all the cheery laughter?|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. on board 93 here Hurd decided not to safety play the @h suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Yes, but North might have discarded another spade with 5 too|pg||
nt|kit: Hurd can certainly bid a small, but he has the problem of setting clubs as trumps and inviting a grand -- difficult|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, Marshall, I'll let you justly malign it:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is a considerably more effective weak 2 than 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S hand almost good enough to open old fashioned 4NT asking for Aces|pg||
nt|kit: Wooldridge would have liked to have been able to bid old-fashioned (not keycard) Blackwood there.|pg||
nt|kit: Yes Andy.  I think it is good enough.|pg||
nt|kit: so you gamble on the jack of spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was hedging against specs who wanted the J@s:)|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is transfer, in case somebody can't figure that out.|pg||
nt|mikam1: On the other side of the argument|pg||
nt|kit: true|pg||
nt|mikam1: Do you think the North hand is worth a Drury bid here?|pg||
nt|kit: only if they open very light|pg||
nt|mikam1: Wow - look at the hand that Diamond didn't overcall!!|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but in Bermuda bowl u normal play 2 x 20 every day|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Amazing really|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'm the biggest chicken in America and I would bid!|pg||
nt|kit: so he just gave up.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd claims he didnt know how to bid it|pg||
nt|cherilou: tired bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge says ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: sits up in his chair to go to work|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sonce other side may not have this toy, 6C is ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: scratches his beard and fans out his cards|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@d looks clearcut|pg||
nt|henryb:  But the margin will now be 49 with two boards to play, so the final aria can begin|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: well this looks a bit high|pg||
nt|kit: but we don't know how they play an opening 4NT -- may have some other meaning|pg||
nt|andyv:  main thing you don't want to do is what happened in the Vandy this year when both teams bid 7@d missing the A@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no, it doesn't promise 8|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson making a slam try, and game isn't making|pg||
nt|puncher99: fred should of x this one also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: this one tuffer.Fred not sure he wants a NT lead :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: will be unlucky that East will be playing it, so heart lead is obvious|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cherilou: S took the passive action here|pg||
nt|kit: I would never let partner play a 4-4 spade fit with that heart suit.  KQJ10xx is called trumps|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe 4@D (which asks major I guess), then 5@D, and over partner's likely 5NT, 6@C|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mikam1: EW can make 4@H at least|pg||
nt|puncher99: u got nothing to lose and a lot to gain|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry . forget the lead but you all knew what it was|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: forgot|pg||
nt|kit: That makes it clear that he has grand slam interest, since if he knows he is playing in clubs why else would he bid 5@D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cherilou: NS make 4@D so only 1 or 2 imps either way|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s can make some @D so maybe a small gain|pg||
nt|kit: Now, do they play 6@C is to play?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree. f onyl to fend off any default tendency toards a spade lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: Played from West side would have gotten club lead|pg||
nt|kit: Would he finesse and risk going down 2 after the overcall?|pg||
nt|kit: We will never know.|pg||
nt|kit: guess he decided that with partner a passed hand and him holding Qxx of spades it wasn't right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  here they are playing either 3 * 15 or 2 * 15|pg||
nt|puncher99: he knows hearts are not breaking well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|kit: at least Wooldridge thinks so.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he may get overruled here|pg||
nt|kit: But is it to play, or TO PLAY?|pg||
nt|kit: in other words, is it a suggestion or a command?|pg||
nt|andyv:  + side for NS is there are 4 small slams that make|pg||
nt|andyv:  so they just need to stay out of 6@d|pg||
nt|wstuart: I hope Hurd doesn't interpret this as bid 7 with a 3rd round 1@C control.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S should fake-ask for queen of spades, then correct the 5S reply to 6C. maybe that would be the muzzle sequence|pg||
nt|andyv:  a new meaning to walking the dog, Marshall?|pg||
nt|kit: the question is, have they discussed the meaning of 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: If Hurd corrects to 6@H, that will be okay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes my remark was addressed to that in a roundabout way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because there could be two paths to 6C|pg||
nt|lml: oh you mean south|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't think this S will pass 6@H - it wouldn't be natural - he would correct to 6@S which will be sure to be playable.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "we've agreed spades"  _sure but how about clubs, instead, the suit i only bid once"  "no how about hearts instead, the suit i only bid once?"|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d was dbld in OR on 42 and 3 imp gain to Bathurst|pg||
nt|lml: I would open 1C too|pg||
nt|pef: despite all of that it's still hard to believe not overcalling on that hand|pg||
nt|kit: but too big a position for me|pg||
nt|mikam1: Still...a big position to take..|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps a case for playing 3 sets of 20 rather than 4 of 15|pg||
nt|daman: EW always play only 1/2 of the boards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4D is easy, sure, but unless pd is void in spades, no grand, and how bullishly will he Q missing the minor aces|pg||
nt|henryb:  The margin will now be 49 with two boards to compare, so the final aria can begin|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wstuart: In several of my partnerships, 6@C would be a 3rd rd control ask.|pg||
nt|kit: Now, will Wooldridge respect this?|pg||
nt|kit: I think overcalling is the coward's bid -- passing is the brave bid|pg||
nt|pef: you might actually get to four hearts if you bid 2d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mikam1: I understand the danger of Qxx of spades, but you might miss a game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pef: 2s by north probably, now double responsive by east is possible which might get you there|pg||
nt|pef: kit makes a good point, people don't always realize that passing can be much braver or riskier (depending on|pg||
nt|mikam1: You actually could overcall, double (scary), or bid 1N (semi-scary and strange)|pg||
nt|pef: your point of view) than bidding|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ferlema: last minutes photos from the final by Catalina Bathurst click here: www.confsudbridge.org|pg||
nt|puncher99: u come off a x on prev hand u dont let them up from the mats|pg||
nt|andyv:  how about just play all 5 level bids, except raise of minor as exclusion with support for minor bid?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  we all know that 6@h, 6@s and 6N make|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, 6@s may have saved or gained 2 imps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i were joel, it would be hard. if i dont get to play 6C, he dont get to play 6H:)|pg||
nt|kit: if no ace of hearts lead, makes 7 |pg||
nt|kit: rare that you can discard 6 losing hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes 6H inferior for that reason:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maych decided by 1 IMP|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@h the more tempting lead|pg||
nt|kit: and they got to 6@C in other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S ran from 6H so i think we wll see a D lead|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine he will lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: big difference when you know they arent about to run the first 8 solid trumps on you glenn|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i couldnt agree more. risk reward ratio all in your favor. your legions of loyal BBO fans wont disdain you if valiant parthian shot goes agley|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: keep in mind . fred and brad having a decent set|pg||
nt|puncher99: u stop ur pard from leading a spade |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: might have picked up 20|pg||
nt|puncher99: he knows u prob got 2 aces and heart shortage|pg||
nt|andyv:  right.  Hard for them to realize boards 93, 96 and 100 aren't what they should have been.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: even the slam hands cant be counted cause their teammates can cover them. may even bid the grand on 96|pg||
nt|puncher99: so u lead ur best holding to tap|pg||
nt|puncher99: ur values are prob not in spades because u didnt x 1n for takeout|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: The whole point is you do what you can. you still got another qtr . So no need to press on a board like this|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure why south can t hold the @s Ace|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: when all else fails, consider your own name|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a 3 imp gain now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: fingering the 6 of @hs|pg||
nt|ritong: not mentioning @s AJxxx:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: oh right -- he doesn't know trumps aren't 2-2, so would always go up ace|pg||
nt|jade: another 6 to Bathurst|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  looks tob heading down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: optimism on part of trailing team about potential slam swings needs to be tempered by likelihood that the leading team will bid them too as quasi-insurance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: yea yea 8th. I got it|pg||
nt|kit: when down by a lot you can only hope for not too many flat boards and that you get some things right they get wrong.|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs can be tough:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: they are just as long as qtrs for my purposes|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Kit|pg||
nt|lc: Normally, in this situation, East's shift to a low one (the deuce) would show an honor.  Apparently, Gitelman-Moss don't have that agreement.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wooldridge asking questions . Brad answering answers|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play in middle of hand 3rd and low |pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Bridge World emissaries|pg||
nt|lc: As do most, but with the exception that from xxx you don't lead low.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h5|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  another couple of IMPs to Bathurst|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Anyway, this time passing was wrong big time|pg||
nt|mikam1: maybe South should even preempt in 3rd seat |pg||
nt|pef: wooldridge also opened 1d on the west hand for a similar result on board 72|pg||
nt|mikam1: Possible to have done that too|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Gitelman able to open 2@D East  on previous board   that will make it very tough for  Hurd-Wooldridge to find 7@C|pg||

nt|joest: this looks very hard to bid indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if they have a bid that says  "now i'm better than 8-11"|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  who leads the BAM this set, 5-4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Would you double if playing equal level conversion Kit?|pg||
nt|pef: so i guess Mike and I are dinosaurs because I too wouldn't have even considered opening 1d on that hand.  a really good Bailey weak 2 bid, though :)|pg||
nt|daman: this is now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|lc: Just a warning that it could happen here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so you disappointed all your fans, Larry|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pef: so that's possibly a double digit swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: board 73, I mean|pg||
nt|pef: although if e/w get to 4 hearts, certainly possible n/s will be 4s at that vul.|pg||
nt|kit: diamond is thinking big thoughts here|pg||
nt|mikam1: In the other room they did bid to 4@S...up to 5@H now with the auction not over|pg||
nt|pef: wow, I'm told they are now at 5H (bid over 4S) in the poen room|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would double (thats why you play equal level conversions where correcting clubs to diamonds does not show extra vlaues |pg||
nt|mikam1: They can make a slam here|pg||
nt|kit: I would have made takeout double also on last hand, but style has to permit it.|pg||
nt|mikam1: A good hand for equal level conversion method, agreed Steve|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like 5H is cold.  unusual to see one table 3 levels higher than the other|pg||
nt|mikam1: I don't play it, so I couldn't do that|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond will certainly bid a small slam -- the danger is bidding a grand|pg||
nt|mikam1: How to handle Diamond's hand?|pg||
nt|pef: south is still thinking on whether to bid 5 spades (or maybe double) in the open room on board 73|pg||
nt|mikam1: Do you show your hand, or try to find out about partner's?|pg||
nt|kit: An immediate grand slam force isn't the worst bid I've ever seen -- odds on no club or heart loser decent|pg||
nt|psyck: I would hacoby|pg||
nt|kit: but it doesn't work well this time|pg||
nt|pef: he passed, I am told.  I dont see how 5H can fail so the will be a 13 imp swing to bathurst almost surely|pg||
nt|kit: West cannot possibly show this hand -- he has to take complete control whatever route he takes|pg||
nt|mikam1: Agreed - specs suggest splinter then RKC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Best thing for Wooldridge. A 2NT preempt|pg||
nt|andyv:  as spec points out have this possibility: 4@D=slam interest and asking major, 4@H=P/C, 4@S=RKC for @C, 4NT=quantitative, 5@C=to play, 5@D+=exclusion agreeing @C|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lc: Nobody likes to watch me play down 90.  It's more Zia's thing to try that than mine.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: as he did against me in the GNTs in New Orleans|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|pef: a lot of good partnerships now play advanced jacoby methods.  that would allow west to find out lots of things about east's hand|pg||
nt|mikam1: That's fine if it this discounts diamond ace|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pef: I really don't like 4 diamonds, what do you expect partner to bid?  it uses so much room|pg||
nt|mikam1: So a 13 imp swing to Bathurst on 73|pg||
nt|robinswr: with 3 keys east should bid 4@h|pg||
nt|kit: how can West possibly find out about the queen of hearts, or partner's exact club/heart length?  Unless playing a relay system, he can't.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, absolutely, assuming last train is clear to them|pg||
nt|mikam1: Unless 4@D showed a void, then I agree with Steve...shouldn't signoff|pg||
nt|mikam1: Eric, do we know if 4@D was a void?|pg||
nt|pef: the way Allan Falk and I play jacoby I could find out about club control and whether he had third round heart control and stop in 6|pg||
nt|robinswr: over 4@d, 4@s shows the worst, bidding over 4! shows the best and bidding !4H shows an inbetween hand saying nothing about hearts |pg||
nt|pef: and also about whether he had a or ak of diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: bidding over 4@s|pg||
nt|mikam1: We've got to teach you where to put your exclamation marks Steve :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
nt|robinswr: last train|pg||
nt|kit: I truly don't think West can expect East to make sensible evaluations here.  Queen of clubs worthless.  Queen of hearts gold.  And so on.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play has finished at other table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of us have more  experience coming back from the -74 yard line than others:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jade: they make a fair number of @H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h or a game try?|pg||
mb|3S!|an|!hs slam try|nt|ritong: good occasion to underline the " the other major" gadget|pg||
mb|d|nt|wstuart: South has an incredibly wide range for his bidding.|pg||
nt|royhughes: What a perfect fit these cards are|pg||
mb|r!|nt|roswolf: 3@S is a testosterone bid|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@S another agressive action |pg||
nt|cherilou: yes it's a 14-16 NT right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: for both pairs|pg||
nt|cherilou: Mighty big|pg||
nt|iceking: i would not have thought about it have to admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east is clearly contemplating game|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3nhAS NO PLAY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 27  platnick-diamond stay out of trouble  4@S Wooldridge [who thought long time about bidding more]|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3 has no play|pg||
nt|iceking: on a normal @C Jack lead its doomed|pg||
nt|cherilou: or @H lead or @S lead or small @D lead :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you have to wait for a heart control, you might wait forever |pg||
nt|lc: When you decide to play from down 90, you incur scores such as -1,000 as here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: lose by 150 or 1 . No difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: for those specs out there who don't know what last train is--it means when you have only one bid to make below the level of your game, that bid doesn't necessarily show a control ...|pg||
nt|pef: in that suit, simply that you had something extra and didn't want to just sign off|pg||
nt|mikam1: So apparently Platnick did not show the diamond ace|pg||
nt|psyck: looking at the rkc response, 4@d was a void|pg||
nt|pef: so in this case, 4 hearts over 4 diamonds would be last train|pg||
nt|robinswr: or splinter followed by keycard after signoff is exclusion|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now John has to decide whether to risk the grand facing AKxxx of trumps and the rest unknown|pg||
nt|psyck: if 4@d void, i would not bid 4@h either|pg||
nt|pef: that's a pretty unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pef: I mean 4 diamonds being a void splinter|pg||
nt|kit: So Diamond has found out the important stuff-- now he has to guess.|pg||
nt|kit: I would bid the grand holding his cards -- and be wrong again.|pg||
nt|psyck: i play void splinters over 1M, but only with limited hands, not big ones...|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes...all he has to go on was the signoff by Platnick with AKxxx of trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: even when partner couln't bid 4@h|pg||
nt|mikam1: maybe he can make one more try|pg||
nt|kit: which tells him nothing.  If partner were 5-2-3-3, the grand would be reasonable|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|kit: even opposite no high cards|pg||
nt|pef: maybe without terribly fancy methods you should bid 2h over 1s.  if partner raises that's sort of bad because you have to worry (but can probably find out about ) the queen of ...|pg||
nt|pef: hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd waves at the rdbl Fred nods|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s means " i like the idea of playing a @h slam", not related to the @s control or suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  great set of boards...in the end, Bathurst build up too big a lead to overcome but a great effort by both teams.|pg||
mb|3N|an|quasi alert|nt|kit: 18 HCP, but the dreaded 4-3-3-3 -- and he is right to open 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind the 18 hcp, I do mind the 2 tens|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but give Greco   K93  AJ32 98 AQ73   and 4@S looks good   so we shouldn't be too harse about 3@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's a minimum 1N opener|pg||
nt|iceking: even if Hampson had passed 2@S N would bal i believe |pg||
nt|kit: If partner is 5-2-4-2, grand is great opposite AKxxx of spades and out|pg||
nt|kit: It is worth noting that so far 94 IMPs scored this set, so if they had all gone to Diamond they would have won|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mikam1: Uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: but the more diamonds you have opposite splinter the better your hand. Having one diamond is the worst|pg||
nt|kit: I think it is wrong to try to bring partner into the loop here -- just have to make the decision yourself|pg||
nt|mikam1: This might fetch a grand bid, unluckily|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h finesse works as you would expect against the opening bidder|pg||
mb|4D|nt|iceking: then after p p 3@S looks rather normal |pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I thought he might|pg||
nt|wstuart: On an eaerlier hand he opened a 4432 14 count with 1NT now he bids 1NT with a very controllish 18 count|pg||
nt|kit: If you always deduct a point for 4-3-3-3, you won't be far wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: they play 14-16 but apparently not in 4th seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: If you count each ace as 4.5 points you won't be far wrong either.|pg||
nt|jade: as minimum hands go, this one is pretty good|pg||
nt|cherilou: A huge round of applause to Fred for giving us BBO and the experience of watching these matchs. There just aren't words to thank him!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hearty congfratulations to the bathhurst team who wired the field in this high-power trials, and look as if they would do same if the ditance were doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd writing a long note to fred|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Brad looks bored|pg||
nt|marlowepi: kudos also to diamond team fopr baliant efforts to close the gap and refusal to throw in the towel|pg||

nt|ritong: an other fine shot by hampson greco|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I don't quote commentators...too much work|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the way I heard Eric Rodwell describe it;  frequent upgrades infrequent downgrades.  Opening a 15-17 N with that hand would very much not be my choice.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 2@h and E jumped to 4|pg||
nt|kit: not clear what declarer should do here|pg||
nt|kit: fortunately for him, if he plays low it only costs an overtrick|pg||
nt|andyv:  stiff @d led in OR and ducked by declarer|pg||
nt|kit: Would Grue really be underleading king of diamonds when 2 small clubs in dummy makes club return pretty attractive from any holding?|pg||

nt|lc: Yeah, but there has to be SOME   where you should pack it in.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: my view is that your national team will obviously have great ability, so you should help them with stamina by playing on. with screens down and barking dogs etc:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes it was a dream set of deals for swingage|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: must know his partner wasnt serious from the 3nt bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfh: they will all play the national swiss tomorrow if they WD :P|pg||

nt|mikam1: Closed room just bid 7|pg||
nt|lc: Sometimes there is a "second chance" event -- where the finals loser then plays another match.  In that case, conceding (to rest up for the next match) makes more sense.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  so N may be trying to talk E out of @d hook if he held both red Kings|pg||
nt|kit: but it is too double-dummy.  For all North knows, 2 club tricks might be cashing.|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room west did respond 2h eventually east blackwooded and bid 5nt, west bid 6h, east signed off in 6 spades, west is now thinking about whether to respect the signoff ...|pg||
nt|pef: having not bid the grand over 5nt|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: they bid the grand in other room, so a bunch of IMPs coming back|pg||
nt|kit: and another 13 IMPs here -- so 107 IMPs total so far for the 15 board segment|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: the real solution is when the margin reaches a certain threshold, the system kicks into pay-per-view|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|andyv:  S can only hope that 3N wasn't reached at other table|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: or, as happened, not made|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  3Nt and 4@h both needed the @h finesse - but 3NT more down if it failed|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|psyck: Penultimate deal here. Thanks to my co-commentators Magnus, Cheri, Geoffrey, & Al.  Good job by our operator Richard. Thanks to the kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  but merely playing Q@s, cash @h and exit @s was enough to make 3 or am I missing something?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: wd south keeping his eye on the ball|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: torture|pg||
nt|marlowepi: friends, Rolands, countrymen, i bid you all goodnight:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: thx all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one more deal in this set i believe|pg||
nt|wstuart: For 5:3 IMP odds I would like to play 3NT 1000 times on those csards.|pg||
