nt|pef: chip, of course is scouting to see who will be USA2.  He's part of the Fleisher team that won last|pg||
nt|pef: year and is USA1|pg||
nt|chip: Hi All.  NS play a strong club system, so a lead directing 1C wasn't an option in third seat, and 2C a bit rich.|pg||

nt|joest: 2@d seems to be Multi and 3@d natural|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 @d?|pg||
nt|joest: I wonder if south can bid something 'on his own' here to play that is noncorrectable.|pg||
nt|joest: anyway I'm guessing 4@h is pass or correct and that that's what Chambers will do|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: yeah 4@d is a good guess|pg||
nt|joest: 4@s clearly is not pass or correct|pg||
nt|joest: over 5@d pass pass back to south we'll see what he does|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 4M would be own suit - and had to bid 4@d to get prds suit in..|pg||
nt|joest: he might try 5@h to give north options|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: I would guess that 4@D is bid your suit and 4M not correctable; even 4@C might be ART requesting transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: S prepraring to bid 5@H next|pg||
nt|joest: i would|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||

nt|puncher99: welcome spectators commetators and operator|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|joest: these cards fit beautifully for ns|pg||
nt|joest: even with the AQ offside|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to make a club trick on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Without diamond lead S could have set up the spades |pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: not if he plays for hearts 3-1 with west having the length..|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: quiet start to this set|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators and Jon, Sigurbj√∂rn and Glenn|pg||
nt|puncher99: thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator is Howard|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|puncher99: looks like making 1 is par|pg||
nt|jbgood: Diamond wants 1 nt contract for the remainding boards...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  hi Howard|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|mc|7|nt|jbgood: but a tricky contract to play|pg||
pg||
qx|o32|st||md|2SJ4HKJ73DA97CA753,SQ532HQ4DJ4CKT642,S96HA862DQT32CQJ8,SAKT87HT95DK865C9|sv|e|nt|athene: 2@C a definite possibility i think with such a good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but maybe he keeps that for NV|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2H|an|good 2S|nt|pef: many good pairs use some method to distinguish types of raises after a t/o double|pg||
mb|3H|an|Constructive??|nt|pef: 2h there is a sound+ 2s raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you overbid to 4@H with north trying to induce a phantom sacrifice, but at this vulnerability opps aren't likely to bid 4@S unless they expect to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: either side can easily get too high on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 3h is already too high for ns, 3s would be too high for e/w|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|pef: michael rosenberg pointed out that e/w actually can make 3s because of the really fortunate club position|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: NS just have to avoid panicking and trying to cash diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: no, michael's right (of course)|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure - what about if the defence force dummy with a third round of hearts immediately?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, both minors are sort of "frozen". They can't play diamonds and if they rise A of clubs, declarer gets to pitch his D's|pg||
nt|pef: although two more hearts here makes it difficult|pg||
nt|smoller: I am not so sure of 3@S - look like declarer cant manage 3 times hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the standard defence when you see a threatening side suit in dummy is to force dummy|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, it was a close decision for W with Qx of hearts, but the rest of his hand is good for offense.|pg||
nt|pef: simple looking actually quite complicated|pg||
nt|chip: And 2H was most often a 3 trump raise.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|pef: well greco found by far the best continuation|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: and so did hampson|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: ok so best for declarer is trump to ace, club, i guess|pg||
nt|chip: If they tap the dummy, as they are doing, can kill the club suit due to dummy's poor spade spots (not second entry to dummy).|pg||
nt|athene: but he's short of an entry to dummy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @S53 just not doing the job|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: even with 2-2 break|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|pef: well that beats it quickly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|smoller: a bit amazing they can find out to eliminate club tricks this way - very well done|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|athene: 3@H would make double-dummy (so the Law does apply in theory) but declarer lost to the doubleton @HQ, as you would expect|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
mc|8|nt|chip: If declarer played low at trick one (looking like someone with Jxx) might have gotten N to lead a D.|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, I don't see the point of the queen|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|joest: well since they hit us with Multi on the last hand it looks as though Multi is for bad weak twos|pg||
nt|joest: and 'weak two's are for good ones|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|jbgood: 8-9 - 11 rather popular these days|pg||
nt|joest: responsive double probably|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: well the heart hook works, the diamond king flops up without a guess|pg||
nt|joest: but still down one b/c of the club slit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: split|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bagman: Defense probably takes two spades and shifts to a club (the diamonds being too dangerous)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  hi everyone, we shout be set up in a minute here|pg||
nt|andyv:  should|pg||
nt|bessi2: well done by diamond-platnick not to compete to 3@s|pg||
nt|puncher99: welcome all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bagman: Wrong again|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|jbgood: strange that EW didnt compete to the 3 level with 9 cards - but ok this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Glenn and Sig|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: it does take a heart ruff to beat 3 spades - so 50 surely no disaster|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't agree though... I would have bid a 4card raise on the west hand immediately|pg||
nt|puncher99: down 2 is probable|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Jon|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bagman: I thought that a dream defense is two spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|jbgood: most would, Sig|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|puncher99: must exit with ruff sluff to get it tho|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|hT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: And believed that N would not go for that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bagman: Diamond after the first spade really surpised me|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bessi2: but then again.. ew will be writing in their plus column after this hand.. and I write way too many 50's and 100's in the minus column|pg||

nt|athene: 1@H is 8-11 pretty much any hand i think|pg||
nt|pef: greco/hampson play 14-16 nts (sometimes 13, occasionally 0+ in third seat nv :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  8-11  not 5 spades|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pef: so he opened their strong 1c|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: the idea is when responder is so limited it's easy to sort out quickly if it's a game or slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: and of course most positives to a strong club are in this range|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Bridge is easy, clubs 4-4, so 9 easy tricks in NT, 10 without a club lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: not sure about the followups here. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: all bids got notes but can't read them from here, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: Well, 9 tricks for NS are easy, its holding EW to 4 that requires a bit of luck.|pg||
nt|athene: he won't want to lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|athene: i assume dummy has shown exactly four hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: he won't want to lead a club, did someone say that?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

mb|3N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|andyv:  15-18- NT |pg||
nt|bessi2: 9 or 10 tricks depending on lead|pg||
nt|puncher99: no club lead 430|pg||
nt|bessi2: 10 tricks MOST probable|pg||
nt|bessi2: club lead is rather silly here in my opinion|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|joest: if declarer has @Sxx @H)KJx @D Ax @C)AKQxxx you might need to do it at trick 3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|joest: even that wouldn't beat it on the lie though|pg||
nt|joest: hi david|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi David|pg||
nt|bagman: If declarer is xx xx Kxx AKQJxx you must not do it at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: somebody forgot a new or rare treatment here it seems|pg||
nt|puncher99: esp when ur pard had a chance to x 2c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  fortunately for NS this will also make|pg||
nt|andyv:  was a dbl made that we missed?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: showed stiff club|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. maybe one should not judge too quickly.. maybe 3N showed @c weakness. what do i know|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: true altho declarer could always guess Ax there.  You would force him to guess the jack by going passive|pg||
nt|joest: the only real shot here is a club switch and a misguess|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: Now N is endplayed in all suits|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: may do well to continue with the queen of hearts anyway, to cut declarer off from the diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: @h 10 was expensive - but natural|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - South played the ten|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|andyv:  ty Howard|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

mb|1C|an|strong|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bramley on his way to showing 17-19 balanced|pg||
mb|1H|an|Spades|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chip: On the prior hand NS got to 5D in the other room, which required a different king of luck: hearts running, and perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: welland psyched a positive to a strong club?|pg||
nt|athene: that's usually sort of a bad thing to do :)|pg||
nt|pef: perhaps 1h is their negative response|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@C is just natural with transfer responses?|pg||
nt|chip: 1c isn't strong, it is most often 11-13 balanced. Here it is the strong balanced version. 1H showed 4+ spades|pg||
nt|pef: ok, the annotation to 1c says strong|pg||
nt|athene: i can imagine someone semi-psyching 1@H transfer in response to a [semi-]natural 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|smoller: Spades are very well places, but defence can set up a diamond ruff or a a promotion in clubs|pg||
nt|pef: he's actually cold for this, isn't he?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|chip: In principle 1c is balanced or clubs, but they like to do it on 5-3-3-2 hands of 17-19 even with a 5 card major.|pg||
nt|pef: both spades onside, it seems like it took a diamond lead to beat it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: two entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: @DQ, heart ruff entries for two spade finesses|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|chip: not easy for the defense to get this right with the E hand hidden. Now makable I think.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wouldn't a club switch have beaten it?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|smoller: South could have played clubs to beat it (I guess)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: yes there should be a trump promotion|pg||
nt|pef: yes, then the 9 of spades comes into play|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|pef: rather unlikely this will be duplicated in the closed room :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|andyv:  nope...push|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|bagman: looks like "We guess them"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Also know as Ghestem|pg||
nt|jbgood: showing a 2-suiter rather than bidding 1 spade|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a modified form of the original - 3@c showed spades and diamonds in the old days|pg||
nt|dburn: or of course clubs and amnesia|pg||
nt|bagman: Ghestem is a very accidend prone way of showing a specific two suiter|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: bad splits for NS here|pg||
nt|andyv:  W going nowhere|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|bessi2: although it allows the contract to make... I feel that a @d lead is the normal lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  club suit impressive holding in vegas|pg||

nt|puncher99: possible swing here  minus in 1n vrs spade partial or game|pg||

nt|Walddk2: With a score of 89% you mean?|pg||
nt|pef: exactly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: alerted 2c|pg||
mb|d|nt|pef: I believe achieving an above average board against them in a club game led to "re-education"|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no room for usual 2-suiter scheme over 2@C really as you need 2nt natural, for one thing|pg||
nt|pef: platnick is probably feeling pretty pleased about his 1n making 2 in the closed room since a club or heart lead beats 1nt several|pg||
nt|athene: west probably wouldn't treat his hand as a red 2-suiter even if he had the opportunity, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: playable in spades too|pg||
nt|pef: what would you guys bid with bramley's hand here?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: well that wasn't his best choice|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|smoller: pass looked as a great winner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't see why he had to bid so fast|pg||
nt|chip: I think Greco will take expection to this.  On the prior deal EW bid 1C (strong) -1D-1N and lost 7 IMPS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: if you aren't going to pass, why not 3@C and play 3n if partner hasn't got four spades|pg||
nt|pef: the spots might be good enough for him to survive this|pg||
nt|chip: He wanted to be declarer to avoid a club lead through, and he did get a friendly lead. Still, 3c then 3S was an attractive alternative (and with the KQ of clubs a questionable ...|pg||
nt|chip: value, an invitational 3s is not unreasonable either)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the problem with 3@C is, if partner bids 3@H (as expected), you can't really bid 3@S because that endplays him if he hasn't got four spades (he can't bid 3NT himself)|pg||
nt|pef: I've noticed that a lot of foreign pairs play 2n forcing (by the east hand) in this situation asking for a description of major lengths|pg||
nt|athene: you could just bid 3@C then 3NT over 3@H hoping partner reads that as showing four sapdes|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pef: I think the positioning of the ace of diamonds and the doubleton in the north hand means that 4s is going down even double dummy here|pg||
nt|pef: interestingly in the closed room e/w stopped in 2nt|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT interesting contract; club lead you can just lead diamonds towards dummy and finesse spades|pg||
nt|athene: try for 1 club, 4 diamonds, 1 heart and 3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: of course much harder on a heart lead but how is that getting found?|pg||
nt|chip: Also, EW seem to only have 9 tricks, though winning the first D not best. NS do need to remove the heart at some point. to beat this.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pef: I think he can pretty much lead anything now and beat this|pg||
nt|athene: i have noticed several times in this event the precision 2@C opener has caused quite a few problems for opps|pg||
nt|athene: quite a limited bid when you play it as 6+ clubs so responder doesn't usually have huge problems with the lost space, but opps do|pg||
nt|chip: If N ruffs this, then needs to lead a heart back.|pg||
nt|pef: while we are waiting, perhaps the vugraph operator can let us know if there was any interesting discussion over the bidding of the previous board?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: There was none...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pef: I guess roy's response was routine|pg||
nt|athene: i assume bramley didn't open 1@S because he didn't want to wrongside 3nt (partner likely to respond 1nt)|pg||
nt|athene: so he just hides the fifth spade and treats his hand as strong bal|pg||
nt|pef: I think ruffing here was a mistake.  if he playslow and north ruffs, as chip said, north now has to play a heart back--at least there was a chance of going wrong, now almost none|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: My old eyes just can't read most of the notes.  Maybe I should ask them all to print and in crayon|pg||
nt|chip: Now defense is in better shape as declarer can't take another spade finesse. Probably best to throw a D.|pg||
nt|pef: bramley welland play 1c is either natural or various nt ranges, possibly with 5 card majors.  one of the ranges is 17-19 which is what he had|pg||
nt|athene: oh right |pg||
nt|athene: so systemically he couldn't open it 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: or at least he had the option of 1@C anyway|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, and routine for them to open a club with a 5 card major and a 5-3-3-2 hand if out of their 1N opening range (14-16)|pg||
nt|pef: correct (according to their system notes)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco fans his hand, folds it, puts it down and leans back|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c6|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: ..ok, he finds the heart lead anyway - not much else to do by that point|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that the @C10 might be showing a heart card|pg||
nt|athene: an amusing possibility here is @DJ, ruffed by north, then @HK |pg||
nt|athene: east ruffs and plays @SA and @SJ and north can win but then has to lead into dummy, or north can unblock and let his partner win the last club|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: oh well. 3@d may be silly.. certainly no fit guaranteed|pg||
nt|andyv:  over 1@c, W chose to show @s with his first bid and E just put it in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and they are on their way...|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart goes on a diamond and two ruffs add up to 12 tricks; no need to set up the spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Still they are a couple of bids short of the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: guess he has shown 6 cl and 1 sp - and denied 4 hearts - so guess they will get there|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: W might have shown a goodish hand with short spades;  4@D probably kickback|pg||

nt|bagman: What would be the best way to get it; take the spade ace now or lead something else...|pg||
nt|bagman: That's probably what he's thinking|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon he'll lead the @SA, I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c normal one round force and natural doesn't improve W's holding|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: i guess a heart|pg||
nt|bagman: good guess|pg||
nt|jbgood: would have been my lead anyway|pg||
nt|bagman: Now Diamond must work out how he survives 3-0 clubs; needs first to guess that and then manage 12th trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Diamond is trying to guess who has the club void|pg||
nt|bagman: Of course the clubs are 2-1 and the slam is laydown|pg||
nt|bagman: but it's too late if you misplay at trick 2|pg||
nt|bagman: or trick 1|pg||
nt|jbgood: some people claim that "diamond against slam" is the right thing - but against Diamond that cannot be right|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|bagman: I think that declarer can handle 3-0 trumps from S Qxx|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|dburn: correct technique in this position is to play the opening leader (if anyone) for a void in trumps|pg||

mb|2N|an|limit +|nt|smoller: Yes, Welland has more spades than usual|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: the thin double means welland likely to get trumps right|pg||
nt|athene: he will see from the opening lead that north hasn't got @CAK so he really should have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|chip: They also opened 1S in the other room, but didn't double. Question about no 4C splinter, but perhaps that is not on after a double.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still, just an overtrick this time|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: misunderstanding over 3@C perhaps?|pg||
nt|pef: looks like guessing the spade will now be a lot more important than an overtrick|pg||
nt|chip: If 3C is a game try, seems like an overbid with all that junk.  5c looks like exclusion, but can't be. Maybe a delayed splinter?|pg||
nt|athene: welland has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart starts to put out 5D card then corrects to 5S|pg||
nt|athene: he should be making whatever his weakest bid is - maybe he thought 3@C showed a minimum here (2nt system on) but bramley thought otherwise|pg||
nt|chip: Looks like they may well get to clubs or a slam.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: Should note that this is a complicated new system for bramley, though 4N makes a lot more sense. Now will presumably guess the spade as noted to win a (scary) IMP|pg||

nt|chip: As I noted earlier, 4s would not be a winning action if partner had long clubs and only 3S. Slow 4C might suggest that, but really in this auction doesn't point to anything much ...|pg||

nt|athene: 1nt looks ok over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: Yes Chip. N could be thinking, bur hardly possible|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: Here S has a nice hand but his partner is nearly broke; NS can make 5@C|pg||
nt|dburn: science gained some measure of revenge on 21, where North-South were able to stay out of a rather strange 4-3 heart fit at this table|pg||
nt|dburn: so 8 IMPs went back to Welland, though the blame cannot entirely be ascribed to the various methods employed|pg||

nt|bagman: Fillers in minors and top cards in majors|pg||
nt|dburn: if it was natural, pass is possible and 5@d is possible - close call|pg||
nt|bagman: Picture a minor two suiter worth bidding 3@D; there should be play in 6m|pg||
nt|dburn: if it was Blackwood, 5@c is right, and if no one knows what it was, anything can happen|pg||
nt|jbgood: S cannot bid more than 5 now - could even be 2 club losers|pg||
nt|bagman: What would you lead from E against 5@C?|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, Gitelman made 3NT despite taking no tricks with his partner's seven-card club suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: but the jack of hearts and the spade pips in dummy were more than adequate compensation|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: so S th 5@c was natural on his natural 4 nt|pg||
nt|dburn: and Chambers seems now to have taken the view that everything was natural|pg||
nt|dburn: let us hope that North does not decide that South must have a lot of solid clubs and just have been asking for aces|pg||
nt|dburn: otherwise one of the more serious violations of a certain Law is about to take place|pg||
nt|jbgood: going down anyway...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: has 6NT out and thinking|pg||
nt|jbgood: and unbiddable after w's pass|pg||
mb|r|nt|bessi2: agressive dbl.. not sure how I feel about it... on the one hand pd is passed.. but on the other passing breeds losing.. I am torn :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  problem with dbl is it also gives road map to opps|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bessi2: VERY true.. but for some reason.. such considerations never enter my mind when deciding whether to bid or not|pg||
nt|jbgood: pderhaps W had done better just to show his hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: diamond cant sit in this i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  it will be difficult now for EW to envision slam so they should be satisfied with game...now only question of which one.|pg||
nt|bessi2: diamond is perhaps smelling blood in the water.. envisioning pd with 5@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: thanks for nice company guys (kibs included) - got to go now - see you|pg||
nt|puncher99: bye|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye Jon|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: well, at least they avoided that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Diamond didn't smell enough blood|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c does not play that badly|pg||
nt|andyv:  even on @c lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @s suit can be set up|pg||
nt|bessi2: difficult to judge.. he knows the opps have no values.. and on this hand.. pd with relatively pad @c +@h fit.. and lots of distribution in the opps hands.. 3@cx will still go for ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: -500 to -800... |pg||
nt|andyv:  I think best is 500 and lose 3 or 4 imps|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: and this is a good news bad news hand with a vengeance|pg||
nt|bagman: S hoping that @DK onside; should have also hoped that diamonds are  not 4-0|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. maybe my analysis is quite off.. -500 seems like the max.. true|pg||
nt|andyv:  for the dbling side|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: the good news is they did not lead a club|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bessi2: maybe it was normal to pass.. could be going for a big number.. and very rarely for less than 500|pg||
nt|bessi2: the big question is what dbl is in the context of his rdbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  not bad lead, and @s back...E may just safety play the hand and play A and K of @hs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: the better news is that West has the king of diamonds|pg||

pc|h2|nt|bagman: Will Diamond switch to clubs having won the @DK?|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  claim time for 5|pg||
mc|11|nt|bessi2: what was he gonna do if @h were 5-0?|pg||
nt|andyv:  curse the bridge gods|pg||
nt|bessi2: ducking the spade was also a safety play.. concedes another ruff sure... but then no more unless qxx with the dbler which is impossible|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would have been the safest route|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: break for a few mins|pg||
nt|bessi2: but maybe this was safe aswell even with 5-0... haven't analysed it fully|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. if @h had been 5-0.. he can then just play a @s... was still safe|pg||
nt|bessi2: and in this case ensured the overtrick... so WELL and CORRECTLY PLAYED :)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bessi2: unless they have some systematic weakness.. then that certainly was a @s opening, at least in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: 4@s is a good contract but easy to go down if declarer goes after @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't see anything in their notes for them not to open 1@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: i wonder why east didn't dbl 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  their style may just not allow them to open that type of 11 count in 1st and 2nd seat...good distribution but very poor spot cards|pg||
nt|bessi2: true.. north's hand is very vulnerable|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: nice landing|pg||

nt|jbgood: slam not bad - takes a di lead to beat any black slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  really?|pg||

pc|s7|nt|bagman: Note that W plays a club to the queen first to safe JTxx North|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bagman: He cannot cash 5 club tricks if clubs are 4-0 but 4 are enough for the game|pg||
nt|bessi2: because if finesse now.. and then 3 round of clubs.. he has to guess whether the spade is 31 ruff low.. or 22 ruff 9|pg||

nt|bessi2: ok.. now I'm lost.. why wouldn't west rdbl with his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 2@h at least invite in clubs |pg||
nt|bagman: NS might make a slam here; either W leads a spade for a heart discard or gets strip squeezed in the end game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bessi2: ahh... perhaps systematic showing @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Not sure if there are enough entries to ruff the diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: first they have to bid it ...|pg||
nt|bagman: Probably not enough entries so a minor suit lead beats it (@DA, ruff, @C, ruff, @C, ruff and no entry to dummy for strip squeeze)|pg||
nt|jbgood: N will not have slam thought now |pg||
nt|bagman: No, they are likely to bid the club game|pg||

nt|bagman: Not so easy to stay out of the majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play xfers after 1 Maj. dbl, so they may play same over their 1@d bid|pg||
nt|bessi2: so perhaps an oppertunity for the welland team if the bidding starts the same way|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|jbgood: a @d was lead ag 6 @s next door on 26 and beat the slam for a major @d win - must be said that the @d lead was natural after a double of 5@d from N|pg||

mb|p!|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|andyv:  ty Howard|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|bessi2: ahh.. there's always a perfectly reasonable explanation as Scully (X-Files) always says|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|andyv:  3N easy make|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't see if 2@c guarantees 6 or only 5 if 4@c major|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@c also makes but I consider easy contracts where the tricks are off the top and no one can ruff in |pg||
nt|andyv:  and spec tells me they guarantee 6@c on 2@c opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Diamond bids a very uncertain 3N and states "we have not discussed this" he guesses pard shape|pg||
pc|d2|mc|10|nt|andyv:  ty to Howard Einberg for a great job as the operator|pg||
nt|bessi2: the uncertainty must have been about the meaning of 3@s,  as the 3N bid was a certainty whatever the meaning|pg||
nt|bessi2: thx all.. it's been a pleasure|pg||
nt|puncher99: thx all|pg||
