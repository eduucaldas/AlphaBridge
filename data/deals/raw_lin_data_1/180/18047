nt|vugraphzfd: rubin watching the ceiling as he often does|pg||
nt|andyv:  was Rubin serious about playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson in his thinker pose, elbow on his thigh, hand on his cheek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- did Jacobs concede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no one told me if they did concede|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: of course rubin was not serious about playing standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson replied that he and simson were playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nickell team down 48|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and joked that it would be interesting if they had to switch systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody for EHAA??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I'd be all for EHAA, I could explain the bidding better then having played it myself|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: although I usually play strong club I don't know..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a very fun friday night game   we used to play [very illegal]  one card if i dealt,  one card if partner dealt, opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfd: all the intricacies of either NS or EW system|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hello specs.  This is the semi finals...first set of what promises to be an exciting match|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Karen, Shir |pg||
nt|psyck: you, about 5 big swings or twice as many partial swings|pg||
nt|passell: the lucky diamond position will help declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|joest: hello all|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW play a precision style club|pg||
nt|peachy: -ley|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: Not unexpected double from south.  Will east stick it?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  Grue and Lall are playing Precision, hence the 1@d opening http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=738&pid=155|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: interesting choice to go with a forcing 2@d before bidding hearts.  I don't know if this sequence got the 5-6 message across or not|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a complex system of relays|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: well not quite.  They do play lots of transfers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3c meant as 3-1-4-5|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|joest: hi Kirshna|pg||
nt|joest: Krishna|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hi to all|pg||
nt|psyck: just call me CK :)|pg||
nt|joest: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no other info|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: If no double, then perhaps the double of 3nt was an error :)  |pg||
nt|passell: he can make declarer guess if he cashes diamond and leads a low heart|pg||
nt|psyck: some may use drury here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: might have been better with the ruffs |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|joest: I guess garner has seen weinstein's lead directing doubles before :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: good lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  gm Peter and CK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|joest: helllo all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even if had sure dummy re-entry might be likely to play @S this way upon sight of @DJ.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|passell: he was a little light for drury with 2 jacks and 4333   they do use drury|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s would have gome down if E gets in with @d to play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should have respected his pd's x after he already bid out his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but matches are not playing the same boards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1NT is 14-16 for them, so West was too weak for that|pg||
nt|kit: as long as you are leading from a king, might as well pick king-doubleton so possibility of ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: with the hearts ruffing out, probably to declarer's surprise, this will make 6|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Andy - for me just after dinner, and CK prob late night :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: Not sure which of the ten losers would suggest Drury, it's OK to have a good hand for your bid.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, agree with not use of drury|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: just catching up - welcome|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades dbld looks like 1 down  although it was allowed to make in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: re Susan, lets hope the connection stabilises this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: one can hope, but unlikely|pg||
nt|robinswr: it's nice having more trumps then declerer|pg||
nt|robinswr: and a suit to tap him further|pg||
nt|robinswr: declarer needs to pitch the spades from dummy in order tostop the tap|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kareno: Had north doubled, that likely would have been the defense.  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: I agree that the principles of doubling call for Dbl on both contracts. Or neither|pg||
nt|passell: good heart guess|pg||
nt|psyck: with 2@s still constructive, drury should be reserved for proper limit raise hands|pg||
nt|joest: yes good heart guess, particularly since not clear why wooldridge would switch to hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good to see so many younge players in action|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Daniel Gulyas|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW 1@d is 10-15 with 2+@ds|pg||
nt|passell: 2 spades not so constructive by passed hand|pg||
nt|joest: when you open all 11 counts though, I find that the standards for Drury drop accordingly :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not clear 2@S still constructive BPH, may not be able to risk pass of 1NT showing non-const raise.|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gulyas: it looks like they are better off by not letting 4@S play out|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't mind the 1nt bid - it's a value bid, though partner may assume you have stoppers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  14-16|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe only undertricks were makable there in any game there on a normal day|pg||
nt|joest: would everyone open 2@c.  I understand it; I understand 1@s too|pg||
nt|joest: now if it goes "double I have nothing" this could go all pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: good morning to all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if photos are current, all the Bathurst team look young|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2@H  4-11 HCP, 5-7 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: after the interruption the redeal button didnt automatically work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I was busy typing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 15-17 in 3rd seat vul, and all 4th seat|pg||
nt|andyv:  they will find the @s game|pg||
nt|robinswr: some would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|passell: I dont like to open 2clubs on minimum hand like that  but it is the winner  assures getting to 4hearts|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2N modified Ogust|pg||
nt|joest: they're in the wrong event if they don't :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, W has quite a pewerful hand, even opp a 14-16 hand|pg||
nt|psyck: double = double negative (bust) & pass= semi positive here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so I'm not the only one whose pds have the W hand when I finally get a biggie.  W will make a weakness-showing noise here.  I would open 1@S as E, need room to describe here.|pg||
nt|joest: the selfrescue will strike gold|pg||
nt|joest: but it is a throw of the dice|pg||
nt|passell: I agree|pg||
nt|passell: garner may run to clubs and hit gold|pg||
nt|joest: "it's one level higher' always runs through my head|pg||
nt|passell: a red suit leat will hurt 2spades  club not as much|pg||
nt|joest: as against that, it's almost sure RHO 'has you' on this auction|pg||
nt|passell: I like crash vs 2clubs   gets 2 suiters in play|pg||
nt|joest: but that's because you're an animal Mike!  :)|pg||
nt|passell: dbl would show reds or blacks  easy to find fit|pg||
nt|joest: but i like it too I do confess |pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S was probably making, so no big deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: much better to support hearts and ignore the spades|pg||
nt|psyck: I agree with supporting @h, though 4 level is strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: only if playing a forcing club system|pg||
nt|peachy: NS methods include: We will open most 11 counts and many distributional 10 counts. We will open 1C with a balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary ...|pg||
nt|peachy: clubs. We open 1D with semi- balanced or unbalanced hands with primary diamonds or 4-5 in the minors. |pg||
nt|joest: most pairs have not prepared adequate defenses vs. 2@c interference soI agree with the philosophy|pg||
nt|passell: can still play 2 of a major natural  only lose 2dia |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 6+@H and   [i think] min|pg||
nt|jcwla: How animalistic it is depends on the hands one chooses to use it on.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West must be wondering whether he has picked up the wrong hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|passell: diamond lead was best  this was second best|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table they opened east's hand with a strong 1@c and south entered at the one level|pg||
nt|jcwla: For those who thank God for small favors, the @S8 drops singleton.|pg||
nt|passell: doesnt matter |pg||
nt|passell: I think he will get a diamond in the end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  amazingly similar to his hand on the previous deal|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: i'm trying to judge how well 4@h plays if they get there next door|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  low club is winner here|pg||
nt|joest: just gave up on slam. partner would need aperfecto I guess but if the ace of diamonds had been @hKQ....|pg||
nt|andyv:  when NS open 1@d, it's either semi balanced or unbalanced with mainly diamonds or 4-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|psyck: W also happy to hear opps bidding @d (lesser @d wastage with pd)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|joest: garner has the wrong shape, and these are the wrong colors, for saving in 5@d!|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d void is a big minus for slam searching opposite a NT bidder when you have limited values|pg||
nt|joest: if Howard is thinking here we may be in for a looooong session|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will be... both NS are deliberate players|pg||
nt|joest: north more so than south|pg||
pc|sA|nt|passell: 4 hearts plays well lose 1 heart 1 dia |pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfd: @h2 turned quickly, ekeblad: "may I?", johnson: "mais oui!"|pg||
nt|psyck: he can see 4@s, 1@h, 1@d, 5@c for 11 tricks if blakc suits break|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine 1nt showed hearts, given the rest of the auction.|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we see a ht lead here?|pg||
nt|joest: now comes the @CK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: 8 is probably suit pref for @hs|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  kibitzers tell me Lall is still a junior|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: Welcome to Joe Shair from the USA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: This is a very unfriendly hand for declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: yeah with the heart jack dropping you are in good shape|pg||
nt|joest: garner's long huddle over 2@s may tip Hurd to the fact that Garner has a club side suit (apart from theplay inthe club suit itself)|pg||
nt|passell: looks like only 1 down|pg||
nt|joest: if they start diamonds now, they may be able to get another|pg||
pc|d2|nt|passell: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's the North Pole...|pg||
nt|peachy: He arrived in a sled, there is  still snow in santyclz land|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ran out in the desert, that's why I was late.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|d6|nt|robinswr: easy hand just needs both aces on sides|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: so just took a lil time to see if he had to do anything in case trumps badly placed|pg||
nt|peachy: Weistein might duck this, I guess he is thinking of it anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: kib noted that must duck, squeezed otherwise. |pg||
nt|kareno: North must duck the heart |pg||
nt|peachy: I feel sorry for the operators, internet service glitches :(|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: or that is what I think, glittches in any case|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|passell: king of spades then heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|robinswr: or KQ of spades on sides|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades 1 dia 1 heart  down 1|pg||
nt|joest: and a club|pg||
nt|passell: I hate dbl as negative there  like pass to show bad hand  dbl for values   you get a lot more penalties that way|pg||
nt|joest: they reached 4@h in the open room|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: y, some chances with @cA off|pg||
nt|kareno: Two rounds of clubs will finish north now.|pg||
nt|joest: and if opener reopens with double,what does that mean the way you play?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Weinstein playing 4@H North|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  24 to be precise|pg||
nt|gulyas: W endplayed sort of, if he took the @HA|pg||
mc|11|nt|andyv:  he better play low @c then:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's Howie Weinstein    Steve Weinstein already going to Eindhoven for 2011 Bermuda Bowl as part of Team Fleisher [USA1 from 2010 Trials]|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect west to work this out - there's no reason not to play two rounds of clubs first.|pg||
nt|peachy: The intuitive action was to duck the heart, for a putz like me.   Wiser guys also knew the reason why|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you just duck on principle.  This would be such a case.  You don't know but you fear for your vulnerable major suit holdings.|pg||
nt|kareno: If south held the hearts along with his clubs, the squeeze would require a different way of cashing tricks, but the heart duck would also, I believe, be required.|pg||

nt|glen: that was sporting|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S to dummy  top @C looks reasonable|pg||
nt|granguru: Zagorin will probably play at most one more @S and then @H..if not immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other option is to play West to hold @DJ|pg||
nt|pelu: that was the start in CR, but when E didnt show up with @CA S ruffed|pg||
nt|swanson: This contract now depends on the diamond finesse, thanks to the great spot cards.|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer is looking for a better chance.|pg||
nt|pelu: and he was now short of trumfs to setup @D-trick|pg||
nt|granguru: the third @S with 4@H cards...for instance|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: ekeblad is taking off his jacket|pg||
nt|pelu: a comment from Kit in CR when @cK and low @C from East: a good defender would duck with @CA - with a singleton @C S would have played @C from hand in trick 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Zagorin has 1@C --- it isn't going away with @D play |pg||

nt|andyv:  nothing wrong with being deliberate although yesterday's match between Aker and Wolfson produced some very long delays|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe Grue needed a mirror for that one :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: still making 4, as he has no way to play a @C up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, interesting that 10 tricks avail w/o dummy entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: 2@H 10-15 or 11-15|pg||
nt|passell: take out  that way if the weak hand has a stack you can get penalties|pg||
nt|kit: what does West discard though?  It is tricky|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2@H   isn't part of Ekeblad system   maybe they really did switch system|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h=5+@hs and 4@c, 10-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   i miscounted @C    10-15  5+@H & 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last board, ekeblad asked to see the final heart trick again, johnson said it didn't matter, played @s3 and conceded @s @H @d @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@c 2+ and not precision|pg||
nt|psyck: NS 2/1 style & EW precision|pg||
nt|kareno: We get to see all four hands!|pg||
nt|sybarra: great lead director overcall |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not)|pg||
nt|peachy: you said it faster, Karen :)|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL indeed!|pg||
nt|jpes: we don't seem to have missed many boards|pg||
nt|joest: so that might be a small gain for Wolfson|pg||
nt|joest: 2+ for 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the <aker-team was vslow playing all the way - also in 1. round <.9|pg||
nt|kareno: No squeeze in the OR as north ducked the heart.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not quite as good a 7@d sac as we saw last segment.|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand, no way to start a segment, coming from behind|pg||
nt|passell: look at this hand for instance|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: 1@h = spades|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@S here takeout of @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, did it really end up with 11?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@s = either diamonds or a 1NT response|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s looks like takeout|pg||
nt|joest: Doubld = 3 spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: actually over double it's just diamonds, sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: These teams were originally seeded 5th & 10th, but some heavy seeds including Nickell & Gordon fell along the way.|pg||
nt|pelu: NS open on almost all 11 counts - and many distributional 10 counts|pg||
nt|psyck: NS's bidding summary says "Normal 21st century" :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: something to be said for rebidding 2@c|pg||
nt|passell: garner claimed too soon I think he was going 1 down if he played it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ordinarily 1@s by this pair shows no 4 card major and is similar to forcing NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe played spades and would have made his contract if a) spades broke or b) south held hearts and clubs and was squeezed on the third spade.|pg||
nt|kareno: 5nt would be choice of slams I think.  two places to play.|pg||
nt|kareno: Susan, can you tell us why 2@h was Alerted?|pg||
nt|peachy: Borth knows enough not to pick NT :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h apparently showed diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d shows hearts - some sort of criss-cross I guess.  And now I can't guess what 5nt means.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: consecutive partscores!  good luck partner, I stretched a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  match got tighter as 4@h went down 1 in CR|pg||
nt|robinswr: make the queen of diamonds the king then its clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: the way you show a 2 1/2 spade bid is to bid 2 minor then raise 2@s to three|pg||
nt|santyclz: Effective preempting!|pg||
nt|jpes: this a b|pg||
nt|jpes: ockbuster result for wolfson|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  unscrambling the tricks will be the EW task|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: well, its a bad feeling to go down in 2@S when u r cold for 6@D...|pg||
nt|robinswr: the spades are so weak that if partner has zero or one spade, 2 minor could be better|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am exeggarating, but u do make 6 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|joest: so Wolfson did pick up 4 on that last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i may have misclicked on a card on that hand|pg||
nt|passell: yes  down 1  after the heart lead|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room a natural 1@c opener, a weak 2@s response and a takeout double. Not clear they will be in game after that start|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: very optimistic|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table s just bid 4@d.|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen will show 3-card limit raise, easy acceptance with the 5-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: YES|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs to lead @DA to beat this|pg||
nt|psyck: @d ruff not easy to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sorry about the caps :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  pushed a little too hard on this one|pg||
nt|joest: quite|pg||
nt|pelu: even 4@h need some work|pg||
nt|joest: btw the pass was alerted b/c it said 'lead diamonds'.  A double would have meant 'don't lead diamonds"|pg||
nt|psyck: a simple doubly & raise to 3@h shows W's values for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think their 1@s in comp was either minor, that is why the pass over 4@d|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s was diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: no after thje free 2@H from East W has a GF hand|pg||
nt|joest: we used to call hands like east's "pickles and ice cream"  Some very good things and some very bad things.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all who know the systems for explaining.|pg||
nt|joest: "where do I start" thinks declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: even making five would be a challenge|pg||
nt|kareno: So presumably this auction shows red suits.  Two places to play and clubs was excluded by the 6@d bid.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trump lead as expected|pg||
nt|kit: ace of diamonds is killer, but trump looks logical|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3 unsupported aces, so lead other suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has a slight guess|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: but over 5@C he could (sh) only bid 5@h|pg||
nt|passell: looks like he will get this home with both red suits behaving|pg||
nt|psyck: not clear E should have blasted to game here either|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  7@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the last score I had was Welland 262-204 over Jacobs.  if Jacobs conceded, no one told me, but it's plausible|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking may endplay E|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: would not be the first time they had|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  his main hope is that all games go down now|pg||
nt|ybob: XX   QXXXX    XXX    AXX  = VERY GOOD SLAM |pg||
nt|gulyas: now only needs the @DJ onside, and that works|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  ruffing finesse possibility in @c|pg||
nt|kit: Somehow when you have 3 aces it doesn't look like it will be necessary to get a ruff in your hand to defeat 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|peachy: I definitely like 5D better|pg||
nt|passell: it is there style   you were young once also|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: weren't we all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  playing @d works better but is it clear cut?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: @H10  helps Ekeblad exit trump|pg||
nt|psyck: if you chose to rebid 2@c, would you bid on after 2@d?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see the bidding at the other table, hover your mouse pointer over the other table score.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: 3nt made in the OR.  Apparently they failed to cash out (including diamonds) after declarer surrendered a spade.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: ruffing finesse in clubs awkward since hearts need to be set up|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
pc|s7|nt|robinswr: while you only have one diamond loser you have two hearts and the fourth club to get rid of|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: Wolfson may judge that ruffing finesse is off since Lall didn'tplay ace|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|psyck: yes & this has decent chances too|pg||
nt|joest: on a trump switch this looks like it comes up short|pg||
nt|passell: trump shift now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can it be beaten with a trump lead?|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: declarers only real chances were 1. opps do not play trump 2. if they do, @c 33|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well it's either blasting 4@H or "blasting" 3@H - hard to believe opposite a free 2@H bid that game would not have chances (if not cold) - so I totally agree with the 4@H bid.  |pg||
nt|joest: weinstein knows garner has 3 spades and 3 diamonds.  If he has 2 hearts and five clubs, that gives declarer 3=5=4=1 pattern and all the more reason  to led trumps now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|joest: my own take is that Justin got a little carried away with his hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will make with both hearts onside.  Nice contract, well played.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: win it or duck it?|pg||
nt|psyck: Vul, i may have tried 4@h too, but NV 3@h seems to express the hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: where the tricks coming from?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|gulyas: you can ruff the @Hs and guess the @Cs|pg||
nt|robinswr: however, 6@d would fetch. ruff two hearts in dummy and play trumps you have a club spade sqeeze|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather be in 5@D than in 2@S|pg||
nt|joest: at this point declarer is reduced to playing for 3-3 @cs|pg||
nt|passell: this was allowed to make in the other room|pg||
nt|passell: this is down 1 now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: you may not have two fast losers but that's not 12 winners|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: and after a free 2@H it was very optimistick to bid 5@C - the void in @S (one of partners suits) not a big value -with only 4 card @h|pg||
nt|psyck: what would double of 1@s by lall have been?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: you'll have to ask him. :)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i think Simson will get location of @DK correct  so !Q will pin card from West holding to down 1|pg||
nt|robinswr: Q8xx opposite AK2 when the 109 falls, its restricted choice to finesse the 8|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: But Lall would know declarer is void, since with stiff he would have led up to KQ|pg||

nt|joest: 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and that won't happen here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some might have tried a 1nt overcall.|pg||

nt|sybarra: 4 @H is pass or correct,  a bit rambuncious maybe|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  UDCA = upside down count attitude|pg||
nt|gulyas: agressive x by Grue, may get punished here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since 1@S only promises 4 -- Drury promises 4   and Rubin hides his canape suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c is art. GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not by passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, just drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad trying to get director to turn dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1NT was ok, but should have bid 3@D then, meaning inv with @Ds, which he had|pg||
nt|psyck: I like that better Daniel|pg||
nt|peachy: Oft'repeated little sayiong , attributed to (I think) Jan Martel:  Operator is like a loongtailed cat in a small room full of rocking chairs.|pg||
nt|kit: Tough hand for E-W.  Opponents have 8-card fit, but they don't.|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is only off 5 tops|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@H I mean|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at least breaks are friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Normal but unfortunate lead.|pg||
nt|joest: Rusinow leads for N-S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you would not expect both reds 3-3 on this auction|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  this shouldn't take too long|pg||
nt|andyv:  Steve should cash the A of @c and then lead 2nd @d|pg||
nt|joest: since they play 'normal' signals, weinstein might have overtaken there to prevent an accident|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may decide to play low @d and get @c back|pg||
nt|psyck: there won't be any problems defending this one looking at that dummy anyway|pg||
nt|joest: even if garner leads a spade they can't get everything untangled|pg||
nt|joest: only a trump switch would cost|pg||
nt|joest: this is one of those situation where when I am north and partner huddles forever I ask myself "Should I have overtaken?"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@d after 1NT is would you would bid with x/xx/QJ10xxxx/Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: this hand will not pose a great challenge|pg||
nt|kit: Wolfson works out that his partner has 3 hearts since opponents landed in diamonds, so not right to compete to 3@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: after S x-ed 2nt, N should have whacked this|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: simson, laughing: I just hoped it wouldn't!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson still hasn't turned trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow defender throughout this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: unfamiliarity with EW methods and difficulty drawing inferences may contribute|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play udca carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and on cue: if you only had 4@s, what kind of shape could you have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: any longer suit|pg||
nt|joest: uh oh|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|psyck: but donno if I would do it at the table, normal to be worried of misfits & only nv game, also poor @d suit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gulyas: S could make 6@D here again:) as long as no @S was lead either, ofc:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  however if they show AK combo, then first trick is a count request card|pg||
nt|pelu: agree that N sh take @DK + A and play @C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some danger that declarer will finesse in @h, expecting Cohen to be more shape suitable|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: sure made me eat my words|pg||
nt|jpes: dcl got a little help with the lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: Only a trick high :)  With the diamond break.|pg||
nt|kareno: Garner expected more values from his adversely vulnerable partner.|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you have to resist using those weapons :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: defensive moral: when you know what is right, take control and do it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzfd: :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: for me "all" the blame on N|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think we will ever get to a point where declarer can take a heart finesse profitably -- about those trumps|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns, "thanks solly", sits down, carrying fresh coffee as usual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in first 4 boards    Nickell has lost another 13   trails Bathurst by 61|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 2 rounds of @s ... I don't think he can afford a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winner of our match plays Semi-Final against winner of Bathurst v Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: laughter elsewhere in the ballroom|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had an interesting board in the 7th round...20 imps swing for Bathurst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin holding his cards in both hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: folds them again, leans closer to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 4th match on vugraph  so presumably  Jacobs [down 62] conceded to Welland |pg||
nt|andyv:  trying to decide if he can protect against a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, trivial from here if spades behave|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson to ekeblad: go for another smoke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson sighs and leans back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad closes screen to exchange some whispers with simson.  rubin seems not to notice half of dummy had disappeared|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: shuffling his hand, planning his line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: moving one card at a time into order|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  this line is better than 3-2 @s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe his assumption is whoever is ruffing is doing it with the long @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin sips his coffee.   now johnson's turn to tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren-Donn stopped in      4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, if S were 2-2 in the black suits, he could easily be going down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some kind of mixup after a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  S=south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @dq selected|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|psyck: after everyone started of doubling light, one would sure have expected this final contract to have been chopped too :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed - more likley to finesse if he was playing in @h|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he really has to hope the @ss are 2-2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|peachy: Match is not even half-way done, but I bet Wolfson would like the gap a little smaller though|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was thinking he could also play @SA  @H @H @H ruff then @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: oppos say "very carefully played", "you get a star for that"|pg||
nt|joest: well so far this is high level ping pong|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS just have to shake this off|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like 2 game swing in 3 and 4|pg||
nt|joest: each pair has tossed one board so we can start over :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: there are 116 boards to go|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Private messages are appreciated, but please understand that commentators may not have time to respond to all of them. No offence intended|pg||
nt|gulyas: some say that 3@D would not have been invitational - but then what do u bid in 2/1? 2nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: pitch in the wrong hand :(|pg||
nt|peachy: If you'd like to watch both tables at the same time, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|peachy: Wooldridge has had an absolutely spectacular year|pg||
nt|peachy: and the the rest are no duffers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  there will a lot of those before this match is over...both teams are very aggressive|pg||
nt|robinswr: in the open room north bid 4spades after raise|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d = 4+  typically unbalanced|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  ok, super safe I guess:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: "all 19 people watching appreciated that"|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's because Walter isn't up here watching:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if u r weak and pd rebids his suit, with a bad hand u pass|pg||
nt|passell: the spade response will give away the show  make 4spades easier|pg||
nt|joest: there are some who don't play double here as penalty.   I don't get that I'm afraid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some have been asking for more info about the players - here is a link to some info on Justin Lall http://justinlall.wordpress.com/about/|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|psyck: EW just tried 6@h a deal too earlyslam |pg||
nt|joest: actually I've played that double =4 and 2@s = 5 with some folks|pg||
nt|psyck: double is commonly used to show 4+@s's here|pg||
nt|jcwla: And a hand with some values.|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like they play that way here too Jack|pg||
mb|3C|nt|joest: it will also make the play in 2@s easier Mike :)|pg||
nt|passell: play dbl is a better hand than 2spades  they must not|pg||
nt|joest: interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 1C = can be a balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary clubs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=790&pid=302|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s info |pg||
nt|kareno: Polish style, getting more and more popular.  Thanks :)|pg||
nt|jpes: they put away a multi world champion away in 120 bds|pg||
nt|passell: looks like 3 is all they can make with the diamond position|pg||
nt|kit: transfer to clubs -- just what Lall wanted to hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  re|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: network burped again.  overloaded with 8 consoles running|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: Lall gets what he deserves fl|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  something on Joe Grue http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/joegrue.pdf|pg||
nt|gulyas: for opening 1nt|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|robinswr: one has to know how high 2spades is forcing to (can you pass 4@s)|pg||
nt|passell: goood non heart ace lead|pg||
nt|passell: great stop by woolridge here|pg||
nt|joest: not everyone would make a takeout double as east|pg||
nt|passell: should easily take 5 spades in his hand 1 ruff in dummy and 2 aces|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  maybe net is talking a smoking break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: leave these out for a minute, just going to think for a little while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: internet is new toy in las vegas|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad thumps the table|pg||
nt|psyck: limit raise or better, foring to 3@h only for me|pg||
nt|robinswr: forcing passes is a compicated subject|pg||
nt|peachy: Sometimes overloading the 1C opener can be a disadvantage, preempts make it really uncomfortable|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  9 tricks pretty easy dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: breaking simson's trance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: different rooms dropped  out this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should have no trouble setting up 2 tricks in @d and @c and should make OT|pg||
nt|kareno: Plenty high enough.  Wonder what 1@s was - diamonds?|pg||
nt|kareno: Usually diamonds, I'm told, thanks to a spec.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: did not see rubins spots|pg||
nt|pelu: with @cJ in W 3Nt and 4@H almost same chance|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe one more in the wash if he gets a @h or something|pg||
nt|gulyas: he had an easy 1@D opening, no rebid problems|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|joest: lall needs the heart king as an entry to diamonds |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|passell: now up to 9 tricks with the dia ruffing out|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|peachy: They are probably too high already|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes raise @s or rebid 1@s over @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or presumably rause 1NT to 2NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  raise|pg||
nt|psyck: It was the exactly wrong vul to experiment with something fancy too|pg||
nt|kit: This isn't so good for defense -- if Cohen wins ace and gives ruff, defense won't get spade trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck: he may be playing to not set up @d now, disc 1@s on @c & ruff one|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 3@c is puppet and 3N is 5@h (flip flopping with 3@h to show no 4 or 5 card major)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gulyas: I would think it is not over 4@S, but someone should double this...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: Rubin has problems in 4@H (Board 3) :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@h seems about the limit here.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: then he needs to guess both maj finesses right|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen sees that giving ruff won't work|pg||
nt|kit: Now it is clear declarer started with stiffqueen of clubs, since no second club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer now has a ruffing entry to the long @c|pg||
nt|kit: But if Cohen leads queen of dimonds now, the suit is blocked!|pg||
nt|kit: and the defense gets both the ruff and the spade trick to set the contract|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  4@d then was xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|joest: weinstein led 5th best so the odds favored Jx or 10x with Garner|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: Very creative lead by Lall, wanting to lead through dummy's strength.|pg||
nt|gulyas: the obv 10 imps to Bathurst on 78 to extend the lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: 4 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts|pg||
nt|joest: so guess theheart|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The winner (on Tuesday) will be USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Martel-Stansby, Levin-Weinstein)|pg||
nt|kit: but he fell from grace|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Specs were calling for a low @c.|pg||
nt|passell: yes  percentage play  he didnt think north had ak of hearts|pg||
nt|joest: so now we're back to 110.  Precision bidding|pg||
nt|joest: right + north opened the bidding|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  and went counter to Crane rule...and it worked!|pg||
nt|joest: is one way to make it is what I was going to say :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam only cost 3imp - Rubin didnt find the winning line in 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was Lall's main hope on that hand|pg||
nt|joest: that's a break for Bathurst|pg||
nt|joest: clearing diamonds while you have the spade king protected looks sorta straightforwarfd|pg||
nt|andyv:  here he just needs to play A@h and K@h and then, after pitching 2 spades, it's a matter of making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff a @D now and he can claim with @hs 3-2|pg||
nt|joest: sorry I'm busy playing 3NT!|pg||
nt|andyv:  did you make it?|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: i just claimed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: did u make it ?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|pelu: slow - again -new smart keyboard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, everyone, ruff a @d first|pg||
nt|psyck: he is just thinking of 41 @h here, cold 10 at least with 32 as pointed out|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck: @d must have been unblocked|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|c5|pc|hA|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: just see|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: rebidding  @CJxxxx   yuk|pg||
nt|swanson: 5@D is a much more sound contract than 3NT.  Won't be easy to get there now.|pg||
nt|glen: in the modern style bidding @Ds can take a few rounds, if at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3NT will depend on whethr east finds the club shift after winning the diamond king|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|joest: quite hard to reach 5@d from this point|pg||
nt|glen: here they have bid everything (all other suits, NT) besides @Ds|pg||
mb|4H|nt|swanson: 1@D is the textbook opening bid for 5-card major players, and would lead to the diamond game.|pg||
nt|granguru: and the Moysean fit? do u like it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: diff to come to 5@D if u never bid @D :)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|joest: I like that call by Zagorin.  Didn't want to play 3NT opposite spade shortness|pg||

nt|joest: now when a diamond comes back to you just fly queen?|pg||
nt|joest: he can still make after misguessing @D|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer is justifiably concerned with losing three clubs tricks (and a diamond) should he simply draw trumps.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW carding  upside-down count, attitude, smith[vs nt]|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: did @CK really score a trick?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|joest: bidding convinced Rubin that Bathurst ahd six clubs|pg||
nt|joest: that might well be right on hands where declarer is 4-6|pg||
nt|swanson: Rubin knows declarer only holds four hearts and thinks partner holds the KQJ of diamonds, so ducks to prevent clubs from being established.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  good point Jack     so Eke's @C4 was just following suit rather than upside-down coutn|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: and realistically partner won't rescue himself to the two level on a four card suit -- or at least he shouldn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: no chance in 3nt, 5@D would have some play|pg||
nt|psyck: other table play some 2 suiter 2 level openings, so could not open that hand 1 or 2 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: only good thing here is they will know it will be a push hand with other table failing in game too|pg||
nt|sybarra: or here |pg||
nt|sybarra: is 4 @H makeable?   |pg||
nt|sybarra: terrible lead problem for E |pg||
nt|peachy: lots of work, abd I think too much, so no|pg||
nt|kareno: Depends the lead and the defense.  With diamond lead, I think yes.  Ruff diamond, ruff club, two rounds of hearts, then clubs.  West must follow and spades go away.|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs saying spade lead,  but I dont see the kjx hand leading a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: on the get go |pg||
nt|kareno: Highly unlikely lead IMO|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt 14-16 in 1st and 2nd.|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they incorporate more nt ranges than normal into 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: operator can you check to be sure Garner pased|pg||
nt|passell: dont believe he passed|pg||
nt|joest: he knows they have 29HCP or so.  I doubt this|pg||
nt|psyck: if it was 22-23, as N has, surely strange pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  they should stop in 6 although an accident will get them a lucky result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing  3@S=cue   3N=serious slam interest|pg||
nt|joest: this will have a steep price tag|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will pretty much need to ruff 2spades in his hand, so will at some point take diamond finesse and then hope for 2-2.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 4@S = RKC|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad has to lean forward to hear simson.  here in the crows nest I have no chance to eavesdrop|pg||
nt|sybarra: if so perhaps we ask where the mirrors are |pg||
nt|kareno: This cannot fetch.|pg||
nt|peachy: D lead likely coming so Karen's estimate could be true|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 2-2, he can ruff 3 @Cs in hand, and discard the 5th if necessary|pg||
nt|kit: he will ruff -- holding onto ace for control|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will ruff and lead a club, giving himself communication and cutting enemy communication for possible heart ruff at same time.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if @d are 2-2, which he does not know, he has 11 easy tricks |pg||
nt|kit: Interesting choice of 4 of spades lead rather than an honor|pg||

nt|passell: if it was 19 20  strange pass|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if they can bid Exclusion here|pg||
nt|kit: Can't hurt to try the jack.  Sometimes opening leader gets a bit too clever and underleads KQ, thinking it is safe|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, its free|pg||
nt|kit: now a club, Larry.  Don't make my analysis look bad.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: Oops, lead coming from West, not so likely....!|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm afraid south interpreted north's cuebid as support showing.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be perhaps a bit disappointed with N spade holding|pg||
nt|sybarra: (or should I say certainly disappointed?)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Garner - Weinstein:  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=790&pid=302|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  I don't think so with pd having a known suit |pg||
nt|jpes: its interesting how hard they work on part score hands|pg||
nt|joest: no it's 23-24|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least @s suit is sitting right as is @c Q|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ = better @Hs than @s|pg||
nt|joest: on board 4 north-south did cash out effectively against 4@s unlike here|pg||
nt|kit: thank you|pg||
nt|gulyas: I did take 3 tricks in AKT vs void in a suit contract the other day:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|robinswr: very slow here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  logical to play a @c early as some danger of an opposing @h ruff if you use the @h entries early|pg||
nt|kit: Logical return.  I think he should finesse the queen.|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the void in hand ofc|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slight clue that the @dK is offside is that East did not lead one initially despite knowing declarer is 3 suited|pg||
nt|kit: the point is that he will have to ruff a spade, so sort of pretend the 4 of diamonds is gone|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|jpes: the Q@D to make S worry|pg||
nt|santyclz: Kaplan was an early advocate of fighting for part scores at imps.|pg||
nt|peachy: The "nickels and dimes" do add up|pg||
nt|peachy: in a 120 board match|pg||
nt|santyclz: In one of the segments in the quarters, after 6 bds Bathurst had picked up 25 partscore imps from Nickell.|pg||
nt|peachy: I hope this is not an impending crash. The operators have had to suffer enough of those already|pg||
nt|jpes: garner is trying to see what he can do with J87@D in Wooldridge hand|pg||
nt|joest: 22-23 sorry|pg||

nt|andyv:  5@c queen ask, |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: who's on lead? ok, tell me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Exclusion not really needed if 3@S promised @SAce|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: basically he was cuebidding after I chose.  he showed 0 or 3 keycards and no queen of trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asking simson as the auction proceeded, rubin just waited for the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: I showed @h and I liked my hand for slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be much faster to play than 7@h where restricted choice would come into play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: and he's leading a minor again!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sassed rubin about the @c lead last time|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|nt|joest: Weinstein knows declarer has at least two spades.  partner would not sit 1@d with five of them|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will have to lead 10@h at some point|pg||
nt|pelu: low-high in @S from S = even No|pg||
nt|pelu: prob @C10 now|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should be able to figure out that S started with 4@s and 5@d so his other dist. should be 2-2|pg||
nt|joest: no|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kareno: Wolfson was closing the gap - this will work against them IMO|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: this group has dished a lot of sass the last 2 days|pg||

nt|ahollan1: glad i didn't predict a boring push|pg||
nt|kit: If he bids 3@D transfer and partner bids 3@H, then what does he do?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that may be a speed record for NS|pg||
nt|passell: couldnt have as west opened 1club|pg||
nt|gulyas: that was fast enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: fast, we like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and junior players saying to themselves...8 ever, nine never...|pg||
nt|joest: on the 3@CX hand n-s were down 2 in 3NT for a pickup for Wolfson|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still ahead of the other table despite the break :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: = a jump from 10 meter where u dont know if there are water in tha bassin :)|pg||
nt|psyck: he may have had to invent a 3@s bid if he tried 3@d xfr|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|joest: can start with 3@c transfer and then bid 3@s naturally if he wants to|pg||
nt|kit: I like the idea of transfers there, but on this hand playing normal where 3@H is a natural force works out easier to handle|pg||
nt|joest: it's good bidding to avoid 3NT on thsi one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck: would be nice to get to 4@h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  there are 12 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson has to take his cards out of the pocket|pg||
nt|joest: double = cards and quite possibly four spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: this PASS  the trap variety|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: since it's not another relay auction [just yet]|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s does show extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@s|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 5|pg||
nt|kareno: You specs had better hold onto your seats!!  This is bridge at its best.|pg||
nt|peachy: 1NT = 14-16, 3H = 5-4 or 4-5 minors with singl H|pg||
nt|gulyas: Bathurst lead back up to 51 in the meantime with small gains|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Donn 6N West|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should move after 3N bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rubin bidding 3N over presumed 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-4|pg||
nt|passell: yes great to get to 4hearts   almost impossible unless opponents in bidding|pg||
nt|joest: and now a master solvers problem for Weinstein. He will 'punt' with 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: they have 2 7-card major-suit fits -- spades doesn't do as well this time|pg||
nt|joest: no ability to clearly grab it with 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: results are right, bidding may not be|pg||
nt|joest: 4@c is reasonable too|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@D or 4@C maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Russ|pg||
nt|robinswr: some play that 3@c shows a minimum saying nothing about clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: move on, nothing to see here|pg||
nt|psyck: there are tons of variations of Jacoby 2NT played :)|pg||
nt|jpes: hurd has his work cut out - |pg||
nt|passell: yes hate 4clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c could wait|pg||
nt|kit: this will get the heart preference|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 3@h apparently a singleton heart with three spades and minors.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  and nice placement of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: "sounds like doug dodged a bullet on this one" [laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: if you misguess @s on this one I'll be very disappointed|pg||
nt|kit: This is an awkward hand for Garner -- he still hasn't shown the diamond suit and slam interest|pg||
nt|pelu: 13 oop 14-16 but 7@D on|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that convention was named after the late and great Grant Baze|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 4333 opposite a 14-16 pt nt.|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl will be helpful|pg||
nt|kit: then Weinstein might punt again with 4@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: another boring hand, a Q of overtricks here|pg||
nt|kit: Lall leading from 3-card suit instead of 4-card suit, since morelikely to find partner with 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: just not this time|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  should make 7 as S will be quickly squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: "let's see how good they are"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: 2@S would have been juuuuicy|pg||
nt|kit: and the excellent slam is missed.|pg||
nt|joest: on the spade layout yes.  6@d would be nice to reach though|pg||
nt|santyclz: They're not shy.|pg||
nt|jpes: with 3 @C tricks it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, it looks like it|pg||
nt|peachy: The red color increases the boldness of even putzes like me at IMPs :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Also with no spots, 8 cards 6 and below.  |pg||
nt|joest: Barcelona, Paris, Normandy, Avignon|pg||
nt|jpes: weinstein's @D signal will be a little late|pg||
nt|joest: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can i go too|pg||
nt|joest: i'm looking forward to it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: great trip, enjoy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i live here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if it's making despite all our (my) complaining.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hope they do it quicker|pg||
nt|joest: is 4@c support?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: or even 3@S, but 4@C looks more accurate|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades looks like a make also|pg||
nt|kit: And with KJ doubleton, I think Garner will pick 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c not cue i think after delayed @h preferance|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  their big gain this set was on 78, where East at the other table did not give West his @d ruff (suit was AJ stiff facing Kxxxxx)|pg||
nt|kit: not that dull for declarer -- he will try to find best way to take 4 club tricks for sure, as that gives him 9.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, may cash @cA & lead up to J|pg||
nt|kit: doesn't really have entries for that|pg||
nt|kit: I think just ace of clubs, jack of clubs -- can't really handle 4 clubs to Q10 in West hand.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: defense against 2@SX = 1100 or 1400|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
nt|psyck: so, just an optional playing strain|pg||
nt|joest: hey i'm just asking.  I confess I'm not sure.|pg||
nt|psyck: so far , so good|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C certainly not Q -- they don't have a trump suit yet|pg||
nt|joest: WEinstein seems out of bids by now it seems to me|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|kit: However, he may think 4@H is a Q.  I don't think it should be|pg||
nt|joest: after a 3@h pref?|pg||
nt|joest: I think this is a great auction : provided it now goes pass :)|pg||
nt|kit: My belief is that 4 of a previously bid major is always an offer to play unless that is just plain impossible|pg||
nt|passell: I agree Kit|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they  have done well so far, but they may still feel some of the bids are ambiguous|pg||
nt|joest: ditto|pg||
nt|passell: especially the second time he bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Might not always be perfect, but avoids a lot of possible mixups|pg||
nt|joest: then in the bar we can argue over what is "just plain impossible"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: you need to frame a question if you expect a reply :)|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, private|pg||
nt|kit: I think they know what the bids mean -- Weinstein is just thinking about slam in clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|robinswr: but simple Jacoby plays that 3@c shows short spades|pg||
nt|santyclz: You could try tapping your foot...|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|passell: unlikely slam knows off dia and heart |pg||
nt|kit: I do not understand this play at all.  |pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfd: getting higher|pg||
nt|joest: Howie can see there will be problems with the expected diamondlead.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  if they pull 4 rounds of trump, N might only get his 3 spades|pg||
nt|robinswr: short clubs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzfd: 4+4+2+2|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a 1 imp gain for Aker|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: this is a good slam if the club queen were onside|pg||
nt|kit: wonder what 4NT was.  I guess Garner thought it RKC for hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|passell: cold if he guesses clubs|pg||
nt|joest: the good news is that 5@c was probably down as well|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h was that magic moment|pg||
nt|passell: he well might |pg||
nt|jcwla: Very well might.|pg||
nt|kit: the queen of clubs is onside-- if you are gib, that is|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if the @d length known may make him get it right|pg||
nt|joest: GIB is a great player|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's always on some side|pg||
nt|passell: slightly anti percentage but dia length might help|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what he had available.  Would not 3@C have been a transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is tough to reach 6@d when no one bids @ds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: he has to cross twice in spades to make the 'big' club play|pg||
nt|joest: and will be fortunate to find long clubs with long spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  was S afraid the @h stopper was the K@h and anything he bid would wrong side it?|pg||
nt|psyck: playing rubensohl/rumpelsohl, he could bid 3@c xfr to @d & then bid 3@s|pg||
nt|joest: well there is a complication there too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: 3@c is invitational or better.  What if partner crosses you up by 'accepting' with 3NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: opposite short clubs and an unlimited hand east has a fair hand long clubs is good opposite a singleton|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
mc|12|nt|passell: 5 -1 spades is never fortunate|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ek: when he bid 3NT I was very disappointed; simson: I was very pleased.  should have bid 1@S, harder to get|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would be rude of him|pg||
nt|santyclz: When you're hot...|pg||
nt|joest: north opened 1NT in theother room|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hoped @CK completed the suit.|pg||
nt|psyck: lead will not be a problem in 3n then|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: he knows pd will not cross when he has AKQJ :)|pg||
nt|kareno: My bridge kibitzing cat, Stella, just jumped into my lap :)|pg||
nt|joest: right 3NT down as well and that's where they are in the open|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  many possible shapes  |pg||
nt|joest: Lall opens his flat ten count vulnerable before Garner can open his flat eleven count vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, would have been interesting of @ck value was in @d|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you should go out of your  way to compete against 1nt|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they would have bwooded into 5@S and made that|pg||
nt|psyck: right|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Which is why I think it is bad to play 3@C transfer invite or better -- partner can't cross you up if 3@D is forced|pg||
nt|joest: he is entitled to accept with a max|pg||
nt|passell: probably going 3 down in 3nt unless inspired guess in clubs at other table|pg||
nt|joest: options are: 1) transfer to spades; 2) use Garbage stayman but risk rotting in 2@h or 3) Stayman and then 2@s which is game invitational|pg||
nt|passell: like the 3rd option|pg||
nt|joest: opposite 14-16?|pg||
nt|passell: gets both majors in and values|pg||
nt|kit: Wooldridge perhaps doesn't have a good way to enter with this shape -- or just chooses not to.|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein mulling over which one of the three doors to open :)|pg||
nt|kit: How do they play 2@C, then 2@S Jack?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  including 5 card @s suit|pg||
nt|psyck: he may have chosen to to at the vul even if he had a minor/major bids available|pg||
nt|gulyas: now you know Kit why they are so far behind:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: will you let her type, Karen ?|pg||
nt|passell: can beat 4spades with dia lead then under lead in clubs for ruff|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: constructive; GI  Partner has rights over 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you have another chance|pg||
nt|pelu: but when S has AKQJ he could be almost sure on 3@D by pd|pg||
nt|kit: With an invite, I just make an old-fashioned game try -- bid game and try to make it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Her spelling is not as good as her analysis :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@d transfer 1@h 2 or 3 with a weak nt.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfd: "he's reaching for cards - he bid"|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to have worked pretty well for you last week, Kit:)|pg||
nt|psyck: Looks like the connections will be a recurring problem today|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably heard your comments re great bridge |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: there is a lot to be said for that kit.  And it solves the problem we are discussing in some transfer lebensohl methods|pg||
nt|gulyas: another push probably|pg||
nt|passell: going low|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  spades play well for N|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad goes through the possibilities for rubin's shape, simson: "I've heard plenty" and passes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: nothing in this room is hot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a clue there was the lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|robinswr: a simple way to bid over 2@s is to play 2NT forces 3@c. for other bids assume partner opened 2NT(15-17) and respond as you would to partner 's 2NT opening |pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@c stayman, 3@D transfer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East held a singleton club, he would probably have had a 5-card suit somewhere|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|kareno: She noted the diamond king onside but suggested they not bid any grand slam on a finesse.|pg||

nt|joest: +100 i think|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to get in vul for NS here with balanced hands|pg||
nt|kareno: This sounds like a forcing club auction with relays.  I'd think 3@s may have been a relay.  Susan?  Any clarification?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: notwithstanding their 26 or 27 hcps |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: picking up 3 on that board is a surprise|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the @d length was not clar in that 3N for him to try @c finness other way|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|psyck: Kit's suggestino of @cAJ looked most practical|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|joest: so while not a high scoring quarter by any means, Wolfson has been plugging away, holding their opponents to 1 imp (so far) and gaining16|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: right.  They will be quite happy with +100 here -- on their own, they surely would have gotten to 3NT down.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: he couldn't decide between Precision 1@D  and 4 card 1@H :)|pg||

nt|pelu: ok so I am not alone :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|granguru: if S has given count..N knows there is not a hurry to attack @C|pg||
nt|pelu: and very passiv by S to pass to 2@H - N must have promised 4 card @s|pg||
nt|joest: declarer would have hooked the spade already if he needed a club pitch|pg||
nt|joest: but 2@s probably wouldn't fetch so passing could be a winning decision|pg||
nt|granguru: good Analysis by Kevin at the table...|pg||
nt|swanson: Ekeblad has a small hope for an endplay by taking the spade finesee and hoping for club blockage.|pg||

nt|kareno: Here's an explanation from a spec:  2D=natural, 2H=Nat, 3H=nat, 3S=non-serious slam try, 3N=spade Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: win some - lose some|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, not being able to cater for single @cQ with E reduces odds of reverse @c fin|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Win 10, lose 5 is a good long-term strategy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  getting to 4@s should be no problem|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c is a multi raise|pg||
nt|joest: anything from a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hi again hope it doesn't happen much today|pg||
nt|joest: up to a balanced three card game force|pg||
nt|joest: it excludes a "jacoby2NT' type hand|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will presumably bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: np Susan, at least we got back immediately|pg||
nt|joest: and garner will 'accept the transfer' to 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe he will find something imaginative|pg||
nt|kit: Which Grue will double I guess -- and then ?|pg||
nt|joest: he is rummaging through his imagination right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, sometimes it takes forever|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2 imps to Bathurst, tripling their lead:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=738&pid=155|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm not sure anyone has stats on the style, but my gut feeling is it pays more than loses|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck: a hand where NS should not let 5 level belong to the opps|pg||
nt|joest: 'walking the dog' as they say|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the answer is.....3@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N used to be semi-force  but yesterday operator alerted as Forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said semi|pg||
nt|andyv:  they have it marked as semi forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: with the transfer to opps known suit generally acting as a stayman substitute|pg||
nt|jpes: look at the score|pg||
nt|kit: With his strong spade holding, Hurd forgets about a possible 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|joest: i like 1NT frankly even though it might not work wellhere|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: John wasn't operator yesterday :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s info |pg||
nt|passell: may cause a dbl part score swing however|pg||
nt|kit: he can back in with 2@H okay|pg||
nt|joest: but Howie may boost to 3@c first|pg||
nt|kit: or double if takeout|pg||
nt|passell: unless north bids 3clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Very interesting that Grue didn't open in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yep   i was very surprised yesterday|pg||
nt|peachy: Polish style 1C, natural, or bal 11-14 or bal 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: N-S should not be bidding to 5@S -- goes for 300, while 5@H might not be making -- it is on diamond guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may be a mistake to bid the E hand slowly if NS can get their @c suit in|pg||
nt|peachy: let me clarify on the club, kib says it is not polish style.. This is what it "is" : balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: somewhat symmetric -- both contract have 4 top losers, both off queen of trumps, and both pick up the queen|pg||
nt|joest: West wants to reopen with double|pg||
nt|passell: likely wants to bid 3dia  not suspecting 4 hearts from partner|pg||
nt|kit: prefer double to 3@D (assuming it is takeout) -- keeps more options open|pg||
nt|passell: agreed  but a little disaster prone without discussion|pg||
nt|joest: it is amazing how people bid on less and less yet more and more doubles are takeout :)|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe West should have made his takeout double at the 2-level?|pg||
nt|joest: not sure a double of 2@c sounds takeout to me Kit, after partner bids 1NT announcing their spades|pg||
nt|passell: I prefer neg dbl with the east hand  then if partner bids 2clubs can bid 2nt|pg||
nt|kit: depends on agreements, that's all.  I would bet they would play it as takeout|pg||
nt|joest: that would made this a much easier hand Mike|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: Which declarer will get right when finding South has stiff heart|pg||
nt|peachy: With the current proliferation of light opening style (11, and many 10 pointers even if balanced/ish) and then light responding style, one can easily get robbed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, everyone opens |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i can understand not opening 4333 12 counts in 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, with 2 12 point hands they stopped low|pg||
nt|gulyas: 8 tricks maybe the limit here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you open agressively in first seat, you can afford to be more conservative in third |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: things don't sit well for declarer|pg||
nt|kit: were never going anywhere after South passed (with 11, not 12)|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops, sry, right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a lot of Precision pairs open almost every flat 11 or 12|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  2N probably showed solid @s suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 2NT 6 good spades and a maximum|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks and johnson confirms semiforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias peeks in, won't be pleased|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final posted   Welland beat Jacobs  by 46|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @c and @h loser, Doug will have to worry about losing 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: someone outside whoops, probably just confirmed that they won|pg||
nt|sybarra: Weinstein trying to get out |pg||
nt|joest: *make|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree -- this is also a very nice hand with texture so tip top anyway.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c may have shown hearts in their transfer style.|pg||
nt|jpes: defense is so much more difficult than declarer play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everyone opens, everyone overcalls, nobody x's for penalty.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's a different game|pg||
nt|passell: would bid 1nt with a little worse hand with those holdings|pg||
nt|kit: problem with that Mike is that if partner has a balanced 12/13 count, 2NT could just be too high|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  taking the money|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: wd by N|pg||
nt|joest: well judged by everybody|pg||
nt|kit: The slow approach worked, talking Weinstein into doubling|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry that was e/w |pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: Okay, now we know that 2@c showed hearts - transfer bypassing their diamond suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: they are in 2 h by n, losing the play|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|joest: Wooldridge saved a part score swing there|pg||
nt|kit: this could be interesting if defense takes 4 black winners and then spade and ruff with 7 of diamonds|pg||
nt|passell: been too high before  the real trouble is missing game when partner has a decent 14 or 15 and a stiff spade|pg||
nt|psyck: EW open most 10 too :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: my calculator has blown a fuse:)|pg||
nt|kit: If they had been pushed to 2@S, that might have gone down on bad lie of cards.  1@S will make for sure.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: hurd has to play this carefully since spades are 4-2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: i would not have expected them to get to 5 w/o knowing their side @c fit against an NV game|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, mis-saw auction|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jpes: those @D have to get set up|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  dbl hook in @ds is one line|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein went right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if system allowed West to open 1@h, there is a case for that - not when playing 5-card majors|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|passell: the opponents also rarely lead my hearts even though it could be the weakness|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|gosia: should have playd a heart earlier|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gulyas: strange|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 4 now|pg||
nt|psyck: too bad we do not get to see his line after a @h or @c continuation|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: much of the time, set up sidetricks before the trumps are all gone|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, kit, or somebody who sees faster than I, what was the justification for this line|pg||
nt|jpes: i think declarer has erred|pg||
nt|kit: here we go -- the uppercut is coming|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: he can open a 4-card major in 3rd seat if he wants, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play precision, less likely to open 4 cards in 3rd seat playing prec than playing standard|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  A@d and @d is 2nd but still have to guess what @d to put in when W ducks|pg||
nt|gosia: now clubs will put pressure on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: % play with all the spots is push Q push T|pg||
nt|joest: Chris Willenken points out that fouru black winners + another spade ruffed with the @D7 makes declarer guess the diamond her|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: and there we are|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems a bit better than 75%|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says: played for Hx of Diamonds onside, with the Heart length, rathen than 3-3 diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: And now the guess|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|peachy: Other suggestions: Human error.          Opps too much I give up.        |pg||
pc|h4|nt|passell: he will get this right |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: South has presumably 6 clubs and 2 spades|pg||
mc|7|nt|kit: Declarer expecting Lall to hold ace of hearts since Grue didn't open|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7 was the limit, just made|pg||

nt|joest: I don't like that way of playing puppet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to play 5-3 @S|pg||
nt|swanson: Puppet is useful because 1NT is opened so frequently with a five-card major these days.|pg||
nt|joest: I like 3@d just denies a five card major and responder can show a four card one if he has one|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: this doesn't tell the opponents whether opener has a four card major ornot|pg||

nt|robinswr: when you have long trumps tap declarer|pg||

nt|andyv:  which is fine as long as you don't lose by 3|pg||

mb|1N|nt|gosia: 2 @d ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D inverted raise even in comp|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural?|pg||
nt|andyv:  must be in wrong room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said natural, forcing. forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@d will make this match a lot closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 1-round force  but Johnson might not pass for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson puts his cards back in his shirt pocket|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: will see if he needs them again as the auction progresses|pg||
nt|joest: no where to park that little club in the east hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: very similar start in other room  except Garner in South bid 2@C |pg||

mb|p|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: so 4@C just a cue|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: sighs and sets down his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if it was obvious he might have done so by now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is he worried that trump is @S???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing k@s may stop them from 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not on same wavelength re: 4@H may keep them out of 6@D|pg||
nt|gosia: diamonds is trump- afraid to show 1D q with only 9 HCP :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson burying his face in his hand again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if he doesn't, S will still bid 5N (or whatever their K asking sequence is) after response of 2 key cards|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@s on 2@s better|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when they ask for Kings  it is  , not specific Kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he did deny Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks, simson says "this is blackwood" louder than his usual voice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: "who asked you to talk out loud?" and calls director|pg||
nt|andyv:  did he show 2 controls?|pg||
nt|chip: If 4H was RKC, surprised he didn't show the Q.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hesitation and S's comments could be a problem here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias: you lose most of your rights, have to point out hesitations from the other side of the screen|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: with both minors placed well, he is making 10|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think this asks   of kings  and 5@S=none|pg||
nt|psyck: difficult to stop below slam now|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H presumably natural, slammish, and a few Q-bids after that|pg||
nt|psyck: S clearly expected 3@s to have more goodies|pg||
nt|robinswr: jump to 4spade is no aces no kings no singletons or voids, good desciption|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: sorry about the net problems|pg||
nt|joest: 3@s doesn't look like a  Q and was alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may just play here|pg||
nt|kit: Pass of the double probably denies club control, and redouble says he has a club control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hope i'm getting this right|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N was serious if 3@s showed @h fit|pg||
nt|kit: interesting opening lead choice.  I think most would have led a high club.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: 2 dow |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: 3NT looks pretty non-serious to me|pg||
nt|psyck: redouble 1st round control likely|pg||
nt|gulyas: n|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  i think so but I thought 5N would ask for specific kings but I don't have any notes to support that|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still  i think Simson should have shown the Q    extra length could have been important to Johnson|pg||
nt|gosia: still 13 to Aker|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson agrees that he asked for keycards, simson showed 2 without the Q, johnson asked for kings, and simson showed 0|pg||
nt|kit: Grue is bidding a lot on his 10-count|pg||
nt|joest: i know you have two aces but are there any brakes at all on the West vehicle? :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  since they open most 10 counts not vul, E has to proceed with some caution|pg||
nt|pelu: last chance for Lall|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will certainly bid the slam -- he is thinking grand|pg||
nt|robinswr: over 3spades if you bid 4@c and partner bids 4@s there is no slam|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|joest: opposite a limited opener that is optimistic|pg||
nt|kit: 5NT choice of slams -- worried about protecting his partner's king of clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  Grue's hand already limited to 10-13 range|pg||
nt|andyv:  can Grue pass this?|pg||
nt|kit: you are right -- can't be a grand|pg||
nt|joest: back on board 9 Bathurst-Zagorin also missed 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: The other semifinal match shows a score gap also, about the same as here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - unlikely to finesse th 9 on the 3rd @c|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: if 1N limited the 10-15 opening to 10-13, this is certainly optimistic bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: the 7@d in B9 = flat in 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: now in fairness if Grue had Qxx of spades we wouldn't be talking this way :)|pg||
nt|joest: not that we would EVER double dummy a hand!|pg||
nt|andyv:  what's that?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: could end up with 11 unless they cash the @Hs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Well, Grue could have Qxx of spades and 3 aces, couldn't he?|pg||
nt|joest: that's a grand!  |pg||
nt|joest: that's the perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I guess that is 1NT opening|pg||
nt|joest: in the real world|pg||
nt|joest: down one|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 1N 14-16, so this was limited to 10-13|pg||
nt|kit: Anybody have any idea why Grue didn't open 2@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hello again :)|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess they prefer better suit quality for 2@c openings. cc only says 6+ 10-15 hcp though.|pg||
nt|pelu: we missed u Susan :)|pg||
nt|joest: so are we frozen or is garner thinking about the opening lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Grue had 2 chances to go anti partnership but score big swing...pass 4@c dbld and pass 5NT |pg||
nt|joest: well let's rule out the latter|pg||
nt|joest: i think that is 100% forcing and he has no idea what lall has|pg||
nt|kit: passing 4@C doubled way to big a position -- could have slam, and 4@C might not be making.|pg||
nt|joest: and this from the high priest of "I will pass a forcing call if it feels right!"  :)|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- but it doesn't feel right|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I didn't say they were right...only that they worked|pg||
nt|kit: does 4@C even make?|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe on trump coup -- but better be playing for it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh good, I got Kit thinking:)|pg||
nt|joest: that's right play for all four trumps on your RIGHT and the guy who double you on the left to have a stiff|pg||
nt|andyv:  what's the problem?|pg||
nt|joest: everybody would play that way|pg||
nt|kit: routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 5N cold...all you have to do is duck the @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  bridge is such an easy game|pg||
nt|kit: rather imaginative double of 4@C byWeinstein btw to get club lead.  Pity it didn't matter.|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime I have lost contact with what is going in real life in Las Vegas|pg||
nt|psyck: I thought life in LV was unreal|pg||

nt|joest: right now this board is living proof the adage:|pg||
nt|joest: "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"|pg||
nt|andyv:  including most of your money|pg||
nt|pelu: are we waiting for a lead?|pg||
nt|kit: probably a connection problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  they've had a few of those|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe operator catching up with play & will just enret result|pg||
nt|psyck: even if W had a 3rd @s, this would need a non @c lead...|pg||
nt|psyck: oh no, can disc immed|pg||
nt|pelu: only chance to make is: stif @hA and stiff @C on same hand - take out @ss + @Ds and play @H and wait for ruff-discard :)|pg||
nt|joest: we have sent someone into this room to see what's going on|pg||
nt|joest: we may have to crash the table and reload it|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: two schools of thought on splintering with stiff aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|ahollan1: and since not a 1N opener then 11-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson still 100% at asking to see the spots on trick 1|pg||
nt|psyck: operator entering the auctions which were missed out during the disconnection|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South did not want to hear 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: anyone like NAMYATS instead of 2@c by W here?|pg||
nt|kit: Spade lead clearly ends it.  Stiff diamond lead works well also|pg||
nt|passell: what are your thoughts kit?|pg||
nt|kit: my thoughts are splinter if at all possible|pg||
nt|kit: Not the kind he will enjoy|pg||
nt|psyck: less effective 2N after opps have exchanged info|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it looks like 2NT directly over 1@d would have ben @c + @H and delayed bid is the minors|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  one imp to Wolfson...lead should be 9 with 2 to go|pg||
nt|kit: On this hand 4@H is the winner.  But interchange West's minors, and 3NT is the winner.  Would be nice if there was a way to tell.|pg||
nt|passell: or both stiff dia lead then spade shift|pg||
nt|passell: yes I agree  diagnosing shortness is one of the keys to slam bidding|pg||
nt|kit: was going to be a dull 4@S contract, but Cohen introduced some excitement|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South seems to have other ideas|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: reasonable game on slim values, unfortunate trump break|pg||
nt|kit: Note Cohen's crafty redouble -- making sure his partner plays the bloodbath|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: I play it the classical style, showing AK to 7+ cards, about 8.5 trick hand with no 2 quick losers in 2 side suits...which fits here|pg||
nt|gulyas: too strong for that I think|pg||
nt|psyck: this will not help make up the deficit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  getting 2@s ruffs now|pg||

nt|jcwla: Maybe 3@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely we will be catching up now |pg||

nt|gulyas: coming with 2@S|pg||
nt|passell: how bad could game be  against any dummy he might get ?|pg||
nt|kit: See -- Cohen doesn't sell at 2-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@s = shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  always a problem how to evaluate shortness when it's the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: Spade shortness will not exactly excite Weinstein|pg||
nt|pelu: often a problem to show shortness with an A|pg||
nt|joest: true but where can partners extra values be that won't produce some reasonableplay for slam?|pg||
nt|pelu: late - again :(:(|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|psyck: if they play minorwood or kickback, N can easily stop in time after finding only 1 side king after key card response|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 10 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|kit: oh he will certainly get them to slam -- the key is to stay out of the bad grand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  KJ@h?  and 6@c may be wrong sided then|pg||
nt|jcwla: Felt boxed into corner here.  As for 2NT to play on opps' fit auction, more power to you.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gosia: no 13 imps here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Susan, great job.|pg||
nt|passell: probably lose 2 imps  50 to 130|pg||
nt|kit: Is there some reason Weinstein could have bid 2@D Jack?|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to Susan our operator!  and thanks kibs.  Last hand of the set.  Next one starts after about a 20 minute break (I think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  no, not now for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John  and PLEASE  thank the players for us|pg||
nt|andyv:  great effort by both teams|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d = RKCB|pg||
nt|kit: why wrongsided?  Where would a heart loser go?|pg||
nt|joest: well they invert so to show @ds he would bid 2@h|pg||
nt|joest: but it's not GF so he could have done that|pg||
nt|joest: a lot of it turns on what the respective meanings of double and 2NT would be in his balancing situation|pg||
nt|joest: but it certainly doesn't seem like you should sell.  WE may land in the wrong spot but I would commit an error of commission rather than omission|pg||
nt|passell: yes if 1nt doesnt show a stopper then dbl has to be take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Congratulations to the Wolfson team|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks Al and everyone|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT = two without|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@d kickback|pg||
nt|joest: could ask with 5@h now|pg||
nt|kit: Wolfson may think his opponents have found a big fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: Grue doesn't, either?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: which he will -- he needs both kings to bid the grand|pg||
nt|psyck: 5!k would confirm all key cards & trump Q|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d asks about kings generally|pg||
nt|psyck: *5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you right, scheduled restart in 25 minutes from now|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will see you all then :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: break after this hand|pg||
nt|jpes: good night all - it  is late on the east coast|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks to all commentators, Joe Shair, Kit Woolsey, Jim Pestaner, and to all spectaros who are the sole reason for these shows. Thanks|pg||
nt|jcwla: With the whole hand in the minors this is a time I would have started with 1@D leaving @C to be mentioned in some comp auctions.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all, back in an hour|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming, spectators, you make it all worthwhile!|pg||
nt|peachy: Expecially thanking you for your comments and other messages|pg||
nt|peachy: during the break, standings will be posted here for both matches http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals|pg||
nt|peachy: Sorry about the internet service problems, let us hope no more of it :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at least one off in trumps and top tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|joest: 1@d shows a distributional hand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|joest: 5NT = diamond king|pg||
nt|joest: no heart king|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, that was private|pg||
nt|joest: no spade king|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: nicely done|pg||
nt|passell: great deceptive play|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: so semi-finals  will be   Diamond v Welland   and  Wolfson v Bathurst|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty John and Al|pg||
nt|jcwla: For those for whom it doesn't, then. :)|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|passell: now plus 140|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: they code naturally with 5NT showing the unbiddable king I guess|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: so a nice auctionto close out the set|pg||
nt|peachy: Spectator messages are always appreciated to keep us on the straight and narrow :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: probably a quick claim|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to Susan our operator and to everyone for their patience|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c 2 way checkback maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: a @h fin would have enabled defense to get @c ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well done|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: I prefer to always have my coding be up the line, as there may be situations where two of the bids don't correspond exctly|pg||
nt|psyck: this shows the advantage of minorwood/kickback for minor fits|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks all & see you shortly in the next set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kit, Jack, CK, Susan and all the specs|pg||
nt|joest: i agre with you but that's not the way they look at it :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Peter!|pg||
nt|passell: thnx all great job by our operator|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C not terrible if clubs 3-2 -- however .....|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: thanks all   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a lot down now|pg||
nt|passell: after J of clubs and Q from wolfson migta been time to abandon|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen's club play order should have suit-preference connotations|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: same other table too, nicely done by both declarers|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Or sometimes -- awake.  Last night we did a segment with 11 partscores...|pg||
nt|kit: why wouldn't Wolfson play queen from Q109?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, that too,|pg||
nt|peachy: Halftime results http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1, top left.  Also, there are daily bulletins on the menu on the left. Enjoy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|passell: like ly 3 down drawing trump and spade shift|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3 down?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|h4|nt|andyv:  and ty all specs for joining us on what turned out to be the closest match in this round.|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: a pleasure whatever the result|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: good night everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: semis start tomorrow 10 am PDT / 1700 GMT|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen can maybe work out Wolfson has jack of spades since Wolfson never pitched a spade|pg||
nt|passell: he might get a late heart trick unless defense perfect|pg||
nt|gulyas: he did|pg||
nt|kit: sorry -- that wolfson pitched only 1 spade|pg||
nt|passell: I think he will get a late heart for sure|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|gulyas: exciting set, ty for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: bye|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|passell: he has to play a dia now and hop with the king of hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|passell: or an early heart|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|hJ|mc|7|nt|yorkbeach:  not as gruesome as it might have been|pg||
