nt|andyv:  with match this close, I don't think Rubin was changing esp. since his team is ahead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 6 might be a bit off there|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N = reject NT invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: goren-donn played 3NT while NS in the other room attempted 6@d in their 6-4 fit and went 1 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: I have 9 that's worse than most 7s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but each match playing a different set of boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: phew didn't lose the broadcast this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: network burped|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin still studying dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @DJ: rusinow from 4 or more, standard from 3 or fewer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson asks for another look at the spots for the thousandth time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: spade called, simson asks for another second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs    upside-down: count, attitude, smith      NS  also upside-down suit preference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson has changed his gray polo shirt for a black one|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS part of the winning GNT team...I think 2nd time for them.. from Ohio.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson crosses his arms and sits back in his seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin watching the ceiling as he often does|pg||
nt|andyv:  was Rubin serious about playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson in his thinker pose, elbow on his thigh, hand on his cheek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- did Jacobs concede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no one told me if they did concede|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: of course rubin was not serious about playing standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson replied that he and simson were playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nickell team down 48|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and joked that it would be interesting if they had to switch systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody for EHAA??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I'd be all for EHAA, I could explain the bidding better then having played it myself|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: although I usually play strong club I don't know..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a very fun friday night game   we used to play [very illegal]  one card if i dealt,  one card if partner dealt, opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: all the intricacies of either NS or EW system|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hello specs.  This is the semi finals...first set of what promises to be an exciting match|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Karen, Shir |pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW play a precision style club|pg||
nt|peachy: -ley|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Not unexpected double from south.  Will east stick it?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: interesting choice to go with a forcing 2@d before bidding hearts.  I don't know if this sequence got the 5-6 message across or not|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a complex system of relays|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: well not quite.  They do play lots of transfers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3c meant as 3-1-4-5|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|joest: hi Kirshna|pg||

nt|pelu: hi all|pg||

nt|psyck: just call me CK :)|pg||
nt|joest: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no other info|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kareno: If no double, then perhaps the double of 3nt was an error :)  |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: might have been better with the ruffs |pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: I guess garner has seen weinstein's lead directing doubles before :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm Peter and CK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|psyck: 4@s would have gome down if E gets in with @d to play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should have respected his pd's x after he already bid out his hand|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|joest: with the hearts ruffing out, probably to declarer's surprise, this will make 6|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Andy - for me just after dinner, and CK prob late night :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfd: just catching up - welcome|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades dbld looks like 1 down  although it was allowed to make in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: re Susan, lets hope the connection stabilises this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: one can hope, but unlikely|pg||
nt|robinswr: it's nice having more trumps then declerer|pg||
nt|robinswr: and a suit to tap him further|pg||
nt|robinswr: declarer needs to pitch the spades from dummy in order tostop the tap|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kareno: Had north doubled, that likely would have been the defense.  |pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: I agree that the principles of doubling call for Dbl on both contracts. Or neither|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Daniel Gulyas|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|psyck: Bidding looks natural enough, after 1@d anyway|pg||

mb|2C|nt|dinos1: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w could get overboard|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: RKC at low enough level will locate missing keycard and queen of clubs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dinos1: cant be|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 27 miltons and no great fit...think they will subside at game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: just needed Q@C extra  to make 6@C a proposition   just 11 hcp|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: I think Cohen was very lucky here -- could easily have had a club slam, and he never tried to find out.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cohen says do you have another "wolfson special"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N was a very bearish call|pg||
nt|kit: or ace of hearts instead of KQ|pg||
nt|kit: My guess is that he didn't feel they had adequate methods to investigate intelligently.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no doubt he was thinking his auction showed extras as no jump to 3N over 2C..but even his extras have extras|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|dinos1: yes, coz 3N may be last makeable game|pg||
nt|ady: there is a case for west not opening|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: his auction doesn't show club support, extras or not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: reverse smith|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: upside down count and attitude|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3N is last makeable game facing a red on white opener, something is amiss|pg||
nt|kit: In fact, he hasn't made 3NT yet|pg||
nt|kit: and I'm not so sure he will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes W will have more than 9 HCP for an opener at unfavorable. every once in a while i mean:)|pg||
nt|swanson: LHO started with KQx|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dinos1: def has 3@d1@h and @c or @s trick|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: if he plays king of clubs, 10 of clubs, Wooldrige needs to duck to defeat contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: well actually he doesn't, since defense has 3 diamond tricks ready to roll.|pg||
nt|dinos1: can play Q, then come to @hA and clear @d's|pg||
nt|kit: but he should|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: Cohen properly took his best chance of spades 3-3.  Now will have no play at all.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: He is hoping diamonds can't run and South has ace of hearts.|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dinos1: now S will be sqz'd with last @s|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|h4|nt|dinos1: @cK - @s - has to disc @h|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @d endplay|pg||
nt|ady: discarded diamond  correctly   still has heart exit|pg||
nt|dinos1: and if disc @h then @c endplay|pg||
nt|kit: but heart isn't an exit!|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h will set 9th trick|pg||
nt|kit: if declrare plays a diamond, can duck 10 of hearts|pg||
nt|ady: but should make now if exiting with diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: has 5 of diamonds in hand|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- West has to discard on diamond exit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: but dummy squeezed on diamond|pg||
nt|dinos1: disc @c - then set up @h trick|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW 1@d is 10-15 with 2+@ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: it looks like they are better off by not letting 4@S play out|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't mind the 1nt bid - it's a value bid, though partner may assume you have stoppers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  14-16|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe only undertricks were makable there in any game there on a normal day|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 2@H  4-11 HCP, 5-7 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: after the interruption the redeal button didnt automatically work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I was busy typing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 15-17 in 3rd seat vul, and all 4th seat|pg||
nt|andyv:  they will find the @s game|pg||
nt|robinswr: some would bid 1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: 2N modified Ogust|pg||
nt|joest: they're in the wrong event if they don't :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, W has quite a pewerful hand, even opp a 14-16 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: much better to support hearts and ignore the spades|pg||
nt|psyck: I agree with supporting @h, though 4 level is strange|pg||
mb|2S|nt|robinswr: only if playing a forcing club system|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 6+@H and   [i think] min|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|andyv:  low club is winner here|pg||
nt|joest: just gave up on slam. partner would need aperfecto I guess but if the ace of diamonds had been @hKQ....|pg||
nt|andyv:  when NS open 1@d, it's either semi balanced or unbalanced with mainly diamonds or 4-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|psyck: W also happy to hear opps bidding @d (lesser @d wastage with pd)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: garner has the wrong shape, and these are the wrong colors, for saving in 5@d!|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d void is a big minus for slam searching opposite a NT bidder when you have limited values|pg||
nt|joest: if Howard is thinking here we may be in for a looooong session|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will be... both NS are deliberate players|pg||
nt|joest: north more so than south|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: @h2 turned quickly, ekeblad: "may I?", johnson: "mais oui!"|pg||
nt|psyck: he can see 4@s, 1@h, 1@d, 5@c for 11 tricks if blakc suits break|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine 1nt showed hearts, given the rest of the auction.|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we see a ht lead here?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: 8 is probably suit pref for @hs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kareno: This is a very unfriendly hand for declarer.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|robinswr: easy hand just needs both aces on sides|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|psyck: so just took a lil time to see if he had to do anything in case trumps badly placed|pg||
nt|peachy: Weistein might duck this, I guess he is thinking of it anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: kib noted that must duck, squeezed otherwise. |pg||
nt|kareno: North must duck the heart |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|robinswr: or KQ of spades on sides|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: y, some chances with @cA off|pg||
nt|kareno: Two rounds of clubs will finish north now.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: Weinstein playing 4@H North|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  he better play low @c then:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's Howie Weinstein    Steve Weinstein already going to Eindhoven for 2011 Bermuda Bowl as part of Team Fleisher [USA1 from 2010 Trials]|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect west to work this out - there's no reason not to play two rounds of clubs first.|pg||
nt|peachy: The intuitive action was to duck the heart, for a putz like me.   Wiser guys also knew the reason why|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you just duck on principle.  This would be such a case.  You don't know but you fear for your vulnerable major suit holdings.|pg||
nt|kareno: If south held the hearts along with his clubs, the squeeze would require a different way of cashing tricks, but the heart duck would also, I believe, be required.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: Grue will get this one right, he is an excellent declarer|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ady: why J@C from Hurd last hand?|pg||
nt|kit: so made it here when could have been defeated, and went down in other room when could have made as play went|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|dinos1: strange N didnt return @d|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: haven't worked out what Hurd was playing for -- I'm sure he had a hand in mind.|pg||
nt|ady: 6 of either red suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|marlowepi:  losers, no shape, limited likelihood you want a club lead, only four card suit the lowest ranking, low offense to defense ratio.........opening bids in the 21st century|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Wolfson shows arm muscle and Wooldridge writes a note|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 8 losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kit: long experience has shown that getting in the first blow is worth a lot|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dinos1: will N cue in @c's?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: reaches for bid and pulls hand back|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@h = 6-5|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|kit: the question is will Wooldridge drive it to slam himself, since he won't get any cooperation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: carrying that argument to the extreme, every hand should be opened in first seat|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|kit: or he might try 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: RKC hearts probably -- but now they will stop|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 5@d = 2 w/o Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: good choice -- partner can still go back to hearts with only a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|kit: This gives him more maneuvaraility to pick up queen of hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after this auction through 4H, Culbertson 4N maybe more useful:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: well, N cd have @hKxx and @cA...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one is sort of endplayed into making 6H too|pg||
nt|ady: cannot afford safety in diamonds  as needs ace for enty to finesse twice in hearts|pg||
nt|kit: right way to play diamond suit by itself is diamond to ace, guarding 4-0 in East hand, but he has other worries|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: actually over double it's just diamonds, sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: These teams were originally seeded 5th & 10th, but some heavy seeds including Nickell & Gordon fell along the way.|pg||
nt|pelu: NS open on almost all 11 counts - and many distributional 10 counts|pg||
nt|psyck: NS's bidding summary says "Normal 21st century" :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: something to be said for rebidding 2@c|pg||
mb|5N|nt|andyv:  ordinarily 1@s by this pair shows no 4 card major and is similar to forcing NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe played spades and would have made his contract if a) spades broke or b) south held hearts and clubs and was squeezed on the third spade.|pg||
nt|kareno: 5nt would be choice of slams I think.  two places to play.|pg||
nt|kareno: Susan, can you tell us why 2@h was Alerted?|pg||
nt|peachy: Borth knows enough not to pick NT :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h apparently showed diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d shows hearts - some sort of criss-cross I guess.  And now I can't guess what 5nt means.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: consecutive partscores!  good luck partner, I stretched a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  match got tighter as 4@h went down 1 in CR|pg||
nt|robinswr: make the queen of diamonds the king then its clear|pg||
mb|6C|nt|robinswr: the way you show a 2 1/2 spade bid is to bid 2 minor then raise 2@s to three|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|andyv:  unscrambling the tricks will be the EW task|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: well, its a bad feeling to go down in 2@S when u r cold for 6@D...|pg||
nt|robinswr: the spades are so weak that if partner has zero or one spade, 2 minor could be better|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am exeggarating, but u do make 6 as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: very optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  pushed a little too hard on this one|pg||
nt|joest: quite|pg||
nt|pelu: even 4@h need some work|pg||
nt|joest: btw the pass was alerted b/c it said 'lead diamonds'.  A double would have meant 'don't lead diamonds"|pg||
nt|psyck: a simple doubly & raise to 3@h shows W's values for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think their 1@s in comp was either minor, that is why the pass over 4@d|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s was diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: no after thje free 2@H from East W has a GF hand|pg||
nt|joest: we used to call hands like east's "pickles and ice cream"  Some very good things and some very bad things.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all who know the systems for explaining.|pg||
nt|joest: "where do I start" thinks declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: even making five would be a challenge|pg||
nt|kareno: So presumably this auction shows red suits.  Two places to play and clubs was excluded by the 6@d bid.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: but over 5@C he could (sh) only bid 5@h|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  7@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the last score I had was Welland 262-204 over Jacobs.  if Jacobs conceded, no one told me, but it's plausible|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking may endplay E|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: would not be the first time they had|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  his main hope is that all games go down now|pg||
nt|ybob: XX   QXXXX    XXX    AXX  = VERY GOOD SLAM |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: @H10  helps Ekeblad exit trump|pg||
nt|psyck: if you chose to rebid 2@c, would you bid on after 2@d?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt made in the OR.  Apparently they failed to cash out (including diamonds) after declarer surrendered a spade.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|robinswr: while you only have one diamond loser you have two hearts and the fourth club to get rid of|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|joest: my own take is that Justin got a little carried away with his hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will make with both hearts onside.  Nice contract, well played.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest: where the tricks coming from?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|gulyas: you can ruff the @Hs and guess the @Cs|pg||
nt|robinswr: however, 6@d would fetch. ruff two hearts in dummy and play trumps you have a club spade sqeeze|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather be in 5@D than in 2@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: you may not have two fast losers but that's not 12 winners|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: and after a free 2@H it was very optimistick to bid 5@C - the void in @S (one of partners suits) not a big value -with only 4 card @h|pg||
nt|psyck: what would double of 1@s by lall have been?|pg||
mc|12|nt|joest: you'll have to ask him. :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Wolfson shrugs shouldre and is talking to himself|pg||
nt|kit: Now diamond to king, and can score 2 more trump tricks also.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well, he cant be sre about club ace. if N has it then S can have D ace|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad giving simson the long explanation of 1@s|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein with a conservative but reasonable pass|pg||
nt|joest: xxx in lho's suit is a danger sign|pg||
nt|gulyas: N should have discarded on the @CJ and ruff pd's @D winner to play a trump thru|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 3 level max for EW - I look forward to a battle on 5-level :)|pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16 NT this seat/vulnerability|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D=@H again |pg||
nt|sybarra: ir appears|pg||
nt|kareno: Might be hearts or some other two suits, suction style - haven't watched this pair before.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or multi landy,  long in one major |pg||
nt|peachy: Multilandy seems to be in vogue nowadays|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|andyv:  1! may be 4C major with longer side suit 10-15|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@s|pg||
nt|joest: some might try 2NT but that is a HUGE gamble with little reward.  either they double you or if they don't they know how to play the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and that won't happen here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson takes his cards out of his shirt pocket, fans them, then passes 2@c|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d would be quite a view playing 2/1 with void in pd's suit & the style of light nv openings played nowadays|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|joest: well now here they do have thirteen tricks|pg||
nt|joest: unfortunately the d has four first|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1NT would not help you get to the correct strain|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: go smoke|pg||
nt|andyv:  or can be 12-14 with 5@s and 5-3-3-2 dist.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: I'd prefer that you stay and play the dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H is pass or correct,  a bit rambuncious maybe|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: since 1@S only promises 4 -- Drury promises 4   and Rubin hides his canape suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c is art. GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not by passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, just drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad trying to get director to turn dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1NT was ok, but should have bid 3@D then, meaning inv with @Ds, which he had|pg||
nt|psyck: I like that better Daniel|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  this shouldn't take too long|pg||
nt|andyv:  Steve should cash the A of @c and then lead 2nd @d|pg||
nt|joest: since they play 'normal' signals, weinstein might have overtaken there to prevent an accident|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may decide to play low @d and get @c back|pg||
nt|psyck: there won't be any problems defending this one looking at that dummy anyway|pg||
nt|joest: even if garner leads a spade they can't get everything untangled|pg||
nt|joest: only a trump switch would cost|pg||
nt|joest: this is one of those situation where when I am north and partner huddles forever I ask myself "Should I have overtaken?"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@d after 1NT is would you would bid with x/xx/QJ10xxxx/Kxx|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: ok   andy and i have both used our screw up quota    we'll be fine from now on|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: how did you know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not done yet, Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson, laughing: I just hoped it wouldn't!|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard enough trying to remember their systems and what position they are!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director asked ekeblad where he was going, ekeblad: to change my flight home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson still hasn't turned trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow defender throughout this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: unfamiliarity with EW methods and difficulty drawing inferences may contribute|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play udca carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and on cue: if you only had 4@s, what kind of shape could you have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: any longer suit|pg||
nt|joest: uh oh|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|psyck: but donno if I would do it at the table, normal to be worried of misfits & only nv game, also poor @d suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|gulyas: S could make 6@D here again:) as long as no @S was lead either, ofc:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  however if they show AK combo, then first trick is a count request card|pg||
nt|pelu: agree that N sh take @DK + A and play @C|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: sure made me eat my words|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno: Only a trick high :)  With the diamond break.|pg||
nt|kareno: Garner expected more values from his adversely vulnerable partner.|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you have to resist using those weapons :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: defensive moral: when you know what is right, take control and do it|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns, "thanks solly", sits down, carrying fresh coffee as usual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in first 4 boards    Nickell has lost another 13   trails Bathurst by 61|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 2 rounds of @s ... I don't think he can afford a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winner of our match plays Semi-Final against winner of Bathurst v Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: laughter elsewhere in the ballroom|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had an interesting board in the 7th round...20 imps swing for Bathurst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin holding his cards in both hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: folds them again, leans closer to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 4th match on vugraph  so presumably  Jacobs [down 62] conceded to Welland |pg||
nt|andyv:  trying to decide if he can protect against a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, trivial from here if spades behave|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson to ekeblad: go for another smoke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson sighs and leans back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad closes screen to exchange some whispers with simson.  rubin seems not to notice half of dummy had disappeared|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: shuffling his hand, planning his line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: moving one card at a time into order|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  this line is better than 3-2 @s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe his assumption is whoever is ruffing is doing it with the long @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin sips his coffee.   now johnson's turn to tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren-Donn stopped in      4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, if S were 2-2 in the black suits, he could easily be going down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some kind of mixup after a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  S=south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @dq selected|pg||

nt|joest: that's a break for Bathurst|pg||
nt|joest: clearing diamonds while you have the spade king protected looks sorta straightforwarfd|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kit: that will get Hurd interested -- but how interested?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N eschews doble, presumably for fear N will either bid spades when that is wrong or pass when it is wrong|pg||
nt|dinos1: didnt get how he made 2@s after 3rd @h|pg||
nt|ady: might well make 4@H on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think W should be leadin trumps if hearts get raised|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: He has put his hand down on the table and has his arms and hands on top of his head|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has club control and ace of spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and S sounds like he could be void|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  precision 1@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 1D, 1+ and 11-15 or so|pg||
nt|sybarra: best to find @H's instead of clubs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2N forces 3@C   to play 3@C of show game force 55|pg||
nt|joest: do you bid spades or go for the penalty pass|pg||
nt|robinswr: partnership decides whether you open 1@h or 2@h I would open 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Actually, 2+ diamonds according to their card|pg||

nt|andyv:  I'd pass with this vul|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: at this vul, pass ok|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would open 2@H in red, especially with this wonderful 6322|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was just the bid Weinsteing wanted to hear |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: It has enough Zar Count to open 1@h, if you play that way :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad/simson whispering again.  quiet and hard to overhear.  contrast with johnson|pg||
nt|joest: Howie on firmer groundhere.|pg||
nt|joest: and they are on higher ground!|pg||
nt|joest: here comes the 2@h pref?|pg||
nt|joest: Justin doesn't know Grue rescued into a three card suit!|pg||
nt|andyv:  Joe will have to stop running sometime|pg||
nt|joest: Of course Joe is known as being quite 'creative' so from Justin's POV, anything can be going on|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we might play it here |pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck: 1st seat vul & farly balanced hand, my preferance would be for 2@h though, even though i play light in some pdships|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky duplication in @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and realistically partner won't rescue himself to the two level on a four card suit -- or at least he shouldn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: no chance in 3nt, 5@D would have some play|pg||
nt|psyck: other table play some 2 suiter 2 level openings, so could not open that hand 1 or 2 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: only good thing here is they will know it will be a push hand with other table failing in game too|pg||
nt|sybarra: or here |pg||
nt|sybarra: is 4 @H makeable?   |pg||
nt|sybarra: terrible lead problem for E |pg||
nt|peachy: lots of work, abd I think too much, so no|pg||
nt|kareno: Depends the lead and the defense.  With diamond lead, I think yes.  Ruff diamond, ruff club, two rounds of hearts, then clubs.  West must follow and spades go away.|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs saying spade lead,  but I dont see the kjx hand leading a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: on the get go |pg||
nt|kareno: Highly unlikely lead IMO|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  they should stop in 6 although an accident will get them a lucky result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing  3@S=cue   3N=serious slam interest|pg||
nt|joest: this will have a steep price tag|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 4@S = RKC|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad has to lean forward to hear simson.  here in the crows nest I have no chance to eavesdrop|pg||
nt|sybarra: if so perhaps we ask where the mirrors are |pg||
nt|kareno: This cannot fetch.|pg||
nt|peachy: D lead likely coming so Karen's estimate could be true|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if they can bid Exclusion here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: Oops, lead coming from West, not so likely....!|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm afraid south interpreted north's cuebid as support showing.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be perhaps a bit disappointed with N spade holding|pg||
nt|sybarra: (or should I say certainly disappointed?)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  I don't think so with pd having a known suit |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least @s suit is sitting right as is @c Q|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ = better @Hs than @s|pg||
nt|joest: on board 4 north-south did cash out effectively against 4@s unlike here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|robinswr: very slow here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c queen ask, |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: who's on lead? ok, tell me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Exclusion not really needed if 3@S promised @SAce|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: basically he was cuebidding after I chose.  he showed 0 or 3 keycards and no queen of trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asking simson as the auction proceeded, rubin just waited for the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: I showed @h and I liked my hand for slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be much faster to play than 7@h where restricted choice would come into play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: and he's leading a minor again!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sassed rubin about the @c lead last time|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d8|nt|joest: Weinstein knows declarer has at least two spades.  partner would not sit 1@d with five of them|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will have to lead 10@h at some point|pg||
nt|pelu: low-high in @S from S = even No|pg||
nt|pelu: prob @C10 now|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should be able to figure out that S started with 4@s and 5@d so his other dist. should be 2-2|pg||
nt|joest: no|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kareno: Wolfson was closing the gap - this will work against them IMO|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: this group has dished a lot of sass the last 2 days|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|joest: yes there was always the chance partner might atually get a ruff if Joe had four hearts like most peole!|pg||
nt|joest: *people|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: Yes, folks, he surely could have bid 4@h en route to 5@c.|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other semifinal match, , Welland has not been able to start closing the gap|pg||
nt|sybarra: greek bearing gift with that lead |pg||
nt|peachy: I am sure this is not a looming computer crash, Garner thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thinking away :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|joest: Rubin is in 4@h also next door on board  5|pg||
nt|andyv:  W effectively endplayed here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: garner will overtake with the queen to cash the @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should overtake this and cash @dK|pg||
nt|joest: or maybe just duck and ruff out the heart j|pg||
nt|pelu: agree Jack|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|joest: ironically enough if grue had a standard 1@c opener weinstein probablyhas no takeout double and they never get into this mess|pg||
nt|andyv:  all systems come with a price tag|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: going for that entry to dummy |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that 10 point hand is infinitely better than the balanced 11s we have seen them open. quite rightly opens thgis even red against white, not a close decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 7 Losing Trick Count, no rebid problems, playability in 3 suits including both majors, you get to bid the suit you want led, and some defense too. a better opening than many 13 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: counts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: low heart lead ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Wolfson not sure how many you make but I went for the premimun|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead  or low heart lead good enough to beat this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: confess i would bid 4S as N. isnt that part of why we opened?|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h lead - duck: then dcl lose 2@c and @h only|pg||

nt|kareno: Still a loss against 170 in the OR - 12 IMPss|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Johnson also thought he'd lost Round of 16   maybe negative pre-gloat is good approach for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: do I have to keep alerting this?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: simson: yeah, keep reminding me|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: I have a weak NT with 5 spades|pg||

pc|d8|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: halfway chimes.  right on time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: asking about A vs K leads|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|robinswr: if he ducks this he could beat it by leading a third heart and getting a trump trick|pg||

pc|h8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  E|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: 6@H making 7 was a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: asks about @CT, yes preference for @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 115   Bathurst over Nickell by 55|pg||
nt|andyv:  4 rounds of @hs and either AK of @s and ruff or take finesse works|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 111  Diamond leads Deutsch by 44|pg||
nt|andyv:  right now this is the only close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad leans over the table, then sits back and sips his coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin examining the chandeliers|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|pelu: yes a wrong claim by Eblad in 4@H - here making 11 - but nprob down 1 by TD|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  4@h not unreasonable and perhaps Justin wanted to see where NS were going to end up|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe declarer could discard @d on the 3rd @h knowing @d fin right on bidding & another discard avaialble on 4th @h|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 6 now|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that would have worked|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i'm told Welland Jacobs did continue their match -- just not enough vugraph operators for the extra 2 tables|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this looks like it's going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson with his legs crossed, hands folded together holding his cards - typical posture when studying them - then folds his card and takes the thinker pose - typical when studying ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can't get any read whether simson is confident or doubtful in his defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has to duck this |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: covers his face with his hand.  first time I've noticed that|pg||
nt|andyv:  so not sure why he's thinking so long about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he thinks long about everything, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: in defense and in the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren in weird position,  but looks like he's going to make 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: especially in defense.  he has not gotten his share of hands as declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DK still in dummy, trump pulled  to both ways to play @S work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs again.  rubin takes a swig of water|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson leaning back with his eyes closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin stifles a yawn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Goren will play @D??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson rubs his eyes.  ekeblad grabs his hair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: geez  this hand is much tougher single dummy    whodda thunk|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is why they introduced chess clocks:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson shakes his head and finally picks up his cards again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last round Wildavsky took a long time until Doub finally told him to do something.  But that contract was never beatable|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: normally players just sit and stew until the meditator breaks his trance|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: earlier, rubin wrote a note|pg||
nt|robinswr: I'm amazed that Cohen did't ruff with the king|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfd: "if opponents stew on a hand, remind me to wake up. this does not apply if I'm dummy"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops      Hideous Hog:  if you're going to do the wrong thing -- do it quickly|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  this was an expensive ruff|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein might just play a spade back here in case garner has two diamond tricks coming and would be endplayed here|pg||
nt|joest: so b/c of the director ruling 4@h was down on board 5|pg||
nt|kit: I think the reason he passed initially was that he was pretty sure N-S would be stopping in 3@C, and then by doubling and bidding 4@H he keeps playing in spades an option if ...|pg||
nt|kit: partner has 5 spades and is short in hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Which makes a lot of sense|pg||
nt|joest: yes it does|pg||
nt|pelu: and better cards :)|pg||
nt|joest: or in the one in twenty when partner passes 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...Justin is a very thoughtful player|pg||
nt|joest: at some point, after the contract is already down one, I think you have to play a card :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is that in the rule book?|pg||
nt|joest: the unwritten one|pg||
nt|pelu: come on - the 'hole world' wont u to play NOW:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: break  -2|pg||
nt|robinswr: with Kx you should cover any honor|pg||

nt|ady: 6@S   can make|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dinos1: in 6@s - set @h suit|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kit: When Wolfson supports spades, they are in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2 rounds of diamonds could give a losing option|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes of course that is how six spades makes as cards lie. but if NS play twop rounds of diamonds they give declarer a potentially attractive losing alternative|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|kit: that would be an insult if declarer fell for it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: i dont see why. it is not like it is a readout as to how many diamonds E has|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway this will make all the tricks now, for a 5 IMP gain|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be a viable defense to shorten dummy to two trumps|pg||
nt|kit: it is a readout as to how many West has :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cant argue with that, but if E has 2 then shortening dummy could be a plausible objective|pg||

pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cohen says wow to Hurd|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no updates about Welland-Jacobs :(|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: when I enter multiple passes sometimes they don't all go through|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D from Johnson in 3rd seat is standard operating procedure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I need to be more careful to doublecheck|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s coming in and how high now?|pg||
mb|7D|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=@C & @D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D was 2+|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin re: X "I don't know, it's in the notes somewhere"|pg||
nt|robinswr: and when they lead the jack of diamonds you should play the 9 (from 109 doubleton)|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: I hope for NS that 3@H now is forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s cannot make.  diamonds loses only 3 tricks so cheap at any level.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: well, ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@d now|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess they paly negative free bids|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d there would have been a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: true, gives a losing option|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: but dec may have had a count of Souths hand there|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead worth another trick.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  at least this will be right sided|pg||
nt|joest: Garner did something 'flexible' :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is what u get for opening the S hand|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s does make on heart finesse.|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will have difficulty leading a @H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: If S - as here - has to X its diff to find a 5-3 fir in @h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  cards sit well for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be boring push|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: had you covered, put it that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a chance Rubin will finesse twice in @H???|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "probably should be responsive"|pg||
nt|kareno: Hafta underlead the spade :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: He was hoping Weinstein would have a 3NT call I think -- which he would pass|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzfd: as usual, simson asks again to leave trick 1 up for a second.  maybe I should only report when he doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers atop the played trick once it's turned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is good practice    and  automatic pause in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: you want to go smoke?  russ: may as well, never did finish the last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: you're an enabler!|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: I have another partner in mind, once I get rid of him... [rubin and johnson break up laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson sighs.  less inclined to banter than the other three at this table|pg||
nt|andyv:  at the rate of this match, by board 115 we will have all the other vugraph viewers because those matches will be over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we going fast enough to have a rate?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin rocks side to side. turns his head suddenly toward the bidbox|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|robinswr: the problem with opening the south hand is that you have no good rebid over 1@s|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|gulyas: 1NT is ok if allowed by sys|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzfd: did not see which picture card he played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very good chance he'll score both either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: "well... let's start with the ... " [reaches for @HJ]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson counts something out with his fingers, talking to himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem will be if Simson shows @CA   |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns and peeks at the card|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: so now I have it right|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|joest: that's also quite possible kit|pg||
nt|robinswr: I open very light but because of the rebid problem I would not open this|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs requires two cards onside.  hearts requires ace onside BUT also ten to fall.  I'd need a computer for that one.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfd: actually I think @HQ is better if he can pick that johnson has psyched|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: might be able to "mark" @HK in S hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnson can't have all remaining honors or would have 14-16 NT opener|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  best to continue @d |pg||
pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: great @C underlead by Simson  gave Rubin chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: With a heart ruff before the ruffing finesse slam makes easily.  So this is a profit for e/w|pg||
mc|10|nt|kareno: This is a profit against game :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: glad i didn't predict a boring push|pg||
nt|kit: If he bids 3@D transfer and partner bids 3@H, then what does he do?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that may be a speed record for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and junior players saying to themselves...8 ever, nine never...|pg||
nt|joest: on the 3@CX hand n-s were down 2 in 3NT for a pickup for Wolfson|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: = a jump from 10 meter where u dont know if there are water in tha bassin :)|pg||
nt|psyck: he may have had to invent a 3@s bid if he tried 3@d xfr|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|joest: can start with 3@c transfer and then bid 3@s naturally if he wants to|pg||
nt|kit: I like the idea of transfers there, but on this hand playing normal where 3@H is a natural force works out easier to handle|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  there are 12 tricks in NT|pg||

nt|joest: double = cards and quite possibly four spades|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: this PASS  the trap variety|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: since it's not another relay auction [just yet]|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@s|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 5|pg||

mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: Donn 6N West|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should move after 3N bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rubin bidding 3N over presumed 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Russ|pg||
nt|robinswr: some play that 3@c shows a minimum saying nothing about clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: move on, nothing to see here|pg||
nt|psyck: there are tons of variations of Jacoby 2NT played :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 3@h apparently a singleton heart with three spades and minors.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  and nice placement of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: "sounds like doug dodged a bullet on this one" [laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: if you misguess @s on this one I'll be very disappointed|pg||
nt|kit: This is an awkward hand for Garner -- he still hasn't shown the diamond suit and slam interest|pg||
nt|pelu: 13 oop 14-16 but 7@D on|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that convention was named after the late and great Grant Baze|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  should make 7 as S will be quickly squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: "let's see how good they are"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: 2@S would have been juuuuicy|pg||
nt|kit: and the excellent slam is missed.|pg||
nt|joest: on the spade layout yes.  6@d would be nice to reach though|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||

nt|andyv:  20 imps and 6 boards to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ek: when he bid 3NT I was very disappointed; simson: I was very pleased.  should have bid 1@S, harder to get|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would be rude of him|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psyck: he knows pd will not cross when he has AKQJ :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  many possible shapes  |pg||
nt|joest: Lall opens his flat ten count vulnerable before Garner can open his flat eleven count vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, would have been interesting of @ck value was in @d|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you should go out of your  way to compete against 1nt|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they would have bwooded into 5@S and made that|pg||
nt|psyck: right|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kit: Which is why I think it is bad to play 3@C transfer invite or better -- partner can't cross you up if 3@D is forced|pg||
nt|joest: he is entitled to accept with a max|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  including 5 card @s suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: will you let her type, Karen ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you have another chance|pg||
nt|pelu: but when S has AKQJ he could be almost sure on 3@D by pd|pg||
nt|kit: With an invite, I just make an old-fashioned game try -- bid game and try to make it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Her spelling is not as good as her analysis :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: "he's reaching for cards - he bid"|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to have worked pretty well for you last week, Kit:)|pg||

nt|sybarra: probably heard your comments re great bridge |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|joest: there is a lot to be said for that kit.  And it solves the problem we are discussing in some transfer lebensohl methods|pg||
nt|gulyas: another push probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  spades play well for N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad goes through the possibilities for rubin's shape, simson: "I've heard plenty" and passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: a simple way to bid over 2@s is to play 2NT forces 3@c. for other bids assume partner opened 2NT(15-17) and respond as you would to partner 's 2NT opening |pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@c stayman, 3@D transfer|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|kareno: She noted the diamond king onside but suggested they not bid any grand slam on a finesse.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: 1 left to score   Bathurst over Nickell by 41   so Bathurst will play winner of our match in the 120 board Semi Final|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I am faintly horrified that the other table is not ahead of us.  scheduled close in 18 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad riffles his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: but nothing short of a fire alarm would hurry simson|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice steal by Grue-Lall|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: N-S got frozen out of this auction -- but they will get a decent plus score anyway|pg||

nt|joest: +100 i think|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to get in vul for NS here with balanced hands|pg||
nt|kareno: This sounds like a forcing club auction with relays.  I'd think 3@s may have been a relay.  Susan?  Any clarification?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: hi again hope it doesn't happen much today|pg||
nt|joest: up to a balanced three card game force|pg||
nt|joest: it excludes a "jacoby2NT' type hand|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will presumably bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: np Susan, at least we got back immediately|pg||
nt|joest: and garner will 'accept the transfer' to 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe he will find something imaginative|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1N used to be semi-force  but yesterday operator alerted as Forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said semi|pg||
nt|andyv:  they have it marked as semi forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: with the transfer to opps known suit generally acting as a stayman substitute|pg||

nt|peachy: Polish style 1C, natural, or bal 11-14 or bal 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: N-S should not be bidding to 5@S -- goes for 300, while 5@H might not be making -- it is on diamond guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may be a mistake to bid the E hand slowly if NS can get their @c suit in|pg||
nt|peachy: let me clarify on the club, kib says it is not polish style.. This is what it "is" : balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary clubs|pg||
