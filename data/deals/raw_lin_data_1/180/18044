pc|cA|nt|sybarra: only the k of sp stopper in nt,  think I prefer 4 @H|pg||

nt|sybarra: always a bit of worry,  that @H's are 4/1, but no need here|pg||
nt|glen: since this is the friendly layout cup, I would bid 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chick: partner raised spades voluntarily, so almost certainly 4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|roghog:  Perhaps W could protect with 1@h, but I guess you hope to get both majors in. Some play Michaels in 4th seat, of course|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|darrene: Thanks all, restart at 12.20pm GMT|pg||
nt|sybarra: this clearly has a special meaning, perhaps it ghestem|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: this meaning the 3 @C  bid|pg||
nt|chick: must manage to stay out of slam, 4@H is the right place|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: and thx also to Roger, my co commentator,  the multi tasker:) |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|roghog:  Roger Flood is operating in the other room. Confusing, eh?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C is the tradition ghestem that I know |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead will skittle this hand |pg||
nt|glen: in the open room declarer lost 2@D tricks, finessing the @D jack|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: and this is how you get to the scary contract of 5 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *skuttle|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog:  Messy hand to play. |pg||
nt|glen: 5@H is possible if you guess to drop it offside|pg||

nt|roghog:  ..but the lead looks like what it is - a singleton - so declarer draws a couple of teeth|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: we want to thank the CBIA and EBU ad clubs bringing this find event to bbo |pg||
nt|glen: again the problem with the @D jack |pg||
