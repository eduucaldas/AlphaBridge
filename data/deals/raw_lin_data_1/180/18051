nt|Vugraphzfh: welcome everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: this is the third of eight 15 board segments in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|royhughes: An exciting board for us to start with|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi folks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|no alert|nt|roswolf: welland needs to get on track early even with 60 bds to go|pg||
nt|puncher99: looks like routine 4 heart bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|royhughes: The 1C can be as short as 2 if balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but what does the bidding mean|pg||
nt|chorush: 30 boards to go and trailing by 59, Welland will have to play well and get some breaks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a routine 4@H contract, anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi eric|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing 17-18/9|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Geoffrey, Sigurbjörn and Bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D showed @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: 1N presumably shows 17-18 or 17-19 bal   he would bid 1@h with 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but matches are not playing the same boards|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chorush: Hello Andrew, Glen|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South wil presumably splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi Ira|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty for the explanation|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2H says 6+ clubs, no side suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: south shows diamonds as well?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley writing long note|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: the diamond team had a big second eighth to take a substantial early lead in the match|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2@S is something cunning|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Hello Peter, Chip and Bill|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or not :)|pg||
nt|chorush: Think his hand is really marginal for a splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this may well end in 6@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1S was an artificial game force|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3! SHOWS A GOOD FIT I THINKC|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy may be tempted to explore|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Now notes on Weland side|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: maybe, although I think splinters are designed for marginal hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: BUT bidding a grand may be the only danger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: NS I think unclear on what their bids meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is safe enough will make at least 9 maybe 10|pg||
nt|bessi2: with greco passing 1@c, and considering his @s lead I don't think welland as any reason to misguess @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thought 2S was a relay to 2NT to show hearts and longer diamonds, Welland thought it showed hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy asks Bart if they have agreement about 2NT and Bart says positive|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals  shows session scores    partnership system summary forms accessible from there by clicking on team name|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Still no ruling from committee|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: hmm well i cant see why - they are playing to qualify for the BERMUDA BOWL and this is a very simple sequence|pg||
pc|cT|nt|royhughes: Yes, you don't want to be in 7 because that rates to need at least a finesse, in addition to setting up a long spade|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he does need more controls for slam than is plausible for a strong NT though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: some use splinters as a way to help place a game contract; others as a slam bdding tool|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|royhughes: 6C is easy unless clubs are horrible|pg||
nt|compton: 3N sloos to be going to come home here|pg||
nt|compton: looks|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|chip: Diamond picked up 44 the previous set to turn a small deficient into a good lead.|pg||
nt|royhughes: With the Q10 of spades coming down you may make 7|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: the grand is on because of the favorable spade position|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi William|pg||
nt|athene: NS have changed their system recently haven't they?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i thought these guys were a serious partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wolfson has conceded to Bathurst who will meet the winner of this match to determine USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chorush: you could contruct xxx AKxx AJx Axx would be plausibile so maybe you are right|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: the other room playing in 6@C i am told|pg||
nt|royhughes: The grand is indeed on but a red-suit lead would put declarer to an early decision|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|bessi2: aren't ns a relatively new partnership ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: with the match score in mind i dont think they will bid 7|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer thinks Greco wouldn't underlead a king, he would maybe go up ace and go after the spades, planning to finesse in the other red suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: But the bidding may have shown where the red aces are|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is just the sort of board Welland needs|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they need a few more hours work on their basic system|pg||
nt|compton: there are at least 9 easy now, and maybe 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: The committee by phone is deliberating about a hand from the last qtr where there was a clear GS try and a slow sign off in 6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: welland may well pick an overtrick imp or 2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: if they get it right of course:)|pg||
nt|royhughes: ;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thinks Welland showed 7 clubs, stiff spade, and a minimum hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think he's right|pg||
nt|athene: not much for greco to go on; his partner passed up opportunities to double either red suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2 keys, no queen of clubs, and neither red king|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: may be an imp to the leaders|pg||
nt|royhughes: It may be -- or declarer may duck if more worried about Jxxx offside with the king of diamonds onside|pg||
nt|athene: it would be necessary to run this sometimes when east had the @DK but trumps were breaking 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: sorry 4-0|pg||
nt|athene: but better chances from going up with the ace i think|pg||
nt|royhughes: Neither that nor 6-1 diamonds is very likely, so maybe just go for the overtrick!|pg||
nt|royhughes: It must be very close|pg||
nt|royhughes: In fact, with spades coming I think he makes 7 even if he goes up ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup a horrible problem if the grand had been bid|pg||
nt|athene: if your only concern were the overtrick i still am not sure what the best chance is|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes indeed.  In 7 I think I would run the lead and get it over quickly|pg||
nt|athene: so much depends on how likely east is to lead away from the king|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|pef: chip, of course is scouting to see who will be USA2.  He's part of the Fleisher team that won last|pg||
nt|pef: year and is USA1|pg||
nt|chip: Hi All.  NS play a strong club system, so a lead directing 1C wasn't an option in third seat, and 2C a bit rich.|pg||
nt|compton: 5 diamonds, 2 clubs, a heart and a spade|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|compton: that sounds like a large amount of imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: GS is grand slam|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|compton: i guess the slow signoff got raised and the grand made?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: yes Chris|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  Not that late, I see|pg||
nt|compton: and please tell me who may gain or lose how many imps? thanks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h9|mc|9|nt|roswolf: hmm didnt go for the uptrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 11 imps are at stake . @d would win them|pg||
pg||
qx|o107|st||md|1SQ74HJT53DQJ73CQ9,SA52HA976D64CAK85,SK863HKQ42D852C43,SJT9H8DAKT9CJT762|sv|o|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: 11 imps could go to welland if he wins the appeal from a previous hand|pg||
nt|kit: now 3@S, 3NT probably|pg||
nt|robinswr: http://www.bridgewinners.com/ for details on appeal|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky slam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|robinswr: committe hasn't made a decision yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|barnets: needs 7 club tricks and one of two spade finesses|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: or @DQJ to fall in 3|pg||
nt|robinswr: slow 6@H bid followed by a 7@H bid director put it back to six|pg||
nt|kit: very surprised no 3NT -- does he think 3@S is slam try?|pg||
nt|kareno: Cue below game should be looking for best place to play.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No questions or explanations, sorry |pg||
nt|barnets: if you are a lot behind in match slam is a reasonablish shot if you locate @D singleton|pg||
nt|barnets: heart singleton|pg||
nt|robinswr: schermer did well not opening 1nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|robinswr: looks like an ugly 15 but it does have three aces|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: 3 aces never look ugly to me|pg||
nt|robinswr: only four honors makes this hand very poor|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm with you, Kit|pg||
nt|barnets: cant be so poor if play for slam opposite 8 hcp|pg||
nt|robinswr: i dont think that east would think about slam and its less than 50%|pg||
nt|kareno: Agreed, Steve.  However, if they were much more behind, they might consider it.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|robinswr: we're looking at all four hands west had less than a 1nt opener and east had a hand that would not force to game opposite a weak notrump|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't think west  was thinking slam when east bid 3clubs showing less than a game force|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|robinswr: look at the USBF web site for the scores of the other matches|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  Wolfson withdrew|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Bathurst is through to the finals|pg||
nt|robinswr: and how do you know that your partner has J109 of spades and not J9x of spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Bathurst was up 80 or so with 15 boards to go|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|c7|pc|h5|pg||

pc|cK|pc|s6|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||

nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but maybe he keeps that for NV|pg||
nt|athene: no harm in heart to ace, spade just to see if the queen falls, is there?|pg||
nt|compton: ok thanks |pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|roswolf: slamtime|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not as i saw no|pg||
mb|3H!|an|various distributions with short !H|nt|royhughes: No, but maybe he didn't want to make a mistake!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not easy to reach 6C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: many good pairs use some method to distinguish types of raises after a t/o double|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pef: 2h there is a sound+ 2s raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you overbid to 4@H with north trying to induce a phantom sacrifice, but at this vulnerability opps aren't likely to bid 4@S unless they expect to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be duck soup|pg||
nt|bessi2: what system are ns playing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but off to a start|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: either side can easily get too high on this hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1D shows hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: a type of polish club |pg||
mb|5C|nt|pef: 3h is already too high for ns, 3s would be too high for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H or 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunate diamond position so maybe four losers here (spade, heart, two diamonds) but perhaps declarer can endplay east?|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being to just take a diamond finesse at a point when east has no trump to return|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you really want to be in slam?|pg||
nt|compton: Hi markshall, yes 6c is breat bidding, hard for Greco to make slam move but if he does, Hampster will bid a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not world's greates spot but trailing team might bid it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry Welland stands to gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: hmm....in that case sure looks like a 1@d opening to me |pg||
nt|bessi2: but maybe 1@d is limited to less than his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will power to 6nt otherwise they need to swiych to sayc|pg||
nt|roswolf: switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Schermer-Chambers tend to open what they consider bad 15's with one of a suit. Greco Hampson play 14-16 so will open 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I usually lead a @S from the East hand; I think it really boils down to style rather than evidence |pg||
nt|chorush: the club posistion is very fortunate so he will have no problem making his contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Sigurbjorn|pg||
nt|compton: ok, so now i am hearing that Welland would win the 11 imps if Shermer Chambers were allowed to bid seven|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson asks if 4@d would still be KC  . Yes|pg||
nt|compton: on this hand, as expected, greco made no slam try|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chorush: Hello Sigurbjorn|pg||
nt|marlowepi: team with a lead will often overbid to protect against a swing away...but there are many assumptions involved, often tenuous|pg||
nt|compton: the appeal must have been an appeal by welland team to restore thier table result|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: the match is 39 but might be 28|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 1N-3H doesnt get you to slam, nothing will. just not eenough ammo|pg||
nt|compton: as expected on this hand, greco made no slam try|pg||
nt|compton: the doubleton diamond, the J109 of spades and the club break |pg||
pc|h8|nt|pef: michael rosenberg pointed out that e/w actually can make 3s because of the really fortunate club position|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don;t think my keyboard can do justice to your name, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ö|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson deliberating|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but making club JT the queen and it would be more fetching|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: a trump is east's only safe lead here|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "always bid 4H - you get 100% sympathy and 0% blame" - i agree|pg||
nt|athene: now west knows his partner is likely to have vulnerable holdings in all the side suits and will think which to play through to get him off the endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok they may keep their system:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: NS just have to avoid panicking and trying to cash diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: no, michael's right (of course)|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure - what about if the defence force dummy with a third round of hearts immediately?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, both minors are sort of "frozen". They can't play diamonds and if they rise A of clubs, declarer gets to pitch his D's|pg||
nt|pef: although two more hearts here makes it difficult|pg||
nt|smoller: I am not so sure of 3@S - look like declarer cant manage 3 times hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the standard defence when you see a threatening side suit in dummy is to force dummy|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, it was a close decision for W with Qx of hearts, but the rest of his hand is good for offense.|pg||
nt|pef: simple looking actually quite complicated|pg||
nt|chip: And 2H was most often a 3 trump raise.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: We shall have to think of it as a NT opening with a stif honor..not quite right, but functional...|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer also in 5@C|pg||
nt|compton: so first two boards will be a push i expect|pg||
nt|compton: hampson would like to play on an elimination line to make the hand when both spades off and club loser, but eventually his plan will be foiled by the club queen popping up, which ...|pg||
nt|compton: we can all see, but he cannot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a line that declarer might take that lets @CQ score?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Very quiet here . I expect this wont be the same jovial set I had with the other match|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pef: well greco found by far the best continuation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pef: and so did hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: a club switch would be my choice but i can see the cards|pg||
nt|bessi2: an informed source told me that welland just likes to conceal :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: there sure ain't nothing wrong with that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some questions about how balanced "balanced" has to be|pg||
nt|roswolf: no void perhaps!?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I routinely bid this way with 5-4|pg||
nt|roswolf: routinely OMG|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|compton: now six easy for us to see and bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: ok so best for declarer is trump to ace, club, i guess|pg||
nt|chip: If they tap the dummy, as they are doing, can kill the club suit due to dummy's poor spade spots (not second entry to dummy).|pg||
nt|athene: but he's short of an entry to dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|nt|roswolf: west prefers red|pg||
nt|athene: west should have won the first trick and played a diamond giving his partner a trump exit|pg||
nt|athene: now east is immediately endplayed in three suits|pg||
nt|royhughes: That would have been a great play|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the suicidial endplay|pg||
nt|royhughes: Ducking is sort of normal|pg||
nt|athene: even on that better defence declarer could have prevailed but it would have been much harder|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but east will not be amused|pg||
nt|athene: it is sort of instinctive to duck the first round from Axx of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was just too hard to see that this was an exceptional circumstance|pg||
nt|royhughes: The best chance here is a club back, I think. |pg||
nt|royhughes: Then declarer could maybe go wrong if he guessed horribly|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer knows east is in trouble|pg||
nt|athene: the longer east pauses here the more obvious he makes it that he has honours in all the suits|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: yes, @S53 just not doing the job|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: even with 2-2 break|pg||
nt|bessi2: that makes 9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: so on a club return declarer will pitch diamond from dummy on the @CK and just go for diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pef: well that beats it quickly|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|royhughes: Bill, that was well analyzed -- I've never seen that play before (taking ace at T1)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: defending 1NT is quite hard work - too many possibilities to work through |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|compton: eliminate a few red cards and pass the spade to north|pg||
pc|d9|nt|smoller: a bit amazing they can find out to eliminate club tricks this way - very well done|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chorush: will be an overtick imp most likely|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|cT|pc|hT|pg||
nt|compton: now has to stopo elmination i think and pass spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are some quasi-exotic partial elimination lines that might warble siren songs, but  all that is so murky that declarer eventually just did what comes naturally|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, prior to the second club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would that fit on twitter?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|athene: 3@H would make double-dummy (so the Law does apply in theory) but declarer lost to the doubleton @HQ, as you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: neither have i, and i am sure i will miss it next time i meet it at the table :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: a nice game swinf for welland - the comeback begins|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|cJ|nt|chip: If declarer played low at trick one (looking like someone with Jxx) might have gotten N to lead a D.|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, I don't see the point of the queen|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||

nt|compton: flat boards not what welland bramley need|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Some jokes about whether this hand shoulda been played after the committee ruling|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has the sort of hand one can open for a swing|pg||
mb|1D!|an|11-15  2+ !ds|nt|roswolf: instructive defensive problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: another slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|royhughes: 14-16 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1nt 14-16 or just an upgrade?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think they open 1C on 17 and 1D on 11-13|pg||
mb|r!|an|hearts|nt|chip: 1C is 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced.|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H is 8-11 pretty much any hand i think|pg||
nt|pef: greco/hampson play 14-16 nts (sometimes 13, occasionally 0+ in third seat nv :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: some players like overcalling 3@h with this hand, I prefer Hampson's style|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit less secure than the previous hand|pg||
nt|compton: redouble now by Greco wil show 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D opener also convenient for N|pg||
nt|compton: and bramley may just bust four spades, but perhaps, also just try to cue bid something and explore|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  8-11  not 5 spades|pg||
mb|d|an|3 card support|nt|roswolf: well now south must try for the slam bonus|pg||
nt|compton: jumping to 4S not really possible with only four spades, my bad |pg||
nt|compton: support redouble from hampson|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 1D as precision, S cant be sure they dont belong in that suit:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson asked  about the 2@d bid before dbling|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: so he opened their strong 1c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bessi2: 2@s -100 seems likely|pg||
mb|2S|nt|royhughes: This seems to be Puppet Stayman, asking for 5-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the idea is when responder is so limited it's easy to sort out quickly if it's a game or slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: and of course most positives to a strong club are in this range|pg||
nt|bessi2: to answer why.. I guess I like my preempts to be classic|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: 2@s is makeable though|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, it does|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bramley clarifies only 4@S    but thought forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Not sure Bramley was expecting that|pg||
nt|compton: natural followups, no doubt 2S was supposed to be forcing as rule is usually cue of 2D is forcing to suit agreement (meaning a a raise)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|compton: agree, Bramley thought north would bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though another cuebid was available as a safety play:)|pg||
nt|compton: tricky to make any game, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the 2nd cue would need to be @H    3@D would sound too natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without heart lead, working on clubs may get job done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley taking his time|pg||
nt|compton: 3N is possible with 8 easy top tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Bridge is easy, clubs 4-4, so 9 easy tricks in NT, 10 without a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt isnt the most scientific bid and seems to have depressed south into passing - for what it was worth i would have bid 4@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: 3@S showed hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: One advantage is that West has not disclosed his 4 spades|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has the option of leading the @HJ second time playing north for @H9x|pg||
nt|bessi2: plus there are advantages.. 3@h bid makes it more likely for the opps to find finesses more easily if needed|pg||
nt|bessi2: but the line to make is unlikely.. ace @d AK @h ruff @h  @s to king ruff another @h out with a minor|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The EW auction gives decalarer a big clue...|pg||
nt|bessi2: east could just as easily have a stiff @h as a stiff @s|pg||
nt|chorush: Sigurbjorn is suggesting getting to hand and leading the spade J. Not a normal play, but behind by a lot, who  knows?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chip: not sure about the followups here. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: all bids got notes but can't read them from here, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: Well, 9 tricks for NS are easy, its holding EW to 4 that requires a bit of luck.|pg||
nt|athene: he won't want to lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|athene: i assume dummy has shown exactly four hearts|pg||
nt|compton: 4S seems dicey with trump lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|royhughes: Yes, that's an option created by the trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok, he isn't put to the test there|pg||
nt|royhughes: Bramley may have been thinking partner could have Axx|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: bramley felt his partner might have led from @HAxx but he would not have led from @HQxx, so finessing against dummy couldn't really gain|pg||
nt|royhughes: and that playing 3 rounds of trumps would be better than blocking them|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he won't want to lead a club, did someone say that?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no "just as easily" an 8 card fit is more leikle to be 4-1 than a 6 card fit 6-1|pg||
nt|compton: and trumps 4-2, if trumps 3-3 likely 4S manageable, not sure yet though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: ok, well he didn't mind leading from a 4-card suit headed by the ace :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   best to take only 9 tricks to make Welland feel better for passing|pg||
nt|compton: UDCA by Greco showing even clubs|pg||
nt|compton: 2S will score 4spades in south, a ruff in north at least one club and one heart, and one diamond so no problem with making 2S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson massaging his head|pg||
nt|compton: hampson definitely not running his hand throuhg his hair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chris  that's cold     funny   but cold|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: He lost it all after last set|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: many would not want to lead that|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chorush: Again, Greco-Hampson will open the North hand 1NT so South may be tempted to get above the 2 level|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|smoller: 4th best in strongest suit - old learning :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|compton: in 3N north south, race is whether north can get his long club before ew get five tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfh: Ruling is in . Rolled back to 6H so the score is correct|pg||
nt|marlowepi: intriguing possibilities of D exit, and formerly also heart to 9, but discard has put paid to latter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Took em long enuff|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|compton: hopefully the players told now so that Welland will start swinging soon|pg||

nt|compton: but defense may have to get onto diamonds to get fifth trick, lot of imps at stake here as welland will win 6 if 3n down and lose 10 if 3N makes 3|pg||

nt|bessi2: hardly too unhappy either... after all they were missing a keycard and the Q of trumps|pg||
nt|compton: i bet greco hampson not discussing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C covers all balanced hands that don't open some number of NT|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|royhughes: Hampson Greco play a kind of Precision, with 1D 2+ cards|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would not be opposed to overcalling 2@d there... but very few would agree with that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west perhaps a little good for 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told the slam was bid in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: On the prior hand NS got to 5D in the other room, which required a different king of luck: hearts running, and perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: welland psyched a positive to a strong club?|pg||
nt|athene: that's usually sort of a bad thing to do :)|pg||
nt|pef: perhaps 1h is their negative response|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@C is just natural with transfer responses?|pg||
nt|chip: 1c isn't strong, it is most often 11-13 balanced. Here it is the strong balanced version. 1H showed 4+ spades|pg||
nt|pef: ok, the annotation to 1c says strong|pg||
nt|athene: i can imagine someone semi-psyching 1@H transfer in response to a [semi-]natural 1@C|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: at matchpoints you will get lots of takers|pg||
nt|chorush: I would agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not what NS were hoping for|pg||
nt|compton: 1N will make 2 diamonds and 2 hearts and one spade for sure, battle for 7 tricks, feels like victory belongs to EW but 1N is very hard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thanks welland for the dummy|pg||
nt|compton: i see a third heart trick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|chorush: 20 years ago I would have said it is crazy|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|smoller: Spades are very well places, but defence can set up a diamond ruff or a a promotion in clubs|pg||
nt|pef: he's actually cold for this, isn't he?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems very comfortable as well|pg||
nt|compton: interesting here after heart jack is passed and club is switched two, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: blockage|pg||
pc|h9|nt|royhughes: Yes, I'll leave the overtrick analysis to you guys|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chip: In principle 1c is balanced or clubs, but they like to do it on 5-3-3-2 hands of 17-19 even with a 5 card major.|pg||
nt|pef: both spades onside, it seems like it took a diamond lead to beat it|pg||
nt|roswolf: no automatic transfer to 4@S i am pleased to see - which is the usual occurence with these sequences|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pef: two entries to dummy|pg||
nt|bessi2: this shouldn't take too long|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and thus big heart first time as u say|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you do something in spades|pg||
nt|bessi2: but the pass is certainly better on this hand, declarer much more likely to find the @c if overcalled|pg||
nt|compton: North hand squeal home with a long spade for 7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asks to see the trick again|pg||
nt|compton: now two wounds of clubs, bramley guessing to duck first club switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Are you doing your elmer fudd impersonation Chris?|pg||
nt|compton: but i guess if greco merely returns diamonds will make 7 tricks his way, one heart, 3 diamonds one spade and two clubs down one|pg||
nt|compton: yes, i am lisping away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention of Smith Echoes for Greco-Hampson in their system summary or 2010 convention card|pg||
nt|compton: no simithing with honors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: trick still up . Greco thinking|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: it's not a hugely exciting board at imps :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy 11 rather than 12 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I hate Precision|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|athene: @DQ, heart ruff entries for two spade finesses|pg||
nt|bessi2: ducking looks right to me|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|compton: bramley now alive in 1N if greco plays another club, if diamond switch, down one |pg||
pc|d2|nt|chip: not easy for the defense to get this right with the E hand hidden. Now makable I think.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wouldn't a club switch have beaten it?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|smoller: South could have played clubs to beat it (I guess)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: he might play a few tricks out, see if he is allowed to steal an 11th|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suit pref K|pg||
nt|compton: good switch, helped by the rule of 11, greco can tell hampson's diamonds will set up|pg||
nt|compton: this hand sprains the brain now, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: also E knows W has 4 spades, so probably longer Ds on the lead|pg||
nt|compton: three rounds of hearts by bramley? or duck a spade?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|athene: yes there should be a trump promotion|pg||
nt|pef: yes, then the 9 of spades comes into play|pg||
nt|chorush: he can discard on J of spades if not covered|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bessi2: but a little complicated hand... 3 rounds of @s discarding @d is possible|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pef: rather unlikely this will be duplicated in the closed room :)|pg||
nt|compton: fourth heart in dummy looks to squeeze south|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chip: needs to finesse the spade 10 now, and knows he needs that. Heart ruff and another finesse, easy game.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chip: I predict they will have the same auction -)|pg||
nt|compton: meanwhile 3N came home on last board in open room and welland loses 10 imps|pg||

nt|pef: this is the kind of auctions you used to see Chinese high ranking party members achieve in the worldwide pairs :)|pg||

nt|compton: you guys change back and fourth, operator has good last name for bridge|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: welland referring to the fact that 1@D is nebulous so you really don't know which minor to attack on this auction|pg||

nt|chorush: I think spade is better|pg||
nt|chorush: but I dont think anything works|pg||

mb|p!|an|no !c stop|nt|athene: very light 1@S for second seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont know if it was unlucky roy didnt have to bid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: well that wasn't his best choice|pg||
nt|athene: well he has 11, if you count the @HJ twice|pg||
nt|athene: personally i wouldn't even count it once|pg||
nt|royhughes: Don't blame you|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C shows 5 hearts doesn't it?|pg||
nt|bessi2: of course not.. but slam was an underdog|pg||
nt|athene: or it is just a game-forcing relay|pg||
nt|bessi2: ns clearly play a very sound opening bid style|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and South's pass has probbaly kept EW out of game, paradoxically|pg||
nt|chorush: I will predict Welland-Bramley get to 3NT which happens to amke|pg||
nt|compton: now perhaps pass showing no club control, but i prefer just bidding your major suits a la meckwell|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|bessi2: which serves them good here... considering what might happen if south had opened 1@s, it seemed to me ew would most likely reach 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: pass looked as a great winner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D obviously hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: which ended up wagging iys tail|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Any EW balancing auction would "overbid" to the cold game|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: uts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't see why he had to bid so fast|pg||
nt|chip: I think Greco will take expection to this.  On the prior deal EW bid 1C (strong) -1D-1N and lost 7 IMPS|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy starting to warp a bit in view of the match score|pg||
nt|royhughes: Presumably this shows a balanced hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: if diamonds are the longest suit, he must be balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: a disciplined 3@H WOULD ALLOW NORTH TO SQUIRM OUT|pg||
nt|athene: i know NS play some odd stuff - maybe 1@S - 2@D is hearts actually|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has a hand that has little desire to be declarer, so pass convenient|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2@H nf|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: if you aren't going to pass, why not 3@C and play 3n if partner hasn't got four spades|pg||
nt|pef: the spots might be good enough for him to survive this|pg||
nt|chip: He wanted to be declarer to avoid a club lead through, and he did get a friendly lead. Still, 3c then 3S was an attractive alternative (and with the KQ of clubs a questionable ...|pg||
nt|chip: value, an invitational 3s is not unreasonable either)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the problem with 3@C is, if partner bids 3@H (as expected), you can't really bid 3@S because that endplays him if he hasn't got four spades (he can't bid 3NT himself)|pg||
nt|pef: I've noticed that a lot of foreign pairs play 2n forcing (by the east hand) in this situation asking for a description of major lengths|pg||
nt|athene: you could just bid 3@C then 3NT over 3@H hoping partner reads that as showing four sapdes|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
nt|athene: even 4@S is too high :) and bramley is thinking about slam|pg||
nt|bessi2: he must be thinking about either 3@s or 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can seriously be thinking about 3@HXX|pg||
nt|compton: hampson goes low with 2H garbage stayman, he did well, if he had gone with redouble, restayman, he might have gotten too high|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: south is going to commit to game|pg||
nt|athene: but has three possible strains in mind - notrumps, hearts, diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: if you do it this way -- need a mechanism so responder can declare with @C stopper|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 3nt likely to play|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: blood may flow here but whose it is not certain|pg||
nt|bessi2: 3N non serious I imagine looking at his hand|pg||
nt|athene: probably just 4@S-1, flat board|pg||
nt|bessi2: Bramley has to close up shop now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: retransfer to @H|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think 4@h from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is i think a very practical contract|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: but we meander on|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pef: I think the positioning of the ace of diamonds and the doubleton in the north hand means that 4s is going down even double dummy here|pg||
nt|pef: interestingly in the closed room e/w stopped in 2nt|pg||
nt|compton: this is popular US method, but not flawless, if south raises clubs ew can have issues finding fit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: AN ADVENTUROUS WAY TO ACHIEVE A PUSH|pg||
nt|athene: bramley just thinks ok, i only need pd to have some honours in his suits, like @SKQ @DAQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks very dangerous|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: the hands fit well - that @HJ turns out to be worth a good bit after all!|pg||
nt|royhughes: the diamond lead threatens a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: certainly no trump finesse now|pg||
nt|royhughes: stops declarer from picking up the trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT interesting contract; club lead you can just lead diamonds towards dummy and finesse spades|pg||
nt|athene: try for 1 club, 4 diamonds, 1 heart and 3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: of course much harder on a heart lead but how is that getting found?|pg||
nt|chip: Also, EW seem to only have 9 tricks, though winning the first D not best. NS do need to remove the heart at some point. to beat this.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pef: I think he can pretty much lead anything now and beat this|pg||
nt|athene: i have noticed several times in this event the precision 2@C opener has caused quite a few problems for opps|pg||
nt|athene: quite a limited bid when you play it as 6+ clubs so responder doesn't usually have huge problems with the lost space, but opps do|pg||
nt|chip: If N ruffs this, then needs to lead a heart back.|pg||
nt|pef: while we are waiting, perhaps the vugraph operator can let us know if there was any interesting discussion over the bidding of the previous board?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: There was none...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I showed 5152 with a minimum minimum I didn't like|pg||
nt|chorush: In the other room they will certainly open 1 spade|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: I guess roy's response was routine|pg||
nt|athene: i assume bramley didn't open 1@S because he didn't want to wrongside 3nt (partner likely to respond 1nt)|pg||
nt|athene: so he just hides the fifth spade and treats his hand as strong bal|pg||
nt|pef: I think ruffing here was a mistake.  if he playslow and north ruffs, as chip said, north now has to play a heart back--at least there was a chance of going wrong, now almost none|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: My old eyes just can't read most of the notes.  Maybe I should ask them all to print and in crayon|pg||
nt|chip: Now defense is in better shape as declarer can't take another spade finesse. Probably best to throw a D.|pg||
nt|pef: bramley welland play 1c is either natural or various nt ranges, possibly with 5 card majors.  one of the ranges is 17-19 which is what he had|pg||
nt|athene: oh right |pg||
nt|athene: so systemically he couldn't open it 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: or at least he had the option of 1@C anyway|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, and routine for them to open a club with a 5 card major and a 5-3-3-2 hand if out of their 1N opening range (14-16)|pg||
nt|pef: correct (according to their system notes)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco fans his hand, folds it, puts it down and leans back|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: north might imagine his partner has another club honour and not the @HQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the defence mustnt be too active|pg||
nt|bessi2: The dbl of 3@h made his hand worse.. 4@d was an overbid in my opinion after having shown interest with 3@s.. but knowing the intricacies of their system I can't say for sure|pg||
nt|bessi2: NOT knowing their system i mean to say|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bessi2: ahh.. a spec suggests 4@d forced 4@h... end signal|pg||
nt|athene: right could be|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 4D apparently generally asked about the quality of the hand, and 4H was yuck|pg||
pc|dA|nt|compton: mechanism would be that over reopening redouble you can criss cross the majors or even reply one under to show the four card suits|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: yes and this will drift down|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfh: For those of you who are late.Did you bring a note?  Committe ruled in favor of Diamond so the score here is correct|pg||
nt|compton: hampson judged well not to push for NV game|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: ..ok, he finds the heart lead anyway - not much else to do by that point|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that the @C10 might be showing a heart card|pg||
nt|athene: an amusing possibility here is @DJ, ruffed by north, then @HK |pg||
nt|athene: east ruffs and plays @SA and @SJ and north can win but then has to lead into dummy, or north can unblock and let his partner win the last club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson says he 100 percent for 3 and claims|pg||

nt|drewsky: Fred and Brad play 3NT is 6-5 in the majors and less than an opening hand..and Im not joking|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps conventional?|pg||
nt|robinswr: gambling?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|barnets: looks a good contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Color blind|pg||
nt|kit: I'm told it shows 6-5 majors, less than opening bid -- seriously.|pg||
nt|robinswr: good hand for it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 3NT showed both Majors (Chambers asked and Brad was clear enough for me to tell). Then Chambers asked about values and Brad shrugged and pointed to the vulnerability|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Nice to have that bid - and a partner who doesn't have 2 spades and one heart!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred: "good choice"|pg||
nt|henryb:  and a layout where it is cold|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe a trump lead is called for|pg||
nt|kit: they stopped in 3@H in other room, so swing on whether this makes or not|pg||

nt|roswolf: wow a freak|pg||
nt|bessi2: my oh my.. this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: nice flat hand here ;)|pg||
nt|compton: wild hand here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LTC suggests invite, and with probably best lead on the way, prudent decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: looked like down 1|pg||
nt|pef: Did I miss something, wasn't that down 1?|pg||
nt|chip: 4S making looks pretty normal.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry, fat fingers, corrected now|pg||
nt|chorush: Here is the kind of hand Welland wants. Good grand. Can they reach it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: double from north, then 4@C if that's still a splinter for them over a double|pg||
nt|roswolf: where will the music stop on this one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has a great hand but what do you do with it?|pg||
nt|compton: bramley choses pass, |pg||
nt|compton: welland will have to bid something|pg||
nt|compton: because it is his turn|pg||
mb|1D!|an|unbalanced|nt|smoller: Yes, Welland has more spades than usual|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C - 3@C and finish, i guess?|pg||
nt|bessi2: a bidding test for ns here.. can they reach the grand|pg||
nt|compton: there we go|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Stuck in the match I would open 4@h with @s|pg||
nt|compton: NS will now bid to 4H but can EW |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass cool if 56, as pd will expect any discrepancy in length to be heart-heavy....but only by one card|pg||
nt|compton: judge not to bid on?|pg||
nt|compton: only 8 card diamond fit EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco thinking|pg||
nt|compton: so should eventually stop and pop 4H, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, anything but pass would be quite a gamble. listen first|pg||
mb|p|an|sloooooowly|nt|bessi2: I like Welland's style here.. although I prefer opening 1@s myself|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: the thin double means welland likely to get trumps right|pg||
nt|athene: he will see from the opening lead that north hasn't got @CAK so he really should have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|chip: They also opened 1S in the other room, but didn't double. Question about no 4C splinter, but perhaps that is not on after a double.|pg||
nt|roswolf: may play 3nt rather than 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: many would raise the spades with that hand|pg||
nt|compton: double is fairly normal over one diamond, but pass with opponents vul v. not is good choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still, just an overtrick this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C could be bid and let through on the lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp facing a PH|pg||
nt|compton: play in 4H may be interesting, |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy taking his time|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: THESE GUYS GO FOR THE MAX|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco maybe is treating it as too good for 2@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: is 2@h w2 I wonder... seem to recall a pair playing it 10-13... and he might have decided his hand qualified...|pg||
nt|chorush: As I recollect, they use multi for "bad" weak 2's and their weak 2's are fairly decent|pg||
nt|bessi2: i am told it IS 10-13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Schermer offered to explain but Gitelman declined so I don't know what it is|pg||
nt|chorush: they may have changed; that is what they used to do|pg||
nt|chorush: they need to have a bid here that sets ttumps in a forcing manner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: since this qualifies pretty much for a 1@H opening...|pg||
mb|d|an|not so slowly|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: misunderstanding over 3@C perhaps?|pg||
nt|pef: looks like guessing the spade will now be a lot more important than an overtrick|pg||
nt|chip: If 3C is a game try, seems like an overbid with all that junk.  5c looks like exclusion, but can't be. Maybe a delayed splinter?|pg||
nt|athene: welland has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart starts to put out 5D card then corrects to 5S|pg||
nt|athene: he should be making whatever his weakest bid is - maybe he thought 3@C showed a minimum here (2nt system on) but bramley thought otherwise|pg||
nt|chip: Looks like they may well get to clubs or a slam.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@H  may proke them into it|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoke|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely double 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: with a trick ineach major|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if south intends his bid as a sort of "non-forcing spade raise"|pg||
nt|athene: north must surely be wondering about that as he has a pretty easy pass otherwise?|pg||
nt|compton: Roy will likely choose pass|pg||
nt|compton: greco makes takeout double, bramley jumps to 4H?  and pass pass double again, all pass, ???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: One of the reasons why Roy huddled might be so that grecos bid doesnt come fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 4N KC in @C solves most of Souths problems|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: by "non-forcing raise" i mean it's an offer to play but opener can go back to spades if he really hates hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@S is what i would bid but i am a coward |pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 4@s is a decent spot too|pg||
nt|chorush: except if he thinks N is 6-4 he would have a potential pointed suit loser|pg||
nt|bessi2: maybe 4@d is just that|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 4D WAS rkc for clubs and 5D showed 2 with a void|pg||
nt|bessi2: i think he will bid 7@h now.. just a prediction :)|pg||
nt|compton: heart blockage means nine tricks north south I THINK|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: roy isnt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with all of the transfers that welland-bramley play   a bit surprising they don't use them over 1@D-X|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ten?|pg||
nt|compton: bramley now beginning to smell a rat, but he still thinks roy has 3 hearts for pass of 1H, |pg||
nt|compton: 3H by Bart all pass? guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: bramley deliberating|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dain bramage --  Greco didn't DBL 1@D   [thanks josh]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Dain Curse|pg||
nt|compton: i guess there are three spade tricks available in 4H because of favorable heart blockage and ace j x of spades with east, thanks to peter friedland for that analysis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bessi2: oh well|pg||
nt|chorush: If I am correct (and I doubt it) that would ask for the club Q|pg||
nt|bessi2: that would be my guess as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: Should note that this is a complicated new system for bramley, though 4N makes a lot more sense. Now will presumably guess the spade as noted to win a (scary) IMP|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but this is safe enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson: passed me in exclusion again?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told the other room chose the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|royhughes: I only see 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|compton: welland will not raise LOL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco does a dbl take when thetray comes back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland passed . Greco shrugs his shoulders and passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 8 tricks on top plus extras ruffing|pg||
nt|royhughes: which the defence is out to stop!|pg||
nt|royhughes: this may be complicated|pg||
nt|athene: yes, only one obvious loser but it's all about winners|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer doesn't have 11|pg||
nt|athene: no way to ruff a heart then take a double ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: north has too many trumps for that|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm another illusion of a hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence will have to be careful|pg||
nt|royhughes: How do you plan this?  I think you try to make declarer's hand high, since it has the long heart.  So maybe up queen at T1 and play hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm sure Greco is thinking more deeply than that!|pg||
nt|chorush: if this speculation is correct, I expect 7 clubs from north. If it is not correct that wont happen|pg||
nt|bessi2: I am starting to think 2! isn't 10-13.. if it is.. then south should have bid 7@h over 5@d it seems to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ace and another trump and declarer has to decide whether to try to make it (hearts from the top) or cater for 3-0 hearts and duck one|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be -1|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry of course ducking a heart would be cold for 11 tricks, he is only in 5 :)|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if east is going to attack a minor suit, diamonds is the one to go for|pg||
nt|athene: he has too many clubs to hope to set up tricks there|pg||
nt|compton: greco did well |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S playing it awfully close to the vest with his hand, esp stuck 50|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy didnt hesitate after the first round and that was to counter Greco's long pause|pg||
nt|compton: it seems like even a heart lead does not prevent declarer from ruffing one spade, taking 5 hearts, one club and a high spade trick and a long spade for 10|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: We'll have to wait for the book to undersatnd this auction...|pg||
nt|chorush: true|pg||
nt|compton: 170 with club over spade up|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: a spec says he plays QC (he aint led from Jxxxx) and then a heart to the 8|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: many pairs play after 1major - 2nt, 3@C is any min and perhaps welland thought that applied here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pef: claim?|pg||
nt|pef: I think we probably missed a bit of the play :)|pg||
nt|chip: just the trumps.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe we missed the bit where north switched to a trump at trick 3 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: got behind with slow response|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Schermer thought everything after 4C was cuebidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: hopefully Eric can inform us.. I am quite curious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Chambers admitted he had no idea what Schermer had after he showed 6-4, still no explanation for 2H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator just entered Gitelman's opening bid as South with    3N|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|royhughes: a heart finesse is maybe a good idea at t2|pg||
nt|athene: now he'll hope north had @HKJx or @HQJx originally|pg||
nt|royhughes: it loses an entry for the ruffs, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd i think it is always off but the defence needs care|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's difficult because you want to throw a diamond on the 13th spade (which won't be good as the cards lie)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: not sure about that play|pg||
nt|chorush: the right technical line here is interesting. Should clubs be 5-1 he can still make on 4-4 spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|royhughes: But that requires trumps to be drawn|pg||
nt|compton: can hampson score his "long heart" LOL?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco nods his head at the @s play from dummy before rising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred's 3N described as 6-5 Majors, less than opening bid      that's a new one for me|pg||
pc|hK|nt|compton: eventually greco will play heart king, but he has spade count|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h7|nt|royhughes: I didn't see any way for Greco to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: now doomed and a possible game swing for welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: the roof now falls in|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bessi2: not sure that was correct though.. heart to K.. what if west had 2@c and 3@h|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|athene: east can't really have @CAK, @SQ, @HA, @DK (16 count) so diamond back would be the quick way to beat the contract|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: playing boards out of order so this board will be up in a second|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: now resuming on correct board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is West an upgrade to 1@C?|pg||
nt|compton: an absolute bolt of lighting to score 790 on the previous hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland says you coulda opened Flannery . bart says he thought of it. Hampson chimes in with ...... thats all you need 2@ds all pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S an interesting shot if hungry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he might score overtrick in 4@HX|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pef: greco/hampson play both multi and weak 2 bids|pg||
nt|pef: 2h is a sound weak 2 bid by their standards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: After Greco cashed his aces he cont diamonds, roy won spade to dummy finess claim|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt perhaps from north now?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's not the right vulnerability for that sort of bid|pg||
nt|athene: double would work out very nicely but i think many would do that at imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks natural but roy may try something tactical|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco will be looking at a pretty good hand and nowhere obvious to go|pg||
mb|2H!|an|nf|nt|bessi2: welland will surely make a bid showing his Majors|pg||
nt|compton: meckstoth rule for upgrading to 1C is 15 HCP or something like 8 tricks, not enought with west here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry i *don't* think many would do that at imps :)|pg||
mb|4C!|an|splinter|nt|roswolf: south should pass and leave the dice to fall where they will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: for specs, BIT = break in temp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: tempo|pg||
nt|compton: non forcing negative freebid by greco|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i meant 3S by N|pg||
nt|compton: Roy knows the score in his head, and he will start making some moves, |pg||
mb|4D|an|like this?|nt|athene: platnik did quite a lot of bidding in the other room? did diamond ever promise any values?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't blame Hampson for pulling, clarifying his hand type|pg||
nt|roswolf: now blood may flow|pg||
nt|compton: i was thinking the 4D was coming, now Bart will save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4D risks playing wrong suit unless Bart has all wits about him, bidding 4N as safety play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: good point Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but all to gain little to lose|pg||
nt|compton: no, Bart has equal minors and Roy bid clubs first, bart wil bid 5C, but 4N if some kind of diamond lead inference???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i didnt mean oin this layout chris|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy wont know which suit Bramley prefers|pg||
nt|compton: ah, sorry M|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i meant, potentially|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably  4N instead of 4@D with more shape|pg||
nt|compton: yes, 4D is somewhat wild, but perfect for situation that Roy is in. Can really be good upside, like i think this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sure has Greco thinking |pg||
nt|compton: 4D should be a fifth diamond, but stuck 40 is different game|pg||
nt|compton: and actually stuck 61|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: you mean 60|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Not like Roy and Bart dont know they arent having a good set|pg||
nt|compton: forty as far as Roy can be Positive of, he has not really any good result, and was behind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: any more negatives you wanna stick in there?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss didn't realize he had a bid over 4@C  so a quiet 4@H East|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco still thinking . Has turned his back to me to face Roy instead of normal position to the table\|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: maybe decent 18 count is worth a go at game when partner has four spades|pg||
nt|athene: welland  playing his partner for nothing|pg||
nt|athene: 800 is there for the taking|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandbagging!?|pg||
nt|athene: (heart lead, south gets in with the @HK and leads a spade to get a ruff there)|pg||
nt|roswolf: greco hasnt passed yet and nor has south|pg||
nt|royhughes: I would expect Greco to pass -- he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|athene: well greco can choose which way round to put his pass card but i don't see that he has any other room to exercise judgement|pg||
nt|royhughes: I agree, but he must be thinking about something|pg||
nt|compton: yes but 4H has four losers?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass would have meant plus in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: often a minor overcall over a weak-2 shows both minors|pg||
nt|athene: because otherwise you would double or bid notrumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so greco might be thinking that his partner could have clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't pull to 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: bramley doesn't double again because he just doesn't want to hear 4@D from partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes roy i think chickened out|pg||
nt|compton: Bramley got it right somehow|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: of course he wouldn't have been ecstatic to hear 2nt lebensohl then 3@D after the first double, but it's a bit more manageable a level lower i guess|pg||
nt|bessi2: a heart to the 10 would be a clever move|pg||
nt|bessi2: and as a spec suggests.. @c to the 9 might be even better|pg||
nt|bessi2: or J|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right would have been DBL|pg||
nt|compton: dbl not realistic possiblity, bart did well not to save|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson asking about various pass and pull auctions|pg||
pc|d2|nt|smoller: Seems best not to lead the singleton club|pg||
nt|chip: A bit surprised S raised with weak hearts and a soft hand, but guess he didn't want to defend 2S and hoped to make it harder (which it did)|pg||
nt|chip: Good decision by Welland to bid 4S, would not be so great if partner were 3-1-3-6.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy gets the screen closed again and asks Jeff something, Jeff reading roys note and writing a response|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: another question from roy and a response|pg||
nt|pef: making 5 in the closed room was pretty impressive|pg||
nt|chip: perhaps after a stiff club lead?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|royhughes: So NS missed a big opportunity|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|royhughes: They may get 200 instead of 800|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chip: probably questions about leads and signals.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that seems very likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|bessi2: quite easy to let this through|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|athene: welland decided to believe his opps (who were vulnerable) rather than his partner (who was not)|pg||
nt|athene: which was maybe not ridiculous i suppose|pg||
nt|royhughes: True, and Bramley maybe didn't know his partner's 3N was for real, either|pg||
nt|roswolf: but you should ALWAYS believe pard|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: yes, north led a club and got a ruff but that didn't really help the defence very much|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chip: This will hold it to 4.|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems crazy to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   couldn't find the sarcasm font|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco leans into the table and sighs|pg||
nt|compton: hampson greco having good set this hand no exception as 4C is cold NS, |pg||

nt|chip: I disagree, he seems well short of a bid. His hand is better suited to pass, planning to bid 3S over the DBL. Look how strong his partner is and 4S isn't cold.|pg||
nt|pef: n/s is making the call|pg||
nt|athene: one thing worth a mention about the general tactics here - the more active and aggressive your opps, the more you have to really know when your partner's bids promise things and ...|pg||
nt|athene: how much they promise|pg||
nt|roswolf: another action hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hang on to your hats|pg||
nt|athene: because you will often face these "should i believe opps or partner?" situations|pg||

nt|compton: reverse flannery 1N|pg||
nt|compton: playing for a swing, Roy is, |pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: fit jump would be useful here|pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe -- the South hand isn't a classic for it|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should buy the contract because of the @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director question about tempo on previous hand, both before about double and pass over 4D|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM INTERESTING|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wondered if NS felt they might have doubled 4@D if the pass was quicker|pg||
nt|athene: north will not stop bidding over 4@S if his partner has shown some sort of good heart raise|pg||
nt|athene: he has the sixth heart AND the spade void|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW have a chance to beat 5H on a diamond ruff, I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think he they should have axed anyway so arguably no damage|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's hard to stop to double 4@S on the NS cards|pg||
nt|athene: a lot might depend here on whether south can show specifically a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: well evereyone has stopped it seems|pg||
nt|athene: or just some "good raise"|pg||
nt|athene: facing the former, north might not go to the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: facing the latter he surely will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director looking at previous hand to see if tempo influenced Hampson's pull of the X to 4D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: ok, 2@D is normally a 3-card raise i assume|pg||
nt|athene: now north might bid 3@S trying to show his hand and get his partner involved over 4@S|pg||
nt|royhughes: Who is screenmate with whom here?  And Hampson tell who was taking time?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson and Bramley are screenmates|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well see a tactical(ie pyschic) bid|pg||
nt|athene: a bid of 4minor from north should be much more concentration in that minor - north doesn't want to emphasize either minor, he just wants to say "i have a 6th heart and a spade ...|pg||
nt|athene: void"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, the comment appears to have created a problem for him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: South said he was bidding over anything BUT 6H, that seemed to be the source of the argument|pg||
nt|bessi2: ahh  sry.. i misread it.. |pg||
nt|chorush: I think it is a good thing with screens. Sometimes you are always going to bid a slam but you are testing the water for a grand. It is a good idea to tell your screenmate this lest ...|pg||
nt|chorush: your partner sign off at five level slowly|pg||
nt|compton: 6N has 12 winners, but will land in 6H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: did they put the board aside?|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, but N or S? anyway next hand|pg||
nt|pef: according to the vugraph operation, Geoff Hampson called the td|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Director took the board...|pg||
nt|chip: As I noted earlier, 4s would not be a winning action if partner had long clubs and only 3S. Slow 4C might suggest that, but really in this auction doesn't point to anything much ...|pg||
nt|chip: specific (and could be N who was thinking)|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt looks ok over 1@S?|pg||
nt|royhughes: It wasn't clear to me who was taking time after 3@d on the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: ok, not sure 3@D will get the job done|pg||
nt|roswolf: slowly slowly catchee monkey thinks north|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't know welland's plan for future rounds of bidding here|pg||
mb|5N|an|Pick a slam|nt|smoller: Yes Chip. N could be thinking, bur hardly possible|pg||
nt|pef: north balanced with 1nt in the closed room and bought it there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry about spelling of Geoff|pg||
nt|royhughes: He's starting by just showing his 2nd suit (2D was artificial)|pg||
nt|athene: well yes but 2@D was a heart raise i assume|pg||
nt|royhughes: Right|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the last bd welland gained 2 imps - for the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe he just felt he was a bit short of tricks for 1nt vulnerable|pg||
nt|chip: Started same way in the other room, and N balanced with 1N as here, buying it.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Everyone's bidding the other side's suit|pg||
nt|compton: too easy unfortunately from the Welland teams point of view|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trying to get full rightside value out of doubleton D queen. that horse doesnt come in but the NT opener should facilitate slam auction|pg||
mb|6H!|nt|athene: if partner has a dead minimum you could lose quite a lot of hundreds|pg||
nt|pef: not buying it here, though|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks reasonable to me|pg||
nt|pef: me too, will hampson now enter the fray?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, quite reasonable, and likely successful.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: South asks west a question|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like 3@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: snickering from both Welland and Greco|pg||
nt|athene: right now everyone knows (or thinks he knows) it's a double fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the auction has created the fog of war|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: wow this will be won by who has enough bottle|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes, it's a double fit but with losers in the long suits|pg||
nt|athene: bramley might have been better off to jump, but he probably thinks there is good chances 6@D or even 7@D is on|pg||
nt|athene: just give partner @HA, @DAK and there you are|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this will win about 6 imps for welland|pg||
nt|pef: assuming he guesses spades--pretty shocking if he doesn't on this auciton|pg||
pc|d2|nt|smoller: he needs them badly|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, Bramley has an awfully good offensive hand for the auction -- really impossible to double 4S|pg||
nt|royhughes: It will also be hard to find the diamond ruff, if NS play 5H|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will have the final decision|pg||
nt|royhughes: 5@D is better as the EW cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not so sure about that|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought east already has his @D10 lined up against a heart contract|pg||
nt|bessi2: ns clearly don't play gazilli or sth akin to that convention|pg||
nt|bessi2: I shudder at the thought of bidding 3@c with a hand like this|pg||
nt|chorush: But if Chambers said what he said then he effectively convicted himself if there was a BIT|pg||
nt|bessi2: agreed|pg||
nt|compton: diamond lost last year's trials final to Fleisher who is USA Bermuda Bowl 1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: earlier in the day we saw [i think] bathurst  open 1N[14-16] with 4522  16 count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kx Ax in minors|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry folks since they played 83 out of order I couldn't get most of the play|pg||
nt|bessi2: he had to cash the @h queen before playing a @d  then it was down|pg||
nt|roswolf: welland putting the hammer down now|pg||
mb|1N|an|semi|nt|athene: (and leading a club might be necessary if you have to set up a club and then get in with the @HA to cash it, say partner has @CKQxx and they are 22)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|smoller: looks like needing one of 2 finesses for a slam|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: a quieter hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: in knockout matches is is unnecessary to rule on an appeal if it doesn't matter either way... I seem to recall that this is the practise but might be mistaken|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: several specs have asked but agreement on last board was making 4 only|pg||
mb|3D|nt|smoller: well that places the @SK, if the can see eachothers cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: both E & W wrote long notes, |pg||
nt|smoller: *if they can|pg||
nt|chip: DBL by S looks wrong. In a GF auction puts yourself a little at risk and gives away your hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco now asks Bramley question and he writes another short novel|pg||
nt|chip: Here might stop a slam that would otherwise be decent.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: maybe short story, novel implies fiction|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|smoller: yes hip, South hadlt wishes to compete to 4@S or 5 in a minor|pg||
nt|smoller: *yes Chip|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bessi2: a spec asked me where the tournament is being held.. I unfortunately don't know.. but I'm sure some of you do |pg||
nt|chorush: Las Vegas|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Green Valley Resort in Henderson NV, just outside Las Vegas|pg||
nt|chorush: In a hotel perhaps 10 miles East of the airport|pg||
nt|chorush: Actually, the hotel is in Henderson, Nevada, a suburb of Las Vegas|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: its OK Steen, I'm hip to it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|smoller: its my keyboard, not me|pg||
nt|chip: Could work out well though if it gets NS off track of what they know about their relay structure.|pg||
nt|athene: the double might encourage bramley as much as anything - if the @DK is missing, south should have it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 113  Gitelman 6@H south|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss didnt find the NT opening?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|athene: but still he knows that whatever losers there are in the black suits will be hard to get rid of|pg||
nt|chip: and doesn't know about the D 10|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if it has come up yet    NS play odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|smoller: West opened pass in the other room where they were not close to bidding a slam|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|royhughes: and faster|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer play a spade and go for overtricks, or just cash out for 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S from Moss    go figure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson leaves the room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many of us would rebid 2S with E hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: define  us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: If opps were Vul I mighta tried dbl with Bramley's hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I am sure that 2@s denies 4@hs Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bypassing 4@C/@D  makes a lot of sense   but not  bypassing @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco sighs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Mumbles something and the whole table relaxes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland goes to the water cooler|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bessi2: what happened now I wonder.. what are ns signals |pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: there are only two hearts out there, so it's safe to play the spade, isn't it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I am not sure if Greco unblocked @h 10 at trick 2 but just in case I unblocked it for him|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|royhughes: He can afford to play spades -- just 2 hearts out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I expect he did. Would be very surprised if he didnt. Definitely led the 6 at trick 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Ill let you know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley needs to lead another @s here to have a chance I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D might work too    i'm in a loop, can't really decide|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is looking at all hands    -  i'd never come out of tank at the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Declarer cant get all his @cs pitched. I think a @d might work as well. Bramley puts his hand down and crosses his hands over his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Now picks up his hand and slowly fans it out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: and plays.......................................................|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h8|pc|d6|nt|royhughes: So should make 3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: taking the diamonds and conceding|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|drewsky: The official WBF/USBF/ABCL rules when behind screens is that 15 seconds is ALWAYS pemitted.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|drewsky: regardless of the auction|pg||
nt|bessi2: often much longer,  if, for example, it is uncertain who was thinking,  if i am not mistaken|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director inquiring about meaning of the auction of the 7H hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2H is 10-13 promising 6, 2NT inquiry|pg||
nt|chorush: If the auction was cue-bidding after 4 diamonds I don't understand 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|bessi2: in that case I think 7@h should be allowed|pg||
nt|drewsky: correct, but even if it was certain who was thinking, there is NO infraction if 15 seconds or less.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: North thought 4C is 6-4, South was not sure but thought their agreement was a diamond void|pg||
nt|bessi2: ohh.. in that case I am not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: he apparently wrote "who knows" as his explanation|pg||
nt|bessi2: how long, approximately was the hesitation ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: the current questioning is about 1) was there a hesitation; 2) did it suggest bidding over 6H?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Everybody asking about everyones distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 to play      needed more hands like that earlier in the set|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gitelman 4@S south|pg||
mb|1C!|an|!cs or balanced|nt|royhughes: EW make 4@s but both have passed once|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w now have a chance to do something|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!ss|nt|athene: east will surely do something |pg||
nt|roswolf: east may be able to bid at his next turn|pg||
nt|athene: and west will bash 4@S in|pg||
nt|roswolf: and did|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1D shows hearts -- I wonder what is happening|pg||
nt|athene: ok, welland forgot the system or is slightly psyching again?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N/S said the entire auction was slow; E/W felt that 6H was considerably slower than the previous bids|pg||
nt|drewsky: The final ruling will be based on how long the hesitation was...if under 15 seconds, 7@H will stand, and if over 15 seconds, then it will be changed to 6@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: it felt like that to me as well... I expected a director call|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: definitely going against the field to pass that north hand|pg||
nt|pef: in the closed room schermer did not open the bidding as north.  schermer/chambers must be about the only pair in this event who wouldn't open the north hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't like that overcall very much I must say|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy is in wild man mode|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the hippy table - put some flowers in your hair and ignore conventional behaviour|pg||
mb|1N|an|17-19|nt|roswolf: psychic probably|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't know what system options are for North|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@D shows hearts, that explains why greco isn't attempting to show a major 2-suiter :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: so they missed a game that looks like it will probably make despite the bad club break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: hamp witing note for Welland|pg||
nt|chip: For Greco this is a good opening bid. Would certainly open if spade Q were the J, and probably if it were the 10.|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl shows 3@H?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS IS A MURKY AUCTION|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2NT a spade raise, like previous board|pg||
nt|athene: east has a pretty good hand for a passed hand, in a way|pg||
nt|roswolf: UNCLEAR|pg||
nt|royhughes: I suspect 2N says there may be game|pg||
nt|athene: but then again in another way he has a pretty bad hand :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, East has a good hand for having passed, but maybe a bad one for having bid a vulnerable spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes being talked out of game is a hideous sin|pg||
nt|athene: he will expect his partner to have a singleton heart but that isn't marvellous|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's ok as at least hearts aren't getting overruffed, as north has 4 (ha, ha)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Game is borderline: spades come and hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|royhughes: Are you allowed to psyche an artificial bid in this event?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think this is an interesting aspect of transfers over 1@C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: both east and west know north may be at it |pg||
nt|athene: but you don't really want to have to try to ruff 3 hearts in the west hand|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is the one with the big spades|pg||
nt|chorush: To be clear Drew, that is the director's ruling, not the ruling of a potential appeals committee|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: even for roy I find it hard to believe the 3n call|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, by anyone.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N & S both writing notes for opps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|chip: Perhaps 3D was ART, asking.|pg||
nt|chip: Seems odd for Hampson to choose hearts, and looks like this can be beater by either tapping the dummy twice, or leading trumps.|pg||
nt|pef: 4h can be beaten fairly easily by forcing dummy to ruff a diamond.  but somewehre in the auciton hampson may have shown spade support|pg||
nt|pef: aren't we starting to run into time problems here?|pg||
nt|chip: yes|pg||
nt|pef: what's the time limit?  2 hours and 10 minutes or something like that?|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, 2:27 in the morning here :)|pg||
nt|chip: yes, 2:10 for 15 boards.|pg||
nt|pef: so we are up to 1 hour and 45 minutes for the first 9+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other treatment is that 1N still shows Weak NT but specifically 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: oddly rightsided in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland says umhummmmm|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: i should think so - these guys dont need to be molly coddled|pg||
nt|royhughes: I guess NS can beat 4S on a diamond overruff|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland asks about the lead. Told Q or short. Asks shortness being.......... told 2|pg||

nt|bessi2: at least 3 imps for welland here.. 13 if he plays trumps right|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: This all looks well-judged to me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: this is how not to bid a hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very declarer friendly layout|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: i think he should by the way.. east possibly had an easier overcall with void in @s than west did over 3@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|royhughes: Can South score his diamond 8?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a sane contract|pg||
nt|royhughes: It looks to me like repeated spade leads may beat it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asks if lead attitude. Confirmed. Bramley says one more time so they leave the trick up|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|bessi2: Hampson will be very happy|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now the moment of truth|pg||

pc|h8|nt|bessi2: nearly impossible in my opinion|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|athene: even if declarer judged to duck a trump, north just keeps playing spades|pg||

mb|1H!|an|spades|nt|athene: 1@H natural and forcing 1 round, maybe be only 4 hearts with a long suit, i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|either 2 or 3|nt|athene: *with a longer suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: north must avoid the temptation to lead a @h honour|pg||

nt|drewsky: Ira, welland-bramley do not play a strong club|pg||
nt|chorush: Let me amend that. they do play that a one club opening followed by 1NT is 18 or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Nice club spots for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: another welland 3 imp pickup on 71 2@S-2 in the other room|pg||
nt|drewsky: Mr. Shermer has seen Mr. Moss's 1@C openers before :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: nice lead by Schermer|pg||
nt|bessi2: the best lead in fact.. when in with a @h he can play another club freezing the 3rd club trick  unless he wants to cash it and free north's remaining @c|pg||
nt|chorush: they have a good chance to beat this. Declarer is likely to win the club K in hand to play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|bessi2: welll.. not quite accurate on my part.. moss can lead low @h towards the 10 twice, forcing an entry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: they have the momentum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe  "side-effect" less pathological than "fallout"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson states that clubs by you would be natural|pg||
pc|dT|nt|drewsky: Although the scorebaord shows Daimond up by 24 IMPS, the actual margin is really 35 as the director ruled 7@H back to 6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the argument for accept transfer guarantees 3  is that it aids competitive auctions|pg||

pc|h2|pc|s7|nt|athene: but you are missing the @D98 too so a lot of the time when south has the @DQJ his suit would be good enough to lead the queen|pg||

pc|d3|nt|pef: that's a lot of passing with a near solid 7 card suit|pg||

nt|athene: no way you can duck a diamond to east and endplay him|pg||

nt|roswolf: west have to be awake when declarer plays a diamond off the board|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't see any way either.  And Hampson can rise with the jack if you get close|pg||
nt|royhughes: But Welland will give it a try, I'm sure|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson says: I wish you were declaring this one :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland lets out a big yawn|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: welland trying a swindle|pg||
nt|royhughes: This looks dangerous to me -- might he not run into a diamond ruff on a hand that was makeable?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but roy is well versed in judging the table vibes|pg||
nt|royhughes: and I'm not sure -- maybe it's fairly safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially he puts max pressure on opps when others dont|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: now Bramley can afford to lose 3 trump tricks  [pitching @H on 3rd @D]|pg||

nt|bessi2: Bart must have felt a knot in his stomach when he discovered 3@h was passed out|pg||
nt|bessi2: ak onside qxx and can still be beaten|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EAst ahppy to have stolen the contract|pg||
nt|bessi2: VERY nicely done|pg||
nt|drewsky: now THAT is a great auction using great menthods|pg||
nt|chorush: Moss-Gitelman did very well to get to 5 clubs here|pg||
nt|bessi2: that 2N showing @c presumably invit + and 3@d some sort of super accept perhaps ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: We get into the whole russinow thing again |pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: same auction as before, so east has shown 5+ hearts? so i guess 2@H from west now|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe 2@C really is ambiguous|pg||
nt|athene: or hampson just doesn't care and wants to get out as soon as possible|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart says j with length but it is Roy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2 discouraging @H  tends to show @D values  [odd/even discard]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|royhughes: the alert said 5+H, 4+C for 2C|pg||
nt|athene: okie|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@D was alerted as a superaccept of @C|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bessi2: perhaps showing better @d than @h ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems plausible|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like this... maybe if I ever play transfers again I will play it like this :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with both  rd suits well held & great @C, he'd probably bid 3NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: i wonder what he does with the canapé hand - maybe he bids 1nt|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: welland slightly on tilt; there are two segments left|pg||
nt|athene: no need to get this swingy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: so with Roy   10  promises the 10   but just barely??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart studying. Those that think about their discards always have 4 card suits left|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|royhughes: Lots of finesses to take, but not so many entries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: canape hand does bid 1NT--Welland just asked|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bessi2: some may feel Welland got what he deserved, but in my honest opinion, I feel this is another unlucky hand for him|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Jack of @cs should make a @h play safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: But either red suit OK I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H sure seems to risk less|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and per Barry's comment    @CJ very thoughtful play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Room dead silent except for Welland making faces at me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is bidding final board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley sits up and fans his hand and then unfans it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: and ununfans it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: pulling the @h 3 out |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: headfake!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 120 board final over 2 days  will pit   Diamond vs Bathurst  to determine USA2 for 2011 Bermuda Bowl in Eindhoven, The Netherlands|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bessi2: +1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: So who won the Bulls game?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: tytytytytytytytytytytyty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know   but K J Choi won The Players Championship in sudden death|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: hope I got everyone :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: over David Toms?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   Toms 3-putted the playoff hole |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I guess Hampson wasnt ready for that play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Probably knew what to play if bramley played a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quoting    BULLS by a bunch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: thanks everyone :) got it :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: So a lot of bull|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
pc|h5|nt|caitlin: hesitation on 6H bid..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|royhughes: As the cards lie declarer can ruff a good heart to play trumps again|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|athene: you get extra style points for ruffing a winner to achieve some strategic end|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is bridge jim but not as we know it|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bessi2: pd will seldom have a solid 21 count there|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: if welland knew 4@H would end the auction he might well have preferred that|pg||
nt|roswolf: last board coming up|pg||
nt|bessi2: ah now.. my eyes are deceiving me again.. @d not running|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe a safer line is just to play hearts, willing to lose 3 trumps and a spade|pg||
nt|athene: he's going to try to ruff a spade in dummy|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2C is cold this way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson shrugs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good assessment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: but still not ready to play. A wave of sound from the kitchen help takes over the room|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: choices of how to go down 2?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: making 4 is pretty impressive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: wasnt ready for that either|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: this ahnd is taking way more time than it needs to :)0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminds me of boot camp:    hurry up and wait|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|royhughes: and will make 3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: your analysis is as optimistic as your overcalling :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chorush: still going to make it|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d9|nt|chorush: maybe not|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cK|pg||
mc|7|nt|chorush: I would have expected him to lead second spade and riff out spades; if they didnt break then squeeze|pg||

nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Roy and Bill for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: welland definitely still in the match|pg||
nt|royhughes: And thank you, Geoffrey -- this was a fun segment|pg||
nt|athene: plenty of time yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 15 mins approx|pg||
nt|athene: but he was scared his partner was not going to stop over 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley: if you raise we're in slam|pg||
nt|chorush: srry I am half asleep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer in 5@S West |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: so tomorrow we will get Diamond and Bathurst. Game time at 10 in ruffly 12.5 hours|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: so with one board to go we're down to 27 imp difference with 76 boards to go|pg||
nt|pef: the match will resume very soon--in theory at 6:15, but maybe there will be a slightly longer break than that|pg||
nt|pef: thanks to the earlier commentators, chip martel, bill frisby, roland wald and others|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: thx to eric and all my fellow commentators and the specs who i trust have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|bessi2: he made an action bid and was trying to rescue himself.. sure.. no one has ever done that before|pg||
nt|bessi2: my oh my... not the best play by Welland to go down in 3@d|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: now roy might pass this|pg||
nt|roswolf: but some specs vote against|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|shows 6|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: tactical (and somewhat odd) 1nt from welland|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: most have some sort of bid for that north hand, like 3@S, say |pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect his pard makes all appropriate allowances|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I don't think it was alerted as forcing unless I missed it|pg||
nt|athene: well if 4@D is a cue it's an overbid|pg||
nt|royhughes: If Welland is cuebidding up the line, he has denied a club control :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now roy will lurch in-perhaps not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did 2@C promise 4+  or was it  one of those   maybe bal game force|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asks about his raises and everyone wishes everyone a good match|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pef: possibly 1s denied as many as 4 spades there|pg||
nt|royhughes: something is rotten|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: after bd 73 welland leading the set 27-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is excessive althiugh the club hole has been highlighted |pg||
nt|roswolf: well diamond has had much the best of this set|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a 60 imp lead is unlikely to be pulled back|pg||
nt|passell: both matches  |pg||
pc|h4|nt|bessi2: Welland's operations will have to more successful if they wish to mount a comeback the last 30 boards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all for now|pg||
nt|bessi2: thx all.. been a pleasure|pg||
nt|darrene:  Cheers guys|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: will leave this room open until other room finishes|pg||
nt|bessi2: at first glance it seems like this will be a flat board|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|robinswr: lead five-card suit. if you don't have one then lead partner's five-card suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: 8 tricks.. I can't see a 9th anywhere|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: yes, west should be able to find the club lead, i think|pg||
nt|athene: on this auction|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS are fortunate hearts break|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pef: so a normal pretty dull contract to end this set|pg||
nt|pef: the heart overcall may gain declarer a trick, actually|pg||
nt|pef: unless greco leads a diamond instead of his partner's suit|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec ducks a diamond and def cash 3 hearts south gets squeezed in blacks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: WEst also |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pef: yep, hard not to lead partners vul. overcall suit when you have 3 of them|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pef: very quick claim because they are a couple minutes over the time limit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|vugraphzfe: In the other match, Wolfson has withdrawn, so tomorrow's final will be Bathurst against the winner of this match. |pg||
nt|chorush: A lot of specs are asking about a potential appeal. A quick recap. NS bid to 7H on board 96 but the director found that !) there had beeen a hesitation before 6H was bid and 2) ...|pg||
nt|chorush: that the hesitation might have influenced South to bid 7H. 7H made but the result was retrned to 6H makeing 7. The board will probably be appealed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: The ruling is being appealed. It will be heard as soon as this table has finished play. We will start play in the final segment after the committee has heard from the players and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the director will tell the players the result of the appeal as soon as it is decided|pg||
nt|robinswr: too important points don't huddle and then sign off. If you're going to bid 7 bid 7 right away|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: if you keep on stopping in 5 of a major, eventually fate will get tired and rebuke you|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think West plays a diamond hoping for the ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 74 east is playing in 1@H|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c6|pc|s3|nt|bessi2: Schermer better not play his pd for J109xx in @h|pg||
nt|robinswr: he now has an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|robinswr: entry to his hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: weak hand with diamond entry is playing it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|royhughes: because it could go away if declarer is 5512|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing in 4   we'll actually finish before the other room|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|henryb:  interesting problem because if declarer had @cK he would have 9 trucks unless the defense already has 5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bessi2: gitelman could just as easily have 2335 as his actual shape.. but then perhaps his play so far is suspect|pg||
nt|robinswr: must play a spade now|pg||
nt|bessi2: still.. they must not cash their hearts|pg||
nt|bessi2: that's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|bessi2: tricky hand for the defenders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: never mind   their score already posted :(|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|bessi2: north can play @s now or ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead signals where the jack of hearts lead is either top of three or four + to the QJxx|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|chorush: good play|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he can make it|pg||
nt|bessi2: ahh.. strip squeeze if @s now.. informed to me |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chorush: but stil makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my best guess     connectivity problem   and hand is over  players have left and are at the bar|pg||
mc|10|nt|henryb:  but another way to give 9th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm afraid to leave|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Barry|pg||
