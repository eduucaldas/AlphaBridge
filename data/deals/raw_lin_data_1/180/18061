nt|Vugraphzff: Everyone discussing styles carding etc |pg||
nt|cherilou: hello all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pef: the bathurst time had a good last eighth with no swings more than 6 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge Hurd play light inititial actions and 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|stevo:  John Hurd's nickname is Jimmy I believe that its because Gavin Wolpert one time said why is your name Johnny you look like a Jimmy and it stuck|pg||
nt|pef: anyone for passing on the north hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: last 15 boards of the day. 60 more tomorrow|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|stevo:  i think pass is very reasonable but close|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|cherilou: I don't like pass|pg||
nt|pef: of course a case could be made for passing on "jimmy" hurd's hand, also :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is close also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad says ty|pg||
nt|stevo:  not their way they play precision opening but standard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: checks their convention card|pg||
nt|pef: me too, certainly would pass if they were vul and us not|pg||

nt|henryb:  now a low @d to the Q?|pg||
nt|stevo:  ealier in the tournament against Zia "jimmy" opened 1@H went double p p XX and Woolridge left  it in getting Zia to run with KQ9xxx|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pef: I gather that wasn't best?|pg||
nt|stevo:  the kids have a lot of poker in their game which I respect|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stevo:  Zia would like it back im pretty sure|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Woolridge spins the @h 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and flips it|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge has absolutely no fear and backs his judgement |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|stevo:  which can be said for many of the players in this final|pg||
nt|cherilou: must be the youngest final ever|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cherilou: by decades perhaps|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, this may be the only time nobody is eligible for the senior events|pg||

nt|joest: hey eric|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs playing a similar form of Precision   system summary forms available by clicking team name at  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Finals|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Eric|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi eric  andy  & specs|pg||
nt|andyv:  after 30 boards, average is a little more than 4 imps per board total|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iceking: Welcome back|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|joest: i can't figure out if the 6 of @ds might have been a Smith Echo|pg||
nt|joest: i.e. "I liked your spade lead", probably showing the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither pair mentions Smith|pg||
nt|kit: if Hampson had held QJ10 of spades he would have played the jack, not the 10, making it safe for his partner to continue|pg||
nt|kit: So Greco should know the spade position|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  which is normal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi henry|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and wayne|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jade: good evening from South Dakota|pg||
nt|joest: howdy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  trying to decide whether to cash Q@d now or ruff low |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  chose correctly|pg||
nt|wstuart: Seems like he's spending a lot of thought about an overtrick - he's cold for 2@S regardless.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jade|pg||
nt|kit: hi Jade|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Finals lets you access system summary forms for the finalists   click on the team name then appropriate pair|pg||
nt|psyck: Operator will enter the players names once he gets a chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 tricks but the auction was murky and i fancy we are in for some torture|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: my guess is we again have  N:Grue  E:Greco S:Lall W:Hampson|pg||
nt|henryb:  The world wants to watch Fred and Joeboo. of 1100 kibitzers they have 900|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: at the risk of sounding like David Bird's parrot, hi Jade|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wstuart: I forgot to shower and ran them all off.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think Fred paid them|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  finessing here?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Probably as it is his only play.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: both play a Big Club   in fact they use the same opening bid descriptions|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wstuart: He can't return to dummy if he plays the J and it loses.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  I think he should have pitched the club from dummy rather than the heart|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cherilou: has the rest--will claim soon|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: agree|pg||

nt|stevo:  1@S is very preemptive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|pef: three nt makes on this hand e/w with spades 44 and the luck in clubs, but will they get there or come close?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|pef: what now on the east hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|stevo:  2@C is not pretty but really his only bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks to me like 5@c also makes|pg||
nt|stevo:  now 3@H I think|pg||
nt|pef: he punted with 2c, not good enough for 2h reverse of 2nt, anything else is just silly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurd thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: good auction|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge was worried about his spades hard to blame him|pg||
nt|pef: turns out this makes with the luck in clubs and luck in hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pef: not a lot of losers, but need a lot of work to get to 11 winners|pg||
nt|stevo:  I think if west had the 9 of spades he wuold have bid 3NT as its a blocker|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: stop talking poker Stevo!|pg||
nt|henryb:  he needs at least one spade ruff|pg||
nt|pef: complicated hand.  is there a clear best line?|pg||
nt|stevo:  :) Barry is referring to blocking cards which is very common in pot limit omaha|pg||
nt|henryb:  or lots of diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurd staring back and forth between his ahnd and the dummy|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks natural to ruff @D's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: now in thinker pose|pg||
nt|henryb:  which would be more complicated and probably a losing option on this layout|pg||
nt|pef: 3nt might not be as good a contract, but has the advantage of being really easy to play :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might win and play a spade first for communication|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pef: indeed, they got to 3nt in the closed room|pg||

nt|stevo:  interesting line|pg||
nt|stevo:  now trump shift looks like|pg||
nt|stevo:  but i think he survives on trump|pg||
nt|pef: once the 10 of hearts fell it seems like once it did you should switch direction|pg||
nt|stevo:  maybe need spade spade?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: @s @s works for defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: cant ruff the last @d|pg||
nt|stevo:  phew its cocktail hour at levin's house was nervous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: the 4th @d|pg||
nt|pef: this might be the first game swing of the afternoon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: LOL pour me a stiff one . ill be over soon!|pg||
nt|stevo:  i will drink it for you |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think everyone onto the @s @s defense now except Fred|pg||
nt|stevo:  on spade spade he cant cross and ruff out diamonds because q clubs is in short diamond hand|pg||

nt|andyv:  precision 1@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=(10)11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, Marshall, they weren't yawning until you suggested it|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW are playing a strong @C with 2+ @D suits, 14-16 NT I think.|pg||
mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks destined for 3nt|pg||
nt|iceking: Greco maybe 2 strong for 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: might just instead jump to 3nt now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  NS Platnick-Diamond also playing Big Club   Wooldridge-Hurd play jazzed up 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: he will think about it for sometime|pg||
nt|cherilou: X and bidding your suit shows this hand to me--about 8 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so 2/1 & not prec for NS then with this pair|pg||
nt|iceking: almost can play 3nt vs zero hcp|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|iceking: as it is this will work also |pg||
nt|iceking: but i dont really like this bid|pg||
nt|cherilou: he took a position and will make the contact|pg||
nt|roswolf: i always say thinking a lot leads too often to mistakes -imo this deserves to be a disaster|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  and their 2@d opener is short @ds and 11-15|pg||
nt|henryb:  The movement to play transfers after overcalls has not yet reached the States|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other room   1@D(precision)-X-P-3@C//P-3@H-P-3N//all pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he lands on his feey|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: feet|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's slowly getting here, Henry...another 20 years:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: soloway was proselytizing for it decades ago|pg||
nt|wstuart: The 14-16 NT is very popular in the strong @C community these days.  Getting the balanced 16 HCP hands out of 1@C made a lot of difference to the Precision players.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psyck: yes 2@h or 3N look better options|pg||
nt|iceking: he is just 2 good for 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|wstuart: Note that though the very popular Precision system is just starting to come around to this idea, I believe it first started with Shenkin's @C system in the 1960s and was also part ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: of the Orange @C used by Hamman in Wolff on the Aces teams.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for W to duck @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D to jackis likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe but 4@H would be worthy of HH himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Wooldridge shows   response to DBL wasn't clearcut  either   2@C vs 3@C|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i overcall with upto bad 18 , so my x & bids are strong, & still this looks too strong for 2@h here|pg||
nt|iceking: yes Hampson must have been close to 3@C bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: but world champs tend to be right more often than not|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see all lines make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course 2@H rebid insufficient --  take away Hampson @CKJ and still game|pg||
nt|psyck: Maybe more likely to bid 3@c against a prec pair like other roon than a 2/1 pair this room, due to the @d holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|iceking: decl afraid @D are 5-1  |pg||
nt|iceking: he has no entry home if he playes 3rounds of @S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4  [since 1@H denied 5+]|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: NS 1N opener is always 14-16|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hearts not much to crow about, but E angling for W to bid 3N, as spade holding may be tenuous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@S=waiting, not natural|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: Rusinow leads probably|pg||
nt|jade: and that way its not his fault |pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: S playing W for 2452|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  j@c must as for @h switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Lall returning his lowest spade, so if his partner has 5 he will know they run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grue-lall  rusinow vs nt & suit    greco-hampson rusinow vs nt     |pg||
nt|marlowepi: also the 7 cant be a power spot|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson can also see it is lowest spade, and if spades 4-4 it can't hurt him to put up the queen|pg||
nt|kit: that is what Hampson is thinking about -- does he trust the 3 of spades?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|iceking: this will be a push 450 coming up in few sec|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is meaningless here  but  i just noticed on their system summary form|pg||
nt|jade: Q@S = 9, low @S = 10 or 11|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jade: though pitching a @H costs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hurd playing 5@C East|pg||
nt|kit: Grue doesn't know the overall position, and from his point of view a club is safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but the real question i show can it help|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: is how|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W knows hearts likely to block|pg||
nt|wstuart: @D is betting that they can't run 5 @H tricks or that S wasn't winning the @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from most holdings that dont block, N would have led one|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now he has to guess - what kind of @H blockage is most likely.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Note that a heart was discarded from dummy to try to talk opponents out of a diamond shift|pg||

pc|c9|nt|andyv:  the @h pitch was interesting...I wonder why not @d|pg||

nt|cherilou: was it really 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|stevo:  I like his lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i thought they played 14-16|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge had to bid 3@H to stop the @H lead |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: obv not at this vul?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: dead silence here|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks like no way to make this|pg||
nt|pef: hard to see any way to make this|pg||
nt|cherilou: I know EW are aggressive but really..........|pg||
nt|pef: or even come very close|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: oh yea it is 16. half asleep here|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might win and play k@D hoping for duck by ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  according to the card 14-16 nv, 15-17 v|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: gitelman meditating|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h9|nt|stevo:  not exacly happening|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|cherilou: and if not go -200?|pg||
nt|pef: probably playing for a doubleton ace of diamonds is his best bet to come close to making|pg||
nt|pef: or doubleton qj|pg||
nt|stevo:  I have to admit i like the K @D they duck it so often|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Greco hampson same auction and I know they play 14-16|pg||
nt|pef: probably not on this hand :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  im getting to use up all my bad luck running good|pg||
nt|pef: it's only the rueful rabbit who could duck with that diamond holding and be right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: that would make an interesting construction problem|pg||
nt|stevo:  to answer questions im getting its not that the k@D is such a great play I just find it to be winning they duck it with aq and aj so often|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: The tempo slows down the later rounds of the event|pg||

nt|stevo:  i would stayman |pg||
nt|pef: 2c wins if partner bids anything but 2h|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS probably play Smith--that should make this easy for Fred to return @H|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge asking about carding but cant hear|pg||
nt|pef: boy, you seemed young at heart when I played with you, Henry|pg||

nt|henryb:  Young at heart but old in spirit|pg||
nt|stevo:  so is there a right @D play here Henry?|pg||
nt|pef: since they haven't played a spade yet, isn't low 2 to 1 right?  K would require an initial doubleton qj|pg||

pc|h5|nt|iceking: 2@C showed @C and higher and W passed accepted @C as trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  heading toward 3N|pg||
nt|kit: Grue might double this -- invittional auction, and he has heart stack|pg||

nt|kit: I like to think that I would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you lead into he bid major, you dont have a four bagger, so dont squander spots that mght grow up|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW  did make 5@c for a push on 47|pg||
nt|jade: That is a tough contract to make|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wstuart: It's interesting but impotant to note that after a 1@D response, 2@D was not forcing.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S hand not a joy to lead from|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb:  am I crazy, or is 6@c cold E-W?|pg||

pc|h7|nt|iceking: still north has a hell of a def vs 2@C but maybe afraid pd has stiff for his takout dbl|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|iceking: but 1400 missed |pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should surely want to, having a maxish 1D and having bid a suit W is short in where E has  no values|pg||
nt|kit: Now Grue in cash it or lose it sitution.  That is why Lall should have led club back.|pg||

nt|stevo:  very hard hand Joe boo did great to make it in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: well the good news for Brad is he has a count on the hand|pg||
nt|pef: which is what happened in the closed room|pg||
nt|pef: so he has to not ruff,|pg||
nt|henryb:  not clear: Barnet is trying to convince me that is was cold by winning two trumps, ruffing a heart in dummy and later wndplaying East in the majors|pg||
nt|pef: and then I guess he only can take one low ruff in dummy so does go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Director hovering |pg||

nt|andyv:  1@d for EW has to be at least 2|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: yes, bundle it into a 1H rebid, or dedicated a second round jump|pg||

nt|marlowepi: canape|pg||
nt|jade: I do not believe we should pass when we could be cold for a game and go down in 1N|pg||
nt|kit: the lack of HCP for the opening bid is compensated for by the strong heart suit :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|wstuart: Does anyone know if 2@C is GF over 1@D here?|pg||
nt|jade: how much will greco bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: W could bid 1NT but it's a very soft 15--I like his choice|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or he'll be thinking pinochle deck|pg||
nt|kit: Greco is done -- why would he bid anything more?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@h = balanced minimum|pg||
nt|jade: though 4 x 1 might discourage him a bit|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Edgar Kaplan professed NT overcall should be BETTER than Strong NT opener|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thinking, yes, but not salivating. if N has heart pictures there might not be enough trics|pg||
mb|5C|nt|iceking: i think its close call dbl isnt that pretty either|pg||
nt|iceking: but it is more save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: basically it is unfashionable to take penalties from very good players - they are mere mortals after all but their reps often save them|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW  upside-down count & attitude    NS standard carding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: If 4@C were forcing (which I think it should be), that would have been Lall's best call toset the trump suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that seems the right auction|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|iceking: its interesting what W should bid here and iam sure experience told Hampson dbl was better |pg||
nt|andyv:  playing limited opening bids, he may not have wanted any accidents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with that @S holding in dummy  attitude/count don't seem to apply   should @S2 show suit preference |pg||
nt|marlowepi: even SP seems otiose looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Should is always a very dangerous word when you change the meanings of signals on the fly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was the most non-committal one i could think of|pg||
nt|kit: I think that a signal should always have its default meaning unless the kibitzers 5 tables away and the janitor know it doesn't.|pg||
nt|andyv:  their notes say trick one exceptions on lead showing AK but don't tell you what the exceptions are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it right to define @S2 as suit pref   when dummy holding rules out need for attitude/count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at least that way default is not yours in de postmortem:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise UCDA and primary attitude signals|pg||
nt|jade: Whatever is the most meaningful signal to the person playing the card|pg||
nt|kit: the most meaningful signal is the one partner is sure to interpret correctly|pg||
nt|jade: exactly|pg||
nt|andyv:  told it was standard|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|wstuart: I hear that 2@C was 1 rd force initially, but I don't know they're system after that point.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: is it so clear that the spade suit is known?  Gee, I'll bet none of us have ever overcalled on AKJx.|pg||
nt|jade: That good?|pg||
nt|jade: Sometimes I might have AKTx|pg||
nt|jade: or worse...|pg||
nt|kit: But my point is, if East has overcalled on a 4-bagger then he doesn't know that the play is intended as suit-preference|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some play ace attitude king count or the like|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer unfortunate that short diamonds on his left and short hearts on his right|pg||
nt|jade: Why is it necessary to change here? There was also an auction|pg||

nt|kit: Declarer can take 7 trump tricks, 1 heart, and 2 diamond -- he need onemore trick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: E playing with fire|pg||
nt|wstuart: Risky line of play?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to say the least|pg||
nt|wstuart: the @H hook is 50%, East thinks he can improve on that because....  if S didn't lead one to start, maybe they either can't take 4+ @S tricks or he wont' lead them again.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade shify should be fairly clear on the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS do play udca so 4@h may have encouraged this line of play|pg||

nt|henryb:  Its not like the other table is far ahead: they have not yet completed board 52|pg||
nt|pef: but this probably won't end until Tuesday on the East Coast|pg||
nt|henryb:  at this rate it may not end until Tuesday on the West coast|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry was sleeping set over|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry have to go thought I would get about 10 hands----nope. Bye and enjoy the show.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Brad still in a trance?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yup|pg||
nt|pef: see on board 51, Lall and Grue had a bit of a bidding accident about what I double showed.  turned out wrong to play in the micro-Moysian (that's a 3-3 fit)|pg||
nt|henryb:  thanks Cherilou|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i wonder if N can snaggle a funny position against E who has both majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge did overcall 1N   he's younger than Hampson|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it may not, right. but isnt it more likely than there is no spade danger?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: South had this thumb on low spade for quite a while before he played it|pg||
nt|henryb:  East refused the @h finesse at the other table also|pg||
nt|wstuart: nice to have some way of making a dist 3 card limit on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: rsearch project for a graduate student|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after opening PASS, Moss did get to 5@C on 49|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Lall glad he has good spades|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: othewise opening 1C at these colors would be inviting army ants|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wstuart: Some folks play 2NT as LR+ and 3+ trumps.  That has a lot going for it if you can move the natural 2NT bids into another auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: transfer over 2N rebid??|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 4@D autosplinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s wont go overboard here - he says confidently|pg||
nt|iceking: if they play like that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H length purely coincidental|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N rebid shows 17/18|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: now @D shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: so is this mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if alert says  short in your suit   or just as Magnus says  mild slam try|pg||
nt|iceking: so north will check keycards now with his maximum|pg||
nt|roswolf: my confidence ebbs away the more north thinks|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have like to show my shortness here, even N did open 1@D its usually the key reach slam show your shortness|pg||
nt|psyck: I play Xfrs after 2N rebid as Inv+ hands too & so this would be a mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diamond platnick will have strong 1@C auction   that will give them more room to explore|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: lack of imagination is a blessing|pg||
nt|iceking: dont understand this bid at all|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@S may well now be bid:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick  3N north|pg||
nt|iceking: why not just check out keycards |pg||
nt|psyck: N did not check KC to check for trump quality instead maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because keycards won't give enough info|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant believe if 4@S here is slam invit 4nt is 2 play that doesnt make any sense to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this focuses directly on trump suit|pg||
nt|cherilou: 5@S sure seems aggressive when partber probably showed some mild slam interest and you have 2 little @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you want to be in slam opposite  @SAQxxxx  @CA ?|pg||
nt|iceking: north hand is super slammish though he has max in hcp and no jack in hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is utter lunancy if you ask me - but i am not playing for a place in the BermudaBowl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is an awful lot to bundle into a jump that takes us to the 3 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Right Magnus, normal to make a try after this seq|pg||
nt|cherilou: N has minimum for his 2NT bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me IFF [keyword] bidding over 4@S  that 5@S is best bid|pg||
nt|psyck: N has a very good max as 2N is 17-18 for them|pg||
nt|iceking: that will just have to happen then, bypassing rkcb is just crime in my books as there is no defense if you reach silly slam with 2 keycards missing |pg||
nt|psyck: South should have just rebid 4@s on 2N maybe|pg||
nt|cherilou: S had entire 5 level to que bid and didn'r--N should pass 4 @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has no real extras - and his trump suit is not really robust|pg||
nt|iceking: its little soft not try for slam with south hand i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry entire FOUR leve;|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: anyway they are at save level|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment but a scary few minutes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|iceking: safe sry|pg||
nt|jade: Fast hand|pg||
nt|jade: for about two tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the limited nature of 1@H  meant Lall wasn't tempted to explore slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S can only be motivated by possibility of a 4S save. but why not bring both blacks into pictures. enhances chance of club lead etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  also the limited nature of Justin's hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: i like LR+, but only with 4+ trumps|pg||
nt|kit: 6 heart tricks, 2 diamonds, 1 spade.  Is there a tenth?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|iceking: now @S to ace @D to dummy and @S to ten|pg||
nt|cherilou: 2nd hand of the five we've watched where bad bid caused no harm. |pg||
nt|jade: I would have chosen 2C|pg||
nt|ferlema: some more photos from last set in www.confsudbridge.org|pg||
nt|andyv:  doing so also gives additional info to opps when it's unlikely that you will win auction|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wstuart: Not really.  You make 2NT LR or slammins and put the bal min @S GFs into another sequence.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|iceking: ugh|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: halfway point of time just expired|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that;s true in general, but if your reason for bidding is hoping to fetch a good save, why not expand the search?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|kit: now heart shift limits him to one ruf, and the diamond ruff will be 4 tricks for the defense -- 2 clubs, 1 spade, 1 ruff|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jade: I also think 2@C chews up more real estate|pg||
nt|kit: But the spade shift might not work so well|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Now declarer can get back to his hand via spade ruffs, and take 7 trumps, 1 spade, 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iceking: this should have been a rather simple safety play |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Vugraphzfh: grue (laughing): back to this position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would @D play work if  greco shape was  5314|pg||
nt|jade: I am not sure I would have chosen this line|pg||
nt|kit: no.  I don't understand why he didn't just ruff club, queen of spades, spade ruff, draw trumps, claim|pg||
pc|h8|nt|iceking: anyway didnt matter this time|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   seems he had no play if @S 6-1|pg||
nt|kit: Now Grue still has to guess what to do|pg||
nt|jade: what guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Grue taking break to get some water|pg||
nt|kit: if trumps now 1-1,ruff diamond and claim|pg||
nt|jade: I believe that the contract is now dead as a doornail|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand would be easier to play if E had shown a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|kit: on actual layout he has worries, but spade ruff, club ruff, spade ruffis okay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: king of D, later ruff club|pg||
nt|kit: since king of diamonds lives|pg||
nt|jade: what about the fact he has already lost 3 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: but he has to decide which to play for|pg||

mb|1S|nt|iceking: bidding will end here |pg||

mb|d|an|can be 5 hearts|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 49  Moss went down in 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ew range varies  4th & 3rd vul = 15-17  otherwise 14-16      ns always 14-16|pg||
nt|iceking: @D lead looks normal here|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS will get to 3N here|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he has that|pg||
mb|2D|nt|iceking: i guess not|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing lead|pg||
nt|jade: DO we know the line he took?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  makes it hard for Wooldrtdge to bid 3N|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think the only consideration is whether to open 1@H or 2@C.  Openeing the bidding is a certainty with the east hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought N would bid 3N with his hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not close for me, 2C is the better suit & more preemptive|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Hurd should try 2N rather than 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4th highest of longest and strongest though|pg||
nt|iceking: @D lead in open room |pg||
nt|cherilou: that usually works the best--S following tried and true|pg||
nt|iceking: this lead might not matter though|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS still have time to get their @S, 2@H, 3@D and @C|pg||
nt|kit: you can see it from the movie Jade|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: i remember reading about rubber bridge games in england   there was a cash pool for winning 1st round of a suit with the 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: this looks best |pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is something to be said for a 1N rebid by W|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson might have rebid 1NT with his spade stopper|pg||
nt|jade: true enough, just wondered if it was anything unusual|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|wstuart: N doesn't have enough to bid 3NT.  But he can make a vlaue showing 3@D which is both safe and allows S to bid on with an above avg hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: now Zagorin needs to go for @S|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like 3@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: someon somewhere did a very long BOREL simulation and found that 4th highest of longest and strongest gain most tricks in any denomination over 51% of the time- a mind-boggling ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: statistic|pg||
nt|iceking: Ten would have been better i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: @S 10 is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid = 11-13 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: for example, if E has a bad hand with long mediocre hearts, he could bid 2H over 1N but will probably pass 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  biggest difference seems that Greco ruffed air here on @d and Hurd was able to ruff K@d|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a mixup -- apparently Lall thought his double of 2@D was penalties, Grue did not think so.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes new partnerships dont discuss what auctions mean at such high levels:)|pg||
nt|jade: Or maybe given his hand, he hoped it was takeout|pg||
nt|kit: and it will be an expensive mixup, as they don't have anything close to a home.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and how does South guess that North has a club stopper?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem is, there are many hands WITHOUT extras than can make game|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why I prefer 3N...5 card suit and Q@c somewhat protected|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamonds is higher than clubs so cant ask for the stopper|pg||
nt|wstuart: If the t/o DBLer bids 3NT after a 3@D jump, should N think that he is taking is DBL back?|pg||
nt|andyv:  their requirements for dbl may be less once pd is a passed hand, so 3@d may be the saner bid for them.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2N is plenty on N hand. there are holes everywhere|pg||
nt|kit: but will Greco know to pass now, or will he think his partner has a stiff heart?|pg||
nt|jade: it will be expensive if Eric passes|pg||
nt|kit: Everybody plays these doubles as takeout, it seems, so partner never knows when they can pass.|pg||
nt|jade: and even then, Joe might get out for down 3|pg||
nt|jade: or 4|pg||
nt|jade: or 5|pg||
nt|jade: I think he will get out for down 2|pg||
nt|kit: I believe this sort of low-level double should always have at least a doubleton in their suit, so partner can pass with 4.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Lall's first pass apparently showed 1 spade, as he could have XXed to show 2 (per Grue)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: so 3@S 2@H 2@D for onedown|pg||
nt|cherilou: Now 3@S, 2@H and 2@D|pg||
nt|cherilou: E just can't get to 7 before NS do|pg||
nt|roswolf: a small gain for diamond|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jade: more reason Joe should pass 2@D doubled|pg||
nt|kit: now ace of clubs, diamond ruff, clubscash, 4th round of clubs for 7 of hearts uppercut I believe.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: We need to see some imps soon :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well it was hard to imagine the teams maintaining the 5 imp per board average|pg||
nt|kit: hardly comfy lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  they got here by being super aggressive...hard to turn that off all of a sudden|pg||
nt|jade: but Lall did not and that means I still think Joe should pass|pg||

nt|jade: Is the bar open?|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile, N is having difficulty in 4@h in OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ""Curious hand", hooted Oscar the Owl. "Neither side can maje 2H"|pg||
nt|jade: Joe's father had it right.....Tom Grue predicted down two.|pg||
nt|kit: more curious -- both side try to play in the enemy's best fit|pg||
nt|jade: Maynard Smith is buying for the journalists|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does that include Rusinow?|pg||
nt|jade: why not|pg||
nt|andyv:  so Bathurst may gain another 12 imps on 50 and lessen the blow of this board|pg||

nt|ahollan1: max would optionally bid 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: this lead yesterday to a bad slam missing a cashing AK being bid - only thing was the opps didnt find the lead|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so this could be better than min also|pg||
nt|cherilou: One of the main threads running through this Trials ---lost opportunities|pg||
nt|wstuart: S still ahs to be able to compete iwth short @C there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well slam is better on these hands might be bid as well|pg||
nt|wstuart: You will die the death of 1000 cuts if you only play for games opposite a PH.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=11-13 bal|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: yes--I like this slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: DBL probably both minors here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is this a scramble or a transfer to clubs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't think that looking at his @s holding|pg||
nt|henryb:  DBL is "I had a trap pass over 1@s|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sry 2NT probably both minors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  which might have made a good investment for E to pass|pg||
nt|henryb:  either that or "I have a weak hand with long clubs"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: correction   3N did show max   3@C rebid with all minimum hands    [thanks mike]|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is appears to be a squeeze on 50|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: W has a lot of useful cards, even with his @d wastage|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this is a slam try sequence i am told|pg||
nt|wstuart: Some play Lebensohl on some of the t/o DBL auctoins, such as (1@S)-P-(2@S)-DBL-(P)  but I don't know that many would play it on this auction.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Of course, given that west is likely to have long @S, short @H and a good hand, easts 2NT as natural and forward going has a lot going for it, too.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it doesnt look like a hand that yearns to play in NT to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the answer is....:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a grammar squeeze?|pg||
nt|jade: 9, 10 or 11?|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to find safest way to take 4 club tricks.  Anybody know what that is here?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|psyck: too tuf though :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some discussion, Diamond thought 2S would be minors and 2NT was natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  which sounds right|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|psyck: at least they tried|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 6@H in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some relayers reverse   here 4@C puppet 4@D then 4@H slam try    others use direct bid as slam try  "puppet" to signoff|pg||
nt|cherilou: They bid it in open room so we'll see some imps|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe Hampson should have been more agressive here|pg||
nt|iceking: KJ of @C just has to be gold|pg||
nt|cherilou: @C J is a huge card|pg||
nt|roswolf: BATHURST BACK INTO THE LEAD|pg||
nt|marlowepi: king|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|wstuart: That also makes sense.|pg||
nt|kit: Would have been more interesting on heart lead.  If defenders could make declarer think hearts 5-3, declarer could not afford to lose a club trick -- so might go down trying for ...|pg||

nt|iceking: 1nt  is 14-16hcp |pg||
nt|cherilou: this would be excellent slam if W's red suits reversed|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting auction anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=4/5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|iceking: maybe east has some bid to show @H shortness with both minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = @D|pg||
nt|cherilou: transfer to @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S pass this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not everyone would reach 3N on this lot|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and i think might include weak 5@D & 5@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: then will 3@H show shortage|pg||
nt|iceking: if so then w would not bid 3@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C no super-accept of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might need better @D for 3@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a positive fit perhaps?|pg||
nt|cherilou: does W like or not like @D's with 3@C call--everyone plays one of the 2 methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what is default for "accept"   A/Kx  Hxx  Qxx  |pg||
nt|psyck: If as Al suggests, then E can pass with weak 55 minors here|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|iceking: that doesnt make any sense then they are in 3@C on 5-2fitt with 5-3 @D fitt|pg||
nt|cherilou: have to decide like or don't like no middle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW   1N-3@C = Puppet Stayman   1N-3@D = game force 5+@D & 5+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: remember 1nt = 14-16 0nly so east knows they are light on values for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S probably exactly 3@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: vwd|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade best|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for N not to bid, and 2@d would be a spade raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  and answer is no|pg||
nt|wstuart: He's far from cold in practice.  Don't pregloat them.  :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, only question was if he would pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but S doesnt have a clear 3N, and if he bids 2N maybe not all Ns would go, esp NV|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: halfway time limit just sounded|pg||
nt|wstuart: I must say, 3NT was not my first choice of rebid with the S hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: however, I would pass 1NT before rebidding 2@S with that suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ouch|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think 2@s was in the radar|pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceking: ok well done no danger go past 3nt now |pg||
nt|cherilou: no, just in case E was 5-5 weak in minors--not on this hand. Now 3@H is shortess and W's red suits have been described|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe i spoke to soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener shows @H holding for 3N    if Qxx is enough that implies  east hold @DAKxxxx   but that holding goes to game without asking|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the long tank suggests a further try may be made|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: then 3@C must have been like @D's--only reason to bid again with E|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|iceking: so 4@C looks like rkcb |pg||
nt|roswolf: agree sheri|pg||
nt|iceking: just guessing though|pg||
nt|roswolf: cheri - sorry|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes it does look like KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  3@C said not @D good enough for 3N  and 3@H said i have game force [slam try] with 6+@D and short @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: in that case a quick sign off is in order|pg||
nt|iceking: so east is just overbidding now continue over 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 4@h rkc|pg||
nt|cherilou: hmmmmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right sided:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 2@s just min. hand/2@h?|pg||
nt|kit: This is a good example of the power of double showing 4or 5 spades -- East is on lead vs. spades.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: they do appear to be groping around in the dark|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like some misunderstanding |pg||
nt|cherilou: N might lead @HA with @DK|pg||
nt|iceking: it seems like Hampson is responding to rkcb and Greco is just bidding natural 4@C|pg||
nt|psyck: Strange after E knew of @h wastage after 3N on 3@h showing shortness|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoa c'est tres incroyable|pg||
nt|henryb:  clearly declarer needed to play @d first, but that was not at all obvious|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|cherilou: seems pretty crazy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  It is very hard for East to play a low spade -- we can all see that would beat it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not obvious, but maybe correct. if E has heart ace W will have a spade card so defence wll have the tempo. this may be the layout you have to play for|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cherilou: this bad bid will cost|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: now sit back and wait for the trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have guessed 4@H RKC @C  [bid 4@D to agree that suit]|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see in this bidding 4@H cannot be meant as quebid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  so it could still be beaten, but much much harder|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iceking: reason is you do not que bid King after pd shows shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge playing 4N West|pg||
nt|iceking: aha so maybe 4@H was rkcb|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more sensible contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec surprised E did not lead from his substantially stronger minor|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 51  Woldridge in 1N West|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|h6|nt|kit: why?  doesn't declarer always have 4 spades, 3 clubs, 2 dimonds, 1 heart at least?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for discussion  if  2 suits potential trump  can you RKC in both of the suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: the dam has burst - i venture to suggest e/w are on tilt|pg||
nt|iceking: its very easy to forget your system i do that also often |pg||
nt|psyck: Not good for Diamond team, 6@h would hanve been in trouble on a @s lead other table & the previous deal was an unforced error|pg||
nt|cherilou: W had 2 ways to avoid @D loser--lead Q hoping RHO had singleton J or hope LHO had singleton K. Neither happening this hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to say where E or W could have come in |pg||

mb|d|nt|marlowepi: yes, playability in the 3 highest ranking suits should always be showable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually   2@H may be   natural or invitational @S raise|pg||
nt|jade: Ok, what would you have done, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: Personally, I play 1NT shows a 4-card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d showing 5+@d and 4@h would have been effective here (10-13hcp)|pg||
nt|kit: since that is probably the most awkward hand type|pg||

mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: somebody doesnt like leading from Jxxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost time to claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: leading Q hoping for singleton J also works when K doesn;t cover--so it is winning play more often|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think you need to steady the ship|pg||
nt|iceking: remember here east isnt limited he could still have up good hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might fall here|pg||
nt|cherilou: I like X--already a passed hand and has 9 cards in the red suits--seems normal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asking about 3@C bid...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: not clear 3 small is a better bargain|pg||

nt|iceking: often right after bidding like this|pg||

mb|1S|nt|henryb:  easy hand for E-W to bid too much on the lie of the cards|pg||
mb|d|nt|stevo:  oops wrong again!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 1@s preemptive!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pef: n/s are in the rather interesting contract of four clubs doubled in the closed room|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: that's off at least 2, but maybe 3|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge asks Fred about the King lead and about carding|pg||
nt|pef: he's going to have to play this carefully, but it looks like the spade spots enable him to succeed|pg||
nt|stevo:  so if declarer draws trumps here hes in good shape by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I wonder if i can get room service cocktails?  Stevo?|pg||

nt|jade: there is a divine entity|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think Eric is trying to catch up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: the last three tricks consisted of Grue ruffing a heart on the board and then correctly finessing trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: hmm another action hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: 2@S enuff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat stray from system   2@C supposed to show 6+@C|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  uninformative auction in OR and E chose the more aggressive @c lead rather than either short suit sequence|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  NS in 4@s undbld in OR on 54|pg||
nt|jade: That's not straying, that's a tactical diversion|pg||
nt|andyv:  with all th quacks, Joe probably trying to get his best suit in|pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Greco should do here.  He has a lot of defense.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a nice one with that @C suit   [and partner NOT having @S length]|pg||
nt|kit: And it isn't 100% that his partner has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jade: timing is everything|pg||
nt|kit: So he may well pass the double|pg||
nt|jade: Do you like the 2@C opener, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I seem to remember that spades outrank the red suits but clubs don't.|pg||
nt|jade: That doesn't really answer the question|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 4@h makes, dbl will only cost 3 imps to EW|pg||
nt|kit: I think it does|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: @HK lead won't be optimal, so good pull :)|pg||
nt|kit: ace of clubs likely lead|pg||
nt|jade: Well, you got the A part right|pg||
nt|kit: Will certainly shift to it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|iceking: so 3nt-3 most likely|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jade: One of those "If I get out of this alive, God, I will never do it again" moments|pg||
nt|kit: looks like declarer can get 6 trump tricks and 1 diamond trick is all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentators in other room predicted 3rd seat 1@C from Brad Moss,  who opened 1@S|pg||
nt|jade: What options is Eric considering?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I can't tell but he clearly was having a hard choice in the auction and another one here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd wrestling with the screen which keeps threatening to fall down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: only consolation is it may be a push|pg||
nt|iceking: yes its very normal result |pg||
nt|ahollan1: is duck here double dummy??|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it looks daftbut has some merit i suppose|pg||
nt|iceking: duck what|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS has 25 points--a push seems likely|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: he is considering that his partner might have a singleton diamond, so ace and a diamond|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: again the 2@S was the warning bell - especially with the spades under the bidder|pg||
nt|iceking: though if N had opened 1@D bidding could have gone:: 1@D-p-1@H-1@S-2@C-p-3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: betting Hampson would overtake if duck -- but  this way easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick also opened 1N|pg||
nt|cherilou: W could have @C Q doubleton or third--then still make 3NT|pg||
nt|iceking: not very interesting the play here |pg||
nt|roswolf: on 24 3@S went off 1 so only a 2 imp loss|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: But I think this defense makes more sense|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: problem now is he has to play something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  4@H West|pg||
nt|kit: might have been better to duck the diamond|pg||
nt|jade: I agree|pg||
nt|kit: it doesn't really cost a trick even if declarer has a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: feeling endplayed 5 times is actually good thing when defending at the 4 level|pg||
nt|kit: Holding 4 aces is usually a good start when defending at the 4-level doubled.|pg||
nt|jade: I was considering exiting a low @H|pg||
nt|jade: actually still am|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson's carding of high spade and high-low in trumps would appear to indicate the king of hearts|pg||
nt|jade: @S might finesse partner|pg||
nt|jade: In this case either low or high is the same. But if Hampson has Kxx @H a low @H is better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: wow   DIamond raised to 3N immediately    @H lead from Hurd|pg||

nt|kit: After 2 rounds of spades, the discarding will be very difficult on the run of the diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S splinter|pg||
mb|d|nt|jade: at least when they were a lot younger|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Moss  3N North|pg||
nt|jade: interesting|pg||
nt|kit: And the splinter keeps them out of the bad 3NT contract and into the decent (but unlucky) 5@C contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-(1@D)    EW never bid @S but Hurd led them|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  with S playing it, is there a clear way to set 5@c?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd: bet it's not Michaels|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond will need to show stuff in both suit, probably by pitching middle spade first, and Platnick will have to work out the position and what to hold|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: maybe players were asking questions??|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: good technique by declarer is to lead the 2 of diamonds on his next to last diamond -- if opponents miscount, they may think it is your last diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but you might too, and then lead a side suit prematurely:)|pg||
nt|kit: and note that he ruffed with 6 of diamonds, so he may have exactly that in mind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no he was just unvlocking in case the 4 of diamonds was hidden and the trump 8 anbd 9 thus both fell on the first round|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W planning later discards|pg||
nt|kit: This is not easy at all.  Defense doesn't know if declarer is 2-2 in rounded suits -- he could be 3-1 either way.  Can they communicate?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he knows spade is safe|pg||

nt|kit: That's what GIB would do|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: S will have to make do with this lot until a good hand comes along|pg||
nt|kit: if he does, declare can cash ace of clubs, low heart to king and ace, and scores the last trick in hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D has some potential value, takes away support double etc.....the danger in mildish preempts with lots of trumps and no values it that opps might be able yo make whatever they bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and your telling them extent of your fit might drive them there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S hand almost good enough to open old fashioned 4NT asking for Aces|pg||
nt|kit: Wooldridge would have liked to have been able to bid old-fashioned (not keycard) Blackwood there.|pg||
nt|kit: Yes Andy.  I think it is good enough.|pg||
nt|kit: so you gamble on the jack of spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was hedging against specs who wanted the J@s:)|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is transfer, in case somebody can't figure that out.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this looks a bit high|pg||
nt|kit: but we don't know how they play an opening 4NT -- may have some other meaning|pg||
nt|andyv:  main thing you don't want to do is what happened in the Vandy this year when both teams bid 7@d missing the A@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no, it doesn't promise 8|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson making a slam try, and game isn't making|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: will be unlucky that East will be playing it, so heart lead is obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: S took the passive action here|pg||
nt|kit: I would never let partner play a 4-4 spade fit with that heart suit.  KQJ10xx is called trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: NS make 4@D so only 1 or 2 imps either way|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s can make some @D so maybe a small gain|pg||
nt|kit: Now, do they play 6@C is to play?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: Played from West side would have gotten club lead|pg||
nt|kit: Would he finesse and risk going down 2 after the overcall?|pg||
nt|kit: We will never know.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|kit: at least Wooldridge thinks so.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he may get overruled here|pg||
nt|kit: But is it to play, or TO PLAY?|pg||
nt|kit: in other words, is it a suggestion or a command?|pg||
nt|andyv:  + side for NS is there are 4 small slams that make|pg||
nt|andyv:  so they just need to stay out of 6@d|pg||
nt|wstuart: I hope Hurd doesn't interpret this as bid 7 with a 3rd round 1@C control.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S should fake-ask for queen of spades, then correct the 5S reply to 6C. maybe that would be the muzzle sequence|pg||
nt|andyv:  a new meaning to walking the dog, Marshall?|pg||
nt|kit: the question is, have they discussed the meaning of 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: If Hurd corrects to 6@H, that will be okay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes my remark was addressed to that in a roundabout way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because there could be two paths to 6C|pg||
nt|lml: oh you mean south|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't think this S will pass 6@H - it wouldn't be natural - he would correct to 6@S which will be sure to be playable.|pg||

nt|andyv:  5@d was dbld in OR on 42 and 3 imp gain to Bathurst|pg||
nt|lml: I would open 1C too|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|wstuart: In several of my partnerships, 6@C would be a 3rd rd control ask.|pg||
nt|kit: Now, will Wooldridge respect this?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  we all know that 6@h, 6@s and 6N make|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, 6@s may have saved or gained 2 imps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i were joel, it would be hard. if i dont get to play 6C, he dont get to play 6H:)|pg||
nt|kit: if no ace of hearts lead, makes 7 |pg||
nt|kit: rare that you can discard 6 losing hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes 6H inferior for that reason:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maych decided by 1 IMP|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@h the more tempting lead|pg||
nt|kit: and they got to 6@C in other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S ran from 6H so i think we wll see a D lead|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine he will lead a heart|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: when all else fails, consider your own name|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a 3 imp gain now|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: oh right -- he doesn't know trumps aren't 2-2, so would always go up ace|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|pef: through a transfer after overcall auction, 4 spades is being played from the short side, so south didn't have|pg||

nt|stevo:  here declare doesnt know its a stiff and might go down |pg||

nt|pef: so a 6 imp gain, that seems undeserved|pg||

nt|pef: also bbo and usbf for making this possible|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|xfer|nt|jade: they make a fair number of @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|wstuart: South has an incredibly wide range for his bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@S is a testosterone bid|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@S another agressive action |pg||
nt|cherilou: yes it's a 14-16 NT right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: for both pairs|pg||
nt|cherilou: Mighty big|pg||
nt|iceking: i would not have thought about it have to admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east is clearly contemplating game|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3nhAS NO PLAY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 27  platnick-diamond stay out of trouble  4@S Wooldridge [who thought long time about bidding more]|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3 has no play|pg||
nt|iceking: on a normal @C Jack lead its doomed|pg||
nt|cherilou: or @H lead or @S lead or small @D lead :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: 18 HCP, but the dreaded 4-3-3-3 -- and he is right to open 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind the 18 hcp, I do mind the 2 tens|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: but give Greco   K93  AJ32 98 AQ73   and 4@S looks good   so we shouldn't be too harse about 3@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's a minimum 1N opener|pg||
nt|iceking: even if Hampson had passed 2@S N would bal i believe |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: then after p p 3@S looks rather normal |pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I thought he might|pg||
nt|wstuart: On an eaerlier hand he opened a 4432 14 count with 1NT now he bids 1NT with a very controllish 18 count|pg||
nt|kit: If you always deduct a point for 4-3-3-3, you won't be far wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: they play 14-16 but apparently not in 4th seat|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wstuart: If you count each ace as 4.5 points you won't be far wrong either.|pg||
nt|jade: as minimum hands go, this one is pretty good|pg||

nt|andyv:  15-17  in 3rd seat vul and all 4th seats|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise 14-16|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all very sensible. but to quote a commentator from the other night:  "all those who have ever gotten a good result at IMPs by downgrading an 18 count, please raise your.....no, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably impossible"|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  I don't quote commentators...too much work|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the way I heard Eric Rodwell describe it;  frequent upgrades infrequent downgrades.  Opening a 15-17 N with that hand would very much not be my choice.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 2@h and E jumped to 4|pg||
nt|kit: not clear what declarer should do here|pg||
nt|kit: fortunately for him, if he plays low it only costs an overtrick|pg||
nt|andyv:  stiff @d led in OR and ducked by declarer|pg||
nt|kit: Would Grue really be underleading king of diamonds when 2 small clubs in dummy makes club return pretty attractive from any holding?|pg||
nt|jade: I would be inclined to rise, I think|pg||
nt|jade: for that very reason|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait    tomorrow's schedule same as today   for your local times check http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  I'm not so sure...the J@s may mean that E has a quick pitch|pg||

nt|andyv:  so N may be trying to talk E out of @d hook if he held both red Kings|pg||
nt|kit: but it is too double-dummy.  For all North knows, 2 club tricks might be cashing.|pg||

nt|pef: yes, that's right|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|pef: and indeed it was a push because played from the east side after a transfer auction so no dangerous diamond lead|pg||
mb|p!|an|forces rdbl|nt|pef: if pass by wooldridge wasn't forcing, brad would have a real problem what to bid, here he can wait |pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  i think will go xx p p now 2h by brad|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pef: but will east redouble of bid 2d?|pg||
nt|stevo:  ha|pg||
nt|pef: got you |pg||
nt|stevo:  Hurd has seen Joel's pass of XX too many times not going there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred asking about 2@d and also about the original pass . Shown the rdbl card |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: gets a note about the rest|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|pef: yes, I once won a match against a very good team (Chip was on it) because one of his teammates decided to add an extra digit to the score in such a situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: how do we get to 3@cs from here?|pg||
nt|pef: that seems a bit pushy by fred with such bad diamond spots|pg||
mb|3D|an|no alert|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Isn't 2N Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|pef: barnet shenkin just told me he thought 5c was cold here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: this si not your typical auction|pg||
nt|stevo:  this is getting dangerous for N/S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: although it would take some magic to get there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: time to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred shaking his head |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: not sure at what|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge nervous 1Nt was a 3rd seat favorable psyche|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Woolridge whispered something|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|pef: this is going to be hard for hurd to lead|pg||
nt|pef: although if the j holds he knows fred doesn't have ak10|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pef: so it sort of pinpoints wooldridges holding|pg||
nt|stevo:  declarer will get squeezed on the 5th diamond for down 3 possibly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pef: hurd is going to think a while |pg||
nt|stevo:  or not :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thats what he came up with|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

nt|pef: now can east possibly know where the queen of spades is?|pg||

nt|andyv:  a good set so far for Bathurst|pg||
nt|kit: and then?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: 3nt from S now|pg||

mb|2H|nt|roswolf: dont like dbl by north butanything is possible now|pg||
nt|iceking: hmm looks like normal 3nt bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@H confirmed 6@H   [5@H was possible]|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: maybe N believes this dbl is pen?|pg||
nt|jade: Penalty it is, then|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: had W started with 4@H that would have ended the auction--now NS likely to gey to good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: hope not the 2nt bidder always has trump support unless big balanced|pg||
nt|kit: Hurd hoping the surprise heart attack will defeat 3NT|pg||
