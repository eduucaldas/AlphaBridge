nt|Walddk2: 60 boards remain, so Welland needs exactly 1 IMP per board to win|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: We must not blame Jan if we get disconnected. It is so easy for her to spill her coffee over the connection plug.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
mb|4D!|an|RKCB !cs|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Easily best to open a vulnerable 3@C on that hand, hoping to shut out the majors.|pg||
mb|5C|an|2 Keycards, no Q|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D could be Minorwood, asking for key cards, but that is quite a high response if so.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Hi!  It is important to have some way of inviting a slam opposite a pre-empt. I have always wondered if a single raise would be good in that respect, since it is not much use ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: pre-emptively.  Here there was no problem because South could simply ask for key cards.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 4@d was in fact RKCB for clubs and 5@c showed 2 without the Q|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Good contract, but ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: 6@C is a great contract. No doubt one would prefer playing it from the S seat. but one can't have everything :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fred has enough entries to set up the spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can make this and perhaps should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, with Q10x it's pretty easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double dummy 13 tricks are available|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sometimes you need to use entries in the trump suit, to set up a side suit, and therefore have to start ruffing the side suit before you draw trumps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sure, he can just pitch a heart loser on a spade|pg||
nt|jcmax: Clubs break 3-1, so there are always 7 @C, 2@S, 11H and 2@D tricks. PLaying 71C would be a challenge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, he does not know clubs break|pg||
nt|brolucius: Probably safe to finesse the heart first.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only he knew if he had a club loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: For those of you who weren't here at the beginning, this board is on the table backward, so in one sense it is being played from the South seat - Gitelman is really South. I'll ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: change the names after this hand as Fred has promised to get the boards on the table right side up from now on|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: But 12 tricks are assured, so no point in finessing (in case the lead happened to be a singleton).|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Only assured if clubs behave. Clubs 4-1 and nothing is certain|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: 4-0 rather|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can get the diamonds away with Q-10-x falling, can't he?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but he does not have the hand records :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: they aren't assured 100%. If @C are 4-0 offside, some more work would have been needed. Maybe it would have been an idea to start with @SA, @S ruff and then @C to the table and ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: take it from there?|pg||

nt|royhughes: An exciting board for us to start with|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: welland needs to get on track early even with 60 bds to go|pg||
mb|2H!|an|6+ clubs, no 4-card side suit|mb|p|nt|royhughes: The 1C can be as short as 2 if balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but what does the bidding mean|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3C!|an|any 7321|nt|roswolf: ty for the explanation|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2H says 6+ clubs, no side suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|pef: the diamond team had a big second eighth to take a substantial early lead in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello Peter, Chip and Bill|pg||
mb|3N|an|alerted|nt|roswolf: this may well end in 6@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1S was an artificial game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|rkc clubs|mb|p|nt|roswolf: BUT bidding a grand may be the only danger|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes, you don't want to be in 7 because that rates to need at least a finesse, in addition to setting up a long spade|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|royhughes: 6C is easy unless clubs are horrible|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|chip: Diamond picked up 44 the previous set to turn a small deficient into a good lead.|pg||
nt|royhughes: With the Q10 of spades coming down you may make 7|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: the grand is on because of the favorable spade position|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi William|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S!|nt|roswolf: hi bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: the other room playing in 6@C i am told|pg||
nt|royhughes: The grand is indeed on but a red-suit lead would put declarer to an early decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N!|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: with the match score in mind i dont think they will bid 7|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer thinks Greco wouldn't underlead a king, he would maybe go up ace and go after the spades, planning to finesse in the other red suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: But the bidding may have shown where the red aces are|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is just the sort of board Welland needs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: if they get it right of course:)|pg||
nt|royhughes: ;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thinks Welland showed 7 clubs, stiff spade, and a minimum hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think he's right|pg||
nt|athene: not much for greco to go on; his partner passed up opportunities to double either red suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2 keys, no queen of clubs, and neither red king|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: may be an imp to the leaders|pg||
nt|royhughes: It may be -- or declarer may duck if more worried about Jxxx offside with the king of diamonds onside|pg||
nt|athene: it would be necessary to run this sometimes when east had the @DK but trumps were breaking 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: sorry 4-0|pg||
nt|athene: but better chances from going up with the ace i think|pg||
nt|royhughes: Neither that nor 6-1 diamonds is very likely, so maybe just go for the overtrick!|pg||
nt|royhughes: It must be very close|pg||
nt|royhughes: In fact, with spades coming I think he makes 7 even if he goes up ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup a horrible problem if the grand had been bid|pg||
nt|athene: if your only concern were the overtrick i still am not sure what the best chance is|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes indeed.  In 7 I think I would run the lead and get it over quickly|pg||
nt|athene: so much depends on how likely east is to lead away from the king|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|pef: chip, of course is scouting to see who will be USA2.  He's part of the Fleisher team that won last|pg||
nt|pef: year and is USA1|pg||
nt|chip: Hi All.  NS play a strong club system, so a lead directing 1C wasn't an option in third seat, and 2C a bit rich.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Probably a flat board as Welland-Bramley also reached 6@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only if very hungry.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss said he bid Keycard in case Fred could show AK 8th (by showing 2 with the Q) so he could bid 7|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North does not have quite enough to insist on game.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is slightly better but 4@H is also OK|pg||
nt|jcmax: Both 1D honors are offside here, which theoretically might cause problems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-4 major and especially 5-3 major fits are overrated|pg||
nt|brolucius: It can be important to tell partner why your hand is worth a raise to 3@H, so you can bid 3@H on a flat hand (as Moss holds) but use mini-splinters on a shapely hand.|pg||
nt|jcmax: But I think W needed to lead a @D to have a chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred asks if they lead 4th best and Schermer says yes|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe declarer will trust the fall of East's @SJ.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but maybe he keeps that for NV|pg||
nt|athene: no harm in heart to ace, spade just to see if the queen falls, is there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: not as i saw no|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|royhughes: No, but maybe he didn't want to make a mistake!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: many good pairs use some method to distinguish types of raises after a t/o double|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|pef: 2h there is a sound+ 2s raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you overbid to 4@H with north trying to induce a phantom sacrifice, but at this vulnerability opps aren't likely to bid 4@S unless they expect to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: either side can easily get too high on this hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1D shows hearts|pg||
mb|3H!|an|18-19|nt|pef: 3h is already too high for ns, 3s would be too high for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H or 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunate diamond position so maybe four losers here (spade, heart, two diamonds) but perhaps declarer can endplay east?|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being to just take a diamond finesse at a point when east has no trump to return|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: michael rosenberg pointed out that e/w actually can make 3s because of the really fortunate club position|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|athene: a trump is east's only safe lead here|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "always bid 4H - you get 100% sympathy and 0% blame" - i agree|pg||
nt|athene: now west knows his partner is likely to have vulnerable holdings in all the side suits and will think which to play through to get him off the endplay|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: NS just have to avoid panicking and trying to cash diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: no, michael's right (of course)|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure - what about if the defence force dummy with a third round of hearts immediately?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, both minors are sort of "frozen". They can't play diamonds and if they rise A of clubs, declarer gets to pitch his D's|pg||
nt|pef: although two more hearts here makes it difficult|pg||
nt|smoller: I am not so sure of 3@S - look like declarer cant manage 3 times hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the standard defence when you see a threatening side suit in dummy is to force dummy|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, it was a close decision for W with Qx of hearts, but the rest of his hand is good for offense.|pg||
nt|pef: simple looking actually quite complicated|pg||
nt|chip: And 2H was most often a 3 trump raise.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|pef: well greco found by far the best continuation|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pef: and so did hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: a club switch would be my choice but i can see the cards|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|athene: ok so best for declarer is trump to ace, club, i guess|pg||
nt|chip: If they tap the dummy, as they are doing, can kill the club suit due to dummy's poor spade spots (not second entry to dummy).|pg||
nt|athene: but he's short of an entry to dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: west prefers red|pg||
nt|athene: west should have won the first trick and played a diamond giving his partner a trump exit|pg||
nt|athene: now east is immediately endplayed in three suits|pg||
nt|royhughes: That would have been a great play|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the suicidial endplay|pg||
nt|royhughes: Ducking is sort of normal|pg||
nt|athene: even on that better defence declarer could have prevailed but it would have been much harder|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but east will not be amused|pg||
nt|athene: it is sort of instinctive to duck the first round from Axx of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was just too hard to see that this was an exceptional circumstance|pg||
nt|royhughes: The best chance here is a club back, I think. |pg||
nt|royhughes: Then declarer could maybe go wrong if he guessed horribly|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer knows east is in trouble|pg||
nt|athene: the longer east pauses here the more obvious he makes it that he has honours in all the suits|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|athene: yes, @S53 just not doing the job|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: even with 2-2 break|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: so on a club return declarer will pitch diamond from dummy on the @CK and just go for diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|pef: well that beats it quickly|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|royhughes: Bill, that was well analyzed -- I've never seen that play before (taking ace at T1)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|smoller: a bit amazing they can find out to eliminate club tricks this way - very well done|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would make double-dummy (so the Law does apply in theory) but declarer lost to the doubleton @HQ, as you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: neither have i, and i am sure i will miss it next time i meet it at the table :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: a nice game swinf for welland - the comeback begins|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|chip: If declarer played low at trick one (looking like someone with Jxx) might have gotten N to lead a D.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred started to put this board on the table backwards also, but then noticed and fixed it - I thought maybe we were going to play odd numbered boards one direction and even ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: numbered boards the other :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jcmax: Actually I don't think any lead could have set the contract, because E was holding all the key cards and could always be endplayed one way or another. But declarer would have to ...|pg||

mb|4H|an|max, no splinter I think|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Fred's line looked fine to me. It's so much easier with all cards in view|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many players are willing to raise to 2@H on only three trumps, so it is important to use a bid like 2NT to investigate, even if you have enough points for game. (Assuming you play ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT as forcing)|pg||
nt|henryb:  a bad but potentially successful game with just about everything possible working|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|jcmax: this looks like a dream deal. If as declarer you could wish a layout of the opposing cards, could you possibly imagine anything better?|pg||
nt|henryb:  not hardly|pg||
nt|jcmax: Even the @D K is singleton to make sure you cannot misguess :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps @s 3-3?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In a dream, you would be doubled too.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room on 62, Hampson endplayed his partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: smal trump led, and when he won @HA he switched to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss studying dummy, probably also noticing that the cards are going to be favorable for declarer and trying to figure out how to beat this|pg||

mb|1N|nt|royhughes: 14-16 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1nt 14-16 or just an upgrade?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think they open 1C on 17 and 1D on 11-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: 1C is 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced.|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H is 8-11 pretty much any hand i think|pg||
nt|pef: greco/hampson play 14-16 nts (sometimes 13, occasionally 0+ in third seat nv :)|pg||
mb|3C!|an|Puppet|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  8-11  not 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|pef: so he opened their strong 1c|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|royhughes: This seems to be Puppet Stayman, asking for 5-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the idea is when responder is so limited it's easy to sort out quickly if it's a game or slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: and of course most positives to a strong club are in this range|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bridge is easy, clubs 4-4, so 9 easy tricks in NT, 10 without a club lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: 3@S showed hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: One advantage is that West has not disclosed his 4 spades|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: all bids got notes but can't read them from here, sorry|pg||

nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|athene: i assume dummy has shown exactly four hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, that's an option created by the trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok, he isn't put to the test there|pg||
nt|royhughes: Bramley may have been thinking partner could have Axx|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: bramley felt his partner might have led from @HAxx but he would not have led from @HQxx, so finessing against dummy couldn't really gain|pg||
nt|royhughes: and that playing 3 rounds of trumps would be better than blocking them|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: he won't want to lead a club, did someone say that?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|brolucius: After the auction of 1NT - 3NT, you should generally favor major-suit leads, because on average you and your partner will hold 7.2 major-suit cards and only 5.8 minor-suit cards. ...|pg||

nt|athene: that's usually sort of a bad thing to do :)|pg||
nt|pef: perhaps 1h is their negative response|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@C is just natural with transfer responses?|pg||
nt|chip: 1c isn't strong, it is most often 11-13 balanced. Here it is the strong balanced version. 1H showed 4+ spades|pg||

nt|jcmax: This contract is very cold. W does best by shifting to a @D now.|pg||
nt|jcmax: That way the defence can either get a @D ruff or 2 trump tricks, because declarer doesn't take the double finesse|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: alerted 2c|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: I believe achieving an above average board against them in a club game led to "re-education"|pg||
nt|athene: light-ish 1@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 11-13 is the low range for 1@c|pg||
mb|2D!|an|hearts|nt|athene: no room for usual 2-suiter scheme over 2@C really as you need 2nt natural, for one thing|pg||
nt|pef: platnick is probably feeling pretty pleased about his 1n making 2 in the closed room since a club or heart lead beats 1nt several|pg||
nt|athene: west probably wouldn't treat his hand as a red 2-suiter even if he had the opportunity, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: playable in spades too|pg||
nt|pef: what would you guys bid with bramley's hand here?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|royhughes: Bramley showed hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: well that wasn't his best choice|pg||
nt|athene: well he has 11, if you count the @HJ twice|pg||
nt|athene: personally i wouldn't even count it once|pg||
nt|royhughes: Don't blame you|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|smoller: pass looked as a great winner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D obviously hearts|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't see why he had to bid so fast|pg||
nt|chip: I think Greco will take expection to this.  On the prior deal EW bid 1C (strong) -1D-1N and lost 7 IMPS|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy starting to warp a bit in view of the match score|pg||
nt|royhughes: Presumably this shows a balanced hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: if diamonds are the longest suit, he must be balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: a disciplined 3@H WOULD ALLOW NORTH TO SQUIRM OUT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: if you aren't going to pass, why not 3@C and play 3n if partner hasn't got four spades|pg||
nt|pef: the spots might be good enough for him to survive this|pg||
nt|chip: He wanted to be declarer to avoid a club lead through, and he did get a friendly lead. Still, 3c then 3S was an attractive alternative (and with the KQ of clubs a questionable ...|pg||
nt|chip: value, an invitational 3s is not unreasonable either)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the problem with 3@C is, if partner bids 3@H (as expected), you can't really bid 3@S because that endplays him if he hasn't got four spades (he can't bid 3NT himself)|pg||
nt|pef: I've noticed that a lot of foreign pairs play 2n forcing (by the east hand) in this situation asking for a description of major lengths|pg||
nt|athene: you could just bid 3@C then 3NT over 3@H hoping partner reads that as showing four sapdes|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south is going to commit to game|pg||
nt|athene: but has three possible strains in mind - notrumps, hearts, diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now 3nt likely to play|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: retransfer to @H|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think 4@h from north|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pef: I think the positioning of the ace of diamonds and the doubleton in the north hand means that 4s is going down even double dummy here|pg||
nt|pef: interestingly in the closed room e/w stopped in 2nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: AN ADVENTUROUS WAY TO ACHIEVE A PUSH|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: the hands fit well - that @HJ turns out to be worth a good bit after all!|pg||
nt|royhughes: the diamond lead threatens a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: certainly no trump finesse now|pg||
nt|royhughes: stops declarer from picking up the trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: 3NT interesting contract; club lead you can just lead diamonds towards dummy and finesse spades|pg||
nt|athene: try for 1 club, 4 diamonds, 1 heart and 3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: of course much harder on a heart lead but how is that getting found?|pg||
nt|chip: Also, EW seem to only have 9 tricks, though winning the first D not best. NS do need to remove the heart at some point. to beat this.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pef: I think he can pretty much lead anything now and beat this|pg||
nt|athene: i have noticed several times in this event the precision 2@C opener has caused quite a few problems for opps|pg||
nt|athene: quite a limited bid when you play it as 6+ clubs so responder doesn't usually have huge problems with the lost space, but opps do|pg||
nt|chip: If N ruffs this, then needs to lead a heart back.|pg||
nt|pef: while we are waiting, perhaps the vugraph operator can let us know if there was any interesting discussion over the bidding of the previous board?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: There was none...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pef: I guess roy's response was routine|pg||
nt|athene: i assume bramley didn't open 1@S because he didn't want to wrongside 3nt (partner likely to respond 1nt)|pg||
nt|athene: so he just hides the fifth spade and treats his hand as strong bal|pg||
nt|pef: I think ruffing here was a mistake.  if he playslow and north ruffs, as chip said, north now has to play a heart back--at least there was a chance of going wrong, now almost none|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: My old eyes just can't read most of the notes.  Maybe I should ask them all to print and in crayon|pg||
nt|chip: Now defense is in better shape as declarer can't take another spade finesse. Probably best to throw a D.|pg||
nt|pef: bramley welland play 1c is either natural or various nt ranges, possibly with 5 card majors.  one of the ranges is 17-19 which is what he had|pg||
nt|athene: oh right |pg||
nt|athene: so systemically he couldn't open it 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: or at least he had the option of 1@C anyway|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, and routine for them to open a club with a 5 card major and a 5-3-3-2 hand if out of their 1N opening range (14-16)|pg||
nt|pef: correct (according to their system notes)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco fans his hand, folds it, puts it down and leans back|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|athene: north might imagine his partner has another club honour and not the @HQ|pg||

nt|brolucius: No doubt you would pull the same trick as West when holding a doubleton diamond?|pg||
nt|jcmax: And I guess that still doesn't matter :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer "well played" Moss "I know you're not a cover an honor with an honor guy, but I thought I'd give you a chance" Schermer: "did you lead an honor? I thought you led small"|pg||

nt|brolucius: How Jan manages to type all this extra dialog, as well as keep up with the bidding and play, is something I will never understand. Maybe she has more than ten fingers.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Raising 1@S to 2@S has become almost standard practice among experts. Bidding 2@C first and then raising @S would show a stronger hand type|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think Chambers said 3@d showed a splinter with 3 spades, but not positive|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|henryb:  3@d I think is a maximum 3 trump raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought they would get to 3NT; now we need to analyse 4@S instead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again we see the responder using 2NT in case partner has raised on only three trumps. (They don't play the 2NT bid in France because raising on three trumps is a social no-no in ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: those parts.)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In some small towns, it would cause them to wheel out the guillotine.|pg||
nt|jcmax: David, I only recelntly read, when the last execution by guillotine was performed. it was shocking.|pg||
nt|brolucius: What was the date?|pg||
nt|henryb:  There's an interesting article on www.bridgewinners.com by Steve Weinstein on when to raise on three|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he is one trick short. He does not have the entries to ruff 2 diamonds, then draw three rounds of trumps and play on clubs|pg||
nt|jcmax: I think 1979 or something like that, not "that" long ago :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing on cross-ruff is also impossible because he can't score 4 club tricks with that line|pg||
nt|brolucius: And what hand did the offender hold?|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I think he is some one whose opinions deserve attention|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: The last guillotining in France was that of torture-murderer Hamida Djandoubi on September 10, 1977.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|henryb:  and the lead will make declarer fear an early club ruff|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jcmax: I was only off by 2 years! Not bad :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is going for the "ruff 2 diamonds line" but it's not quite good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that Brad continues clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he doesn'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: t|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he has that extra entry later|pg||
nt|jcmax: If N had 3 @H declarer would probably be able to make this now. But here he cannot get back to his hand conveniently for enough  @D ruffs|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think as long as Brad does not continue diamonds now, declarer is down|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hope for declarer, as North thinks.|pg||
nt|jcmax: A @S switch doesn't look so hot for the defence either :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I don't think that costs since declarer needs to ruff twice in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gitelman signalled even number of clubs to trick 1, maybe that will guide Brad to the winning defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and even number of diamonds too|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, you are right, on a spade declarer can take 6 trumps, three clubs and a heart|pg||
nt|jcmax: Doesn't declarer have 4@S, 4@C 1@H and 1 ruff on a @S switch?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: At the start of this hand, Chambers said he wanted to go to the bathroom and Moss suggested they wait until the hand was over and he'd go too & commented "we're fine on time, ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: aren't we?" All agreed that we are. So I guess he's entitled to take his time here and we'll probably still have a short break after this hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always annoying for declarer when a defender thinks for AGES and then makes the right play.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Welland still ahead of schedule: 8 imps in 5 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Henry, he also makes it on a heart shift|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HA, heart ruff, diamond ruff, club to the queen, diamond ruff, heart ruffed high, diamond ....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then he has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Moss is taking so long just because he knows that Chambers wants to go to the bathroom.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And annoying for the defender and his/her partner when they think for ages and make the wrong play (I say that from lots of experience!)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, when a defenders screws up and then says 'Well, I did think about it.' that makes it worse.|pg||
nt|jcmax: That would be a terrific line of play, Roland! declarer would have to guess the layout very well. Let's hope for some spectacular play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only a club defeats it for sure as I see it|pg||
nt|brolucius: I noted a couple of days ago that this is like watching a rental DVD that has just stuck.|pg||

nt|brolucius: A chance missed for E/W.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Still N could actually have beaten the contract two tricks by returning a @C after he overruffed to square the board|pg||
nt|brolucius: He may have thought that declarer held five trumps, leaving South with none at that stage.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: When they got up to leave, Brad said: "if you want a break, you should play faster, Neil" to much amusement|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wolfson ha pulled some back against Bathurst, only 38 IMPs up now|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: still, just an overtrick this time|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: THESE GUYS GO FOR THE MAX|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco maybe is treating it as too good for 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: misunderstanding over 3@C perhaps?|pg||
nt|pef: looks like guessing the spade will now be a lot more important than an overtrick|pg||
nt|chip: If 3C is a game try, seems like an overbid with all that junk.  5c looks like exclusion, but can't be. Maybe a delayed splinter?|pg||
nt|athene: welland has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart starts to put out 5D card then corrects to 5S|pg||
nt|athene: he should be making whatever his weakest bid is - maybe he thought 3@C showed a minimum here (2nt system on) but bramley thought otherwise|pg||
nt|chip: Looks like they may well get to clubs or a slam.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|royhughes: 4@s is a decent spot too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: Should note that this is a complicated new system for bramley, though 4N makes a lot more sense. Now will presumably guess the spade as noted to win a (scary) IMP|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but this is safe enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson: passed me in exclusion again?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told the other room chose the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|royhughes: I only see 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|royhughes: 8 tricks on top plus extras ruffing|pg||
nt|royhughes: which the defence is out to stop!|pg||
nt|royhughes: this may be complicated|pg||
nt|athene: yes, only one obvious loser but it's all about winners|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer doesn't have 11|pg||
nt|athene: no way to ruff a heart then take a double ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: north has too many trumps for that|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm another illusion of a hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence will have to be careful|pg||
nt|royhughes: How do you plan this?  I think you try to make declarer's hand high, since it has the long heart.  So maybe up queen at T1 and play hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm sure Greco is thinking more deeply than that!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: a spec says he plays QC (he aint led from Jxxxx) and then a heart to the 8|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play after 1major - 2nt, 3@C is any min and perhaps welland thought that applied here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pef: claim?|pg||
nt|pef: I think we probably missed a bit of the play :)|pg||
nt|chip: just the trumps.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe we missed the bit where north switched to a trump at trick 3 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: got behind with slow response|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|royhughes: a heart finesse is maybe a good idea at t2|pg||
nt|athene: now he'll hope north had @HKJx or @HQJx originally|pg||
nt|royhughes: it loses an entry for the ruffs, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd i think it is always off but the defence needs care|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's difficult because you want to throw a diamond on the 13th spade (which won't be good as the cards lie)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|royhughes: But that requires trumps to be drawn|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|royhughes: I didn't see any way for Greco to make it|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|royhughes: down 2, i think|pg||
nt|athene: east can't really have @CAK, @SQ, @HA, @DK (16 count) so diamond back would be the quick way to beat the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably -2 actually|pg||
nt|athene: but this is fine - north can see there is no rush|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jcmax: The defence would probably lead a @D to the K and a @D back. then a fter a @H switch they can just wait for 3 more tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D!|an|6 !hs, minimum hand|mb|d|nt|jcmax: This looks like NS will arrive at 4@H and then will need to guess the @H layout to make it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a good double, as I see it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Three ways of playing after a 2NT inquiry. 1. Asking for strength and suit quality - 2. Asking for a feature (only shown if maximum) - 3. Asking for a singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Any method can be good; you just need an agreement|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad's note made it clear that "minimum" was worst of 3 possibles - "good" "middle" "weak"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  4@h has no play: @dQ, @hA, @cA, @cruff, @druff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Maybe West thinks he has more chance of scoring his @HQ in defense if he shows long diamonds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3N requires guessing hearts|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, but would you lead a @D or your singleton?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcmax: I happen to think most players would lead their singleton, but I may be wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Chambers asks "could he have 5?" Moss, could have had 5, but he has now shown 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players overbid facing a weak two. I saw Zia/Hamman go two down in 4@H for a flat board the other say when I thought he should have passed 2@H. Here Moss has shown restraint ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: (probably knowing my views on the subject).|pg||
nt|henryb:  if you lead your stiff partner can shift to his stiff and get both ruffs|pg||
nt|jcmax: Very true! so NS did well to stop here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Then schermer asks what a minimum hand would be - Moss says, "we're probably in the upper 5% of soundness" "I was going to game force until you doubled" Schermer, "you mean my DBL ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: got you off of bidding game? cool"|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: J-x is not a very attractive lead, so East can tell that the lead is a singleton.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|pef: greco/hampson play both multi and weak 2 bids|pg||
nt|pef: 2h is a sound weak 2 bid by their standards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: After Greco cashed his aces he cont diamonds, roy won spade to dummy finess claim|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt perhaps from north now?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's not the right vulnerability for that sort of bid|pg||
nt|athene: double would work out very nicely but i think many would do that at imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks natural but roy may try something tactical|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco will be looking at a pretty good hand and nowhere obvious to go|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|nt|athene: sorry i *don't* think many would do that at imps :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south should pass and leave the dice to fall where they will|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: platnik did quite a lot of bidding in the other room? did diamond ever promise any values?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't blame Hampson for pulling, clarifying his hand type|pg||
nt|roswolf: now blood may flow|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe decent 18 count is worth a go at game when partner has four spades|pg||
nt|athene: welland  playing his partner for nothing|pg||
nt|athene: 800 is there for the taking|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandbagging!?|pg||
nt|athene: (heart lead, south gets in with the @HK and leads a spade to get a ruff there)|pg||
nt|roswolf: greco hasnt passed yet and nor has south|pg||
nt|royhughes: I would expect Greco to pass -- he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|athene: well greco can choose which way round to put his pass card but i don't see that he has any other room to exercise judgement|pg||
nt|royhughes: I agree, but he must be thinking about something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: often a minor overcall over a weak-2 shows both minors|pg||
nt|athene: because otherwise you would double or bid notrumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so greco might be thinking that his partner could have clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't pull to 4@C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: bramley doesn't double again because he just doesn't want to hear 4@D from partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes roy i think chickened out|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: of course he wouldn't have been ecstatic to hear 2nt lebensohl then 3@D after the first double, but it's a bit more manageable a level lower i guess|pg||
pc|d6|nt|smoller: Seems best not to lead the singleton club|pg||
nt|chip: A bit surprised S raised with weak hearts and a soft hand, but guess he didn't want to defend 2S and hoped to make it harder (which it did)|pg||
nt|chip: Good decision by Welland to bid 4S, would not be so great if partner were 3-1-3-6.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy gets the screen closed again and asks Jeff something, Jeff reading roys note and writing a response|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: another question from roy and a response|pg||
nt|pef: making 5 in the closed room was pretty impressive|pg||
nt|chip: perhaps after a stiff club lead?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|royhughes: So NS missed a big opportunity|pg||
pc|h6|nt|royhughes: They may get 200 instead of 800|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chip: probably questions about leads and signals.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that seems very likely|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: welland decided to believe his opps (who were vulnerable) rather than his partner (who was not)|pg||
nt|athene: which was maybe not ridiculous i suppose|pg||
nt|royhughes: True, and Bramley maybe didn't know his partner's 3N was for real, either|pg||
nt|roswolf: but you should ALWAYS believe pard|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: yes, north led a club and got a ruff but that didn't really help the defence very much|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chip: This will hold it to 4.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: well, up to a point|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: but bramley is in first seat at favourable and he needs 50 imps the same as you do|pg||
nt|athene: some partners will tend to do things in that situation|pg||
nt|roswolf: niet you have 2 opps already why create a 3rd|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chip: and get the hand over more quickly.|pg||
nt|pef: is somebody really thinking here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Jeff calls for director, tempo issue with Roys first pass he explains|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can cash one trump then just cash the @CKQ and @DA crossruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: or bart's 4C call|pg||
nt|athene: i can certainly imagine welland might have given it a think over 3@H - he almost has a double or a 3@S bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry, the problem was with Bramley's break before 4C  Jeff is Hampson and Roy is Welland|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I think all 4 players bid reasonably|pg||

nt|jcmax: Could this be an exciting deal?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  easy to get a trick too high on these cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a Michaels hand, really. 1@S better.|pg||
mb|2S|an|3 !hs, Limit+|nt|Walddk2: If N-S go to the 5-level, it has to be in diamonds, not hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I think diamonds are dead now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many use 2@S to show a sound 3-card raise, while 2NT would show a sound 4-card raise.|pg||
nt|jcmax: If W bids 4@S now, can N stop below 5@H?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer asked what 2NT by Gitelman would be and Fred said "Natural"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  many use 2N as Fred and Brad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it's important to distinguish between 3 and 4-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know Sabine is a subscriber to that|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may be reluctant to bid 5@D in case that is read as a slam try when a heart fit is already found.|pg||
nt|henryb:  She is younger than I am|pg||
nt|jcmax: The other possibility is to distinguish between invitational and GF hands. That can be important, too, in competitive auctions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now I look at it again, though, North has a good hand on this bidding, with a void in their suit.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Roland I am actually a subscriber to limit and gf :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, perhaps he does not mind how partner reads 5@D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would be quite something if Fred passes this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last makeable spot|pg||
nt|jcmax: Can S be sure that 5@D is a suit? probably not, probably just cuebid, so he canøt pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: It could be lead-directing on a void, from South's point of view, perhaps.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, he took as natural, alas ...|pg||
mb|6H|nt|henryb:  no. not a void: partner would bid 5@c with 12 cards in hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 6@D seems surprising to me, when the @SA may be wasted.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Plenty of drama for us in the audience.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy for an intermediate player to understand how they reached this contract. "6@H off 2 cashing aces??", they would ask|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: As was the case earlier this year when they reached 7@D off @DA at two tables|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not this pair, though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Yes, which cost Bakhshi and Del'Monte a big win on their debut as a partnership.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||

nt|chip: I disagree, he seems well short of a bid. His hand is better suited to pass, planning to bid 3S over the DBL. Look how strong his partner is and 4S isn't cold.|pg||
nt|pef: n/s is making the call|pg||
nt|athene: one thing worth a mention about the general tactics here - the more active and aggressive your opps, the more you have to really know when your partner's bids promise things and ...|pg||
nt|athene: how much they promise|pg||
nt|roswolf: another action hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hang on to your hats|pg||
nt|athene: because you will often face these "should i believe opps or partner?" situations|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: fit jump would be useful here|pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe -- the South hand isn't a classic for it|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should buy the contract because of the @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director question about tempo on previous hand, both before about double and pass over 4D|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM INTERESTING|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wondered if NS felt they might have doubled 4@D if the pass was quicker|pg||
nt|athene: north will not stop bidding over 4@S if his partner has shown some sort of good heart raise|pg||
nt|athene: he has the sixth heart AND the spade void|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW have a chance to beat 5H on a diamond ruff, I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think he they should have axed anyway so arguably no damage|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's hard to stop to double 4@S on the NS cards|pg||
nt|athene: a lot might depend here on whether south can show specifically a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: well evereyone has stopped it seems|pg||
nt|athene: or just some "good raise"|pg||
nt|athene: facing the former, north might not go to the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: facing the latter he surely will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director looking at previous hand to see if tempo influenced Hampson's pull of the X to 4D|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|athene: ok, 2@D is normally a 3-card raise i assume|pg||
nt|athene: now north might bid 3@S trying to show his hand and get his partner involved over 4@S|pg||
nt|royhughes: Who is screenmate with whom here?  And Hampson tell who was taking time?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson and Bramley are screenmates|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well see a tactical(ie pyschic) bid|pg||
nt|athene: a bid of 4minor from north should be much more concentration in that minor - north doesn't want to emphasize either minor, he just wants to say "i have a 6th heart and a spade ...|pg||
nt|athene: void"|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pef: did they put the board aside?|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, but N or S? anyway next hand|pg||
nt|pef: according to the vugraph operation, Geoff Hampson called the td|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Director took the board...|pg||
nt|chip: As I noted earlier, 4s would not be a winning action if partner had long clubs and only 3S. Slow 4C might suggest that, but really in this auction doesn't point to anything much ...|pg||
nt|chip: specific (and could be N who was thinking)|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt looks ok over 1@S?|pg||
nt|royhughes: It wasn't clear to me who was taking time after 3@d on the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: ok, not sure 3@D will get the job done|pg||
nt|roswolf: slowly slowly catchee monkey thinks north|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't know welland's plan for future rounds of bidding here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|smoller: Yes Chip. N could be thinking, bur hardly possible|pg||
nt|pef: north balanced with 1nt in the closed room and bought it there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry about spelling of Geoff|pg||
nt|royhughes: He's starting by just showing his 2nd suit (2D was artificial)|pg||
nt|athene: well yes but 2@D was a heart raise i assume|pg||
nt|royhughes: Right|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the last bd welland gained 2 imps - for the moment|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: maybe he just felt he was a bit short of tricks for 1nt vulnerable|pg||
nt|chip: Started same way in the other room, and N balanced with 1N as here, buying it.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Everyone's bidding the other side's suit|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: if partner has a dead minimum you could lose quite a lot of hundreds|pg||
nt|pef: not buying it here, though|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks reasonable to me|pg||
nt|pef: me too, will hampson now enter the fray?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, quite reasonable, and likely successful.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: South asks west a question|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like 3@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: snickering from both Welland and Greco|pg||
nt|athene: right now everyone knows (or thinks he knows) it's a double fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the auction has created the fog of war|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|royhughes: Yes, it's a double fit but with losers in the long suits|pg||
nt|athene: bramley might have been better off to jump, but he probably thinks there is good chances 6@D or even 7@D is on|pg||
nt|athene: just give partner @HA, @DAK and there you are|pg||
mb|5C|nt|pef: this will win about 6 imps for welland|pg||
nt|pef: assuming he guesses spades--pretty shocking if he doesn't on this auciton|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: he needs them badly|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, Bramley has an awfully good offensive hand for the auction -- really impossible to double 4S|pg||
nt|royhughes: It will also be hard to find the diamond ruff, if NS play 5H|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will have the final decision|pg||
nt|royhughes: 5@D is better as the EW cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not so sure about that|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought east already has his @D10 lined up against a heart contract|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Oh, right, I had the wrong player on lead.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I thought Welland might have completed his description by doubling 4C|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm now south needs to judge|pg||
nt|royhughes: That might have slowed his partner down|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if the defence begin with three rounds of hearts, declarer will throw the @CQ?|pg||
nt|smoller: no spades guess if they set up his heartsuit|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Even when a middle card is marginally better, it can mislead (no pun intended) partner. He may think that the 9 or 8 is from a weak suit. |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer took a moment to be sure before saying that 2@d showed Majors - probably because of the misunderstanding yesterday|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: psychic probably|pg||

nt|roswolf: UNCLEAR|pg||
nt|royhughes: I suspect 2N says there may be game|pg||
nt|athene: but then again in another way he has a pretty bad hand :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, East has a good hand for having passed, but maybe a bad one for having bid a vulnerable spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes being talked out of game is a hideous sin|pg||
nt|athene: he will expect his partner to have a singleton heart but that isn't marvellous|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's ok as at least hearts aren't getting overruffed, as north has 4 (ha, ha)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Game is borderline: spades come and hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|royhughes: Are you allowed to psyche an artificial bid in this event?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: both east and west know north may be at it |pg||
nt|athene: but you don't really want to have to try to ruff 3 hearts in the west hand|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is the one with the big spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: even for roy I find it hard to believe the 3n call|pg||

nt|pef: 4h can be beaten fairly easily by forcing dummy to ruff a diamond.  but somewehre in the auciton hampson may have shown spade support|pg||

mc|9|nt|jcmax: E was a good partner and didn't give W that problem! :)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|pef: bramley maybe hoping they get to 3n?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|royhughes: I meant clubs are 75% if you have enough entries, and you may be one short|pg||
nt|roswolf: that bidding was routine|pg||

nt|royhughes: Hampson had to consider partner having Jx in trump|pg||
nt|athene: must lose three diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|athene: even if you managed to get some sort of elimination position, west can just stick up the @DJ so you are totally doomed|pg||
nt|athene: no way you can duck a diamond to east and endplay him|pg||
nt|athene: and you are short of about half-a dozen entries to strip the rounded suits anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west have to be awake when declarer plays a diamond off the board|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't see any way either.  And Hampson can rise with the jack if you get close|pg||
nt|royhughes: But Welland will give it a try, I'm sure|pg||
nt|athene: he'll use an entry to run the @CQ i guess - the king might be onside after all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: welland trying a swindle|pg||
nt|royhughes: This looks dangerous to me -- might he not run into a diamond ruff on a hand that was makeable?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but roy is well versed in judging the table vibes|pg||
nt|royhughes: and I'm not sure -- maybe it's fairly safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially he puts max pressure on opps when others dont|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|royhughes: If East could put up a doubleton honor, take a ruff and exit in hearts, that would be one down if he had the club king|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|royhughes: But as you say, it may create pressure on the opponents|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|smoller: crocodile?|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: so then even if the @DK loses to the ace east might have to give a ruff and discard|pg||

nt|jcmax: Agree :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzfb: we'll try to do equally well the rest of the day :). For anyone who doesn't know, of course I'm joking, we have no control over what hands the computer produces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|jcmax: EW stopped at 2@C at the other table. At first sight that appears very low, when one player holds 18 HCP with 55 distribution!|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcmax: Is it a bit surprising that N passed out 1@H?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Would Michael Rosenberg have responsed on those West cards? He tells me that he never passes (or perhaps that is only when NV).|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|pef: in the closed room they also opened 1nt with the stiff k of clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|roswolf: a possible trappy hand for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|pef: hampson knows greco has a big hand, but still a bit rich to balance vul.|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5+H, 4+c|nt|roswolf: but they should stay low enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: that's a very favorable lead for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: same auction as before, so east has shown 5+ hearts? so i guess 2@H from west now|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe 2@C really is ambiguous|pg||
nt|athene: or hampson just doesn't care and wants to get out as soon as possible|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|royhughes: the alert said 5+H, 4+C for 2C|pg||
nt|athene: okie|pg||

nt|royhughes: As the cards lie declarer can ruff a good heart to play trumps again|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|athene: you get extra style points for ruffing a winner to achieve some strategic end|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|royhughes: Maybe a safer line is just to play hearts, willing to lose 3 trumps and a spade|pg||
nt|athene: he's going to try to ruff a spade in dummy|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2C is cold this way|pg||

nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Roy and Bill for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: welland definitely still in the match|pg||

mb|1S|nt|pef: so with one board to go we're down to 27 imp difference with 76 boards to go|pg||
nt|pef: the match will resume very soon--in theory at 6:15, but maybe there will be a slightly longer break than that|pg||
nt|pef: thanks to the earlier commentators, chip martel, bill frisby, roland wald and others|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: tactical (and somewhat odd) 1nt from welland|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: most have some sort of bid for that north hand, like 3@S, say |pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect his pard makes all appropriate allowances|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I don't think it was alerted as forcing unless I missed it|pg||
nt|athene: well if 4@D is a cue it's an overbid|pg||
nt|royhughes: If Welland is cuebidding up the line, he has denied a club control :)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|pef: possibly 1s denied as many as 4 spades there|pg||
nt|royhughes: something is rotten|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: after bd 73 welland leading the set 27-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is excessive althiugh the club hole has been highlighted |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|athene: yes, west should be able to find the club lead, i think|pg||
nt|athene: on this auction|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS are fortunate hearts break|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pef: so a normal pretty dull contract to end this set|pg||
nt|pef: the heart overcall may gain declarer a trick, actually|pg||
nt|pef: unless greco leads a diamond instead of his partner's suit|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pef: yep, hard not to lead partners vul. overcall suit when you have 3 of them|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pef: very quick claim because they are a couple minutes over the time limit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: if you keep on stopping in 5 of a major, eventually fate will get tired and rebuke you|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think West plays a diamond hoping for the ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 74 east is playing in 1@H|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
