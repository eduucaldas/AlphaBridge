nt|hedyg: thats better than me!|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|hedyg: session scores and results at: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals|pg||
nt|mikam1: So the Wolfson team will have to get a move on soon...down 51 with 60 boards to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals  gets session scores and access to partnership system summary forms [click on team name]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Good Morning we are waiting for the boards|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS system form: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=809&pid=608|pg||
nt|mikam1: Rubin-Ekeblad play a complex relay system with Canapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   unfortunately  matches are not playing the same boards|pg||
nt|mikam1: They often bid their shorter suit first|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Al, that is unfortunate indeed|pg||
nt|mikam1: Bathurst-Zagorin 2/1 natural system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yesterday spec helped me come up with better description  regarding canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: welcome we are ready to start the last 60 boards|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably a security measure , but how do you compare strength when they play different boards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Third seat opened|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: with 2 suits the shortest is opened|pg||
nt|mikam1: The Bathurst team consists of many good young players, maybe all under 30 years old|pg||
nt|hedyg: Debbie is the board wrongly put?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the age of the |pg||
nt|mikam1: This must be pass pass 1@S|pg||
nt|mikam1: Then Drury by North|pg||
nt|hedyg: N cannot open 1@s here, S can|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: yes, even the young ones have limits on how light they can open|pg||
mb|2C|an|Drury|nt|mikam1: Zagorin has a game try over that I think...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: N not worth a drury imo with 9 hcps in a flat hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mikam1: Unless North specifically showed only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|mikam1: That makes game much less likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: he would need a 4th @s in N for a gametry for sure|pg||
nt|mikam1: In any case, had he tried 2@D North would have signed off|pg||
nt|glen: given NS open most 11s, drury is a 9-10|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Glen|pg||
nt|mikam1: Hi |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: i think it is a shame that only 4 pairs submitted convention cards for the trials   most other parts of the world CC submission is obligatory|pg||
pc|s8|nt|glen: hi Hedy, Michael :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|glen: and Al|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|glen: yes, for example the NS system summary is a total of 10 lines |pg||
nt|mikam1: Note Zagorin's play of the club jack at trick one|pg||
nt|glen: that is not enough information for preparation by opps|pg||
nt|mikam1: This caused east to "waste" his queen and made the defense harder here|pg||
nt|mikam1: Rubin was now "slightly" endplayed|pg||
nt|mikam1: If leads are 3rd and 5th, Ekeblad had to guess at trick one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  carding  upside-down count, attitude and smith    NS carding standard|pg||
nt|mikam1: If he misguesses here he goes down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zagorin is shaking his head|pg||
nt|mikam1: Tough decision|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mikam1: well done|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zagorin is leaning in|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|mikam1: Spec pointed out that perhaps ace and another spade was correct after the diamond jack dropped|pg||

nt|andyv:  with match this close, I don't think Rubin was changing esp. since his team is ahead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 6 might be a bit off there|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: faces D8, CA, and tosses the rest aside, making 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: board is wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, pls shut down and reconnect|pg||
nt|psyck: :(|pg||
nt|Walddk5: open room has the right boards now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: directors are checking|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS will be playing a strong @c system and EW 2/1|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this the right score? |pg||
nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H doesn't fit   anything for either pair|pg||
nt|andyv:  or for any pair that I know of|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: oh its 107|pg||
nt|kareno: Hi all from sunny Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: helo raija:) |pg||
nt|jcwla: Both matches fairly wide apart at this point, plenty of time but both trailers need to start making inroads and not get further behind.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: really tighten up |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, aker gained 11 on board 105|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||

nt|psyck: ya, both need to recover at around an imp a board|pg||
pc|c2|nt|passell: these wont come 1 at a time|pg||
nt|psyck: quiet start|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: scores with 1 set to play at  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S Size Ask  for  NT invite or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = reject NT invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: goren-donn played 3NT while NS in the other room attempted 6@d in their 6-4 fit and went 1 off|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: I have 9 that's worse than most 7s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but each match playing a different set of boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: phew didn't lose the broadcast this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: network burped|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin still studying dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @DJ: rusinow from 4 or more, standard from 3 or fewer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson asks for another look at the spots for the thousandth time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: spade called, simson asks for another second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs    upside-down: count, attitude, smith      NS  also upside-down suit preference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson has changed his gray polo shirt for a black one|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS part of the winning GNT team...I think 2nd time for them.. from Ohio.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson crosses his arms and sits back in his seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin watching the ceiling as he often does|pg||
nt|andyv:  was Rubin serious about playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson in his thinker pose, elbow on his thigh, hand on his cheek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- did Jacobs concede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no one told me if they did concede|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: of course rubin was not serious about playing standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson replied that he and simson were playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nickell team down 48|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and joked that it would be interesting if they had to switch systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody for EHAA??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I'd be all for EHAA, I could explain the bidding better then having played it myself|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: although I usually play strong club I don't know..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a very fun friday night game   we used to play [very illegal]  one card if i dealt,  one card if partner dealt, opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: all the intricacies of either NS or EW system|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hello specs.  This is the semi finals...first set of what promises to be an exciting match|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Karen, Shir |pg||
nt|psyck: you, about 5 big swings or twice as many partial swings|pg||
nt|passell: the lucky diamond position will help declarer|pg||
pc|d9|nt|joest: hello all|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  EW play a precision style club|pg||
nt|peachy: -ley|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: Not unexpected double from south.  Will east stick it?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|joest: interesting choice to go with a forcing 2@d before bidding hearts.  I don't know if this sequence got the 5-6 message across or not|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a complex system of relays|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: well not quite.  They do play lots of transfers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3c meant as 3-1-4-5|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|joest: hi Kirshna|pg||
nt|joest: Krishna|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hi to all|pg||
nt|psyck: just call me CK :)|pg||
nt|joest: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no other info|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kareno: If no double, then perhaps the double of 3nt was an error :)  |pg||
nt|passell: he can make declarer guess if he cashes diamond and leads a low heart|pg||
nt|psyck: some may use drury here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: might have been better with the ruffs |pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: I guess garner has seen weinstein's lead directing doubles before :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  gm Peter and CK|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|joest: helllo all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Even if had sure dummy re-entry might be likely to play @S this way upon sight of @DJ.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|passell: he was a little light for drury with 2 jacks and 4333   they do use drury|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: 4@s would have gome down if E gets in with @d to play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should have respected his pd's x after he already bid out his hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: with the hearts ruffing out, probably to declarer's surprise, this will make 6|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Andy - for me just after dinner, and CK prob late night :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not sure which of the ten losers would suggest Drury, it's OK to have a good hand for your bid.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, agree with not use of drury|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfd: just catching up - welcome|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades dbld looks like 1 down  although it was allowed to make in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: re Susan, lets hope the connection stabilises this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: one can hope, but unlikely|pg||
nt|robinswr: it's nice having more trumps then declerer|pg||
nt|robinswr: and a suit to tap him further|pg||
nt|robinswr: declarer needs to pitch the spades from dummy in order tostop the tap|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Had north doubled, that likely would have been the defense.  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree that the principles of doubling call for Dbl on both contracts. Or neither|pg||
nt|passell: good heart guess|pg||
nt|psyck: with 2@s still constructive, drury should be reserved for proper limit raise hands|pg||
nt|joest: yes good heart guess, particularly since not clear why wooldridge would switch to hearts|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: amazing 6@H here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass could be trap  --  dare to dream|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: May go all pass here...but Ekeblad has ALOT of stuff for that|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner in 2@SX South|pg||
nt|mikam1: does pass show 0-4 if not a trap?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Really Al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-P-2@C-2@S//X-end|pg||
nt|glen: EW could miss 5-6 @S fit against young players when 1@S was faked|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Ekeblad has taken of his glasses and rubbing his eyes|pg||
nt|mikam1: I don't think Zagorin would psyche here (in spades yet) up by 50 imps|pg||
nt|hedyg: missed the chance to run|pg||
nt|glen: exactly, so I would pass here|pg||
nt|glen: and miss the "excellent" 6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this type of problem comes up in Master Solvers' Club  --   you may have a good spot, but almost zero change to get there|pg||
nt|mikam1: Pass is not the worst idea ever if he knows Rubin is broke....the problem occurs when Rubin has long hearts or diamonds|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: he expects 0-4 HCP|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now this may get more competitive|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will Rubin enter the fray?|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: well 4 is all he needs for game|pg||
mb|2D|nt|glen: rubin assumes (knows) system is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the CR S did not rebid over the penalty pass of 2@ss and missed the save in 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: writing by Rubin to Zagorin|pg||
mb|3C|nt|glen: bidding 2@D as a transfer I suspect|pg||
nt|mikam1: I suspect that's natural...2@D I mean|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am afraid so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and likely to kill chances of finding @H|pg||
nt|mikam1: we'll see who's right Glen|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: no alert on either side of table|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: actually   might be analogous to 1N-(2@C)   where  front of card applies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2@D=@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: they would have alerted that|pg||
nt|mikam1: Really...would be a good understanding here...but I still wonder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: keyword = might|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Debbie - was 2@D alerted?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: i was reaching since 2@D natural instead of 2@H  seems counter-intuitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: NO|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: she said neither side alerted it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: everyone is laughing|pg||
nt|mikam1: I do think it was natural...Ronnie was just competing in his best suit|pg||
nt|mikam1: Russ's good 4@C bid got them to game |pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well done by Ekeblad|pg||
nt|hedyg: he made the cheapest bid he could|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin says this auction has never been discussed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute situation   defend 1@S or declare 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zagorin says wow|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW 1@d is 10-15 with 2+@ds|pg||
nt|passell: 2 spades not so constructive by passed hand|pg||
nt|joest: when you open all 11 counts though, I find that the standards for Drury drop accordingly :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not clear 2@S still constructive BPH, may not be able to risk pass of 1NT showing non-const raise.|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gulyas: it looks like they are better off by not letting 4@S play out|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't mind the 1nt bid - it's a value bid, though partner may assume you have stoppers.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  14-16|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe only undertricks were makable there in any game there on a normal day|pg||
nt|joest: would everyone open 2@c.  I understand it; I understand 1@s too|pg||
nt|joest: now if it goes "double I have nothing" this could go all pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: good morning to all|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: 2@H  4-11 HCP, 5-7 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: after the interruption the redeal button didnt automatically work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I was busy typing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 15-17 in 3rd seat vul, and all 4th seat|pg||
nt|andyv:  they will find the @s game|pg||
nt|robinswr: some would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|passell: I dont like to open 2clubs on minimum hand like that  but it is the winner  assures getting to 4hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N modified Ogust|pg||
nt|joest: they're in the wrong event if they don't :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, W has quite a pewerful hand, even opp a 14-16 hand|pg||
nt|psyck: double = double negative (bust) & pass= semi positive here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ah, so I'm not the only one whose pds have the W hand when I finally get a biggie.  W will make a weakness-showing noise here.  I would open 1@S as E, need room to describe here.|pg||
nt|joest: the selfrescue will strike gold|pg||
nt|joest: but it is a throw of the dice|pg||
nt|passell: I agree|pg||
nt|passell: garner may run to clubs and hit gold|pg||
nt|joest: "it's one level higher' always runs through my head|pg||
nt|passell: a red suit leat will hurt 2spades  club not as much|pg||
nt|joest: as against that, it's almost sure RHO 'has you' on this auction|pg||
nt|passell: I like crash vs 2clubs   gets 2 suiters in play|pg||
nt|joest: but that's because you're an animal Mike!  :)|pg||
nt|passell: dbl would show reds or blacks  easy to find fit|pg||
nt|joest: but i like it too I do confess |pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: much better to support hearts and ignore the spades|pg||
nt|psyck: I agree with supporting @h, though 4 level is strange|pg||
pc|h2|nt|robinswr: only if playing a forcing club system|pg||
nt|peachy: NS methods include: We will open most 11 counts and many distributional 10 counts. We will open 1C with a balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary ...|pg||
nt|peachy: clubs. We open 1D with semi- balanced or unbalanced hands with primary diamonds or 4-5 in the minors. |pg||
nt|joest: most pairs have not prepared adequate defenses vs. 2@c interference soI agree with the philosophy|pg||
nt|passell: can still play 2 of a major natural  only lose 2dia |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 6+@H and   [i think] min|pg||
nt|jcwla: How animalistic it is depends on the hands one chooses to use it on.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|passell: diamond lead was best  this was second best|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table they opened east's hand with a strong 1@c and south entered at the one level|pg||
nt|jcwla: For those who thank God for small favors, the @S8 drops singleton.|pg||
nt|passell: doesnt matter |pg||
nt|passell: I think he will get a diamond in the end|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|joest: i'm trying to judge how well 4@h plays if they get there next door|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  low club is winner here|pg||
nt|joest: just gave up on slam. partner would need aperfecto I guess but if the ace of diamonds had been @hKQ....|pg||
nt|andyv:  when NS open 1@d, it's either semi balanced or unbalanced with mainly diamonds or 4-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|psyck: W also happy to hear opps bidding @d (lesser @d wastage with pd)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: garner has the wrong shape, and these are the wrong colors, for saving in 5@d!|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d void is a big minus for slam searching opposite a NT bidder when you have limited values|pg||
nt|joest: if Howard is thinking here we may be in for a looooong session|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will be... both NS are deliberate players|pg||
nt|joest: north more so than south|pg||
pc|h5|nt|passell: 4 hearts plays well lose 1 heart 1 dia |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @h2 turned quickly, ekeblad: "may I?", johnson: "mais oui!"|pg||
nt|psyck: he can see 4@s, 1@h, 1@d, 5@c for 11 tricks if blakc suits break|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine 1nt showed hearts, given the rest of the auction.|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we see a ht lead here?|pg||
nt|joest: now comes the @CK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: 8 is probably suit pref for @hs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: Welcome to Joe Shair from the USA|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: This is a very unfriendly hand for declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: yeah with the heart jack dropping you are in good shape|pg||
nt|joest: garner's long huddle over 2@s may tip Hurd to the fact that Garner has a club side suit (apart from theplay inthe club suit itself)|pg||
nt|passell: looks like only 1 down|pg||
nt|joest: if they start diamonds now, they may be able to get another|pg||
pc|s6|nt|passell: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: That's the North Pole...|pg||
nt|peachy: He arrived in a sled, there is  still snow in santyclz land|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ran out in the desert, that's why I was late.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|robinswr: easy hand just needs both aces on sides|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|psyck: so just took a lil time to see if he had to do anything in case trumps badly placed|pg||
nt|peachy: Weistein might duck this, I guess he is thinking of it anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: kib noted that must duck, squeezed otherwise. |pg||
nt|kareno: North must duck the heart |pg||
nt|peachy: I feel sorry for the operators, internet service glitches :(|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|peachy: or that is what I think, glittches in any case|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|passell: king of spades then heart|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|robinswr: or KQ of spades on sides|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades 1 dia 1 heart  down 1|pg||
nt|joest: and a club|pg||
nt|passell: I hate dbl as negative there  like pass to show bad hand  dbl for values   you get a lot more penalties that way|pg||
nt|joest: they reached 4@h in the open room|pg||
mc|6|nt|psyck: y, some chances with @cA off|pg||
nt|kareno: Two rounds of clubs will finish north now.|pg||
nt|joest: and if opener reopens with double,what does that mean the way you play?|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: that was the claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can all relax now    nothing else will happen in remaining boards|pg||
nt|mikam1: Could have made 6 in the end|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok thanx Debbie|pg||
nt|mikam1: for another imp|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mikam1: diamond finesse (10 drops) back to hand - another finesse|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|hedyg: i dont like wasting imps :( i have lost a match by 1 imp indeed :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|mikam1: For sure...but it does save brain cells sometimes :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm looking at the hand and still can't imagine meaning of 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: alert by Bathurst - then Zagorin and then he says no|pg||
nt|glen: constructive with 6+@Ss?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zagorin|pg||
nt|mikam1: Doesn't look like that either|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Somewhere between weak and....?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   just doesn't seem to fit    anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: not mentioned on their 10 line summary form|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Ekeblad puts his hand down on the table|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|hedyg: a non-constructive bid. 1@s followed by 2@s would be 8/9 then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge 4@H West|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: I believe 3@S would have been down 1...and so will 4@H on best defense|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mikam1: Although this will be close|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mikam1: 4-2 club break may be too much to handle|pg||
nt|mikam1: If the opponents get some trumps in.....|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: NS 1N opener always  14-16    if that helps declarer analyze anything|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mikam1: Problem is that you have to give up a club and a diamond...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mikam1: If south shifts to a low heart I believe that's that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge won @SA and played 3 rounds of @D|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now I think Rubin can make by playing diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mikam1: He probably needs them to be 3-3 anyway|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: tip from Wooldridge :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|hT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mikam1: Actually this should be fine|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: because Zagorin can't continue @S tap|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed that :(|pg||
nt|mikam1: Zagorin did help by playing spade back...but perhaps it was always a make|pg||
nt|mikam1: No...I go back to earlier analysis....trump upon winning the club would probably lead to defeat|pg||
nt|glen: @C switch here and if N holds up in @Ds to prevent W winning @D jack?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: how Glen?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe credit to Rubin for @C3 at trick 2    hard for Zagorin to see  DUCK is best|pg||
nt|glen: no, still okay|pg||
nt|mikam1: But Rubin just keeps playing diamonds|pg||
nt|mikam1: all safe now...and forced as far as I can see|pg||
nt|mikam1: South opened 1C, so must have this shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein finally came out of the tank    returns @H at trick 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner's turn to think    i|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Big deep breath by Rubin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I'm not even going to try to analyze 4@H for that position|pg||
nt|mikam1: Assuming spades are 6-3, South must be 3334|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mikam1: If south has the diamond ace (unlikely) nothing can be done by Rubin|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: in that case Rubin could just claim 10|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all - a lttle late :_)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Peter :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Zagorin can't hold @DA else 1N opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin asks Zagorin you opened a diamond?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Right Al...and all irrelevant anyway - there are no choices here for declarer as far as I can tell|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hang on -- that would 17 hcp   too good for 1N[14-16]|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mikam1: well done after all that :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if players need a break now -- as much as we do|pg||
nt|hedyg: already? i dont|pg||

nt|andyv:  nothing wrong with being deliberate although yesterday's match between Aker and Wolfson produced some very long delays|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe Grue needed a mirror for that one :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzfd: 2@H 10-15 or 11-15|pg||
nt|passell: take out  that way if the weak hand has a stack you can get penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H   isn't part of Ekeblad system   maybe they really did switch system|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h=5+@hs and 4@c, 10-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   i miscounted @C    10-15  5+@H & 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last board, ekeblad asked to see the final heart trick again, johnson said it didn't matter, played @s3 and conceded @s @H @d @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@c 2+ and not precision|pg||
nt|psyck: NS 2/1 style & EW precision|pg||
nt|kareno: We get to see all four hands!|pg||
nt|sybarra: great lead director overcall |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not)|pg||
nt|peachy: you said it faster, Karen :)|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL indeed!|pg||
nt|jpes: we don't seem to have missed many boards|pg||
nt|joest: so that might be a small gain for Wolfson|pg||
nt|joest: 2+ for 1@c|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|pelu: the <aker-team was vslow playing all the way - also in 1. round <.9|pg||
nt|kareno: No squeeze in the OR as north ducked the heart.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not quite as good a 7@d sac as we saw last segment.|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand, no way to start a segment, coming from behind|pg||
nt|passell: look at this hand for instance|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: 1@h = spades|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@S here takeout of @S|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: 1@s = either diamonds or a 1NT response|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s looks like takeout|pg||
nt|joest: Doubld = 3 spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: actually over double it's just diamonds, sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: These teams were originally seeded 5th & 10th, but some heavy seeds including Nickell & Gordon fell along the way.|pg||
nt|pelu: NS open on almost all 11 counts - and many distributional 10 counts|pg||
nt|psyck: NS's bidding summary says "Normal 21st century" :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: something to be said for rebidding 2@c|pg||
nt|passell: garner claimed too soon I think he was going 1 down if he played it out|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  ordinarily 1@s by this pair shows no 4 card major and is similar to forcing NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe played spades and would have made his contract if a) spades broke or b) south held hearts and clubs and was squeezed on the third spade.|pg||
nt|kareno: 5nt would be choice of slams I think.  two places to play.|pg||
nt|kareno: Susan, can you tell us why 2@h was Alerted?|pg||
nt|peachy: Borth knows enough not to pick NT :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h apparently showed diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d shows hearts - some sort of criss-cross I guess.  And now I can't guess what 5nt means.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: consecutive partscores!  good luck partner, I stretched a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  match got tighter as 4@h went down 1 in CR|pg||
nt|robinswr: make the queen of diamonds the king then its clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: the way you show a 2 1/2 spade bid is to bid 2 minor then raise 2@s to three|pg||
nt|santyclz: Effective preempting!|pg||
nt|jpes: this a b|pg||
nt|jpes: ockbuster result for wolfson|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  unscrambling the tricks will be the EW task|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gulyas: well, its a bad feeling to go down in 2@S when u r cold for 6@D...|pg||
nt|robinswr: the spades are so weak that if partner has zero or one spade, 2 minor could be better|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am exeggarating, but u do make 6 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|joest: so Wolfson did pick up 4 on that last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i may have misclicked on a card on that hand|pg||
nt|passell: yes  down 1  after the heart lead|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room a natural 1@c opener, a weak 2@s response and a takeout double. Not clear they will be in game after that start|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: very optimistic|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table s just bid 4@d.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  pushed a little too hard on this one|pg||
nt|joest: quite|pg||
nt|pelu: even 4@h need some work|pg||
nt|joest: btw the pass was alerted b/c it said 'lead diamonds'.  A double would have meant 'don't lead diamonds"|pg||
nt|psyck: a simple doubly & raise to 3@h shows W's values for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think their 1@s in comp was either minor, that is why the pass over 4@d|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s was diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: no after thje free 2@H from East W has a GF hand|pg||
nt|joest: we used to call hands like east's "pickles and ice cream"  Some very good things and some very bad things.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all who know the systems for explaining.|pg||
nt|joest: "where do I start" thinks declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: even making five would be a challenge|pg||
nt|kareno: So presumably this auction shows red suits.  Two places to play and clubs was excluded by the 6@d bid.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: but over 5@C he could (sh) only bid 5@h|pg||
nt|passell: looks like he will get this home with both red suits behaving|pg||
nt|psyck: not clear E should have blasted to game here either|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  7@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the last score I had was Welland 262-204 over Jacobs.  if Jacobs conceded, no one told me, but it's plausible|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking may endplay E|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: would not be the first time they had|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  his main hope is that all games go down now|pg||
nt|ybob: XX   QXXXX    XXX    AXX  = VERY GOOD SLAM |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: I definitely like 5D better|pg||
nt|passell: it is there style   you were young once also|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: weren't we all|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: @H10  helps Ekeblad exit trump|pg||
nt|psyck: if you chose to rebid 2@c, would you bid on after 2@d?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|santyclz: To see the bidding at the other table, hover your mouse pointer over the other table score.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: 3nt made in the OR.  Apparently they failed to cash out (including diamonds) after declarer surrendered a spade.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|robinswr: while you only have one diamond loser you have two hearts and the fourth club to get rid of|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|psyck: yes & this has decent chances too|pg||
nt|joest: on a trump switch this looks like it comes up short|pg||
nt|passell: trump shift now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can it be beaten with a trump lead?|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: declarers only real chances were 1. opps do not play trump 2. if they do, @c 33|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well it's either blasting 4@H or "blasting" 3@H - hard to believe opposite a free 2@H bid that game would not have chances (if not cold) - so I totally agree with the 4@H bid.  |pg||
nt|joest: weinstein knows garner has 3 spades and 3 diamonds.  If he has 2 hearts and five clubs, that gives declarer 3=5=4=1 pattern and all the more reason  to led trumps now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|joest: my own take is that Justin got a little carried away with his hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will make with both hearts onside.  Nice contract, well played.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: win it or duck it?|pg||
nt|psyck: Vul, i may have tried 4@h too, but NV 3@h seems to express the hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: where the tricks coming from?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gulyas: you can ruff the @Hs and guess the @Cs|pg||
nt|robinswr: however, 6@d would fetch. ruff two hearts in dummy and play trumps you have a club spade sqeeze|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would rather be in 5@D than in 2@S|pg||
nt|joest: at this point declarer is reduced to playing for 3-3 @cs|pg||
nt|passell: this was allowed to make in the other room|pg||
nt|passell: this is down 1 now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: you may not have two fast losers but that's not 12 winners|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: and after a free 2@H it was very optimistick to bid 5@C - the void in @S (one of partners suits) not a big value -with only 4 card @h|pg||
nt|psyck: what would double of 1@s by lall have been?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|joest: you'll have to ask him. :)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i think Simson will get location of @DK correct  so !Q will pin card from West holding to down 1|pg||
nt|robinswr: Q8xx opposite AK2 when the 109 falls, its restricted choice to finesse the 8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ekeblad might not bid 3@C with just  KK and 4@C|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck: I play 3@d on 1@s as Nat, Inv; but the suit not good enuf for that :(|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|nt|gulyas: now he can make with the endplay|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  or he can just 2nd @d and W will be endplayed|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: this works too|pg||

pc|c4|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: go smoke|pg||
nt|andyv:  or can be 12-14 with 5@s and 5-3-3-2 dist.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: I'd prefer that you stay and play the dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H is pass or correct,  a bit rambuncious maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since 1@S only promises 4 -- Drury promises 4   and Rubin hides his canape suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c is art. GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not by passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, just drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad trying to get director to turn dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1NT was ok, but should have bid 3@D then, meaning inv with @Ds, which he had|pg||
nt|psyck: I like that better Daniel|pg||
nt|peachy: Oft'repeated little sayiong , attributed to (I think) Jan Martel:  Operator is like a loongtailed cat in a small room full of rocking chairs.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Normal but unfortunate lead.|pg||
nt|joest: Rusinow leads for N-S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  this shouldn't take too long|pg||
nt|andyv:  Steve should cash the A of @c and then lead 2nd @d|pg||
nt|joest: since they play 'normal' signals, weinstein might have overtaken there to prevent an accident|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may decide to play low @d and get @c back|pg||
nt|psyck: there won't be any problems defending this one looking at that dummy anyway|pg||
nt|joest: even if garner leads a spade they can't get everything untangled|pg||
nt|joest: only a trump switch would cost|pg||
nt|joest: this is one of those situation where when I am north and partner huddles forever I ask myself "Should I have overtaken?"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@d after 1NT is would you would bid with x/xx/QJ10xxxx/Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: this hand will not pose a great challenge|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: ok   andy and i have both used our screw up quota    we'll be fine from now on|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sol weinstein sits in.  simson: this one isn't going to take much time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: how did you know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not done yet, Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson, laughing: I just hoped it wouldn't!|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard enough trying to remember their systems and what position they are!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director asked ekeblad where he was going, ekeblad: to change my flight home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson still hasn't turned trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow defender throughout this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: unfamiliarity with EW methods and difficulty drawing inferences may contribute|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play udca carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and on cue: if you only had 4@s, what kind of shape could you have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: any longer suit|pg||
nt|joest: uh oh|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|psyck: but donno if I would do it at the table, normal to be worried of misfits & only nv game, also poor @d suit|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gulyas: S could make 6@D here again:) as long as no @S was lead either, ofc:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  however if they show AK combo, then first trick is a count request card|pg||
nt|pelu: agree that N sh take @DK + A and play @C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: sure made me eat my words|pg||
nt|jpes: dcl got a little help with the lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kareno: Only a trick high :)  With the diamond break.|pg||
nt|kareno: Garner expected more values from his adversely vulnerable partner.|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you have to resist using those weapons :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: defensive moral: when you know what is right, take control and do it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfd: :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: board 63 the 2 spades was suppose to be weak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge 2@S West    will EW even get into this auction?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Debbie|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mikam1: Close takeout double by East?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mikam1: Should say, "light"|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mikam1: Surprising auction for Rubin so far|pg||
nt|pelu: Rubin has va nice distribution for TO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder if Eke accounts for Wooldridge-Hurd absolutely making takeout DBL over 1@D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: i play double here is 4 cards in @s and 2@s is 5+|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder if I'd double first or bid 2@S directly|pg||
nt|glen: agreed Hedy|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Ronnie will sure compete to 2@S...but will he bid 3 if south raises clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ekeblad didnt find a double card over 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and some would say  Ekeblad's PASS denies 4@S|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|mikam1: I don't think it denies 4 spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: the reason for not doubling 2@c is that he cannot double 2@d|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: now !|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with a light X - sometimes u dont dare to make trhe normal call|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|c8|pg||

nt|pelu: or @S from start|pg||
nt|glen: agreed Peter, why cash @D ace|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mikam1: This may be down 1 in the end now|pg||
nt|mikam1: 4@C was probably wrong by North...but he will now survive|pg||
nt|mikam1: Void in partner's suit and only 4 trumps...a bit too aggressive|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|cK|nt|mikam1: I'm fairly certain (not double dummy I hope) that Russ's defense was wrong...a trump instead of the second spade seemed clearly indicated|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps it was even reasonable to lead a trump on the go|pg||
nt|glen: E needs to be careful|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Ekeblad is muttering|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: and just outside the door are some children screaming|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Bathurst has his head in his hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin is looking at the ceiling|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Private messages are appreciated, but please understand that commentators may not have time to respond to all of them. No offence intended|pg||
nt|gulyas: some say that 3@D would not have been invitational - but then what do u bid in 2/1? 2nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: pitch in the wrong hand :(|pg||
nt|peachy: If you'd like to watch both tables at the same time, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|peachy: Wooldridge has had an absolutely spectacular year|pg||
nt|peachy: and the the rest are no duffers|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|d|nt|andyv:  there will a lot of those before this match is over...both teams are very aggressive|pg||
nt|robinswr: in the open room north bid 4spades after raise|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d = 4+  typically unbalanced|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  ok, super safe I guess:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: "all 19 people watching appreciated that"|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's because Walter isn't up here watching:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if u r weak and pd rebids his suit, with a bad hand u pass|pg||
nt|passell: the spade response will give away the show  make 4spades easier|pg||
nt|joest: there are some who don't play double here as penalty.   I don't get that I'm afraid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: EW just tried 6@h a deal too earlyslam |pg||
nt|joest: actually I've played that double =4 and 2@s = 5 with some folks|pg||
nt|psyck: double is commonly used to show 4+@s's here|pg||
nt|jcwla: And a hand with some values.|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like they play that way here too Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it will also make the play in 2@s easier Mike :)|pg||
nt|passell: play dbl is a better hand than 2spades  they must not|pg||
nt|joest: interesting|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: 1C = can be a balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary clubs.|pg||

nt|kareno: Polish style, getting more and more popular.  Thanks :)|pg||
nt|jpes: they put away a multi world champion away in 120 bds|pg||
nt|passell: looks like 3 is all they can make with the diamond position|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  re|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: network burped again.  overloaded with 8 consoles running|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|robinswr: one has to know how high 2spades is forcing to (can you pass 4@s)|pg||
nt|passell: goood non heart ace lead|pg||
nt|passell: great stop by woolridge here|pg||
nt|joest: not everyone would make a takeout double as east|pg||
nt|passell: should easily take 5 spades in his hand 1 ruff in dummy and 2 aces|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  maybe net is talking a smoking break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: leave these out for a minute, just going to think for a little while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: internet is new toy in las vegas|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad thumps the table|pg||
nt|psyck: limit raise or better, foring to 3@h only for me|pg||
nt|robinswr: forcing passes is a compicated subject|pg||
nt|peachy: Sometimes overloading the 1C opener can be a disadvantage, preempts make it really uncomfortable|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  9 tricks pretty easy dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: breaking simson's trance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: different rooms dropped  out this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should have no trouble setting up 2 tricks in @d and @c and should make OT|pg||
nt|kareno: Plenty high enough.  Wonder what 1@s was - diamonds?|pg||
nt|kareno: Usually diamonds, I'm told, thanks to a spec.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfd: did not see rubins spots|pg||
nt|pelu: with @cJ in W 3Nt and 4@H almost same chance|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe one more in the wash if he gets a @h or something|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|joest: lall needs the heart king as an entry to diamonds |pg||
pc|sT|nt|passell: now up to 9 tricks with the dia ruffing out|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: They are probably too high already|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: he may be playing to not set up @d now, disc 1@s on @c & ruff one|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 3@c is puppet and 3N is 5@h (flip flopping with 3@h to show no 4 or 5 card major)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would think it is not over 4@S, but someone should double this...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: Rubin has problems in 4@H (Board 3) :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@h seems about the limit here.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: then he needs to guess both maj finesses right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d then was xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|joest: weinstein led 5th best so the odds favored Jx or 10x with Garner|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: Very creative lead by Lall, wanting to lead through dummy's strength.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: 4 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts|pg||
nt|joest: so guess theheart|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk5: The winner (on Tuesday) will be USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Martel-Stansby, Levin-Weinstein)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Specs were calling for a low @c.|pg||
nt|passell: yes  percentage play  he didnt think north had ak of hearts|pg||
nt|joest: so now we're back to 110.  Precision bidding|pg||
nt|joest: right + north opened the bidding|pg||
mc|8|nt|andyv:  and went counter to Crane rule...and it worked!|pg||
nt|joest: is one way to make it is what I was going to say :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam only cost 3imp - Rubin didnt find the winning line in 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was Lall's main hope on that hand|pg||
nt|joest: that's a break for Bathurst|pg||
nt|joest: clearing diamonds while you have the spade king protected looks sorta straightforwarfd|pg||
nt|andyv:  here he just needs to play A@h and K@h and then, after pitching 2 spades, it's a matter of making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff a @D now and he can claim with @hs 3-2|pg||
nt|joest: sorry I'm busy playing 3NT!|pg||
nt|andyv:  did you make it?|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: i just claimed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: did u make it ?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|pelu: slow - again -new smart keyboard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, everyone, ruff a @d first|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  2N asks and is GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  precision 1@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 1D, 1+ and 11-15 or so|pg||

nt|robinswr: partnership decides whether you open 1@h or 2@h I would open 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Actually, 2+ diamonds according to their card|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: It has enough Zar Count to open 1@h, if you play that way :)|pg||
nt|joest: no way|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|joest: Garner had to raise to 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad/simson whispering again.  quiet and hard to overhear.  contrast with johnson|pg||
nt|joest: Howie on firmer groundhere.|pg||

nt|joest: here comes the 2@h pref?|pg||
nt|joest: Justin doesn't know Grue rescued into a three card suit!|pg||
nt|andyv:  Joe will have to stop running sometime|pg||
nt|joest: Of course Joe is known as being quite 'creative' so from Justin's POV, anything can be going on|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: we might play it here |pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: 1st seat vul & farly balanced hand, my preferance would be for 2@h though, even though i play light in some pdships|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky duplication in @Ss|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: and realistically partner won't rescue himself to the two level on a four card suit -- or at least he shouldn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: no chance in 3nt, 5@D would have some play|pg||
nt|psyck: other table play some 2 suiter 2 level openings, so could not open that hand 1 or 2 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: only good thing here is they will know it will be a push hand with other table failing in game too|pg||
nt|sybarra: or here |pg||
nt|sybarra: is 4 @H makeable?   |pg||
nt|sybarra: terrible lead problem for E |pg||
nt|peachy: lots of work, abd I think too much, so no|pg||
nt|kareno: Depends the lead and the defense.  With diamond lead, I think yes.  Ruff diamond, ruff club, two rounds of hearts, then clubs.  West must follow and spades go away.|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs saying spade lead,  but I dont see the kjx hand leading a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: on the get go |pg||
nt|kareno: Highly unlikely lead IMO|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt 14-16 in 1st and 2nd.|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they incorporate more nt ranges than normal into 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: operator can you check to be sure Garner pased|pg||
nt|passell: dont believe he passed|pg||
nt|joest: he knows they have 29HCP or so.  I doubt this|pg||
nt|psyck: if it was 22-23, as N has, surely strange pass|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  they should stop in 6 although an accident will get them a lucky result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing  3@S=cue   3N=serious slam interest|pg||
nt|joest: this will have a steep price tag|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: 4@S = RKC|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad has to lean forward to hear simson.  here in the crows nest I have no chance to eavesdrop|pg||
nt|sybarra: if so perhaps we ask where the mirrors are |pg||

nt|jpes: its interesting how hard they work on part score hands|pg||
nt|joest: no it's 23-24|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  at least @s suit is sitting right as is @c Q|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ = better @Hs than @s|pg||
nt|joest: on board 4 north-south did cash out effectively against 4@s unlike here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|robinswr: very slow here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jpes: the Q@D to make S worry|pg||
nt|santyclz: Kaplan was an early advocate of fighting for part scores at imps.|pg||
nt|peachy: The "nickels and dimes" do add up|pg||
nt|peachy: in a 120 board match|pg||
nt|santyclz: In one of the segments in the quarters, after 6 bds Bathurst had picked up 25 partscore imps from Nickell.|pg||
nt|peachy: I hope this is not an impending crash. The operators have had to suffer enough of those already|pg||
nt|jpes: garner is trying to see what he can do with J87@D in Wooldridge hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: who's on lead? ok, tell me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Exclusion not really needed if 3@S promised @SAce|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: basically he was cuebidding after I chose.  he showed 0 or 3 keycards and no queen of trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asking simson as the auction proceeded, rubin just waited for the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: I showed @h and I liked my hand for slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be much faster to play than 7@h where restricted choice would come into play|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: and he's leading a minor again!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sassed rubin about the @c lead last time|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein knows declarer has at least two spades.  partner would not sit 1@d with five of them|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will have to lead 10@h at some point|pg||
nt|pelu: low-high in @S from S = even No|pg||
nt|pelu: prob @C10 now|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should be able to figure out that S started with 4@s and 5@d so his other dist. should be 2-2|pg||
nt|joest: no|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Wolfson was closing the gap - this will work against them IMO|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: this group has dished a lot of sass the last 2 days|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: yes there was always the chance partner might atually get a ruff if Joe had four hearts like most peole!|pg||
nt|joest: *people|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kareno: Yes, folks, he surely could have bid 4@h en route to 5@c.|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other semifinal match, , Welland has not been able to start closing the gap|pg||
nt|sybarra: greek bearing gift with that lead |pg||
nt|peachy: I am sure this is not a looming computer crash, Garner thinking|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: auction wrong|pg||

mc|11|nt|joest: garner will overtake with the queen to cash the @d|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: 8 to go here, not over yet|pg||
nt|gulyas: 11 to Bathurst and they are in the lead!|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps they play some kind of serious-non serious 3NT -- always dangerous if not 100% clear when 3NT might be natural|pg||

nt|joest: did we just miss board 67?|pg||

nt|joest: boring hand anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thru 112  Diamond leads Deutsch by 45|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no updates about Welland-Jacobs :(|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, didn't miss much.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh    should have looked at hands  not just the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: when I enter multiple passes sometimes they don't all go through|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D from Johnson in 3rd seat is standard operating procedure|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rubin re: X "I don't know, it's in the notes somewhere"|pg||
nt|robinswr: and when they lead the jack of diamonds you should play the 9 (from 109 doubleton)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough call, you know if you x your pd is going to bid @Hs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I hope for NS that 3@H now is forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s cannot make.  diamonds loses only 3 tricks so cheap at any level.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: well, ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@d now|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess they paly negative free bids|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d there would have been a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: true, gives a losing option|pg||
nt|jpes: lall must have known Grue was broke to go so quietly|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|psyck: but dec may have had a count of Souths hand there|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead worth another trick.|pg||
nt|joest: 4@c double on 65 went down 1 vs the 110 hre so that was a push|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|joest: this isn't right either b/c the 1NT range is 14-16 but I believe 2@s is the final contract|pg||
nt|joest: hi kit|pg||

nt|psyck: 1@c-1@s-1N-2@h-2@s maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: not sure of auctions, but did raise to 3nt on 66|pg||

nt|joest: Garner did something 'flexible' :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is what u get for opening the S hand|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s does make on heart finesse.|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will have difficulty leading a @H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: If S - as here - has to X its diff to find a 5-3 fir in @h|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards sit well for declarer|pg||

pc|c8|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: I didn't know how to bid it.  I didn't care how you took the X|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: had you covered, put it that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a chance Rubin will finesse twice in @H???|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "probably should be responsive"|pg||
nt|kareno: Hafta underlead the spade :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: He was hoping Weinstein would have a 3NT call I think -- which he would pass|pg||
nt|passell: 1c 1sp 2nt|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: as usual, simson asks again to leave trick 1 up for a second.  maybe I should only report when he doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers atop the played trick once it's turned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is good practice    and  automatic pause in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: you want to go smoke?  russ: may as well, never did finish the last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: you're an enabler!|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: I have another partner in mind, once I get rid of him... [rubin and johnson break up laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson sighs.  less inclined to banter than the other three at this table|pg||
nt|andyv:  at the rate of this match, by board 115 we will have all the other vugraph viewers because those matches will be over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we going fast enough to have a rate?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin rocks side to side. turns his head suddenly toward the bidbox|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy |pg||
pc|d6|nt|robinswr: the problem with opening the south hand is that you have no good rebid over 1@s|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D opening here is   semi- balanced or unbalanced hands with primary diamonds or 4-5 in the minors. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: 1NT is ok if allowed by sys|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: did not see which picture card he played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very good chance he'll score both either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: "well... let's start with the ... " [reaches for @HJ]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson counts something out with his fingers, talking to himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem will be if Simson shows @CA   |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns and peeks at the card|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: so now I have it right|pg||
nt|passell: looks like he will take a lot of thricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: that's also quite possible kit|pg||
nt|robinswr: I open very light but because of the rebid problem I would not open this|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs requires two cards onside.  hearts requires ace onside BUT also ten to fall.  I'd need a computer for that one.|pg||
nt|kit: should he come back with king of hearts or club ruff?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: actually I think @HQ is better if he can pick that johnson has psyched|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: might be able to "mark" @HK in S hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnson can't have all remaining honors or would have 14-16 NT opener|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  best to continue @d |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: I think this is right -- doesn't want to give opponents a chance to discard a diamond|pg||
nt|psyck: spec suhhests: 1C 1H (spades) 1N (17-19 bal) 2H 2S|pg||
nt|joest: more likely is a 1@c opener and a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|passell: yes he did well|pg||
nt|psyck: their CC says: A 1NT rebid shows 17-19 after 1  1 or 1. |pg||
nt|kit: right -- West does have an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: you are probably right|pg||
nt|passell: yes surely that is correct  we missed the 1 club opener in front of him|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks Mike|pg||
nt|kit: and while North hand is too strong for 1NT opening, the overcall on 18 is reasonable|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: otherwise he was just going to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: right, 15-18 is common range for overcall|pg||
nt|passell: yes too light in points and club spots to dbl and then bid nt|pg||
nt|kit: he is wondering whether he can trust the opponents count signal which means the third diamond will cash|pg||
nt|passell: he can guess to ruff a club come to dia and get another spade enpasse|pg||
nt|passell: after cashing heart |pg||
nt|kit: but safest for 8 tricks is to not try to cash the diamond -- club ruff, heart to ace, club off -- assumingWest diddn't start with 3 clubs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|s7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: great @C underlead by Simson  gave Rubin chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: With a heart ruff before the ruffing finesse slam makes easily.  So this is a profit for e/w|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kareno: This is a profit against game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: was it only 3 down?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes profit for n/s, sorry|pg||

nt|andyv:  E should move after 3N bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rubin bidding 3N over presumed 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 0-4|pg||
nt|passell: yes great to get to 4hearts   almost impossible unless opponents in bidding|pg||
nt|joest: and now a master solvers problem for Weinstein. He will 'punt' with 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: they have 2 7-card major-suit fits -- spades doesn't do as well this time|pg||
nt|joest: no ability to clearly grab it with 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: results are right, bidding may not be|pg||
nt|joest: 4@c is reasonable too|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@D or 4@C maybe|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Russ|pg||
nt|robinswr: some play that 3@c shows a minimum saying nothing about clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: move on, nothing to see here|pg||
nt|psyck: there are tons of variations of Jacoby 2NT played :)|pg||
nt|jpes: hurd has his work cut out - |pg||
nt|passell: yes hate 4clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c could wait|pg||
nt|kit: this will get the heart preference|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kareno: 3@h apparently a singleton heart with three spades and minors.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and nice placement of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: "sounds like doug dodged a bullet on this one" [laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: if you misguess @s on this one I'll be very disappointed|pg||
nt|kit: This is an awkward hand for Garner -- he still hasn't shown the diamond suit and slam interest|pg||
nt|pelu: 13 oop 14-16 but 7@D on|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that convention was named after the late and great Grant Baze|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 4333 opposite a 14-16 pt nt.|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl will be helpful|pg||
nt|kit: then Weinstein might punt again with 4@C|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  should make 7 as S will be quickly squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: "let's see how good they are"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: 2@S would have been juuuuicy|pg||
nt|kit: and the excellent slam is missed.|pg||
nt|joest: on the spade layout yes.  6@d would be nice to reach though|pg||
nt|santyclz: They're not shy.|pg||
nt|jpes: with 3 @C tricks it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, it looks like it|pg||
nt|peachy: The red color increases the boldness of even putzes like me at IMPs :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Also with no spots, 8 cards 6 and below.  |pg||
nt|joest: Barcelona, Paris, Normandy, Avignon|pg||
nt|jpes: weinstein's @D signal will be a little late|pg||
nt|joest: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can i go too|pg||
nt|joest: i'm looking forward to it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: great trip, enjoy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i live here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if it's making despite all our (my) complaining.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hope they do it quicker|pg||
nt|joest: is 4@c support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: or even 3@S, but 4@C looks more accurate|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades looks like a make also|pg||
nt|kit: And with KJ doubleton, I think Garner will pick 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c not cue i think after delayed @h preferance|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: defense against 2@SX = 1100 or 1400|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
nt|psyck: so, just an optional playing strain|pg||
nt|joest: hey i'm just asking.  I confess I'm not sure.|pg||
nt|psyck: so far , so good|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C certainly not Q -- they don't have a trump suit yet|pg||
nt|joest: WEinstein seems out of bids by now it seems to me|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|kit: However, he may think 4@H is a Q.  I don't think it should be|pg||
nt|joest: after a 3@h pref?|pg||
nt|joest: I think this is a great auction : provided it now goes pass :)|pg||
nt|kit: My belief is that 4 of a previously bid major is always an offer to play unless that is just plain impossible|pg||
nt|passell: I agree Kit|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they  have done well so far, but they may still feel some of the bids are ambiguous|pg||
nt|joest: ditto|pg||
nt|passell: especially the second time he bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Might not always be perfect, but avoids a lot of possible mixups|pg||
nt|joest: then in the bar we can argue over what is "just plain impossible"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: you need to frame a question if you expect a reply :)|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, private|pg||
nt|kit: I think they know what the bids mean -- Weinstein is just thinking about slam in clubs|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|robinswr: but simple Jacoby plays that 3@c shows short spades|pg||
nt|santyclz: You could try tapping your foot...|pg||
mb|5H|nt|passell: unlikely slam knows off dia and heart |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: getting higher|pg||
nt|joest: Howie can see there will be problems with the expected diamondlead.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|andyv:  if they pull 4 rounds of trump, N might only get his 3 spades|pg||
nt|robinswr: short clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: 4+4+2+2|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a 1 imp gain for Aker|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: this is a good slam if the club queen were onside|pg||
nt|kit: wonder what 4NT was.  I guess Garner thought it RKC for hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|passell: cold if he guesses clubs|pg||
nt|joest: the good news is that 5@c was probably down as well|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h was that magic moment|pg||
nt|passell: he well might |pg||
nt|jcwla: Very well might.|pg||
nt|kit: the queen of clubs is onside-- if you are gib, that is|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if the @d length known may make him get it right|pg||
nt|joest: GIB is a great player|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's always on some side|pg||
nt|passell: slightly anti percentage but dia length might help|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|kit: I don't know what he had available.  Would not 3@C have been a transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is tough to reach 6@d when no one bids @ds|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|joest: he has to cross twice in spades to make the 'big' club play|pg||
nt|joest: and will be fortunate to find long clubs with long spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  was S afraid the @h stopper was the K@h and anything he bid would wrong side it?|pg||
nt|psyck: playing rubensohl/rumpelsohl, he could bid 3@c xfr to @d & then bid 3@s|pg||
nt|joest: well there is a complication there too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|joest: 3@c is invitational or better.  What if partner crosses you up by 'accepting' with 3NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: opposite short clubs and an unlimited hand east has a fair hand long clubs is good opposite a singleton|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|passell: 5 -1 spades is never fortunate|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|kit: since playing West for queen of clubs loses opportunity to pick up stiff queen, I see no reasonto do that|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|joest: all double dummy.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|passell: might play 3nt at other table for a push|pg||
nt|kit: Well, if they are to play in clubs then 6@C is better contract than 5@C, as it is potential 4 or 6 hand|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  many possible shapes  |pg||
nt|joest: Lall opens his flat ten count vulnerable before Garner can open his flat eleven count vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, would have been interesting of @ck value was in @d|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you should go out of your  way to compete against 1nt|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they would have bwooded into 5@S and made that|pg||
nt|psyck: right|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Which is why I think it is bad to play 3@C transfer invite or better -- partner can't cross you up if 3@D is forced|pg||
nt|joest: he is entitled to accept with a max|pg||
nt|passell: probably going 3 down in 3nt unless inspired guess in clubs at other table|pg||
nt|joest: options are: 1) transfer to spades; 2) use Garbage stayman but risk rotting in 2@h or 3) Stayman and then 2@s which is game invitational|pg||
nt|passell: like the 3rd option|pg||
nt|joest: opposite 14-16?|pg||
nt|passell: gets both majors in and values|pg||
nt|kit: Wooldridge perhaps doesn't have a good way to enter with this shape -- or just chooses not to.|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein mulling over which one of the three doors to open :)|pg||
nt|kit: How do they play 2@C, then 2@S Jack?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  including 5 card @s suit|pg||
nt|psyck: he may have chosen to to at the vul even if he had a minor/major bids available|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: will you let her type, Karen ?|pg||
nt|passell: can beat 4spades with dia lead then under lead in clubs for ruff|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: constructive; GI  Partner has rights over 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you have another chance|pg||
nt|pelu: but when S has AKQJ he could be almost sure on 3@D by pd|pg||
nt|kit: With an invite, I just make an old-fashioned game try -- bid game and try to make it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Her spelling is not as good as her analysis :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@d transfer 1@h 2 or 3 with a weak nt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: "he's reaching for cards - he bid"|pg||

nt|psyck: Looks like the connections will be a recurring problem today|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably heard your comments re great bridge |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: there is a lot to be said for that kit.  And it solves the problem we are discussing in some transfer lebensohl methods|pg||

pc|cK|nt|andyv:  spades play well for N|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: nothing in this room is hot|pg||
pc|c7|nt|robinswr: a simple way to bid over 2@s is to play 2NT forces 3@c. for other bids assume partner opened 2NT(15-17) and respond as you would to partner 's 2NT opening |pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@c stayman, 3@D transfer|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|kareno: She noted the diamond king onside but suggested they not bid any grand slam on a finesse.|pg||

nt|kareno: This sounds like a forcing club auction with relays.  I'd think 3@s may have been a relay.  Susan?  Any clarification?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: notwithstanding their 26 or 27 hcps |pg||

pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||

pc|s6|nt|kit: right.  They will be quite happy with +100 here -- on their own, they surely would have gotten to 3NT down.|pg||
nt|joest: they stopped in 3@h on board 8 so another small pickup for wolfson|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: hello again all|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: win some - lose some|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, not being able to cater for single @cQ with E reduces odds of reverse @c fin|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|santyclz: Win 10, lose 5 is a good long-term strategy.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  getting to 4@s should be no problem|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c is a multi raise|pg||
nt|joest: anything from a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hi again hope it doesn't happen much today|pg||
nt|joest: up to a balanced three card game force|pg||
nt|joest: it excludes a "jacoby2NT' type hand|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will presumably bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: np Susan, at least we got back immediately|pg||
nt|joest: and garner will 'accept the transfer' to 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe he will find something imaginative|pg||
nt|kit: Which Grue will double I guess -- and then ?|pg||
nt|joest: he is rummaging through his imagination right now|pg||

mb|1N|nt|psyck: a hand where NS should not let 5 level belong to the opps|pg||
nt|joest: 'walking the dog' as they say|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the answer is.....3@h:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 1N used to be semi-force  but yesterday operator alerted as Forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said semi|pg||
nt|andyv:  they have it marked as semi forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: with the transfer to opps known suit generally acting as a stayman substitute|pg||
nt|jpes: look at the score|pg||
nt|kit: With his strong spade holding, Hurd forgets about a possible 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|joest: i like 1NT frankly even though it might not work wellhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: John wasn't operator yesterday :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s info |pg||
nt|passell: may cause a dbl part score swing however|pg||
nt|kit: he can back in with 2@H okay|pg||
nt|joest: but Howie may boost to 3@c first|pg||
nt|kit: or double if takeout|pg||
nt|passell: unless north bids 3clubs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: yep   i was very surprised yesterday|pg||
nt|peachy: Polish style 1C, natural, or bal 11-14 or bal 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: N-S should not be bidding to 5@S -- goes for 300, while 5@H might not be making -- it is on diamond guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may be a mistake to bid the E hand slowly if NS can get their @c suit in|pg||
nt|peachy: let me clarify on the club, kib says it is not polish style.. This is what it "is" : balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: somewhat symmetric -- both contract have 4 top losers, both off queen of trumps, and both pick up the queen|pg||
nt|joest: West wants to reopen with double|pg||
nt|passell: likely wants to bid 3dia  not suspecting 4 hearts from partner|pg||
nt|kit: prefer double to 3@D (assuming it is takeout) -- keeps more options open|pg||
nt|passell: agreed  but a little disaster prone without discussion|pg||
nt|joest: it is amazing how people bid on less and less yet more and more doubles are takeout :)|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe West should have made his takeout double at the 2-level?|pg||
nt|joest: not sure a double of 2@c sounds takeout to me Kit, after partner bids 1NT announcing their spades|pg||
nt|passell: I prefer neg dbl with the east hand  then if partner bids 2clubs can bid 2nt|pg||
nt|kit: depends on agreements, that's all.  I would bet they would play it as takeout|pg||
nt|joest: that would made this a much easier hand Mike|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: Which declarer will get right when finding South has stiff heart|pg||
nt|peachy: With the current proliferation of light opening style (11, and many 10 pointers even if balanced/ish) and then light responding style, one can easily get robbed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, everyone opens |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2N probably showed solid @s suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 2NT 6 good spades and a maximum|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks and johnson confirms semiforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias peeks in, won't be pleased|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final posted   Welland beat Jacobs  by 46|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @c and @h loser, Doug will have to worry about losing 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: someone outside whoops, probably just confirmed that they won|pg||
nt|sybarra: Weinstein trying to get out |pg||
nt|joest: *make|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agree -- this is also a very nice hand with texture so tip top anyway.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c may have shown hearts in their transfer style.|pg||
nt|jpes: defense is so much more difficult than declarer play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everyone opens, everyone overcalls, nobody x's for penalty.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's a different game|pg||
nt|passell: would bid 1nt with a little worse hand with those holdings|pg||
nt|kit: problem with that Mike is that if partner has a balanced 12/13 count, 2NT could just be too high|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  taking the money|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: wd by N|pg||
nt|joest: well judged by everybody|pg||
nt|kit: The slow approach worked, talking Weinstein into doubling|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry that was e/w |pg||
pc|s7|nt|kareno: Okay, now we know that 2@c showed hearts - transfer bypassing their diamond suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: they are in 2 h by n, losing the play|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest: Wooldridge saved a part score swing there|pg||
nt|kit: this could be interesting if defense takes 4 black winners and then spade and ruff with 7 of diamonds|pg||
nt|passell: been too high before  the real trouble is missing game when partner has a decent 14 or 15 and a stiff spade|pg||
pc|sK|nt|robinswr: hurd has to play this carefully since spades are 4-2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck: i would not have expected them to get to 5 w/o knowing their side @c fit against an NV game|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, mis-saw auction|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jpes: those @D have to get set up|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  dbl hook in @ds is one line|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein went right|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|passell: the opponents also rarely lead my hearts even though it could be the weakness|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|gosia: should have playd a heart earlier|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: strange|pg||
nt|gulyas: making 4 now|pg||
nt|psyck: too bad we do not get to see his line after a @h or @c continuation|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|peachy: much of the time, set up sidetricks before the trumps are all gone|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, kit, or somebody who sees faster than I, what was the justification for this line|pg||
nt|jpes: i think declarer has erred|pg||
nt|kit: here we go -- the uppercut is coming|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  A@d and @d is 2nd but still have to guess what @d to put in when W ducks|pg||
nt|gosia: now clubs will put pressure on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: % play with all the spots is push Q push T|pg||
nt|joest: Chris Willenken points out that fouru black winners + another spade ruffed with the @D7 makes declarer guess the diamond her|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: and there we are|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems a bit better than 75%|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says: played for Hx of Diamonds onside, with the Heart length, rathen than 3-3 diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: And now the guess|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|peachy: Other suggestions: Human error.          Opps too much I give up.        |pg||
pc|d5|nt|passell: he will get this right |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: South has presumably 6 clubs and 2 spades|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: He needs queen of hearts on|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|andyv:  so dbl hook it is and a push board|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein could be 5=3=2=3 or 5=2=3=3|pg||
nt|passell: no one would lead third spade with 2 small diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: So give South 3 hearts-- ergo 2dimonds|pg||
nt|passell: maybe|pg||
nt|kit: why not?  Might need to kill spade discard.  Declarer could just be off third round heart trick|pg||
nt|passell: true|pg||
nt|joest: east-west in a comfortable 2@h next door |pg||
nt|passell: lose 3 or 7 depending on guess|pg||

nt|sybarra: hopefully we are not crashing|pg||
nt|kareno: sigh we had too much of that earlier.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: Weinstein opened 1@D which guarantees unbal hand|pg||
nt|kit: This may be a difficult slam to avoid -- big spade duplication|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have long trumps tap declarer|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = majors, much to Garner's surprise|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Welland, with no vugraph operators to slow them down, finished ahead of everyone...well done.|pg||
nt|andyv:  which is fine as long as you don't lose by 3|pg||
nt|psyck: 10-15, 2+@d's|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gosia: 2 @d ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D inverted raise even in comp|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural?|pg||
nt|andyv:  must be in wrong room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said natural, forcing. forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@d will make this match a lot closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 1-round force  but Johnson might not pass for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson puts his cards back in his shirt pocket|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: will see if he needs them again as the auction progresses|pg||
nt|joest: no where to park that little club in the east hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very similar start in other room  except Garner in South bid 2@C |pg||
nt|gosia: this is the time to bid 7 on a finesse for sure|pg||

nt|robinswr: undo|pg||

nt|andyv:  wonder if 4@c is keycard now|pg||

nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: so 4@C just a cue|pg||

nt|jpes: 60 bds a day is taking a toll|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: of course he will|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sighs and sets down his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if it was obvious he might have done so by now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is he worried that trump is @S???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing k@s may stop them from 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not on same wavelength re: 4@H may keep them out of 6@D|pg||
nt|gosia: diamonds is trump- afraid to show 1D q with only 9 HCP :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson burying his face in his hand again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if he doesn't, S will still bid 5N (or whatever their K asking sequence is) after response of 2 key cards|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@s on 2@s better|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: when they ask for Kings  it is  , not specific Kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he did deny Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks, simson says "this is blackwood" louder than his usual voice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: "who asked you to talk out loud?" and calls director|pg||
nt|andyv:  did he show 2 controls?|pg||
nt|chip: If 4H was RKC, surprised he didn't show the Q.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hesitation and S's comments could be a problem here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias: you lose most of your rights, have to point out hesitations from the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|andyv:  re re|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: do u often have bad internet-conections?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: i think this asks   of kings  and 5@S=none|pg||
nt|psyck: difficult to stop below slam now|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H presumably natural, slammish, and a few Q-bids after that|pg||
nt|psyck: S clearly expected 3@s to have more goodies|pg||
nt|robinswr: jump to 4spade is no aces no kings no singletons or voids, good desciption|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: sorry about the net problems|pg||
nt|joest: 3@s doesn't look like a  Q and was alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may just play here|pg||
nt|kit: Pass of the double probably denies club control, and redouble says he has a club control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hope i'm getting this right|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N was serious if 3@s showed @h fit|pg||

nt|mikam1: If Ekeblad guesses here he makes for sure|pg||
nt|pelu: also 4@h in CR - @S lead and 2x@h from top |pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a layout where @H floated to south  loses?|pg||
nt|hedyg: to finesse or not to finesse..|pg||
nt|mikam1: If it loses and a spade comes back...|pg||
nt|mikam1: you're down|pg||
nt|mikam1: Seems like restricted choice - except that South could drop an honor from QJx|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Ekeblad has his hands in his coat pocket|pg||
nt|mikam1: Note that south could have gone up with the diamond ace if he knew declarer's shape|pg||

nt|ahollan1: another 0+@D|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can have 4+@D and longer @S or @C, but not @H|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|mikam1: quite a light overcall|pg||
nt|mikam1: short diamonds, but not much else to recommed it|pg||
nt|hedyg: found the jackpot in pds hand!|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D has 5) on the CC - 3x 4+@D, 1x +2 and only the 3 suited can be o-1 - |pg||
nt|mikam1: Bathurst just has to bid game here, no?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has seen his pd's overcalls before|pg||
nt|mikam1: Even with the "wasted" diamond queen|pg||
nt|glen: 2@D then 3@H not-forcing but shows considerable values|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mikam1: nope|pg||
nt|glen: especially if had other raises (2NT etc.) available|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: well judged|pg||
nt|hedyg: fantastic stop!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: wold u bid 1@H in S?? - not for me|pg||
nt|mikam1: Even with the diamond queen wasted, I would have gotten myself too high|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would pass quickly|pg||
nt|mikam1: I would not overcall either|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|glen: i'm a steve robinson fan - get your majors in|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h6|nt|pelu: so u would bid 1@S, Glen :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: I suppose Kevin was right...partner could have Kx AQJxx xx Jxxx or somesuch and game would be terrible|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: Garner went slightly overboard there with the 4@d bid where 3@d would have been enough|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mikam1: So Bathurst will pick up their first real swing of the set|pg||
nt|hedyg: Glen i doubt Steve would have bid 1@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that may be the point   of robinson, glen and followers   danger of trying to catch up  greater than  slowing down later ???|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: director: you're ten minutes into overtime, simson: maybe there'll be a tie|pg||
nt|andyv:  14-16 NT for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, hopefully we are caught up here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we are back |pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome back, all. Susan will have us updated in no time|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|andyv:  except in 4th seat (15-17)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias: anyone want one last cup of coffee?  ekeblad claims it|pg||
nt|jcwla: This segment just what the doctor ordered for Wolfson.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck: 2@s was invitatinoal in that sequence|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: except 3rd vul and 4th seat|pg||
nt|robinswr: both majors|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: Garner has a pretty good hand here off this auction|pg||
nt|kit: always good when opponents don't score any imps|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some might open 1@D here with prepared 2@C rebid.|pg||
nt|passell: looks like they are making the last hand in the other room   played from other side with club lead|pg||
nt|passell: cashed a heart sneaked a diamond to hand  now restricked choice  4h 4dia 2 aces|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe 3@D|pg||
nt|kit: Simple 3@H for me -- why complicate the issue?|pg||
nt|joest: I'm guessing a straightforward 3@h or a bold 4@h|pg||
mb|4D|nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|passell: I like 4dia |pg||
nt|joest: I didn't think of it! :)|pg||
nt|kit: this is just an overbid IMO.  If partner rejects 3@H invite,game won't be good|pg||
nt|passell: compromise between 3dia and 4hearts  gets to game in best fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely we will be catching up now |pg||
nt|kit: best fit isn't important -- hearts has to be adequate|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: that was a screeching halt.  ekeblad asks johnson's range, simson: what seat was he in? then 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with 17 hcp, Russ has nowhere to go.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Can beat it 3 with that lead.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|passell: yes 3 diamonds and trust partner|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: had a chance in OR - played by W and @D-lead - to Q and a @h on @DA, but wrong guess in @C|pg||
nt|psyck: 55 is sure tempting to enter, though vul & suits not great|pg||
nt|robinswr: its clear to enter with 55 also clear if 5431|pg||
nt|joest: well kit you seem to have hit the nail on the head on this hand|pg||
nt|passell: if partners dia Q were somewhere else game would have been good and it would have been missed going low|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: defense can now take the first 4 trick|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Susan u had a hard time - hope for better connection in next segment|pg||
nt|psyck: lots of interesting & swingy deals, hopefully several more of such to come|pg||
nt|gulyas: good bid I think, and a partscore swing|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: important to remember that partner also knows they pay that vul game bonus -- if he rejects the invite -- ugh|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: operator job is hard enough without computer glitches|pg||
nt|sybarra: you bet|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: 3 more to Wolfson for that third undertrick on board 73|pg||
nt|passell: a missed chance for wolfson on last hand as ekeblad didnt take restricted choice play in hearts went 2 down  |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you hope that the opponents have 10 points in that suit and that the ten points would only take one trick|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
mc|9|nt|jcwla: I'm sticking with 3@D - involves pd in both decisions, second choice 3@H, then 4@D (level more imp to solicit pd's input than strain), 4@H last of all.|pg||

nt|hedyg: last board of this set now|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: our thanks to our operator Debbie Hyatt! well done!to my excellent fellow commentators Peter Lund, Glen Ashton, Al Hollander and Mike Kamil for generously donating their time and ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: sharing their wisdom with us!and last to the USBF(Joan Gerard)for bringing this event to BBO, especially to Jan Martel who is instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S!|nt|hedyg: thanks specs for joining us , we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|mikam1: Turns out 1@D opener would have made life easier for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: session scores and results at: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: just confirmed from the source    Steve Robinson DOES overcall 1@H on previous board|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: lol ok|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now he had to sell|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||

mc|7|nt|mikam1: Woolridge made a good deceptive shot at the other table...won the trump return and led heart queen out of hand at trick 3|pg||

nt|andyv:  this is the last board of the first set... a lot of action still left as they play 120 boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a short break after this hand (as I recall)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all - this is the last one :)|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why he didn't take the percentage play in 4@H|pg||
nt|jcwla: Last board of the segment here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: this is the last, a small break and back in 10 or 20 minutes|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: are there 13 imps to be had here?|pg||
nt|joest: 1@C = 2+|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  1@c=2+|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = inverted|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+   too numerous to describe|pg||
nt|kit: is 1NTneg double for minors?|pg||
nt|joest: no it's natural.  stoppers be damned!  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: Aker put up great battle|pg||
nt|andyv:  there are always 13 imps to be had somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but this hand doesn't bode well for the Aker team|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h  ART game force|pg||
nt|passell: meckwell style  they also dont promise stoppers  just points|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT here means what?|pg||
nt|joest: to play it would seem like|pg||
nt|kit: Simple 2@D call looks right to me.  Why not?|pg||
nt|joest: Garner could have five diamonds here|pg||
nt|passell: means I misbid the 1st time|pg||
nt|joest: all balanced hands open 1@c|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would make a neg X missing a @H.  |pg||
nt|passell: yes  I like neg dbl  extra values make up for missing heart|pg||
nt|kit: so, is double takeout (after having shown spade strength)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = good @H raise   2@H would be weaker|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to be much weaker although the @h honors are nice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren started with 1N  so that auction began 1 level higher|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner already at 4@C and auction not over|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad said 2@S showed 4, rubin is less sure "I believe a double would show 3, but since I showed 5..."|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3rd session starts at 4:45 Pacific daylight time|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3:45|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: final contract   4@S West|pg||
nt|andyv:  relay now|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT = an initial balanced GF|pg||
nt|joest: both major stopped|pg||
nt|joest: a bad hand for the n-s system|pg||
nt|kit: When you have over half the deck, 9-card fit, and sell out to 2@S, something is very wrong.|pg||
nt|passell: have to cash a major ace to beat 5 diamonds by south|pg||
nt|joest: on for 130 and selling for 110|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  this one may run out of steam |pg||
nt|psyck: nice for N to know S has a non minimum, they should get to 6@c eaily, hopefully not more|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's at 3:45 pacific time|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: 3@s = shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  always a problem how to evaluate shortness when it's the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: Spade shortness will not exactly excite Weinstein|pg||
nt|pelu: often a problem to show shortness with an A|pg||
nt|joest: true but where can partners extra values be that won't produce some reasonableplay for slam?|pg||
nt|pelu: late - again :(:(|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|psyck: if they play minorwood or kickback, N can easily stop in time after finding only 1 side king after key card response|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 10 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|kit: oh he will certainly get them to slam -- the key is to stay out of the bad grand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  KJ@h?  and 6@c may be wrong sided then|pg||
nt|jcwla: Felt boxed into corner here.  As for 2NT to play on opps' fit auction, more power to you.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gosia: no 13 imps here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Susan, great job.|pg||
nt|passell: probably lose 2 imps  50 to 130|pg||
nt|kit: Is there some reason Weinstein could have bid 2@D Jack?|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to Susan our operator!  and thanks kibs.  Last hand of the set.  Next one starts after about a 20 minute break (I think)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  no, not now for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John  and PLEASE  thank the players for us|pg||
nt|andyv:  great effort by both teams|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d = RKCB|pg||
nt|kit: why wrongsided?  Where would a heart loser go?|pg||
nt|joest: well they invert so to show @ds he would bid 2@h|pg||
nt|joest: but it's not GF so he could have done that|pg||
nt|joest: a lot of it turns on what the respective meanings of double and 2NT would be in his balancing situation|pg||
nt|joest: but it certainly doesn't seem like you should sell.  WE may land in the wrong spot but I would commit an error of commission rather than omission|pg||
nt|passell: yes if 1nt doesnt show a stopper then dbl has to be take out|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  Congratulations to the Wolfson team|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks Al and everyone|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT = two without|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: 4@d kickback|pg||
nt|joest: could ask with 5@h now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: which he will -- he needs both kings to bid the grand|pg||
nt|psyck: 5!k would confirm all key cards & trump Q|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d asks about kings generally|pg||
nt|psyck: *5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you right, scheduled restart in 25 minutes from now|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will see you all then :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: break after this hand|pg||
nt|jpes: good night all - it  is late on the east coast|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks to all commentators, Joe Shair, Kit Woolsey, Jim Pestaner, and to all spectaros who are the sole reason for these shows. Thanks|pg||
nt|jcwla: With the whole hand in the minors this is a time I would have started with 1@D leaving @C to be mentioned in some comp auctions.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all, back in an hour|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming, spectators, you make it all worthwhile!|pg||
nt|peachy: Expecially thanking you for your comments and other messages|pg||
nt|peachy: during the break, standings will be posted here for both matches http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals|pg||
nt|peachy: Sorry about the internet service problems, let us hope no more of it :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: 1@d shows a distributional hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: 5NT = diamond king|pg||
nt|joest: no heart king|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, that was private|pg||
nt|joest: no spade king|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|psyck: nicely done|pg||
nt|passell: great deceptive play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: so semi-finals  will be   Diamond v Welland   and  Wolfson v Bathurst|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty John and Al|pg||
nt|jcwla: For those for whom it doesn't, then. :)|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|passell: now plus 140|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: they code naturally with 5NT showing the unbiddable king I guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: so a nice auctionto close out the set|pg||
nt|peachy: Spectator messages are always appreciated to keep us on the straight and narrow :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|joest: probably a quick claim|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to Susan our operator and to everyone for their patience|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c 2 way checkback maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: a @h fin would have enabled defense to get @c ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well done|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: I prefer to always have my coding be up the line, as there may be situations where two of the bids don't correspond exctly|pg||
nt|psyck: this shows the advantage of minorwood/kickback for minor fits|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks all & see you shortly in the next set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kit, Jack, CK, Susan and all the specs|pg||
nt|joest: i agre with you but that's not the way they look at it :)|pg||
