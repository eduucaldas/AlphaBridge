mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Operator Jan Martel|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|chip: Hi All.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: Probably play as straight crossruff -- ruff 3 diamonds in dummy|pg||
nt|kit: question is how high to ruff the first spade -- but probably just hope East doesn't have a singleton|pg||
nt|chip: With the spade length with East, can just cross-ruff 10 tricks in 4H. However, declarer will be worried about an overfuff or setting up a winner by ruffing high.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to John Swanson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and welcome back to Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|chip: alternative is to ruff 2 diamonds, crossing to hand once in trumps and once with a high ruff, then plan to set up a club trick.|pg||
nt|swanson: Hi|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer can ruff one spade low and then, on the thrid round, shift gears, ruff high and go for the club trick.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm not frozen or anything, Brad's still thinking|pg||
nt|swanson: If West follows.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad: "sorry, it's a complicated hand"|pg||
nt|jcmax: It looks like an easy crossruff. But declarer must be worried about getting overruffed in @S'|pg||
nt|kit: he sure is|pg||
nt|chip: If he had W's 87 of hearts instead of the 63 hand would already be over.|pg||
nt|kit: I think Chip's plan of one diamond ruff and hope to get a club trick is best, but on this hand might not work if declarer misguesses clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|chip: Actually 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chip: A couple Kibs have suggested discarding clubs. That isn't a sensible plan from either hand.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c3|nt|kit: now Brad knows his club chances are down to 50-50|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kit: but it is too late to ruff 3 diamonds in dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|jcmax: I was earlier thinking that W as a passed hand instead of bidding 4@D might have bid 4@C to indicate the lead. It may turn out well now, that he didn't!|pg||
nt|kit: now he is getting only 1 diamond ruff -- don't understand this approach|pg||
nt|chip: Even if he guesses the club, on a club back Brad will have to guess if hearts are 2-2 or 3-1 (though expect he will guess right)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfb: I've been asked to ask you to capitalize names (Hurd for instance, instead of hurd) because it looks nicer - not a big deal but probably better|pg||
nt|chip: With hearts 3-1 he has to win the club and lead winning spades.|pg||
nt|kit: note that if East had played 10 of clubs, there wouldn't be the extra entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
mc|10|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - I carefully typed another operator name in the "to" box and then it went away :)|pg||
nt|chip: yes, you are correct.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I've been asked to ask you to capitalize names (Hurd for instance, instead of hurd) because it looks nicer - not a big deal but probably better|pg||
nt|chip: Kib noted that no trump guess is needed, can just ruff the D.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry happened again!|pg||

nt|joest: 2@d seems to be Multi and 3@d natural|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 @d?|pg||
nt|joest: I wonder if south can bid something 'on his own' here to play that is noncorrectable.|pg||
nt|joest: anyway I'm guessing 4@h is pass or correct and that that's what Chambers will do|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest: yeah 4@d is a good guess|pg||
nt|joest: 4@s clearly is not pass or correct|pg||
nt|joest: over 5@d pass pass back to south we'll see what he does|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 4M would be own suit - and had to bid 4@d to get prds suit in..|pg||
nt|joest: he might try 5@h to give north options|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bagman: I would guess that 4@D is bid your suit and 4M not correctable; even 4@C might be ART requesting transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: S prepraring to bid 5@H next|pg||
nt|joest: i would|pg||
mb|5H|nt|joest: plus he will get to play it!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: these cards fit beautifully for ns|pg||
nt|joest: even with the AQ offside|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to make a club trick on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Without diamond lead S could have set up the spades |pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbgood: not if he plays for hearts 3-1 with west having the length..|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|jbgood: but a tricky contract to play|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|joest: much quieter in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: ns playing a peaceful 4@h|pg||
nt|bagman: He's soon on the cross roads: if hearts 2-2 he can set up the spades; if not he needs to ruff the diamonds and guess clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - playing for 3-1 in trumps doesnt do him any good - ever|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|hT|nt|joest: not after he's tapped at trick one|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: he surely needs the club trick for his game|pg||
nt|bagman: Relying on something good to happen in clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|dQ|pc|h6|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|hA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|joest: wonder why west pitched a diamond|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: more threatening to hang to another one at ths point so he is not club tight|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: W soon endplayed in clubs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|jbgood: now W doesnt have any exit card after 3 trumps - so|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jbgood: end of defense|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: would have been nice to have that diamond back right about now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bagman: If west had kept a diamond, declarer would have guessed the clubs (otherwise E had high club and diamond to cash)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|jbgood: as a kib says: Diamond needs a diamond...|pg||
mc|11|nt|joest: so Welland out of the gate with a strong result|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Not a classic 3@S opening, but could work well|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|kit: Little did Gitelman know that if he had passed he probably would have bought it for 3@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: East really has a hand, where he would like to play 3N, if pard has a @S stopper. But no way to express that over a 3@S opening|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|kit: so he decided to put pressure on, expecting his partner to be weaker|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|3C|nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|joest: well since they hit us with Multi on the last hand it looks as though Multi is for bad weak twos|pg||
nt|joest: and 'weak two's are for good ones|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|jbgood: 8-9 - 11 rather popular these days|pg||
nt|joest: responsive double probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: well the heart hook works, the diamond king flops up without a guess|pg||
nt|joest: but still down one b/c of the club slit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|joest: split|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bagman: Defense probably takes two spades and shifts to a club (the diamonds being too dangerous)|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||

nt|chip: after DBLing 5H.|pg||
mb|1C|an|can be 2|mb|p|mb|1H|an|4+ spades|nt|chip: 1C is 2+, 1H shows spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|11-13, <4 !ss|mb|p|nt|jcmax: W's 1@H response is a trf to @S. How should one defend against that? Should a dbl show hearts or should it be a t/o dbl of @S or something totally different?|pg||
nt|chip: 1S suggests 11-13 balanced.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: NS discussed that and decided that DBL would show hearts and 1@s would be takeout|pg||
nt|kit: any defense is okay -- the key is to have an agreement|pg||
mb|2H!|an|transfer -> 2!s|nt|chip: 1c showed 2+ clubs (they open it with clubs and with balanced hands)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: then why didn't Moss double 1@H?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Good point, Kit! Maybe forgot? :)|pg||
nt|kit: or may have made a reflex pass before seeing the alert|pg||
nt|jcmax: Good thing he got another chance! :)|pg||
nt|chip: Chris Willenkin who knows their system, says E could also have a 1-(3-4)-5 hand.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chip: Not sure if 2S now would have shown 3 or just 2 (or maybe Hx)?|pg||
nt|kit: So Moss doesn't think he can beat 1@H, thinks he can beat 2@H, but doesn't think he can beat 3@H :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: right sided|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: 2H over 1S showed 5+ S and either a signoff or GF. 3H was likely angling for NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: East muyst have been terribly torn over the 3@H bid. good decision to just bid 3@S. Definitely 3N from the other side is better than anything else!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bramley confirms that 2@h was a transfer, asks about strength, Welland says "it's either game forcing or to play"|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chip: Roy loves to play 3N with a long major.  Club lead taking out the entry could have been rather inconvenient.|pg||
nt|kit: They did well to get to 3NT.  4@S would have nervous moments, though it probably would come home.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The director just brought a chair in so he could "hover" from a seated position|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|chip: king of spades pitch will require declarer to guess well to make.|pg||
nt|kit: Moss should have led suit-pref queen of hearts to show spade "entry"|pg||
nt|chip: He must run his D's, throw N in with the 3rd spade, then guess clubs|pg||
nt|imp_jan: probably misguess due to non doubling first heart bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: It would seem, if South is thinking for a very long time about his discard now, he must be thinking about the @SK. wouldn't you agree?|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- but wouldn't that be quite the discard from, say, KJx?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: He hasn't put anything at the end of his hand, which is what he usually does - now closed the hand up and put cards on table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now has a diamond out|pg||
nt|chip: If KJx then the endplay line will work quite well. If KJxx then not so much.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfb: Roy then said "I was wondering what you were thinking about"|pg||
nt|kit: Should Bramley raise or go for the trap in 1@S doubled?|pg||

mb|p|nt|chip: Yes, trapping with a club void looks wrong, and Bart agrees.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Apparently might be a big raise if Welland is bothering to splinter|pg||

mb|4N|nt|dburn: but if 4NT is natural, I guess he can do that|pg||
nt|dburn: and there is a good case for playing it so|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and go via 3 spades if you are very serious |pg||
nt|dburn: the question will be how good a case Schermer thinks there is - this is a murky area|pg||
nt|jbgood: so David is right (of course)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|dburn: no - that was Blackwood|pg||
nt|jbgood: N tht so - but does S agree?|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump coup chances in 6@D as W is so short in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe the idea is that North, if he decides to continue at all, responds as if it were Blackwood|pg||
nt|jbgood: often the case when in doubt|pg||
nt|bagman: If 4NT is natural, I think that N should have natural regressive 5@D available|pg||
nt|dburn: but if South thinks that North will bid naturally over a natural 4NT, he may do something unfortunate|pg||
nt|jbgood: if it was nat - pass looks right?|pg||
nt|bagman: Raise would look fine |pg||
nt|bagman: Fillers in minors and top cards in majors|pg||
nt|dburn: if it was natural, pass is possible and 5@d is possible - close call|pg||
nt|bagman: Picture a minor two suiter worth bidding 3@D; there should be play in 6m|pg||
nt|dburn: if it was Blackwood, 5@c is right, and if no one knows what it was, anything can happen|pg||
nt|jbgood: S cannot bid more than 5 now - could even be 2 club losers|pg||
nt|bagman: What would you lead from E against 5@C?|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, Gitelman made 3NT despite taking no tricks with his partner's seven-card club suit|pg||
mb|6C|nt|dburn: but the jack of hearts and the spade pips in dummy were more than adequate compensation|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so S th 5@c was natural on his natural 4 nt|pg||
nt|dburn: and Chambers seems now to have taken the view that everything was natural|pg||
nt|dburn: let us hope that North does not decide that South must have a lot of solid clubs and just have been asking for aces|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: 2@h at least invite in clubs |pg||
nt|bagman: NS might make a slam here; either W leads a spade for a heart discard or gets strip squeezed in the end game|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bagman: Not sure if there are enough entries to ruff the diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: first they have to bid it ...|pg||
nt|bagman: Probably not enough entries so a minor suit lead beats it (@DA, ruff, @C, ruff, @C, ruff and no entry to dummy for strip squeeze)|pg||
nt|jbgood: N will not have slam thought now |pg||
nt|bagman: No, they are likely to bid the club game|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|jbgood: a @d was lead ag 6 @s next door on 26 and beat the slam for a major @d win - must be said that the @d lead was natural after a double of 5@d from N|pg||
