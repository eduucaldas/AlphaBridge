nt|paulg:  so we have Charles and Vi Outred in the closed room for the first time, with their homegrown version of Carrot Club|pg||

nt|paulg:  The match is over 64 boards with compulsory change of opponents every set|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A playable slam here|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play a 2+@c 1@c opener|pg||
nt|paulg:  an opportunity missed by team Outred|pg||
nt|paulg:  so Gillis hopes for some quiet hands dismissed here|pg||

nt|petka: intressant att se NS metoder nu, 3H?|pg||
nt|malkani: A more interesting board|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play a short 1@c too, which is why Gillis plays a natural 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|iain sime: 1@c is potnetially a two card suit.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjurn:  transfer?|pg||
nt|paulg:  good hand for West to do something|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: 3@H om detvisar spader|pg||

nt|petka: eller klassisk lebensohl|pg||
mb|5H|mb|6D|nt|paulg:  3NT is the practical bid but looks short of tricks with the bad club break|pg||
nt|iain sime: Interesting lead problem for Derek Diamond.|pg||
nt|paulg:  good pressure from EW here|pg||
nt|paulg:  NS must be in forcing pass, so Barton should suggest defending|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  but on a spade trick he is up to eight tricks and East may come under pressure|pg||
nt|paulg:  playable, but not great|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Barton's hand has no redeeming feaures at this point|pg||
mb|6H|mb|7D|nt|malkani: Defence needs to be sharp to beat 3NT.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Nu behöver dom 19 IMP|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, looks like defence just needs to be careful and remain passive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petka: det är i alla fall en sekvens som seriösa par bör se över, annars blir det för enkelt att sätta en på giss|pg||
nt|jbennet: vid andra bordet bjöd syd rätt listigt.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can hear the director being called from here?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|2hplus4: not one you'd want to be in - except today|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jbennet: han visade upp sin hand  5 klöver + NT-fördelning + 3stöd i spader+ lite tillägg.|pg||
nt|petka: ja, nords pass med Axx i klöveranpassning och en singelton var nog inte vinnande i längden|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbennet: nej att passa på 3 sp verkade obegripligt.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it does not have to be a particularly bad day for 5@s to go down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  Barton would have been considering overtaking the @cQ, with only one entry in dummy|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|iain sime: It would have been better to pich a discouraging diamond. |pg||
nt|paulg:  but the spade position is too dangerous to do that|pg||
nt|malkani: Needs to throw hearts, but still should go down.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Overtaking @C Q would have worked if the singleton were the 10 or Jack.|pg||
nt|paulg:  but you might easily lose three spades, club and diamond when clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|paulg:  if West held @sQJx for instance|pg||
nt|iain sime: Not if lead fourth best.|pg||
nt|paulg:  True, they do play 4th (and 2nd from bad suits)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|2hplus4: true because as well as spades behaving, you need hearts behaving too on that lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|malkani: 1NT seems the best contract|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|paulg:  Vi Outred's 7@d bid looks normal, but perhaps when 70 imps down you should take your chances|pg||
pc|s8|nt|2hplus4: Declarer perhaps will cash 2 spades and play hearts|pg||

nt|paulg:  And the kibs may feel that 1 imp is not important over 64 boards, but last year's final was tied after 64 boards, and after the first set of 8 extra boards, and after the second set of 2 extra boards, and it needed a third set of 2 boards |pg||

nt|2hplus4: Is this the dreaded gazilli?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  2@d is 7-11 with 6-card major|pg||

nt|iain sime: 2@S can make.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: I think 2@C was 2 way...now has shown at least 3 clubs|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may duck this in both hands, just to retain some communication between the hands|pg||
nt|2hplus4: If declarer gets D right he is close to making|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd be asking what they lead from Q98 and J98, but they may not have discussed it|pg||
nt|2hplus4: ducking won't cost against these holdins|pg||
nt|paulg:  ducking looks right ..  diamonds probably 3-2 or 4-1 onside and just let the defence do something|pg||
nt|paulg:  they should probably continue diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: D from defence looks best Short of entries to N then|pg||

nt|paulg:  Gillis has been here for a few years now, and has played for Scotland once|pg||
nt|paulg:  Vi Outred looking at a host of unpalatable options|pg||
nt|lml: we call what Vi is doing hoping for an earthquake|pg||

nt|paulg:  less common in Glasgow, it has to be said|pg||

nt|paulg:  a big swing to Barton on  3 when the contract was played the other way round|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|lml: me too but I was saying it more politely|pg||
nt|paulg:  North might double if partner was not a passed hand|pg||
nt|lml: we Canadians are very polite it has been said|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  only if someone can bid it, but I guess they'll go 5@c or 5@d (depending on whether 3@c was strong or fit)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petka: nästan alltid är det färgkvalitet som gör att det blir så|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jbennet: sant.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Interesting that Gillis did not make any move towards slam, as 3@s is pretty slam invitational|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3@S forcing and 4@S is a minimum. Good auction in that they didn't get to the five level to find they had insufficient key cards.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbennet: nord kunde bjudit antingen 2 NT krav eller 3 ruter krav'|pg||
nt|malkani: looks like an easy 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess they have sounder openers than me ... with good trumps and an outside ace I'd make a non-serious (perhaps trivial) cue bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  a diamond lead would be worrying for Gillis|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  of course South is always leading a heart against 6@c|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||

mb|1N|nt|paulg:  cards lying pretty well for 4@h, decision may be whether to double 4@s (best) or bid on, depending on East's first call|pg||

pc|c8|nt|jbennet: jahapp matchen över i princip.|pg||

nt|2hplus4: When you mastermind you need to be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Barton could have bid 2@h, showing hearts and a minor|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|paulg:  yes, the 3NT on board 8 was played the other way round and much harder to beat|pg||

nt|paulg:  They missed the slam on board 11 in the other room, looks like a mix of poor judgement and an unfamiliar partnership|pg||

nt|paulg:  board 12 did result in a slam swing for Barton, so the match is very close now|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't believe in upgrading when partner holds a bust|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm getting as tired as the players, having been on all day ... i was playing 3@d which was why the line did not make sense|pg||
nt|lml: sort of a cute ending that wasnt|pg||
nt|lml: you must be quite hoarse by now|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm looking forward to my Merlot|pg||

mb|p|nt|iain sime: 2@D 18/19 balanced.|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is the strong 1@c opener ... West may have guessed this was the case|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bjurn:  Hej!|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d is probably a mixed raise ... 4-card support and a card or two outside, without shortage|pg||
nt|paulg:  5-5 black suits, which do you open, the eternal debate|pg||
nt|lml: club slam looks decent.|pg||
nt|paulg:  if North can bid a forcing 3@c, they may get to 6@c|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hej Björn, välkommen|pg||
nt|iain sime: In my 2@D system 2NT is a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|iain sime: And here.|pg||
nt|malkani: good spot, well bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  a good spot to finish|pg||
nt|paulg:  Murdoch/Spears play any range for their Michaels cue bid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@c now will also get the job done|pg||
mb|4C|nt|paulg:  well bid by Murdoch-Spears|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yeppers|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|paulg:  the double of 4@d also prevents an ambiguous 4@h bid|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if it is worth doubling for the lead when you are going to be on lead|pg||
nt|lml: it does give them an extra bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: hej alla|pg||
nt|bjurn:  VÃ¤st, som vet att partner saknar 4-korts hÃ¶gfÃ¤rg, garderar att partnern har @C-lÃ¤ngd med 2NT|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Walddk2: Så 3 IMP räcker för 16-14|pg||

mb|p|mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Om one more! vinner med minst 3 IMP tar dom guldet från *guld*berg|pg||
nt|paulg:  okay, this is ambitious|pg||
nt|lml: I would have lead a trump but that is me|pg||
nt|lml: so here we have the side that shouldnt be swinging in a very aggressive grand|pg||
nt|lml: if dummy had a better club spot you might have a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think he needs diamonds 3-3 to make, which with seven missing seems unlikely|pg||
nt|paulg:  East will be a little concerned about being squeezed|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think that is 13 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: if diamonds are 3-3- and clubs 3-2 you will need more|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|paulg:  Murdoch-Spears have been in the last few Scottish Open teams, you'd hope that they knew most of these bids|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  singleton @hK is perhaps the only legitimate line|pg||
nt|lml: liand of course you will have to find the last diamond on the floor|pg||
