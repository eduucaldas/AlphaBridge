mb|p|nt|gulyas: hello Kasia|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi there|pg||
mb|1D!|an|15+ 4+!h|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: we see 2 nt iw wk, both minors |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Holy cow, it's in Polish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me guess that this is invitational woth 6+ spades|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4-6 4!h|nt|sybarra: that is played often in conjuction with multi/tartan or muiderberg systems |pg||
nt|gulyas: who would have thought:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: N-S one of the top pairs in Poland who do not play Polish Club|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Walddk2: It's more like 2/1|pg||
nt|athene: awkward problems for both sides in these auctions|pg||
nt|athene: for example, west might now be wondering whether 2@S is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Iin Nail 1C= 15+ hcp with less than 4 hearts. 1D= 15+ hcp with 4H or more. 1H/S capped to 14HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: wyglada na to, ¿e by³ namys³ z rêk¹ E, ale IMO W ma czyste wznowienie|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wow - and they are still allowed to live in Poland?|pg||

mb|d|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2nd/4th in Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So low from a doubleton, middle from 3, also with an honour|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphp1: Namys³ faktycznie by³...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As long as opener does not raise with 3 cards, they can stay|pg||
nt|gulyas: it did sound like a trump lead is called for|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nice summary|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is not making, to put it mildly|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they can get all the ruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: in Polad 2nt is usually minors but 7-11 - they're playing 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: well, all the other suits were unappetizing.  This is a trump lead I can live with|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow, good result for EW in the closed room|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the right leadfor the ruffs, this could go down a lot |pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: How did 4@H make I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North must surely have started with two top clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Only 1|pg||
nt|gulyas: and you still have 2 trumps to lose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, he switched to a diamond at trick 2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|gulyas: did not start with @Hs, so only 1 down|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jkotor: 11 opening, 12 game, as I sayd before...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and 4 rounds of spades to pitch the second club, then some ruffing|pg||
nt|athene: difficult decision for south now as well - lead could be @DQ10x or a singleton, on the bidding, i suppose|pg||
nt|puncher99: daimond ace and another is best lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|puncher99: play must b real slow|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: pazur is still thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: he doesn't look happy with his P bid|pg||
nt|puncher99: wht was the alert of 2hearts?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: with E out of @Ss, he is only down 1|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless some miracle happens of course, E has 2 trumps to come|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if the lead is @D10xx it might be costly to take the ace, but here that is not likely to be the case|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jkotor: trying for -1, may produce -3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not a happy spade break here |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: if you play a 9-12 notrump and you don't mind bending the shape a bit, you open it a lot!|pg||
nt|athene: i would say of any slightly non-standard bid, this has the biggest impact|pg||
nt|athene: because it comes up so much and it changes the whole character of the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: sorry no connection to other table, need to relog|pg||
nt|athene: north just thinking whether slam might be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and it certainly might be|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: south is limited to an extent, perhaps, by failure to double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Brave intervention with 9 high and only 9 cards red vs white.|pg||
nt|athene: but he can still have enough for 6@H|pg||
nt|puncher99: made 5 x|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kamyk: a¿ mnie z sieci wywali³o po tym poprzednim:)|pg||
nt|athene: also with strong shapely hands people might prefer to start with 2@C rather than double|pg||
nt|athene: so north definitely can't just jump to 4@H |pg||
nt|athene: that would be too lazy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: it is called "strefa", and it has many lovers|pg||
nt|jkotor: the problem is with "³apanie strefy"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@s in trouble here even if @s broke, as @d's are unfav too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: with all danger suits lying favorably, this will be home easily|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dzieñ dobry wszystkim to our Polish viewers|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D has this drawback, though|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: results are in, sorry for the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
nt|athene: partner doesn't know you are just making a slam try in hearts :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2nd-4th, as usual|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not any lovely choices for a lead.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: In this case protected by the fact that pd isn't accepting *any* invitations.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This contract is in jeopardy on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer may get trumps wrong|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: would east bid like this with @HQxx? surely not|pg||
nt|athene: so i think declarer should have got the trumps right anyway|pg||
nt|athene: this is an odd lead though|pg||
nt|athene: @DK looks normal and safe|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, @H3 is odd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H4 would not have been|pg||
nt|athene: east is worried about @DAJ10x or something with declarer, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but that's a bit of a view to take|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jkotor: in my style E gives 2@h transfer with 6@S|pg||
nt|blum1956: It were probablly better to discard boards like this one from the play. Unfortunately that way players will know every board is "interesting" and that will be another game|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or just play matchpoints - no dull boards there|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: he has communication problem on the lead in trying to ruff 2@c's, so playing for suits to break|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would be tempted to lead the @c9 -- with my usual stellar results.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jkotor: west can bid now 2N or 2@h, probably 2N showing better hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jkotor: 2N or 2@s*|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: may see a spade hit the table from S |pg||
nt|gulyas: I would guess a @H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: some players say the machine-duplicated hands are rigged, but I think it is only the natural distribution of cards - hand-dealt hands are not able to give you all the probabilities|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not so dull in the other room where the contract is 3@CX|pg||
nt|blum1956: ))|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|gulyas: wow, which way?:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: that might make sense also |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: N-S, going for 1100 I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's another counter-argument to the "discard dull boards" approach|pg||

nt|santyclz: 14|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: E/W playing this match perfectly for 0-28|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably some artificial GF that could be various hands, including the one with a long @C suit I assume|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,   |pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: EW close to slam values, only missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know man has billions of unused brain-cells, but this is too much for a mere mortal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer forgot to unblock @SQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: i doubt his opponents will be gloating about that, though|pg||

nt|gulyas: I am also playing a relay precision system in the last few years, and I have the same problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet 4 @C some sort of ace asking|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|athene: i assume north started off by relaying for distributioni|pg||
nt|athene: distribution|pg||
nt|athene: and then 3@S was some sort of strength ask, maybe asking for number of controls|pg||
nt|athene: and south has so many, he makes a big bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@S asking controls with a base level of 2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: the places where the artificial bids are useful are so rare, that you happen to forget them until they come up again|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think  (since I am blonde) I should stay with some system like 2/1 with gadgets |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have wrong-sided both minors so the only hope is NT|pg||
nt|athene: if north does know how many aces and kings his partner has, he might be thinking about how good slam can be, depending on whether south has the @SA or @HA|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the hand played by n, this would be an easy defense to hold it to 2.  |pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: 2@D is game-forcing, which is very good for a hand like this|pg||

nt|gulyas: you have to be able to bid exclusion bw somehow, but S is not the one with the big hand, he only sees the 12hcp and a void in pd's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 3@D showed a good hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done, should bid it now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so Opener must have his values where you need them if no @HA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could Kwiecien not have dloubled 2@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But no harm done|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 2 no queen?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As it is, he even has wasted @HKQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did 3@D show 4 diamonds?|pg||
nt|gulyas: after N cued instead of 3NT, he surely has lots of extras|pg||
nt|blum1956: The trump Q not needed N promising 4 diamonds with 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as 2@D could be 4 cards|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@D has to be 4|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table e didn't feel the necessity of showing @ss over the overcall but w reopened with 3@h.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gulyas: so he can see it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South has to commit one way or another ... and it has to be the grand I feel, else why bid 5@h|pg||
nt|blum1956: One needs to count accurately )))|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And be confident that 3@D showed 4-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He'd like to know about @CK of course, but there is no room to ask for it|pg||
nt|blum1956: how many Aces does pd have|pg||
nt|gulyas: pd cued in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, North did promise some kind of club control|pg||
nt|blum1956: He knows after the 4@c cue|pg||
nt|Walddk2: but that could be a singleton|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he has a singleton, he may have the @SQ or the @HA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Once he bid 5@H, he was committed to following through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's Kwiecien's conclusion too|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: He just needed to think it through|pg||
nt|gulyas: if neither, then the @HKQ, so he has some finesses to take|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Really, this auction is a model of modern bidding|pg||
nt|gulyas: of course, no hurries|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: 2/1, 4 card raise, 2nd round control bids, exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|gulyas: he saved the time in the play:)|pg||

nt|gulyas: you don't always need Polish club, see, Roland?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I said Polish Club is needed|pg||
nt|blum1956: When I started to play bridge in the 70s 2@d was nf, ques from 1st round and no exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, that was Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In he other room, the wrong hand asked for keycards|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and South decided not to show his heart void|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You've got to feel for E/W ... haven't put a foot wrong and 41 imps in the hole|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have bid 5NT, 2 keycards + a void|pg||
nt|bjacobs: coulda shoulda|pg||

nt|gulyas: this is another interesting aspect of imp scoring|pg||
mb|1C!|an|15+ no 4!h|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C in Polish Club is usually 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|gulyas: when you are 90% sure you are down|pg||
nt|gulyas: but say, if you played a @C, you are down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H by South is where you want to be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not by North although it happens to make from that side too|pg||
nt|santyclz: No weak 2 in @ss by e?|pg||
mb|1N!|an|9-13 4+!h|nt|gulyas: and if you try for a miracle, you maybe 3 down|pg||
nt|gulyas: (not the actual hand)|pg||
nt|gulyas: what is the right play?|pg||
nt|gulyas: by playing for a sure 1 down, you may be saving your side imps|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mr murray: 4 spades a good contract that will fail. not easy to reach|pg||
mb|p!|an|forcing|nt|gulyas: considering the miracle situation is very unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: same category as "pard never has the perfect hand" |pg||
nt|psyck: vul, play for less down...|pg||
nt|mr murray: easy for them :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: if they play kokish here it might get in the way a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: practical bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: it may also contain some very strong hands|pg||
nt|puncher99: 6c anyone?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: nv, go for all the marbles|pg||
nt|gulyas: is there a percentage where you say I play for a sure down 1? when there is a slim chance you could make?|pg||
nt|gulyas: yeah, but all those imps add up in the long run|pg||
nt|gulyas: its like overtricks at imps|pg||
nt|gulyas: you think you always make sure you make, and then play for overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 15+ with clubs or 18+ any|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@H is definitely hearts then north can just splinter and it's easy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gulyas: but sometimes you have a 90% chance for 3 overtricks, and 10% for going down if you go for it|pg||
nt|gulyas: should you try the overtricks, or forget it and cash out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if 2@H is hearts OR balanced - as it seems to be - it can get more fiddly|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think many if not most systems will get you there.  |pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: so 2@S is just a relay and 3@D says he has hearts|pg||
nt|mr murray: true|pg||
nt|mr murray: I miscounted souths points at first glance :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to diagnose the @d duplication.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now north can't make such a clear raise of hearts - 3@H might just be much more grudging preference|pg||
nt|athene: clearly 4@H over 3@D would be a huge underbid|pg||
nt|athene: this is not to say that Kokish is not valuable, but all these gadgets come with a price tag|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are we crashing?|pg||
nt|mr murray: right|pg||
mb|4N|nt|psyck: I generally save myself the strain & concentrate on the big ones in a match|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know, but math says otherwise in some situations|pg||
nt|psyck: but having lost by 1vp, 1imp, several times, i can see the case for trying hard every deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: excel,lent contract that will need a slip to make|pg||
nt|mr murray: that was the slip|pg||

nt|gulyas: not a good choice of game here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|gulyas: so you could bid that you will catch the XXI|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|gulyas: since the player holding it cannot be sure which opp has the skiz (the highest trump)|pg||

nt|gulyas: Barboo?|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a very complicated game, ppl who play it compare it to bridge|pg||
nt|gulyas: I could never master it:)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|gulyas: if they had a method to show 6c @Ss and forcing, I would try that and leave it to pd to decide|pg||

nt|gulyas: so another 10 imps going the other way probably|pg||

mb|1N|an|11-14|mb|p|nt|gulyas: yep|pg||

nt|gulyas: 'betli' here, after call from yet another card game only Hungarians play:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|sybarra: but so similar |pg||
pc|cA|nt|blum1956: chance to recover by bidding the grand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: By anyone's standards ... in clubs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gulyas: yes, this game probably not originated from here|pg||
nt|sybarra: wandering towards 4 @H's it looks like|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6 is a maker|pg||
nt|gulyas: only need trumps 3-2 it looks like, so not bad|pg||
nt|athene: double by passed hand might be 5m 4M?|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might consider 2@D perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: or he might have been wondering what double would mean|pg||
nt|athene: now south can bid 2@H and he showed his hand perfectly :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: yes, very good grand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that they may set hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and find out that they are off @HQ|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if they can relay it out|pg||
nt|sybarra: the clubs provide the pitch for the @S |pg||
nt|athene: 1NT and then two unilateral rebids|pg||
nt|santyclz: S isn't shy.|pg||
nt|athene: all reasonable enough|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: he can still bid 7@C after that|pg||
nt|blum1956: From W's point of view he needs only @h AK for 7@c|pg||
nt|gulyas: seeing how he can set up the @H suit probably|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... they should be able to reach this ... West takes control, hears about @HAK via Blackwood, and should know what to do|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs another entry to cash it, but thats not too much to ask from an opener:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: he could well have both missing kings|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and if he has neither @DK or @SK, surely he will have @HQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Feinscheckers bid 7NT and collect all the matchpoints|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: Feinscheckers?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Typo sorry|pg||

nt|Walddk2: m missing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 1 for a push|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: oh, that explains everything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Minus 1 point to Roland for a typo|pg||
nt|gulyas: you could argue that you need the @CJ for it to be good, but its N who holds it, so he can ask for the @CQ:)|pg||
nt|puncher99: 8 tricks here unless ew gets in on diam|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: its a 28 point slam, with not even a J wasted|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s3|nt|gulyas: you only need the @Hs to run, or @D finesse and a squeeze:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: who's Feinschmeckers when he's at home?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have Michael down for 7 minuspoints|pg||
nt|gulyas: now 4@S rkcb?|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats a treatment I rarely see, to exchange 4@S and 4nt in situations like this|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kickback Blackwood|pg||
nt|gulyas: but its very useful, you don't go higher than 5@H with the bw responses|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: Yes/ Even if pd has a heart support which is far from being obvious NS may be short of tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: the grand rolled in in the meantime, for another 12|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H leaves me speechless and that takes a lot|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky somewhat, 4@H is on a finesse after all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One has to delve into his mind to see what we can learn from his thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: Finally on the current board Jagniewski will pay the bill I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Kasia and Joe|pg||
mb|6S|nt|Walddk2: There is nothing to suggest that 4@H will play well|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe S did bid a t/o double |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He buys a dream dummy and still can't make|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he was considering passing as opposed to bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South doubled 4@C we have an explanation|pg||
nt|gulyas: on a @S lead ducked by S, 4@C is 2 off actually on a trump promotion - no, the @D loser goes away then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he didn't, Kasia?|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats the only possibility I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is bonkers if South did not double 4@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kasia has gone on strike, because we insulted his operating|pg||
nt|gulyas: bd 10 is also playing in 2@S in the meantime|pg||
nt|mr murray: 4 hearts also works|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: W takes advantage of the limited nature of the 1@d bid to show a relatively good hand with great distribution.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: only reds|pg||
nt|mr murray: good decision|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: After a lengthy deliberation Jagniewski has decided to play @C7 from the dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: yes yes, replay, sorry:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Gm (10am here) Roland, Kasia.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphp1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: last 12 boards today|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: good play|pg||
nt|santyclz: The tap makes the contract uncomfortable but still makes.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps pitch a @s?|pg||
nt|mr murray: throws a spade best|pg||
nt|mr murray: then it is easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's the difference if they continue with a 3rd club?|pg||
nt|puncher99: welcome spectators commentators and operator|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: on NS we can watch "Nail" system|pg||
nt|puncher99: very good x|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: you can check it on http://www.bridge.com.pl/nail2009_12_12.pdf|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|s2|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know Jagniewski from real life; he is a sensible individual and would not bid 4@H without a double|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|psyck: 3@hx would have fetched a tidy score, but it was normal for W to escape to 4@c with a min opening & a 7 card suit|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Defenders don't always to the best thing.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||

nt|gulyas: so S has to have something for his raise|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And thanks muchly to our flawless commentators Daniel, Michael and Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: ty all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally our appreciation to the Polish Bridge Union (Slawek Latala)   for broadcasting this excellent event|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer response and good hand |pg||
nt|puncher99: i like to bid 2n with good 10 and 5card minor|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: "never put an 8-card suit down in dummy" - what about -card suits?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: 9-card suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That dummy is absolutely worthless|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garden2005: otwarcia z trzeciej rêki podlegaj¹ regule "w najsilniejszy kolor 4+", w przypadku utrzymania siê przy grze przeciwnika jest to jednoczesnie wskazanie wistu|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muchly!?, minus 1 point to Bill|pg||
nt|blum1956: thx all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Paul Heitner:  There are no 9-card suits.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: now relays?  I will need help here |pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: 6@C is on a finesse, but since its trumps, they will not bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do N-S play Dwururka, Kasia?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Jagniewski did not promise anything .... unless diamonds are trumps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Nail they play I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: i think they do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deviced by Pazur|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: so you cash the ace first, succeeding against any 3-2 break or singleton king|pg||
nt|mr murray: guess they dont play smolen|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3 diamonds must be there version of smolen|pg||
nt|mr murray: right spot|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hope I am not in the red yet:)|pg||
nt|athene: north's hand is worth 7 tricks in diamonds and none in hearts, but on the other hand 4@H is pretty much a command to put the dummy down, so....|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he hoped he might make a trick with a spade ruff|pg||
nt|athene: even a club ruff not inconceivable i suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only consolation is that 5@D does not make either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 3 down vulnerable is not exactly a triumph|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D was much more likely to be doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: They're using 3@D there for their version of Smolen.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (English is tough.)|pg||
nt|mr murray: not much to this hand easy 5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: Event continues in about 20 minutes I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 6-0, this may go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: this will|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2N asks for 3@c to show shortness, 3@h @s sing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pazur in Polish means 'nail'|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me try that again,  2 @S asked for 2n,  so that S cold show shortness.  and 3 @H says spades |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|athene: nothing better than that|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pazur also devised Dwururka, the double-barreled rifle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: in 2007|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: E didn't want to x opposite a weak nt.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: this allows N to bid the nt,  with wastage in spades,   (or place the contract suitably) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a link to Dwururka but not Nail|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Next is scheduled to start in about 20 minutes|pg||
