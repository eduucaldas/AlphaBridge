nt|sybarra: we may need these,  since this is "not standard" |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a horrible bunch of misfits - not us - the hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be us also LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if all stay low |pg||

nt|milton_se:  och Calle|pg||
nt|haans: Hej Bertil|pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|milton_se: hi Hans|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@D w/o  a @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: Hej Carl|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45: N/S can make a very lucky 3 NT here, but hardly bid it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S or 5@D |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
nt|daman: welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bara brudar = Only 'chicks' (women)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West should already be thinking: "3NT"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: hi all - round 5 just starting|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Fridrik|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: can NS really make 3nt? how do they get to dummy to finesse diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT would be my (bad resulting) bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is -1, but I think they will take a sacrifie - which will make|pg||
nt|rv: Please access http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html for running scores|pg||
nt|granguru: 3N or 5@d is an easy task to fullfil|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hello everyone from a sunny westcoast of Sweden|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
nt|psyck: 1N=@c or puppet to @c i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in spades, given time :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S Jack is the entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: - but I said: VERY lucky|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might be some either/or bid - those are sort of the norm after strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so clubs or something else, maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning all|pg||
nt|bobholl: typical screen wait :)|pg||
nt|psyck: @d's put to sleep|pg||
nt|rv: huge surprise Lavazza out of contention|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|granguru: N Asks for majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|athene: many people play the overcall in responder's suit as natural here - but not by a passed hand|pg||
nt|haans: Noth - South in the lead|pg||
nt|haans: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=3755|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all; N-S have a nice fit for 6@H and they are on their way to it with the splitner|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam!|pg||
nt|haans: easy start|pg||
nt|leanderiii: Ganska säker på att NS spelar stark klöver|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strong enough for one try ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning - and it is another sunny morning in dublin - can we take all this good weather|pg||
nt|rv: yes sunny in Dublin and wet in Bangalore good for resp regions:)|pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome to see some of the best players in Italy - and in the world|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: possible slam here - seems to be dependent just on the @SA being right|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @D should end the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could be a suction variant with @c or red suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|fann4: After 8 rounds - SBAR lead the table with 166 vps, and MIRO are 2nd with 149 vps.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So you guessed it, N-S are young women|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|j0i: Hi all|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Hej|pg||
nt|milton_se: reasonable save here|pg||
nt|meggen: One More! won last year but Simon Bech is replaced with Lars Jansson|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: and getting scarcer|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing,  "not sure this is success either"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @D is jumping into fire |pg||
nt|sybarra: (out of frying pan)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: best to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ not an entry for trump finesse playing in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not have to try anymore|pg||
nt|bobholl: double all pass :)|pg||
nt|daman: yes   we are very lucky to see this match|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: Hi John|pg||
nt|kemperg: 17 to work on, nice task for Miro|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: was looking at the wrong CC... :)|pg||
nt|meggen: 5@d is a profitable save but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S semi-relay to 1nt|pg||
nt|milton_se: and Guldberg is 2/3 of the national team|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: it seems as One More! only needs 16, since they |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Will be defeated - with the @S-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45: - not any longer|pg||
nt|athene: now he can just play ace and a diamond, lose @SAK, @DK, @CA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But not from his side...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No ... it was awkward|pg||
nt|haans: urk starting hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and its "good luck pard" with a smile |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like 1 down with 5@d cold!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Henry!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder why West did not raise diamonds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s lead?|pg||
nt|rv: East won't find inspired @SJ lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If 2@C was a game force, then West could bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: perhaps East should rebid 2NT with his scattered stuff|pg||
nt|friggi: Hej alle, velkommen til denne begivenhed, forhåbentlig vil vi se en masse af god Bridge|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|haans: but then what|pg||
nt|bagman: N holds xxx in the splinter suit and a good hand; there should be enough tricks unless EW can cash 2 first|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescue|pg||
nt|woozle: Likely phantom|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would you?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Fabio Carugati|pg||
nt|rv: on this auction, there is case for leading @sj instead of @C since you have no entry and best to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Fabio, I will seriously consider @SJ lead|pg||
nt|caruga: hi all, the weather is not so good here in Northern Italy....let's hope|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I certainly would since no suggestion declarer or responder have spades|pg||
nt|rv: did the weather affect Lavazza?|pg||
nt|caruga: is possible :)|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer can make this contract by playing @HJ and rising with @CA if West wins and continues @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how about kibs any spade leaders out there|pg||
nt|rado: zdraveite vsichki, kryg 4 na otkritia otboren Serdika:)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: zdr, Rado @H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: but close to down 1|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should guarantee fireworks since have to pout the boot down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: only way the contract might go down is spade shift and then try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|athene: East's double just showing a good hand i think?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So they both had chances, but it might all depend on their system agreements|pg||
nt|cuttysark: All is not lost: he has to switch to a diamond now to beat the game|pg||
nt|bagman: With this lead N can discard a club on diamond to make the grand|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 4@C here a self supporting splinter|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: this seems like a decent contract|pg||
nt|haans: fair ...|pg||
nt|rado: SiSi@h:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: lesni 12 chakame drugia don:)|pg||
nt|rado: 14-16 NT stayman i SMolen 3@H do normalen dogovor i byrz claim|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: zdr, Bobi @H blagodarq vi, mom4eta|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: right John!  this can not be worse  (only 50's) |pg||
nt|psyck: S will have to provide an entry to dec hand for @c fin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wow, that's tough|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rv: it is easier for East to lead a @s from shortness here since partner has most of values and odds on to hold 4+@s|pg||
nt|athene: this is a swift clam|pg||
nt|fann4: So to win the event, MIRO need to win 24-6, a VERY tall order.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S 10 importent |pg||
nt|cumino: EW can make 3@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well if you HAVE to win 24-6 you cant sit on your hands|pg||
nt|bagman: or set up spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: then @DK overruff, @S ruff|pg||
nt|athene: claim :)|pg||
nt|fann4: What can beat 2@S here are east and west's trump spots. the @S8 and the @S9.|pg||
nt|friggi: 5@S is cold so they have to bid 6@D and risk to drive N-S to slam|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: Sometimes I think dbl is used very bad instead of supporting|pg||
nt|caruga: Paolo Uggeri is a very imaginative player but the first board in rama......|pg||
nt|rv: now 1 down again|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
nt|granguru: yes, for the ones who are asking...WE ARE watching the bridge legenda|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @SA @S10 will cause some damage here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, -3|pg||
nt|j0i: Might go for -3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: 2@cs + 2@D and 2@hs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  2@s very limited in range...3-7 hcp which may be reason for lack of try by S...W's balance will not meet with teammate approval|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: playing 4@C no risk on card play playing for 10 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S can not find his parner entry for a ruff but might try it |pg||
nt|fann4: Now the contract can make.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D retranfer|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: he can make even with @SA wrong because the clubs and diamonds lie nicely|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: with the double of 4@C showing the K is well placed that becomes a real possibility|pg||
nt|haans: slam has no odds before efter|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: so this is the first time the suit gets mentioned?|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jameslee 2: claim  for 10 not 11 should be |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry was the other way|pg||
nt|haans: evening Patrick|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: but fall of @CQ ought to change declarer's mind|pg||
nt|rv: Franchi did have a tough play problem even on favorable @c lead, to play for either @SK right or hope for right @HT guess and 4-4 @cs|pg||
nt|granguru: hi |pg||
nt|rv: he didn't take a very unreasonable line |pg||
nt|rv: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Plaut|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pressure w|pg||
nt|granguru: namaste|pg||
nt|caruga: hi, ciao|pg||
nt|athene: yes, indeed - west's first name is "THE"|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito Garozzo, born in September 1927|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: ace and a diamond completely safe now|pg||
nt|hawe45: North will hardly ruff @C - seeing the @C Queen coming down |pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: There is no typo in the N-S team name. Intentional as Guld means Gold. Those guys dreaming of the gold medal|pg||
nt|haans: double up to 2@D = no game score if a make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|j0i: Guldberg is my pick to win this compatition|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I wonder if the information about void is correct|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: getting partner to lead through dummy's singleton was never going to gain you much; it could|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|woozle: Good hand to show off the law - EW make 9 tricks in their nine card fit, NS make8 tricks in their eight card fit. If 4H was making, 4S would be -500|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA what else?|pg||
nt|athene: no way anyone can win the @DK and give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|athene: if he had cashed the @CK and seen the queen fall, yes|pg||
nt|granguru: ciao Fabio|pg||
nt|daman: he could have made it double dummy :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: be that the double of 4@C has given declarer a winning line|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: I meant 'she' onviously - and  agree that is asking too much|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So far, the defence is sparkling|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we call these kind of hand "buzz sawa" |pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|bagman: At least N believed it|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: but the way it went it was not so obvious that the @CQ was stiff|pg||
nt|athene: but still|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond was 100% to make 3@D at that point|pg||
nt|hawe45: This will not be the best played hand of the tournament|pg||
nt|athene: definitely very bad play|pg||
nt|athene: i guess "first board syndrome"|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north thought that west had the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: All beginning is difficult|pg||
nt|athene: since west bid them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: maybe he did not check what 1nt meant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might as well find out about chilean weather|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: *buzz saws"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: get out fast before you lose your head|pg||
nt|bobholl: a of @C claim|pg||
nt|granguru: nice weather here|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could have been a lot worse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: and he did not bother to even ruff high first time|pg||
nt|athene: so he must have been really sure west had club length|pg||
nt|athene: that suggests he just did not pay attention to the bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45: Would not have helped|pg||
nt|hawe45: ruffing high|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: no, of course not, but the fact that he didn't does show he didn't even consider that east might be the one with the long clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Fred madea point in rec.games.bridge recently avout arriving early to a tournament to free your mind of clutter before the 1st board... :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: was down and makes now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Liz McGowan and Per Leandersson|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: oops !|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|woozle: 8 imps to EW, richly deserved by NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: 90% of the pecs could:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: specs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|granguru: 10% are blind?|pg||
nt|fann4: Bd 1 in the OR (Open Room) EW have bid to a very agressive 4@h, which may make.|pg||
nt|haans: Liz and Per Hi|pg||
pc|d5|nt|leanderiii: Hi all|pg||
nt|rado: s kakvi VP sa v momenta Sisi?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: endplay|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ianmcc: well put|pg||
nt|andyv:  very unusual @d play...are we sure Fulvio ducked the @d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which suggests boot is down already|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: I'm not do sure the first round @H finesse is the percentage play|pg||
nt|cumino: Wrong play by Comella (safe playing Q@S or club) and wrong defence by Alfredo. |pg||
nt|kemperg: so it is Paolo|pg||
nt|cumino: Or at least what we have seen :)|pg||
nt|fann4: But declarer is going to go down agains the 4-1 trump break there.|pg||
nt|kemperg: all hands makes it easyer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: These two teams are 1st (Sbarigia) and 2nd with a 17 VP gap. So Miroglio needs to win by at least 24-6 VP to overtake Sbarigia|pg||
nt|j0i: We got a sibling rivalry in this match :) Ida and Mikael Grönkvist|pg||

nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: first board and last board are the killers for keeping concentration|pg||
nt|athene: the ones in between, they are hard too|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  -800 usually not what you expect when opps are not in game|pg||
nt|athene: i think that possibly east should bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: the point being it's very likely his partner might balance disastrously|pg||
nt|athene: east is a passed hand - how bad can 3@C be?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just with benefit of hindsight|pg||
nt|andyv:  but in imps, is there a reason for W to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  poor quality suit, and, except for 6th @h, the hand is balanced|pg||
nt|athene: well the hand does go to prove one point which is that just because opps have stopped low, doesn't mean it's safe to come in|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the severity was pretty extreme|pg||
nt|psyck: unlikely S would try pd entry with all hcp marked though|pg||
nt|rv: early summer rains have really cooled temperature here in Bangalore|pg||
nt|Walddk4: running scores at  http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|granguru: end april time is like ending the summer...not so cold not so warm...|pg||
nt|daman: so*|pg||
nt|daman: with another entry in dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry was the other way|pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo´s partner is around 45/47 years nice guy|pg||
nt|athene: he might downgrade to 1nt - 4333, poor spot cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I might have given up the contract a trick earlier with a low heart lead at trick 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Jóhann Sigurdarson|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure you would find the low diamond, Bill :)|pg||
nt|milton_se:  a great deal of luck for the favourites|pg||

nt|athene: so -2!|pg||
nt|athene: but still should have been a much bigger swing|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was cold|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost always safer to act aggressively earlier rather than pass and back in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a rather easy 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  good thing E-W missing 2 aces. otherwise W might drive to a no-play slam|pg||
nt|athene: but still it is an 18 and not that bad an 18|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree with 1nt here|pg||
nt|athene: now it's usual to treat 6-4 as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|j0i: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C or 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|cumino: Hard to believe Alfredo didn't play clubs|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: half the points to each side here but EW have the spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: dealer having fun today?|pg||
nt|athene: at the point he won the second club|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT better be played by East - only @D-lead brings trouble|pg||
nt|pelu: but he need to discard a@D on @s|pg||
nt|fann4: 3@C presumably a 'good raise or better'.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: may try for slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: anybody for 3@C by south?|pg||
nt|fann4: Some would have splintered over 2@C, if available.|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps he is to strong for splinter|pg||
nt|cumino: Souh annot bid 3@C because it is @H @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed but wouldnt bid 3c vul anyway|pg||
nt|fann4: RKC (Roman Key card) would fine a key card and the trump Q missing, so not a good slam, but the other room they may push for it.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah cant find a CC, what is 2NT then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they have a higher range for their 2NT opening I assume|pg||
nt|fann4: No, they stopped in 4@S there.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: certainly, with the hand record, instantly|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: North cannot tell whether both oppo are weak or one is strong|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: 1 @S denies 4 sp |pg||
nt|athene: but that was a particularly tough one |pg||
nt|psyck: no problems in 4@h with trump breaking if they can get there|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Kristina have we got our vugrapher around to ask for any doubts?|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't know, we can try :)|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@H contract |pg||

nt|athene: but Versace wants to get both majors into it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s too|pg||
nt|kemperg: specialy with the bad 4 and good 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To win by 24-6 on the 16-board scale you need 37 IMPs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@D unlikely to make if they casn 2 aces - no reson to guess diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Noth have four clubs|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C easy make|pg||
nt|leanderiii: 4 clubs, good bid and north will now bid 5 clubs I hope|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They will probably save in 5@H - 'when in doubt - bid one more'|pg||
nt|psyck: time for EW to bid a @h slam now|pg||

nt|daman: yes   the discard would be necessary|pg||
nt|granguru: fantoni nunes range is diff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East takes a reasonable gamble - and loses|pg||
nt|haans: in sweden we alert 1@C with ´can have three´|pg||
nt|meggen: 4@s is on for NS, will they reach it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Interesting that NS sold out here - you really can't afford to let them have the auction to themselves|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Was South polishing her nails when 1@C was bid?  What happened to the 1@H overcall?|pg||
nt|rado: 2-ra masa BezNazwy 59 - FIl 59|pg||
nt|rado: Fil|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: 1@C is natural (ish) and 14+|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You still a junior, Jóhann?|pg||

nt|sybarra: hitting the deck again? |pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just a natural game force|pg||
nt|xenya: Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: he knows E opened 1 @C a "good hand" |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and heart back, ducked|pg||

nt|hawe45: and the police|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D control & slam prop that N will decline |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|fann4: Not good to have North playing it.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 tricks could be claim soon after 2 round @H |pg||
nt|rv: I play pass here by West says I want to play in 1@d XX|pg||
nt|granguru: thats the top level meaning|pg||
nt|haans: my opinion as well 5@H|pg||
nt|haans: ops|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surprised North did not raise last time|pg||
nt|haans: 4m not a contract to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I'm told 3@c was transfer last deal, that makes sense|pg||
nt|psyck: Common to play transfers after intervention|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H = 2/2 help to make contract easy |pg||
nt|caruga: me too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me three|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
nt|haans: cannot pass for ever|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could he be worried about pushing then into slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores  http://tinyurl.com/5w9ppn3|pg||
nt|psyck: @d losers go way, but still a couple of @s's to lose|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: not a great contract although there things sometimes make|pg||
nt|haans: odds for diamond lead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: will depend on whether NS get their diamond trick going in time|pg||
nt|leanderiii: I think D is better than 3 hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: they play transfer responses so 1@S response would be limited with no major|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt stronger than 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|athene: basically if anyone has not seen NS before, they play an unusual system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a fast claim I hope|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri-Cossu possibly play it differently|pg||
nt|granguru: I must confess that I agree with it but at the table I use my instinct|pg||

nt|athene: fairly strong, forcing 1 level bids|pg||
nt|athene: 14+ or thereabouts|pg||
nt|athene: weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: 2-level bids are 10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that @d suit is never mentioned.|pg||
nt|athene: so after the 1-level openers, responder can force to game on ten counts|pg||
nt|athene: and they can set up a game force quickly and often|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed east would lead red but this is better|pg||
nt|athene: normally you would prefer to have the lead running up to a strong notrump rather than through it|pg||
nt|athene: but here the red tenaces are protected at least|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be so !|pg||
nt|henryb:  At my local club :) there would be two pairs in 5@h and at least one in a partial|pg||
nt|henryb:  also, probably, one in 3N|pg||

nt|haans: Hi Magnus|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades might have been @D,  I am still chedking |pg||
nt|daman: the @H 10 is nice to have|pg||
nt|pelu: 8 toptrick and with @h10 S can setup a @D trick|pg||
nt|granguru: but it used to be 20-22|pg||
nt|kemperg: 21-22 on the CC|pg||
nt|granguru: for you to remember all 1 openings are 14+ hcp|pg||
nt|kemperg: told that by 3@C, not splintering??|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w has no intention of dropping this and then the s play|pg||
nt|cumino: No I think 2BT 3 cards raise or better 3@C 4+ cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells splinter limited hand, so he is bigger than that|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to show max|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||
nt|athene: worth pointing out that if north at any points found the @H7 lead(and south had not led the suit) and declarer plays the king, south has to duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards the 8 is so obvious :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: might be too difficult for North to duck this; if we wins @HA  :(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: good question|pg||
nt|fann4: Hard for east NOT to bid it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, North should play the queen, in case partner has @DJxxxx|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: very common to duck the first round if you have AJx(xx) over KQx|pg||
nt|athene: keep communications open|pg||

nt|cumino: 2NT|pg||

nt|athene: what is south thinking about? his partner can't have @HQ left can he?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i second that|pg||

mb|2C|nt|granguru: 4M and 5m: to play|pg||
nt|athene: partner has two more cards in the 4-card suit and it still makes two more tricks in the long suit|pg||
nt|fann4: To have any chance, declarer had to assume North had the @DK - so it was likely that South was then pretty long in @C - but it's easy seeing all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|kemperg: this keeps it exiting|pg||
nt|bagman: Anyhow, a nice and relatively easy hand for EW to recover from the first hand|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: perhaps he shoudl have played to the JT, rather than leading out the Q|pg||
nt|meggen: This one looks interesting, game on both ways.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: missing DK will hardly bid 7|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: N was too strong for his action after all :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This cuts communication a little|pg||
nt|athene: ok now declarer can't get to dummy for a pitch on the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: sensible lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead the singleton with a weak hand|pg||
nt|psyck: @h will be entry later|pg||
nt|hawe45: Listen folks - does 2 @S mean: Lead what you like?|pg||
nt|athene: Garozzo said "if you don't lead your singleton, pd shld assume u don't have one"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces away and claim |pg||
nt|henryb:  they might beat this enough to compensate for the game!|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes agree.|pg||
nt|j0i: This should go down at least 1|pg||
nt|meggen: But you'll have to take the @h finesse. Shouldn't be that difficult after S 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 4@S.. now|pg||
nt|sybarra: up the line cues I guess |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: danger hand with @D 5/0 Q@S off side & a @H looser |pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H was min,|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/gazzilli.html|pg||
nt|jbennet: it all comes down what the 6 card suit is like.|pg||
nt|athene: west's @SAJ gets a lot better when partner shows six of them|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but rather too many losers in 5@C - looks like -800 territory|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: still you have to bid 5@C - what if North and Easts hands are switched? :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: what can W do over the 4@H opener - can't pass, double suggests spades - so might see the same at other tables|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: nobut must have 2|pg||
nt|fann4: So a big swing heading back to SBA here, on a 'nothing' board really.|pg||
nt|ppilot: end 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rado: next board as Pilot would say:)|pg||
nt|vbman: 5 h yields how many tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that doesn't quite mean "always lead your singleton" as people sometimes say|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but it is fairly close :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't it the Q he led ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  so what?|pg||
nt|bobholl: otherwise i didn't understand the duck :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this aint much better|pg||
nt|jbennet: if however SpQ was h Q then the hand should be bid as both majors.|pg||
nt|athene: a spec asks why cima doesn't use stayman - well, this is what we are talking about|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: @D set as trump |pg||
nt|jcomyn: that dk still missing though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are off to the races |pg||
nt|athene: he has SPADES (and hearts on the side)|pg||
nt|fann4: Probably 2 off on this lead.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|woozle: EW will win seven imps, but a completely worthwhile vulnerable game has gone begging|pg||
nt|meggen: 5@d is also doomed, you can't avoid a @c loser|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|kemperg: 2@S any 4card|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like no breaks :) - 2NT was a possible winner|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sommer: nice and easy, wd|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S 3crd support|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, with weak NT, you are generally forced to adopt complicated runouts, like say Twisted Swine, to ensure that you land in a cheap 7+ card fit at the 2 level|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: now i bid 2s on the s hand after the x|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: Good lead - from his shorter holding in partner's suits|pg||
nt|cuttysark: EW might have a save at different vulnerability - really there is nothing much to say about this deal|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45: Now 11½|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he took the pitch earlier|pg||
nt|granguru: why is garozzo playing then?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45: Even if East ducks the first @H, still 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fann4: It was tough for south after the x of 2@D. Should he pull to 2@S before he knows what west is going to do? |pg||
nt|milton_se: sure|pg||
nt|haans: squeeze now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: east covers in case his pd has @H109x or something|pg||
nt|caruga: foreign players are allowed|pg||
nt|caruga: we've players from France, Poland, Venezuela....|pg||
nt|pelu: @H back - if decl has @h10 N can kill the ruff of the 4. @d|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Madala had a 2@h-opening in S! (@h+minor)|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 3@CX - looks like down 2 - but u never know :(|pg||
nt|daman: the auction almost guarantees that declarer is 3541 |pg||
nt|daman: and so ot will help with the D|pg||
nt|daman: it*|pg||
nt|xenya: essentially a 50% game, and you can't expect juniors to throw the chance away|pg||
nt|milton_se: has to play for 5@S making|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a plus with Klinger stealing 3@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and as WE see, it makes 13 tricks fast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this WONT take long|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to duck with a doubleton honour|pg||
nt|hawe45: Hmm...!|pg||
nt|athene: clearly this is trivial unless south has all the hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Just has to hope trump are breaking now|pg||
nt|milton_se:  would be surprised if not|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I missed line of play, but just made|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: nunes fantoni didn't take their tricks against 4@H either|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: another one where we can't see what happened in the CR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nor should this|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is a good sac against 4@H here|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only game here is 3 @D doubled|pg||
nt|athene: nunes obviously did not think his hand quite good enough for a 2@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: (10-13, unbalanced, 5+@D)|pg||
nt|athene: they tend to be ultra disciplined with those|pg||
nt|athene: so it has to be a ridiculously good 9|pg||
nt|psyck: not with all values outside i guess|pg||
nt|athene: a 9 that is basically a 12 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we will have to wait a little longer for the imps to flow|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so as well as 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: the least you would expect from this legend :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 84 year old think|pg||
nt|psyck: the @s return probably tipped him off to play that way|pg||
nt|psyck: 83|pg||
nt|daman: now NS can show their 2 suiter|pg||
nt|kemperg: sigh of relieve|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://tinyurl.com/5w9ppn3|pg||
nt|haans: suprising easy slam|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So they did - but not a great slam|pg||
nt|haans: little less than 50%|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Svag Klover went for their 3NT game on Board 1 and so collected 8 imps|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: board 1 in open room was 4@H making 6, when club was led into the AQ8|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: so so 11 imp swing there|pg||
nt|haans: only in sweden you still play forcing pass systems|pg||
nt|meggen: Credit to EW for finding this save. Very good|pg||
nt|meggen: Yes, W may discard wrongly, but I don't think Cecilia will do that, she's too experienced|pg||
nt|rado: 5@h for 300 only missed sacrifice|pg||
nt|ppilot: so - 2 imps|pg||
nt|vbman: 5 h is down 2 |pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder what happens on the other table:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
nt|sommer: this?..this may be a swing|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N dares to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 18-19 i take it|pg||
nt|sybarra: X will now = @D I suspect |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: :) ty not far |pg||
nt|psyck: 84 later this year i think|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@S by NS will be an easy task|pg||
nt|granguru: the main idea was 1. to have always and alternative to run into |pg||
nt|granguru: as you would, as partner never fall into a void dummy|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jcomyn: will they defend or not|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S is on here. On the surface it looks like it was misplayed in the OR. After 1 rd of trumps ending in dummy, declarer must abandon trumps and play a @C.|pg||
nt|j0i: a thin 4@s game here|pg||
nt|psyck: True Pekka, lot of judgement involved in deciding when to runout & when not|pg||
nt|friggi: agree, but that was the only chance|pg||
nt|rado: they started with boards 7 and 8 so later will have check|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
nt|caruga: do you all bid with N?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|athene: south is close, in my opinion, to a double of 2@H (he is in the pre-balancing position)|pg||
nt|jbennet: as usual activity will now be rewarded.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The girls in the other room played 3Nt from the better side on Board 1, and so gained an imp|pg||
nt|haans: 11 imp on the slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D interesting - sometimes you have to open 1@D with various "loose" hands in a strong club system|pg||
nt|athene: but usually with 6 clubs you can open 2@C!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their 2@C opener denies a 4 card major|pg||
nt|granguru: 2. you can lead trumps agaisnt any doubled contract if it was the case|pg||
nt|athene: but combination of mediocre shape and minimum hcp and being vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: so pass is sensible enough|pg||
nt|kemperg: and no @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2@S may be 2 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt think sacrifice now|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..very passive by N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Once again, N/S strangely silent ... I would have taken a youthful risk and overcalled 2@C|pg||
nt|vbman: how many boards per round?|pg||
nt|rado: 8 boards 11 rounds now 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really must hunt out a CC for NS :) then i could actually stop just guessing haha|pg||
nt|psyck: Papi has been practicing with N quite a bit on BBO recently, you can catch him with the id sillafu here often|pg||
nt|fann4: Clearly 1@S would not have been forcing by S here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not bad hands for a start for Benito 16/18/17/19 in 4 hands :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s might now go overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This time, though, no harm done|pg||
nt|bagman: Often 1NTX is a reasonable contract for both sides swingin a couple of IMPs (180/100/200/300)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5w9ppn3  running scores|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: big heart fit here unnoticed - shouldn't someone have bid them?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: Bridggida, the goddess of Bridge, clearly favors him :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: ah!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: Usually, in a strong @c system, it is the long relays we cannot make sense of, here even their natual bids are unnatural :(|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D is always a bit of an amorphous blob in 5-card major strong 1@C systems|pg||
nt|athene: just not usually this sort of blob :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their system (yet) but looks like strong club with conventional answers |pg||
nt|pelu: u see "only" 13 HCP so N cant open 1@h (= 14+)|pg||
nt|daman: Running scores at  http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: good 12/13 also allowed|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer needs 2 ruffs in dummy.|pg||
nt|rado: E might retransfer with 3@D here|pg||
nt|ppilot: if gunev does not act they miss score|pg||
nt|vbman: they make 4 cl?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: this is a situation well suited for Lebensohl|pg||
nt|milton_se: 3@D = GF w support|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sommer: got a chance there too, to X|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs probably shows both minors.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Mikael Westerlud|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Westerlund, sry|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi all|pg||
nt|meggen: 1@d shows @h and D 3-card support in @h's|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: well, what would 2nt show? this is a bit odd i have to say|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 2@H was is that|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i dont like this style of bidding with this kind of shape|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D making N 3Nt only by S|pg||
nt|fann4: maybe heading to 3N by S, if N bids 3@H now.|pg||
nt|granguru: if @D forces N to a new bid 4@S can be reached|pg||
nt|granguru: ditto|pg||
nt|kemperg: stif K not good|pg||
nt|granguru: 3. There was a chance to find a 4-4 fit even if you opened a "weak 2"|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Mikael|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5332 is not a great distribution, but 2@H does seem to give opponents more room than they deserve|pg||
nt|haans: agree with that bidding|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks good - and looks like the par contract reached|pg||
nt|haans: fair bid but ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: may make w/o @S lead, but now -- hardly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: we can just ignore the 1st round of bids & it looks fine though...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With an easy @H-guess, East can make 4 @D - if N/S do not find the @H-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed it was just 1@C natural, 1@H transfer, 1nt natural, new minor forcing|pg||
nt|granguru: good bid by Montanari|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know tha ditto system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And in fact, it might have worked well ... not helping to clue E/W in to their effective fit|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: overetick here on the right guess|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: likely that E has a club honour and a diamond honour, given neither of those suits were led|pg||
nt|friggi: due to 3-3 in @H 12 tricks can be made here|pg||
nt|vbman: well \ optimistic somehow|pg||
nt|rado: Nanev jumped to game optimistic but could be right sometimes|pg||
nt|ppilot: now missed diamond lead and this might make|pg||
nt|vbman: cant argue with success|pg||
nt|ppilot: i think this will go down|pg||
nt|vbman: ew must be careful with their h play|pg||
nt|rado: suppose Partner has "normal 4144 15-19p"  could be easy game or down 1:)|pg||
nt|rado: 15-16 sorry:)|pg||
nt|vbman: but with that why not immediate 2h?|pg||
nt|ppilot: with 4441 and strong hand he might bid 2@H so 4 @S too optomistik|pg||
nt|vbman: is super |pg||
nt|rado: not sure but 2@H maybe is 2 suiter in their methods|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tak 'em or dont get 'em |pg||
nt|athene: not trivial perhaps to bid 3@D with east |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT much better than 4@S @C lead and swiftly 1 down |pg||
nt|fann4: Down a lot if the @DK offside - 5@D much better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: brave or what?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi there Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: so should not place him with @SK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: only in nt |pg||
nt|sommer: sry..I'm told, E showed 5c@H|pg||
nt|athene: might feel he is just hanging partner for a good balancing action|pg||
nt|psyck: E was afraid of crucifying pd for balancing|pg||
nt|athene: also he might just assume that north has implied some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: since usually you will do if you open 1@D and rebid clubs, even if you might have longer clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: I also have to sleep some time, this contract is a 2-minut-one...!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/apr/fantunes-and-garozzo-play-angelini-salsomaggiore is about this match|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d looks like xfer to @hs, otherwise 3N doesn't make sense with E hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be used to poor overcalls|pg||
nt|granguru: I am also not accustomed to bid suits like N, but it is a good strategy to enter over 1 in a minor  with such type of semisolid suits|pg||
nt|caruga: NS are very good and very young players|pg||
nt|meggen: You can make this, duck one spade, take the double finesse in @h's and then set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: how about entries to the 4th diamond?|pg||
nt|milton_se: N can cover 1st @H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: i'm told that 1@D generally promises a 4-card major in the NS methods, so 2@C showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: but lauria-versace do have a lot of funky little bits of system that come up in odd places :)|pg||
nt|fann4: A commentator in the OR has said - MIR will start afresh after this board, as Versace won't fail to make 4@S, I guess.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he did go down in 6s|pg||
nt|rado: pass and DBL later for t/o|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: i was wondering why he ignored the spades, but if he has implied them, that is ok :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems they are heding to a good 5@D|pg||
nt|granguru: because it is around 50% chance that NT might be bid by 3rd hand so defense wins a critical tempo if the lead is in the mentioned suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well if my pard overcalled vul I wont stop in 4s|pg||
nt|granguru: by passing the chances that partner leads another suit are overwhelming|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sommer: ..the 3@C did|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H lead expected |pg||
nt|fann4: No he didn't - his partner did.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Object lesson in leading trump - always lead your lowest in case partner has a useful singleton|pg||
pc|cK|nt|woozle: It would all work if the D8 was in North|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S was "wheater/or"..and then 3@C showed 5c @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|daman: NS stole the auction from EW    Ew can make at least 8 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|daman: 9 actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is in 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: according to the OR|pg||
nt|vbman: is superacceptance popular with 3 cards in bulgaria?|pg||
nt|ppilot: now easy to defend for ivanov |pg||
nt|rado: yes with max and tricks|pg||
nt|ppilot: just take his red aces and play king of hearts to get 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|vbman: and with a doubleton l suppose|pg||
nt|rado: our players like to bid all the time:)|pg||
nt|vbman: its the bidders game|pg||
nt|ppilot: i wold have doubled with ivanov hand and wonder with my famous greediness:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: oh yes thats true|pg||
nt|fann4: At this point in the OR, declarer played a 2nd trump, and that was goodbye.|pg||
nt|haans: no play usually mean claiming|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: well done, S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: ufffff|pg||
nt|jbennet: and now folks lauria entered the bidding on the 3 level vulnerable and earned himself a wel deserved double part-score swing.|pg||
nt|athene: these partscore hands are 6 imps a time so it's not enough just to say "i might go for 500, i have to pass"|pg||
nt|jbennet: lucky?? no the least. just acting with the odds.|pg||
nt|athene: if any specs are wondering what i meant when i mentioned that south was in the "pre-balancing" position - he isn't actually in the passout seat, but opps have had a limited fit ...|pg||
nt|athene: auction|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|rado: after Q@S declarer might place all honoirs and distribution on the table|pg||
nt|vbman: yes for sure|pg||
nt|ppilot: that is true but does not help much like a predicted deaht|pg||
nt|rado: I bet other room playes much faster and soon they will reach this 2 boards differnece|pg||
nt|ppilot: clu Tony and regret not doubling:)|pg||
nt|vbman: my father used to say= at the end of each hand cards must be open book for you|pg||
nt|ppilot: club:) |pg||
nt|rado: and needed somebody to read it :)|pg||
nt|vbman: you must always concentrate on counting and placing= solving the hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  some think it was nmf, but does that guarantee @hs?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the bidding makes more sense now, thanks |pg||
nt|jcomyn: fine in defence but thats a might big s hand|pg||
nt|granguru: you must be very young  john|pg||
nt|kemperg: :) well done|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: so he can see 2@H might well get passed out and he wants to compete if so|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. it will indeed once in a blue moon be a layout such as a) they dont have a playable trump-suit |pg||
nt|cuttysark: he could concede 2 tricks now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|vbman: good def|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8th trick|pg||
nt|fann4: So now MIR need 41imps, and they have 12 boards to do it.|pg||
nt|cumino: Interesteng 5@H|pg||
nt|cumino: NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but with @S start and continuation not easy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|woozle: Well, Anderson gets a chance to show off his cardplay, and if he does, Buchen gets a chance to show off his defense|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: went for the drop pity :(|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: wouldnt doubt it|pg||
nt|psyck: Another 'routine' 1@d opening for N now|pg||
nt|hawe45: Seems impossible to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: @sA was sleepy|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess transfer too :)|pg||
nt|caruga: slam time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we can see that but can they?|pg||
nt|daman: so now    when N opens 1H   it shows a minimum of 14 HCP|pg||
nt|jbennet: and b) NS can double. (lots of times balancing actions escapes from being punished with a double even if it gets down 2. |pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo has 13 World Champ., 3 OLymp. & 12 Europe Champs plus others|pg||
nt|kemperg: rest for a smoke?|pg||
nt|fann4: Spectators are asking - after this round it is the end of the event. No knockouts to follow.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: East realized he played really stupid since this was teams :) but he counted 3 loosers besides the spade suit :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I guess West can't start with a forcing pass this time, being in 4th seat !|pg||
nt|leanderiii: well done!|pg||
nt|friggi: very good analysis|pg||
nt|rado: any bets for 1@D from E here?|pg||
nt|vbman: l dont know any of these players but the level is quite satisfying|pg||
nt|ppilot: i bet:)|pg||
nt|rado: open or no?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: Running scores at   http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html |pg||
nt|sommer: EW missed even 6@D at the other table in b 3|pg||
nt|fann4: Certainly a big swing possibility. West may not open in the other room or declarer may still take the @D finesse.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sommer: 2..sry|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H or 3@S the limit but ???|pg||
nt|granguru: fit is what its all this game about|pg||
nt|caruga: isn't easy|pg||
nt|granguru: and there is an important 4th adventage: the relay. It permits opener to show the 5-4 or the 6th card suit at ease|pg||
nt|dima:  hi all :) 6@h on 1-1 split?|pg||
nt|daman: yo Dima|pg||
nt|daman: You Di Ma|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible that NS use 3@C there to show both minors because if you start with 2NT you allow east to double to suggest a penalty|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|mikael_w: At this table we see Karlsson/Gullberg a really strong young pair. And their team "Guldberg" are huge favorits to win the swedish championship this year. And Grönkvist/Petersen is ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a really young girlpair. They will also play in the uropean championship for sweden in the "Girls-class"|pg||
nt|xenya: on a different layout, declarer might have suffered a ruff|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: x wide ranging opp a nebulous opening|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the double of 1@D just says "i am doubling whatever minor he has for takeout " :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will they miss @H now ?|pg||
nt|athene: many people bid 1@S with that west sort of hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s from S?|pg||
nt|pelu: but NS are missing 2 key-cards - so no slam|pg||
nt|dima:  If they find out that they have 11 trumps and havea chance to Qbid @d ace on the way ... but unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@C might make it harder|pg||
nt|ppilot: open|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: these nebulous minor openers cause a whole lot of interesting problems for both sides|pg||
nt|jbennet: but for every -500 the activity philosophy will earn 8-10 partscore swings. (worth 4-6 IMP:s every time)|pg||
nt|psyck: they may have had a signalling disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you see it a lot more with short 1@C openers|pg||
nt|hawe45: In fact, best game is 3 NT - with @S 5-1, 4 @H might be a looser|pg||
nt|athene: but they they are stuck when the bidding comes back to them in 4@H or something|pg||
nt|athene: they have to bid 5@C and now partner can't go back to 4@S if he wants to|pg||
nt|athene: much more descriptive to bid clubs first then spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead 4@S migth make|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes match can get closer |pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially as s d are pretty scruffy|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@C-4@D might do it|pg||
nt|athene: NS play a slightly modified form of stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have to go for it|pg||
nt|fann4: I would imagine that EW should start stepping things up in the OR - they must know that going down in 4@S on bd 4 was a shocker.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5w9ppn3  running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are 15 year old twins|pg||
nt|haans: standard in sweden to allow all systems|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: could be lively auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and some were worried about missing 7,  John and I were both chickens  and happy to be in 6 |pg||
nt|rado: I won:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: right pair of chickens we are shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: that ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: now N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that nunes splinters for hearts with no more than a minimum opener (in their style)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians generally lay great stress on showing the shape in competition like this |pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 5@D now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: two small in clubs looks very bad from north's point of view - but not if you know partner has a singleton :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but may be not strong enough sure :)|pg||
nt|athene: will west lightner double hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would force NS to find the better spot in @hs|pg||
nt|dima:  4NT is turbo?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Seems that transfer responses to 1@C are standard in Swedish Youth|pg||
nt|j0i: Girls are still scoring :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, That is correct Yuval :) Its our U-26 team VS Girls team :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North's @H8 ices 3NT|pg||
nt|meggen: N nedded to switch to a @c in order to remove dummys ace|pg||
nt|friggi: sometimes it helps to be force to play sudden way to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, South found the obvious 1@H overcall, but they couldn't apply the brakes after that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: over 900 watching this match now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 to go after this one|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: at the end of the last hand Buchen just showed his kj10x @d to Smolanko, and they both agreed 1 off|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think is says "nolo comprendo" - or so - in Italian. What could 3 @C mean???|pg||
nt|athene: @C2 lead now maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes should convert this|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to underlead in @C to deafeat 5@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H?|pg||
nt|granguru: no|pg||
nt|ppilot: ok|pg||
nt|vbman: u shd not open 2nd seat |pg||
nt|ppilot: that missed game in @H|pg||
nt|rado: missed 4@H for EW|pg||
pc|h7|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4H almost looks like an underbid, but if you're going to stop low, that North hand won't disappoint|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih no apologies to mates :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: not any more|pg||
nt|fann4: 1NT probably 18-20|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: only 4@S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: no chance|pg||
nt|psyck: can set up an extra @s trick as cards are to get home|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: J@D lead or 10@D with agreement |pg||
nt|jcomyn: can hardly bid on now|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of spects claim that the slam sh be bid - but when N ask for keycards he will get 2 - could be @HK and @DA - then missing 2 Aces|pg||
nt|dima:  Turbo shows even number of key cards so Fulvio knows they are off 2 keycards|pg||
nt|granguru: well seems yes|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think that the 2NT shows both minor BUT south shall choose clubs if eqal length.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H showed a maximum hand without majors|pg||
nt|granguru: many other things like a 5th (if memory doest fail) with his wife Lea Dupont, a pro/am victory with Martin Woltman (wollies) watching now here|pg||
nt|athene: OR four hearts]|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rv: back, sry had conn problems|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, THAT is an importent 8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Without it, he has to find the @HQ play here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: not much point west underleading since he is on lead against diamonds not hearts :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might deduce the diamond void from the auction|pg||
nt|granguru: Coach of italian natl team and the italian juniors - european champios|pg||
nt|jbennet: whats does 3 club mean???|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just asking what he has|pg||
nt|jcomyn: assdume 5d|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is happy to see this lead as now the contract is assured unless EW can take a (spade)ruff|pg||
nt|psyck: Strong @c system helps here (you do not want to see the bidding go 1@S all pass)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: this should get 1@S (indirectly?) and a raise and then game|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: i donno what 4@c is either|pg||
nt|athene: but a diamond lead could be wrong in many ways - if partner doesn't ruff you just gave a vital tempo away|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 5@H is made|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'll deduce it now but it's too late|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but no entry in parner to make damagge |pg||
nt|psyck: actully not, cannot afford it now|pg||
nt|granguru: if it is a cue|pg||
nt|j0i: Transfers after 1@c are popular in Iceland as well, though I have never tried it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nord Syd pick up 11 on Board 2 where they played 4@H in one room and 4@C+1 in the other|pg||
nt|milton_se: or South inserting @CQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: but can endplay S |pg||
nt|pelu: so for sure impossible to bid if u dont just use dice's :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, there is the matter of finding @SQ perhaps|pg||
nt|meggen: No, that was too late as @d's were 3-3|pg||
nt|haans: Opinion about last deal: snillrik13: go Micke go Örebro är bäst|pg||
nt|ppilot: need quick gange to @D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: pass 1@C-1@D-1@H-1@S|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: not a lot can go wrong here with @DA right and clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: was 1@H showing spades?|pg||
nt|milton_se:  no extras|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H promise 20 have 18|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right...no reason not to try|pg||
nt|granguru: 6 reached|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well on the way now|pg||
nt|fann4: The lead sorted out the trump suit for declarer, but without it the right play is small to the Q, and it if loses, cash the A next.|pg||
nt|fann4: On the basis that the person who won the K is more likely to have done so from K10xx rather than a singleton K.|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: so 2@S was the first introduction of the suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: of course, "Normally", you only lightner double at the slam level|pg||
nt|bobholl: not the ace :)|pg||
nt|athene: but there are other times when perhaps it might apply|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that it does interfere with when you just want to double for penalty because opps are saccing|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps, I think E had enough to go on to try a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can only really use it when you are known from the previous auction not to be strong enough to need to double just to protect your equity on the deal|pg||
nt|andyv:  and question for W was whether to bid on, to dbl for lead direction, or to pass....this time pass looks costly|pg||
nt|bobholl: he didn't know for sure his P had @C Q|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@C in N -1 |pg||
nt|psyck: @c doubleton sees him home too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's see how he goes about it|pg||
nt|haans: maybe +1 imp here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: They are becoming popular everywhere.  I play it even, but I actually think it's an inferior style ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: 10 tricks w/o trump lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: it is particularly important to overcall when they play transfers - disrupt their rhythm|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: underleading an ace very reasonable here, as very unlikely the king is on your right|pg||
nt|haans: yep 1@S = weakish hand|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bobholl: and may be someone has no @C|pg||
nt|granguru: Merit for Franchi|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@D is a VERY though bid to make at the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree we see so few minor slams these days|pg||
nt|caruga: agree|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sommer: closer to 8 than to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: on spot 9 make |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mikael_w: yes, But I think you always "finds" it when you play safe|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: yes, tough to get to this slam, if I had @DQ or @DT in Franchi's hand, I might have bid 3@d on 2@c to set suit with an extra card than min |pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/TurboConvention.pdf|pg||
nt|granguru: good tip daman|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: a guess is that 2NT at 3rd bidding turn would show minimum to allow then to play 2NT|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|woozle: ducking the opening heart lead is leaving Smolanko poorly placed - it's hard to see him going down if he rises with the ace and knocks out the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just pitch|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ill tell him|pg||
pc|c4|nt|woozle: Perhaps Christie is contemplating an undercut|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has he fallen asleep?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: "thanks"|pg||
nt|haans: costly lead :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: Good defence ... a phony threat, but it changes the whole hand for declarer|pg||
nt|ppilot: ok now  D:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: south might vaguely have had thoughts of 6@C, but if so, they must have been only very vague ones|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim 10 ´now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fann4: Push board here.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohhh, now he dont need the @s-trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: yeah, this is the end|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|meggen: 10 tricks it is|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HJ gives it away:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: i dont think 3c shows c more likely d|pg||
nt|friggi: do you agree with this line of play?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jameslee 2: board 4 now call in W as dealer and playing 3nt |pg||
nt|vbman: 3 down compansate some?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: Realistically, I don't think there was any beating it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: 2 imps|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|woozle: now Buchen tries desperately to break spades, but Smolanko, try as he might, can't go down|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I have not tried transfers sine I mainly play a natural club, but can see there are plusses and minusses|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jameslee 2: 1@S-2@D-3Nt board 4|pg||
nt|psyck: that should be comfortable then|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 4, in the OR (Open Room) W passed, so big swing heading back to MIR|pg||
nt|psyck: as W did not open & NT right sided|pg||
nt|ppilot: so 200 is not a great loose|pg||
nt|vbman: 2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fann4: Yes|pg||

nt|bobholl: 7@D or 7@H even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but when s passes no slam bid|pg||
nt|rv: need @s 3-3 or honor doubleton inside, poor slam|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito, at 83 can play 10 different full systems ...|pg||
nt|kemperg: E is not expecting a @D fit:)|pg||
nt|cumino: In the other room 1H 2H 3NT = 4H with cards|pg||
nt|ppilot: wait we may see something|pg||
nt|rado: RDBL= 1st round control|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: some times overcall 1NT with singleton honour is OK but this is not such an occasion.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: whether it shows 2, 3, 4, 5, whatever|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gosh. I thought they were for those playing a fester: 2+ clubs|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: we have all played guessing game|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|woozle: Someone asked about a low spade instead of the queen. That's complex, and I think that Smolanko would have had to find the weird play of the jack from dummy to make|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone open in s|pg||
nt|pelu: also here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no, And now n/s has bidding really hard many boards and it has been right every time|pg||
nt|psyck: and the only makable game i suppose (unless something like 5@d make)|pg||
nt|milton_se: @H to 10 seemed obvious in trick 3|pg||
nt|rado: now clea @D lead|pg||
nt|ppilot: bruma found 5@H in the other table|pg||
nt|vbman: science is a good furniture to have in upper storey as long as you have commonsense on the ground floor|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|jcomyn: NO|pg||
nt|athene: so east bid 1nt over a strong club with clubs, now 1@H with spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: I´am proud of the fact, that I do´nt understand one single of these bids|pg||
nt|athene: so it looks like some sort of suction|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing the next suit up or some other 2 suiter|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe just simple transfers but that is a little passé surely|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo east in 4@S here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if they are too sophisticated they'l discover missing @D Q|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knows 65 now i suppose so simple RKC can do the trick now (7@D)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he surely takes enough time for it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: well, versace is a good partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no on previous one|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be one of his better fits:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @D finessed in board 4 hedding to a confortable 630 swing |pg||
nt|friggi: ugly hand - just 3 tricks|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|rado: sure when 4@s passed by opener 5@h has good ground for save|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: having an actual anchor suit! that's bordering on natural bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can one open 4th in hand - and let the opponents play - undoubled|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi peter|pg||
nt|fann4: the dbl presumably showed @H, and 2@H showed 4 card support.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 12-12|pg||
nt|granguru: @Sk stiff, doubleton or tripleton on side|pg||
nt|pelu: would X from Fantoni be take out - also here??|pg||
nt|athene: lauria was hoping he would bid the right suit and he did|pg||
nt|friggi: you have to collect the 9 tricks needed:)|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6 red tricks = good start|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|friggi: then play low @C to dummy|pg||
nt|milton_se: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: IF Buratti had bid 2@C, N might have fallen i love with his hand and go for 5@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter:) |pg||
nt|granguru: no one would think of it at the table...just commenting how easy 4@h will be|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 6-4 h fit not helpful defending|pg||
nt|fann4: How to play trumps here? If they are 2-2 anything works (declarer has to ruff at least 1@C presumably)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: True ... in my part of the world, the whole method is geared around a VERY short club - 1@D openings showing 4+ or even 5+ diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: With diamonds breaking and no club ruff, NS can make 5@D|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: seems to work - got to the normal contract  :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: it seems so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The point is that transfers give you more room for investigation later because 1@D takes up less space than 1@H, 1@H less than 1@S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and here we go again|pg||
nt|haans: not an easy make all cards wrong|pg||
nt|ppilot: yes good if they bid will def|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45: Look at this board, no mistake possible in the play|pg||
nt|athene: only three trumps and two clubs to lose here|pg||
nt|xenya: well this will go down?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not right this time|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but this game is a pretty good one. but this time the cards are not in favor|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's quite a poor game, I think, but not hopeless|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: there is a defense to strong @c called DONTTON where 1 level bids are transfers showing length or shortness in the next suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim :(|pg||
nt|jbennet: and indeed overcalling 1nT might have caused a missed an excellent 4 msp|pg||
nt|athene: now versace might have to decide whether to deep finesse the heart or play east for a singleton honour|pg||
nt|jbennet: so what should he have done if he had got a D response.|pg||
nt|jbennet: treat the hand as a 18-20 NT of course.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem here is that he would like to just crossruff it - but to cash two heart tricks (or three) he needs to draw east's trumps|pg||
nt|athene: so he is a bit stuck|pg||
nt|athene: of course to cash the @CK he needs to draw west's trumps too!|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see this coming home|pg||
nt|athene: hard to say how a 1nt overcall would have fared but it looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and will take some time i daresay|pg||
nt|athene: a spec asks, can we not just play west for both hearts? well, yes, but if we draw trumps and do that we only make 3 trumps, 3 hearts, @CAK, and one ruff|pg||
nt|athene: no way to organize TWO diamond ruffs and keep control|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes a 4-4 trump fit just ain't enough|pg||
nt|jbennet: looking at NS hands alone 4sp looks good. But knowing about the club suit.|pg||
nt|athene: on this sort of hand what you really, really want is a ninth trump|pg||
nt|jbennet: N might have realized that the breaks was bad (knowing bith west and south was short in clubs)|pg||
nt|athene: still, these borderline game contracts in a 4-4 fit are really tricky to defend|pg||
nt|athene: and versace has had a lot of practice at making them|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lets see D king at tricks 2.|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps 3+3+2 D ruffs+AK might be possible.|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|jbennet: was 4 spades an overbid??|pg||
nt|athene: so if he plays the @DK to the ace, what does Garozzo do?|pg||
nt|jbennet: the defence prevails if for example garozzo bangs down AX in spades.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: easy grand - more interestig to bid without @cA |pg||
nt|rv: OR, North did bid 3@d on 1@s by South and now South could visualize slam easily|pg||
nt|granguru: but there are still some other chances with @SKxxx in W,,such as @CKQ alone|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: & 2 level bids like DONT|pg||
nt|athene: well, no-one managed to find their 5-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: but there is work to be done|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: @HQ and then ...|pg||
nt|ppilot: but now helped ops to find their best fit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: and Pass lead directional in Pointed suits, & Double lead directional in Rounded suits :)|pg||
nt|psyck: So far we have been able to follow NS bidding anyway, usually they are more esoteric :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H 3/2 no problem in 4@H = or Q@C placed for +1|pg||
nt|jbennet: h to the 7?|pg||
nt|granguru: for the askers: Leo Cima is from Tuscany a very good player, training almost daily with Benito thru Internet|pg||
nt|granguru: as said 45/47 years old|pg||
nt|kemperg: called 100 dog?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: Garozzo is smispi?|pg||
nt|athene: no, that's dano de falco|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 sp looks in fact unmakeable as long as defence doesnt slip.|pg||
nt|granguru: Smispi is Dano de Falco|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo is sillafu here|pg||
nt|kemperg: No sillafu, mixed them|pg||
nt|granguru: LAURIA was born one year later as me 1946|pg||
nt|athene: of course it would help declarer if garozzo had overruffed there|pg||
nt|granguru: Versace is much younger 1969 I think|pg||
nt|athene: you shouldn't give up the ace of trumps so casually|pg||
nt|athene: holding Axx of trumps in defence is very powerful in many ways|pg||
nt|athene: for example, often declarer wants to draw exactly two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: but you can prevent that by ducking the first round|pg||
nt|athene: then if a second round is played you can win and play a third|pg||
nt|jbennet: A diamond now. to the ace. if garozzo at that stage plays AX in spades. then 4 sp will make|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like imps to ew|pg||
nt|kemperg: think that wil happen |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 off now|pg||
nt|fann4: So, 14 imps for MIR, putting them 10 ahead. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: had 4s made in the other room on bd 4 the fat might really be in the fire|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|woozle: The defense here seem to have taken to heart Zia's tip "always play the nine"|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really hope to make use of the diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, of course, you tend to say "sayonara" to the hands with diamonds|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: all the grandmothers in the audience are shaking their heads|pg||
nt|pelu: well defended by Nunes|pg||
nt|dima:  One might use 3@d for takeout and X for penalty but who am I to suggest here ... :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: so you just have to scramble some tricks by ruffing hearts|pg||
nt|mikael_w: for junior this MUST be a verry good game when even I want to be in it in teams :)|pg||
nt|haans: hurray|pg||
nt|haans: i started to play passbits after 5 min 40 years ago|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: North-South had a nice save in 5@C, even if E-W finds the heart ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: not or, need both|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sry true need to find Q@C to make |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Here I play 3@c asking for more distribution, and when we can find 3244, we will land in 5@c|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer hopes that long spades, @DA and QJ of hearts are in the same hand (or @HQJ doubleton)|pg||
nt|psyck: Nice, I play 3@c as repeat stayman too, allowing one to find all hand patterns of NT opener|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kemperg: losing 2 @S or 1@S + 1@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: none of these gimmicks are free|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: Well, you need to win finesses in both clubs and diamonds, and also avoid several other dangers, such as 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|haans: good @S9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: I was talking about board 5 of course:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..where NS make 5@C|pg||
nt|xenya: @D switch would have beaten it by 2 tricks|pg||
nt|meggen: Pass would have been right, EW makes 2@s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i believe it was Belladonna's Bridge Tip to "hold up the ace of trumps!"|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo-belladonna top pair in the 1970s, early 80s|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You bid 1@S with diamonds, splendid idea when you have no major|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: i agree -100 could be good for ew|pg||
nt|haans: :) :) :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems a lot to do - but North had to split his honours there|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbennet: yep he didnt play a D to ace so now he have opened himself for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think you can go back further than that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kib says last world title was as far back as 75|pg||
nt|jbennet: only way to let 4 sp now is overruffing and return spade. then and only then 4 sp makes|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo is just trying to work out if he can beat it if versace has five trumps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jameslee 2: 3 loose always |pg||
nt|fann4: Nothing much to this hand really.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so needs to find the Q@C |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: but versace would not have had anything like such a problem with five spades in his hand|pg||
nt|haans: a killer|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: luckily   EW avoided a big penalty because of system|pg||
nt|jbennet: if declare has 5 trumps there nothing to be done.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You really don't want to be in it|pg||
nt|meggen: But as we can see it was a winner when they bought 1NT|pg||
nt|friggi: yes you can get luck:) from time to time regardless|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: tie game now|pg||
nt|milton_se: surprising in a junior's event that no-one opened b4 :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck: will not try drop this time :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But their system just got them ... the 8-11 raise, aggressive but reasonable try, aggressive but reasonable accept|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: basically there is a big practical advantage in complicated artificial schemes of interference|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: in theory it is supposed to give the other side more room |pg||
nt|mikael_w: trumf now and its 2 down too, but can not be found|pg||

nt|woozle: 4H looks excellent NS - the clubs establish with one ruff|pg||
nt|woozle: Hard to reach though - someone has to bid an awful lot|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I have a spec says it's off|pg||
nt|sommer: Bocchi/Madala bid the 6@D too..of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs (lauria versace i think) play for example that 1nt - 2@H double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: One looser in each suit, seems correct|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H being a transfer i mean|pg||
nt|athene: EW might well try 5minor|pg||
nt|athene: east surely isn't passing anything but a pure penalty double?|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead against 5@C would be unfortunate perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C wasn't exactly best in trick 2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can perhaps still survive by ruffing hearts and unblocking the diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: lucky 3N for NS but will not get there|pg||
nt|fann4: more likely 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid this one|pg||
nt|rv: on brd 21, even on 2@c Franchi would have considered 3@d, chose to bid 2@d and subsequently changed his mind and bid 4@d |pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats shows what a great game bridge is - its longevity|pg||
nt|fann4: 3@H can make here if declarer guesses how to play the @C suit.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: meanwhile EW have 12 tricks in a cold game - it would be mucg more difficult to find @HQ in slam|pg||
nt|vbman: or his antics helped twist proceedings|pg||
nt|ppilot: here i dont think will be played same stupid slam|pg||
nt|vbman: when u have voids things are not easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and then lead the @DQ forcing west to ruff with a trump trick|pg||
nt|haans: makes slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: tap tap|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but they didnt find the sacrifice, despite Bocchi bid both @D and @S!!|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer a pitch for a diamond - then if he can ruff two hearts he can make|pg||
nt|hawe45: They will not bid 5@C before midnight...|pg||
nt|athene: and throwing a club loser from dummy when he does|pg||
nt|daman: 2@S?|pg||
nt|daman: intermediate?|pg||
nt|daman: 9-13|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1|pg||
nt|granguru: a @S too much|pg||
nt|friggi: yes both in @H and @D|pg||
nt|meggen: 6@d or 6@h on this one|pg||
nt|leanderiii: maybe the hand is to strong for 2 hearts|pg||
nt|meggen: But will they bid it after this opening?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: east has a nice hand but no bid :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|woozle: So do I. I don't think that anybody figured out the diamond tap thing without Deep Finesse though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Double?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in b 4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another slam but can it be bid|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: you surely have to do something over 3@S with that east hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: this better|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S could push lets see |pg||
nt|kemperg: good 13|pg||
nt|daman: I thought you needed 14 HCP to open 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: or good 12/13|pg||
nt|daman: ok  thx|pg||
nt|fann4: In the OR, declarer went to dummy and played a @C to the Q, losing 3 tricks.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Did she really Pass?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Needless to say, the trump lead helped :)|pg||
nt|bagman: On the previous hand declarer should have cashed 5 rounds of clubs before committing |pg||
nt|rado: after 1@D - (1H) E coud bid 1/2 NT to calm the situation|pg||
nt|rado: pass will start some comlications|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: this X is outside my knowledge:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he goes |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c prob either @c or some strong hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (I should wat ch the play more :))|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: easy 4@S bid now for south - in fact larry thinks he should bid 5@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: ("bid to the level of your fit")|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i predict 5@C from east now|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of situation where it's much better to have screens|pg||
nt|bobholl: not strong enough for a "normal" weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 1@S with that east hand|pg||
nt|pelu: I was told tyhat 13 good HCP also ok - and this hand for sure good 13 - remember that 1-openings are F1|pg||
nt|daman: I wasn't certain if the held to the 14+   as John explained in the beginning|pg||
nt|granguru: bal hands with 15-17, no M are opened 1@C then 1N|pg||
nt|fann4: A small @C towards dummy's J, and then ducking a @C next time wins.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Moa must have miscounted her hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: repsonsive type |pg||
nt|fann4: But here it's neither|pg||
nt|psyck: likely stop here|pg||
nt|fann4: Suprising initial pass here by south.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be playing here at all|pg||
nt|fann4: and then dbl instead of 1@S?|pg||
nt|vbman: dont like to take out with voids|pg||
nt|rado: nobody likes but happens sometimes|pg||
nt|ppilot: but if p passes it will lead to +score:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: ..he felt maybe too strong for jump to 4@S??|pg||
nt|athene: at club level, it only takes a slight variation in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: for west to double fast with a trump trick and slightly slower with values outside spades|pg||
nt|athene: and E knows when to leave and when to pull :)|pg||
nt|athene: i see so many pairs doing this and they might not even realise it is dodgy :)|pg||
nt|athene: decent suit texture|pg||
nt|daman: now that we have that straight...........|pg||
nt|granguru: bal hands with 18-19, no M are opened 1@D then NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)http://www.archiviobridge.it/FantoniNunes-CCard2-0.pdf|pg||
nt|ppilot: loool|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: even over 1@s pas he has no good bid|pg||
nt|meggen: Can you make this?|pg||
nt|milton_se: don't they play some 10-13? But string even then|pg||
nt|vbman: whats wrong with 3of a minor or 2nt to show a minor hand|pg||
nt|ppilot: all games down|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko's raise to 2H inadequate - that's what he would bid with a balanced minimum, and this hand is anything but|pg||
nt|psyck: strong being 15+ maybe|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: end 2@D |pg||
nt|jbennet: B schapiro won his first Gold Cup -title 1945 and his last  1997.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ireland's greatest ever woman player will be 100 in september|pg||
nt|granguru: trivia: Why the Blue team is called like that?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: played blue club i darseay|pg||
nt|athene: they formed two squads to select a team|pg||
nt|jbennet: the game does indeed have a life prolonging element in itsself.|pg||
nt|athene: the red squad and the blue squad|pg||
nt|granguru: good athene!|pg||
nt|milton_se: strong|pg||
nt|rado: missing 2@H doubled as we see:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: A spectator just messged that it shows 15-17 with 5@D and 4@H.|pg||
nt|fann4: I have my doubts.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: making 11 ruff a @S & K@H placed |pg||
nt|pelu: Ns can win 1@S and EW 9-10 tricks - so now they are on 5-level :):)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and  http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|haans: best in the long run|pg||
nt|vbman: ivanov will be in a terrible mood until he sees the score|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: could be the 1st big swing now|pg||
nt|athene: never lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit! :) ok this was a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo tends to overcall aggressively at the 1-level so he might well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C preclude to invite in @H i guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: optimism rewarded|pg||
nt|granguru: it is not due to the italian squad colors|pg||
nt|jbennet: no i think blue team is named after the bidding system "blue club"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but did they play blue or roman club|pg||
nt|granguru: The name apparently derived from the 1956 ItaLIAN trials, when the blue team defeated the red team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that solves that|pg||
nt|haans: not Blue Clibs not p clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jameslee 2: @H 3/3 for the 11 trick |pg||
nt|psyck: Papi understandably did not want to play in 1N with an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|caruga: 3@S=heavy limit|pg||
nt|rv: some might even bid 4@s on Franchi's hand |pg||
nt|fann4: this should make, for a push board|pg||
nt|haans: not Carrot|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I can't explian the bidding but 26 hcp and no 8cd fit - we expect to try 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 1@S was transfer to 1NT - South showed stronger hand some kind of conventional|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|woozle: 3H initially should incite Anderson to bid game, diagnosing the short diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|woozle: Still, making 3 or 4 will be worth 1-2 imps, potentially vlauable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree peter. I cannot see any reason for 2@c|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ is the 100% normal lead - but - again - a trump would have worked better|pg||
nt|leanderiii: Good suit but my choice i D|pg||
nt|bagman: The spades were marked 54 so playing a diamond was a no-win play|pg||
nt|psyck: he wanted to try stealing 9th before all was known|pg||
nt|milton_se: and the slam is on a hook|pg||
nt|leanderiii: y. But 64 with a huge heart suit and an ace|pg||
nt|meggen: Yes, slam is on a finesse but it's worth to be in it|pg||
nt|ppilot: lool he will calm after seeing th cards whem mist go over:)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: taking a long time to find that big s fit|pg||
nt|athene: now the problem is if declarer uses the @DA to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it was certainly an uncomfortable lead situation for S|pg||
nt|fann4: Many would just pass 1N, on the basis that pard is likely to have some @C, having skipped both majors.|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to steal a trick when opps have a setting trick to cash|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: ..and this slam isn't good...but it makes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no chance on a bad day, but this isn't one of those|pg||
nt|granguru: the blue team system received its name from the blue team memebers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: martin johnston says it was neapolitan club - well there yar|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This looks unreal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do they play strong pass on odd boards? :)|pg||
nt|j0i: Could be hard to make this one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, they play odd pass on strong boards|pg||
nt|cuttysark: or odd pass on strong boards?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (You are too quick, Bill)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sorrrry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please explain, Staffan|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Such an obvious comment - it was a speed typing contest|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what is Moa's initial pass?|pg||
nt|haans: nost prefer overcall to double Have a point this time but ...|pg||
nt|leanderiii: instead of 2 clubs|pg||
nt|milton_se:  1@C = 2+, 1@S = bal, 2@D = GF|pg||
nt|meggen: I think the ugly @D position sets 4@S|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|athene: NS would open 1@C with any balanced hand i think|pg||
nt|pelu: we have not aeen the best of Fantoni in the last 2 boards :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: strange lead|pg||
nt|daman: unfortunate lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|woozle: Klinger's "raise" to 2H in the other room just as bad, but then he compounded it by defending 3D|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: agree again, but @c10 can solve the trumph suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but can't west have akxxxx ax x xxx thats enough for 4@S|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: so they can use the 1nt rebid artificially|pg||
nt|bobholl: a@S 2@C and a@D to loose|pg||
nt|haans: have seen overcall on Jxxxx instrad of double|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: no good|pg||
nt|athene: he is banking on the diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not the winning line here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could never make it with heart ruffs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: we will not see a new leader yet|pg||
nt|caruga: 100% tied.....in a bad day or today :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: play in a BBO tournament on one of these and you are 2 down|pg||
nt|caruga: no, only 99%|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trumps 5-0 club finesse wrong to be going on with|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @HQ would be unfortunate|pg||
nt|milton_se:  South chose to bid it as bal|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: S can expect @Cs 5-3 and 4 by pd - and C10 will stop some cross_ruffs|pg||
nt|vbman: w must be wondering why pard no lead doubleton dia?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: how can u pass with that s hand unless u are a real mouse|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't expect the @HA to be onside|pg||
nt|rv: Fabio, as per Roland's mail we have 9 rounds of RR, is this last round and 2 to qualify from each group?|pg||
nt|j0i: there it went i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|granguru: turkey is awakening...|pg||
nt|caruga: I think here we have only 9 rounds and a champion after the RR|pg||
nt|rv: this broadcast heading says 6/6 and we seem to have 2 groups as well?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but just too tempting|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree about the double - you cannot afford to ignore 4card majors|pg||
mc|11|nt|ralfwil: duck!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||

nt|woozle: Buchen has a good hand, as long as he can call "Misere"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Shirley, Povi and John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: choose a game|pg||
nt|hawe45: Nice in CR - we can compare...|pg||
nt|psyck: surprising to get comparisions here, considering that they both started with same boards & Fantoni playing other room :)|pg||
nt|athene: where you want to play is 3nt from the north seat|pg||
nt|athene: is it's 100%|pg||
nt|athene: (board 7)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@c trick + 2 tricks in major = 7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be -2 as I see it|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@C depending on the (wrong) @H finesse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems neapolitan was the forerunner of all those artificial club systems|pg||
nt|jbennet: well bid NS.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps the 2@C overcall did help them a little.  Funny that N/S here have gained on the back of some very conservative passes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For newcomers. Bara Brudar in Swedish means "Only chicks". 'Bara' also has a different meaning which (perhaps) is not appropriate to mention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hmm|pg||
nt|bjacobs: straight to Google I think|pg||
nt|meggen: Guldberg leads 38-0 now, this is good news for the teams in third and fourth position|pg||
nt|vbman: or 4333|pg||
nt|vbman: l hate to defend 9 card fits even at the 3 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: rigth but very difficult with KQJ 6th |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 or 3@h from N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2h or something|pg||
nt|rv: Sabatini is a famous name in sports world, I can think of Gabriella Sabatani former beauty and top tennis problem and Rory Sabatini a top golfer from SA|pg||
nt|granguru: amazing how similar are red cards in E and S|pg||
nt|rv: top tennis player|pg||
nt|granguru: name of the winner team was the blue one...vs the red one|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: yes, this is a one way street game so far|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: nunes couldn't open a weak-2 of course as 2@S for him is 10-13|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@S ew|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@h would be my bid|pg||
nt|fann4: 3 rounds of @H would have made it tough for declarer to make 3@D. He has to ruff high and then run the @D9 - not likely to find that play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: poor south - his partner stole his spadesuit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: sorry was private|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Do not tantalise us Roland - quite unfair :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  will be interesting if they get there|pg||
nt|granguru: is there time to establish 5th @S?|pg||
nt|milton_se: considering that boards 13 and 14 are good for Goldberg - it seems over|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east knows he wants to sac in 4@S over 4@H and perhaps is trying a sort of semi-psychic bid suggesting a strong raise|pg||
nt|athene: in the hope of not getting doubled|pg||
nt|granguru: need x+1=4 entries|pg||
nt|granguru: if @D is an entry it will suffice|pg||
nt|friggi: needs to ruff 2@D to make|pg||
nt|meggen: And those two teams are also playing each other|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: I've looked in vain in the bidding boxes|pg||
nt|andyv:  they might now|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C 10-13 unbalanced with 5+@C; 2@D ask; 2@H 3 or 4 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Naked|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: the match is very one sided so far - results in from Open room show 32-0 imps over boards 1-4, in favour of our NS|pg||
nt|meggen: They are playing quite fast, 7 boards in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: compared to the other matches so far in this event, that is rather slow... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome Ralf |pg||
nt|psyck: looks like 12 tricks here on non @d lead|pg||
nt|bagman: but N is very likely to lead a diamond so there's only 11 tricks in NT; in spades, however, it's S to lead|pg||
nt|friggi: they are young and full of energy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|woozle: 3NT will certainly be reached...Brown will be happy for a certainly flat board...Klinger won't be|pg||
nt|bobholl: but should go down|pg||
nt|fann4: This is not a particularly great slam, but EW could climb quite high here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if they try to go to 6@H |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d either nmf or some kind of GF checkback|pg||
nt|granguru: Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina was 13 when she came to play to Chile a junior tourney...we saw she would be a world champion sooner or later...|pg||
nt|jbennet: south refrained from insisting on 4hwith his balanced shape and wk suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2@D may be GF relais (stronger than 2@C)|pg||
nt|sommer: "double check-back|pg||
nt|athene: 5-level is wrong yet again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is all ghetting a bit confusing since we now have a kib saying vanderbilt club was first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: something hs occurred to me over the past few days - I havent seen one psyche. Do Italians never psyche|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: snillrik13: Raptor is the solution|pg||
nt|haans: standard sweden 3@C minimum|pg||
nt|milton_se: @HQ is necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: on a @S lead it makes but on @D ??|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks a little pushy, especially NV|pg||
nt|athene: but he has all four tens|pg||
nt|athene: and all four are potentially working very hard|pg||
nt|athene: for example give partner @HJxx on a  heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: and the @H10 saves your skin|pg||
nt|granguru: well Fantoni is NOT going to lead a @H against 6@C..but over 3NT :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, strong  club methods have been around almost since the very start of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: With a weak hand N tries to hit partner's suit|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks like an impregnable 6@S here - and how could South not bd it |pg||
nt|pjs_ch: issue is that if @HQ was @CQ then 7 is cold|pg||
nt|haans: need @S stopper|pg||
nt|haans: @D|pg||
nt|milton_se: well now!??|pg||
nt|vbman: is this slam try l guess not|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Uggeri will finally get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead might be worst for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  S|pg||
nt|athene: sadly partner doesn't have @HJxx :)|pg||
nt|rv: E-W should make 8 tricks here, N-S could have competed in either black suit for only 1 down|pg||
nt|cumino: 4@D seems wrong|pg||
nt|fann4: John, I'd say most top players don't do much psyching at all - they don't have to.|pg||
nt|rado: nooo|pg||
nt|vbman: no slam after they opened??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbennet: 6322 with weak suit and secondary values in side suits.|pg||
nt|athene: the blue team played traditional methods their first couple of years|pg||
nt|athene:  then eugenio chiaradia designed the forcing club systems with canapé|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is polish the newest|pg||
nt|kemperg: only Zia likes it:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think someone should have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: whith the @d-J onside it seems like 3 @h will make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: It´s a long way... Why not a direct 4@h after the rebid 1nt from W?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 nt will be ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H made in other room on previous hand so angelini loses|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good stop |pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 7 in the OR, NS amazingly reached the cold 3N.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as the cards lay down|pg||
nt|fann4: 22 high card points between them, no particularly long suits and it's cold.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: naked chicks?   is there a webcam?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Down, Bill|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, it has its downsides also|pg||
nt|haans: all will find 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck first @s and partner will show his entry|pg||
nt|bobholl: ay ay now even 2 down but not bad play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not even 3rd in hand not vul|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphb1: see you after about 5 min.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: they were making up for the previous deal :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Yet the hand before they stopped in 2@H with 25pts!|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR - @SJ lead|pg||
nt|haans: Raptor 1nt show 5C m + 4C M|pg||
nt|milton_se: and some will be X-ed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: who started this anyway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: they like their trump leads|pg||
nt|haans: focing cue|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: is there a hand N could have without either @DA or @DK?  Hard to see any - so Blackwood might have done|pg||
nt|haans: North had no choice|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: they've got to the right place, but there is a trap - others might try 7|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: yes, she had both beauty and talent|pg||
nt|psyck: & succeds there, not with the result he was expecting though|pg||
nt|haans: Qxxxx KQx xxx KQx|pg||
pc|s3|nt|j0i: We use "bara" alot in Iceland with another meaning, now i know why the swedes always look at me funny when i talk|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: yep - just worked that out ... tks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sommer: ..4@H too..as said already with "pick a game"|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes:)|pg||
nt|athene: dunno, think we are getting sidetracked :) let's look at 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why a @c?|pg||
nt|haans: not good odds for that|pg||
nt|friggi: need @D |pg||
nt|meggen: A @d switch is needed but that will not be hard when viewing dummys minors|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: With nine certain tricks in view, Smolanko doesn't bother to duck the opening lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes sorry didnt mean to repeat |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|haans: yep 1nt balanced have no bid :(|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbennet: should be bid as 5332 (if having done home work properly then there should be possibilty to show 6 Card suit Game forcing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so lon ago i cant remem,ber yes i agree|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: @CJ on the @DJ|pg||
nt|jbennet: below 3NT.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must play @hQ now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: is there any chance to make this?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that was the OTHER red jack|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|granguru: hard to say what was predominant on her|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: lauria will have cashed his @DJ throwing the @Cj first|pg||
nt|athene: then led the @HJ|pg||
nt|meggen: Obviously it was|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see you after about 5 min.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: cash @CAK and play ace and a diamond, hope for a ruff and discard?|pg||
nt|fann4: And it's vul too, so new leader coming up.|pg||
nt|psyck: could afford safety play in @h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if other team go & make as spec tell me 12 is cold on a squeeze |pg||
nt|vbman: **(((|pg||
nt|rado: 18:12 VP for Shatteau|pg||
nt|vbman: some imps to recover|pg||
nt|rado: SiSI will we have 1 more round tonight?|pg||
nt|vbman: 1 nt made things easier though not my cup of the|pg||
nt|rado: tx to our excellent operators Sisi and Desi great work ladies|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see you ater about 5 min.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: or hope for a minor suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|andyv:  after cashing @hs, @d switch should set this|pg||
nt|athene: no play for this as long as someone keeps spades and someone keeps diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could be a big swing here |pg||
nt|psyck: only after @c lead|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: cash the @CK and run the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: cash  both clubs and run the hearts you might as well|pg||
nt|granguru: Giorgio Belladonna and Walter Avarelli played the Roman System (3 versions made)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Irritating 4-1 spade break compensated for by fortunate club position|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Trump lead was a reasonae shot here - but nothing will beat this game|pg||
nt|milton_se: now too late|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: they have to divide their @D and @S stoppers otherwise made :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another claim|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C min hav an advantage if no slam interest you may bid game not telling opps were single may be|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fann4: this will be a push, so at the half way stage MIR needs a further 27imps to win the event.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: North got an overtrick as he played the Q of @H and West then chose to save his heart while East didnt save his diamond|pg||
nt|meggen: N can't propably not picture 6@s's in partners ahnd|pg||
pc|s4|nt|granguru: Benito Garozzo and Pietro Forquet played Blue Team|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbennet: indeed he was lucky.|pg||
nt|jbennet: south.|pg||
nt|granguru: Mimmo D'Alelio and Camillo Pabis-Ticci played Arno|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and all our 10,000 kibs have a different version|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see you after about 10 min.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: thx all, have to dash,  called to do "real work"  sorry  cu later |pg||
nt|haans: the LAW has killed lot od doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see you after about 5 min.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: but a squeeze would need the diamond finesse too and west isn't going to have both minors|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphb1: see you after about 5 min.|pg||
