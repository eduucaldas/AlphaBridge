mb|2H!|nt|jcmax: Oh sigh, how can the bidding go 3 passes with all those beautiful distributions and suits? .)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: :)  It didn't at the other table|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am not surprised! .)|pg||
nt|mikam1: I thought only three Mike Kamils would bid this way :)|pg||
nt|bagman: All three first hands had an opening bid in my system :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Diamond has great stuff (for everyone)|pg||
nt|mikam1: 4@S will not quite come home with a heart lead|pg||
nt|bagman: What's XX here? and whatever it is, can it be selected?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mikam1: I actually play redouble is extras with 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: Yes, the double may have been essential to get the @H lead. But might it prevent NS from bidding the game?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: A bit dangerous by Schermer|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|mikam1: That was really a surprise|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he can score a diamond ruff |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|bagman: overruffed with the cost of a trump trick possibly|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, that's the good news|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|bagman: They might cash the spade and cross ruff their high trumps|pg||
nt|mikam1: still 500 I think|pg||
nt|mikam1: Bidding was quite dangerous given that partner could easily have 4 spades on the auction|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|c8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|bagman: With that @HQ it was unlikely that 2@HXX would have been a success for NS (and AQ over NT bidder)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mikam1: If partner can't beat 2@H xx when I have an ace and the Qx of hearts...his fault|pg||

nt|jcmax: Let's just say -200 was a very lucky escape :)|pg||
nt|bagman: That is a minor triumph for going down for 200|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Even it lost 6 IMPs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcmax: Wow, what a deal! will @H win here or @S?|pg||
nt|bagman: Cannot bid what he thinks he can make?|pg||
nt|bagman: would 4@H be spl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think W is tired (he said so)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: There you go, fatigue|pg||
mb|2N|an|NAT|nt|mikam1: As we discussed...right Roland...fatigue|pg||
nt|jcmax: Or @C? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Should Platnick bid now? or wait for further developments|pg||
nt|bagman: Surprised, that he passed|pg||
nt|jcmax: Very good question, Mike! i was just wondering myself....:)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bagman: His spades are solidish and the red suits are reasonable for 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: And what does it mean, if you first pass and then bid later? Would that be a better hand or a weaker hand or a "I couldn't make up my mind" hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: true - he has a lot of losing diamonds, though|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe he wanted to hear partner's opinion|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mikam1: He just got it...but will be surprised at the dummy I bet!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: double by Schermer|pg||
nt|mikam1: for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: well, someone will double, even if it's only for a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|mikam1: Other table played in 5@SX...down 2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcmax: In the context of the auction would you interpret this as a Lightner double?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Diamond knows there's a heart ruff coming...was thinking of running :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mikam1: Yes|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it's either "I can beat this whatever you lead" or it's a Lightner double|pg||
nt|bagman: with the @SA, it probably does not matter if you lead a heart against a penalty doubled slam|pg||
nt|mikam1: Lightner feels right, no?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, it does.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|bagman: If the X is is Lightner, heart lead might be the only lead to beat it|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, when they jump to six spades when they didn;t have to, double ought to be Lightner and not "the guy to my left is a lunatic"|pg||
nt|mikam1: Schermer will be disappointed when club doesn't cash|pg||
nt|dburn: even if the guy to your left is actually a lunatic|pg||
nt|mikam1: Trump is best|pg||
nt|mikam1: Not easy to find a trump play here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many in the audience are not familiar with the Lightner Double I am sure. So here is a link ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Doubles/LightnerDouble.html|pg||
nt|mikam1: Funny heart position, declarer should actually have dropped the 9 |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mikam1: Wow!! Great play|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcmax: Declarer is known to hold at most 3@H. well done by W!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: well done indeed|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@H I meant :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mikam1: I suppose you're right Sabine|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: Now the rest is easy for the defense; they show the club count and wait for diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mikam1: So down 4 now - 12 Imps back to Welland|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he did play Heart 9 at trick 1|pg||
nt|mikam1: 12 well deserved imps for Schermer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mikam1: 11 imps |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: If N balances here, can S stay out of game?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mikam1: I mean board 80|pg||
nt|mikam1: we'll never know :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: I guess it depends on how light you're allowed to balance with majors |pg||
nt|jcmax: No and we'll never know whether they would have made it either|pg||
nt|dburn: vile choice of leads for South|pg||
nt|bagman: I think I would lead the same spade|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|bagman: reluctantly, though|pg||
nt|dburn: would have been a kindness for North to balance, to save South having to lead from that|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well...47 finesses are on for NS, so....they might have made it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mikam1: I'll bet Roy will balance in the same position|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a signal and then 5 hearts and 2 clubs for the defense (or after the next diamond)|pg||
nt|mikam1: even though I'm a chicken...you're "probably" supposed to balance with 5-5  in majors - you know partner has opening hand or nearly so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcmax: I just went to have a peek. he did balance. You won your bet :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mikam1: The heart 7 probably wasn't helpful whatever it meant|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it rarely helps the defense to throw away a winner|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mikam1: I think he'll make it|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzff: at least the bids are bigger and they don't cover then up with their hands|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|5C|mb|5D|nt|bagman: The bad entry situaion means that N cannot make even if the @SK were onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|jcmax: Leading his longest suti definitely was a good idea for East here. It seems to me there are only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer needs some kind of an endplay to score a 2nd spade trick; a very unlikely endplay|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: 4@H did make, so two consecutive 11's for Welland|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|jcmax: And they made 3N on this deal!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|mikam1: How?|pg||
nt|bagman: This is not down, yet|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|jcmax: True, never easy to find discards in these situations|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, tough position here|pg||
nt|jcmax: but so far I don't think EW have touched a wrong card yet|pg||
nt|bagman: E needs to pitch the @HA, I think|pg||
nt|mikam1: East may have to decide whether partner has the heart king or the spade jack|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikam1: now it's Platnick's turn to guess|pg||
nt|bagman: @HA discard would not have helped as W cannot win a club|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|nt|bagman: Can he make, if the finesse wins?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe he should guess right...would Schermer know not to cover with the king?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bagman: Needs W to hold both hearts for a stepping stone|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mikam1: well done!|pg||

nt|bagman: Passing the @SQ might have been no-win play in many cases|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: true|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mikam1: Many would have overcalled here with Brian's hand as North|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: close call...poor distribution|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mikam1: I would think this would end the auction|pg||
nt|mikam1: and it does|pg||
nt|jcmax: Mike, I honestly didn't expect this coming from you! You wouldn't dream of overcalling, would you?|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wouldn't....but as I said "many would"  :) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 100% of Versaces would overcall|pg||
nt|bagman: Here S is happy to see a very good dummy; sometimes it's nice to have a maximum|pg||
nt|mikam1: My partner would...he hates leaving me in the dark in case I'm on lead :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Vulnerable most dummies show minimum|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bagman: because a maximu is upgraded to a minimum one more :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|jcmax: Well, but that's really just one point of the hand. One wouldn't necessarily mind a @S or a @C lead, if partner fancied that. would one?|pg||
nt|mikam1: true Sabine...|pg||
nt|mikam1: actually I think my partner would see it just as you said....but he does fear my leads :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Let's see how well Diamond guesses for kings and jacks |pg||

nt|athene: (against 6@H there east's only worry was trying to beat, so if his partner had an entry, it was down even without the @D ruff)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: exactly - you have to establish expert practise|pg||
nt|tejjyid: technically maybe, peer practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: earlier in the day we saw [i think] bathurst  open 1N[14-16] with 4522  16 count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kx Ax in minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry folks since they played 83 out of order I couldn't get most of the play|pg||
nt|bessi2: he had to cash the @h queen before playing a @d  then it was down|pg||
nt|roswolf: welland putting the hammer down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6  Gitelman started @HJ   where Lall immediately located @H10|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: (and leading a club might be necessary if you have to set up a club and then get in with the @HA to cash it, say partner has @CKQxx and they are 22)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|smoller: looks like needing one of 2 finesses for a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H may be @H & @S|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|roswolf: a quieter hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: in knockout matches is is unnecessary to rule on an appeal if it doesn't matter either way... I seem to recall that this is the practise but might be mistaken|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: several specs have asked but agreement on last board was making 4 only|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: well that places the @SK, if the can see eachothers cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: both E & W wrote long notes, |pg||
nt|smoller: *if they can|pg||
nt|chip: DBL by S looks wrong. In a GF auction puts yourself a little at risk and gives away your hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco now asks Bramley question and he writes another short novel|pg||
nt|chip: Here might stop a slam that would otherwise be decent.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: maybe short story, novel implies fiction|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceking: looks like it|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D = @S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|smoller: yes hip, South hadlt wishes to compete to 4@S or 5 in a minor|pg||
nt|smoller: *yes Chip|pg||
nt|daman: 3C = @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: a spec asked me where the tournament is being held.. I unfortunately don't know.. but I'm sure some of you do |pg||
nt|chorush: Las Vegas|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Green Valley Resort in Henderson NV, just outside Las Vegas|pg||
nt|chorush: In a hotel perhaps 10 miles East of the airport|pg||
nt|chorush: Actually, the hotel is in Henderson, Nevada, a suburb of Las Vegas|pg||
nt|iceking: has to be explains the bidding|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chip: its OK Steen, I'm hip to it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|smoller: its my keyboard, not me|pg||
nt|chip: Could work out well though if it gets NS off track of what they know about their relay structure.|pg||
nt|athene: the double might encourage bramley as much as anything - if the @DK is missing, south should have it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 113  Gitelman 6@H south|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss didnt find the NT opening?|pg||
nt|daman: wrong sided|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a common treatment over Precision 1@D   and since passable  there is a 2nd bid to show stronger 2-suit majors|pg||
nt|iceking: this will not have a happy ending|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|athene: but still he knows that whatever losers there are in the black suits will be hard to get rid of|pg||
nt|chip: and doesn't know about the D 10|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Greco should have bid 3@S over 3@D?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: not sure if it has come up yet    NS play odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|iceking: will probably escape 2 down |pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see that, he has min values and i doubt dbl of 2@H is gf|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|smoller: West opened pass in the other room where they were not close to bidding a slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart passes his notes to Geoff for confirmation that explanations were the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe the problem is   2@H is good pressure bid [since nonforce]   and DBL|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|royhughes: and faster|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer play a spade and go for overtricks, or just cash out for 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S from Moss    go figure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson leaves the room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many of us would rebid 2S with E hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: define  us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: If opps were Vul I mighta tried dbl with Bramley's hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I am sure that 2@s denies 4@hs Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bypassing 4@C/@D  makes a lot of sense   but not  bypassing @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco sighs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Mumbles something and the whole table relaxes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland goes to the water cooler|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson back. missed nothing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H in other room    Fred-Brad never bid|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|bessi2: what happened now I wonder.. what are ns signals |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: there are only two hearts out there, so it's safe to play the spade, isn't it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I am not sure if Greco unblocked @h 10 at trick 2 but just in case I unblocked it for him|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c2|pc|s8|nt|royhughes: He can afford to play spades -- just 2 hearts out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I expect he did. Would be very surprised if he didnt. Definitely led the 6 at trick 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Ill let you know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley needs to lead another @s here to have a chance I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D might work too    i'm in a loop, can't really decide|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is looking at all hands    -  i'd never come out of tank at the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Declarer cant get all his @cs pitched. I think a @d might work as well. Bramley puts his hand down and crosses his hands over his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Now picks up his hand and slowly fans it out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: and plays.......................................................|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|iceking: this is what you pay sometimes when you open this light|pg||
pc|c5|nt|royhughes: So should make 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room play started   @C to King    @D @D  |pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: this should still go down|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: will go down|pg||
nt|drewsky: test|pg||
nt|chorush: Hello Drew|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|smoller: It has been a long day|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry entered claim incorrectly, made 5 on previous board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: taking the diamonds and conceding|pg||
nt|iceking: alot of kibitzers have told me they dislike east opening with flat 11hcp |pg||
nt|joest: i play in partnerships where we open all 11s|pg||
nt|joest: you win some and you lose some :)|pg||
nt|iceking: this is a matter of style, like if your 1nt opening is 14-16hcp for sure you should open all 11hcp hands|pg||
nt|joest: you have to be more careful when you invite of course|pg||
nt|joest: it puts a lot of pressure on the opponents|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c6|nt|athene: playing a strong club it's easier to organize things so you can open quite light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's much more encouraging than   you can't win them all   [doesn't rule out winning NONE]|pg||
nt|iceking: it does |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|drewsky: The official WBF/USBF/ABCL rules when behind screens is that 15 seconds is ALWAYS pemitted.|pg||
nt|joest: Eric Rodwell believes strongly that defensive methods are nowhere near as accurate as offensive ones|pg||
pc|c3|nt|drewsky: regardless of the auction|pg||
nt|bessi2: often much longer,  if, for example, it is uncertain who was thinking,  if i am not mistaken|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director inquiring about meaning of the auction of the 7H hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2H is 10-13 promising 6, 2NT inquiry|pg||
nt|chorush: If the auction was cue-bidding after 4 diamonds I don't understand 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|bessi2: in that case I think 7@h should be allowed|pg||
nt|drewsky: correct, but even if it was certain who was thinking, there is NO infraction if 15 seconds or less.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: North thought 4C is 6-4, South was not sure but thought their agreement was a diamond void|pg||
nt|bessi2: ohh.. in that case I am not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: he apparently wrote "who knows" as his explanation|pg||
nt|bessi2: how long, approximately was the hesitation ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: the current questioning is about 1) was there a hesitation; 2) did it suggest bidding over 6H?|pg||

mc|7|nt|iceking: iam though not a big fan of opening with flat 11 if your 1nt opening is 15-17, the range 11-14 is just 2 wide|pg||
nt|athene: board 4 is a good example:- NS would probably not have played their club slam in 1@S if East had not opened the bidding|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Everybody asking about everyones distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 to play      needed more hands like that earlier in the set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even their own?|pg||
nt|joest: left to my own devices I pass bad 11 counts as well|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gitelman 4@S south|pg||
nt|joest: but some of the best pairs in the world play otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: as a constructive measure opening flat 11s probably is neither good nor bad, but in terms of annoyings opps, the more you open the better|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|royhughes: EW make 4@s but both have passed once|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w now have a chance to do something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: east will surely do something |pg||
nt|roswolf: east may be able to bid at his next turn|pg||
nt|athene: and west will bash 4@S in|pg||
nt|roswolf: and did|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1D shows hearts -- I wonder what is happening|pg||
nt|athene: ok, welland forgot the system or is slightly psyching again?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N/S said the entire auction was slow; E/W felt that 6H was considerably slower than the previous bids|pg||
nt|drewsky: The final ruling will be based on how long the hesitation was...if under 15 seconds, 7@H will stand, and if over 15 seconds, then it will be changed to 6@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: it felt like that to me as well... I expected a director call|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: definitely going against the field to pass that north hand|pg||
nt|pef: in the closed room schermer did not open the bidding as north.  schermer/chambers must be about the only pair in this event who wouldn't open the north hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't like that overcall very much I must say|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy is in wild man mode|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the hippy table - put some flowers in your hair and ignore conventional behaviour|pg||
nt|joest: 2|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: psychic probably|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't know what system options are for North|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@D shows hearts, that explains why greco isn't attempting to show a major 2-suiter :)|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h now will end things|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: so they missed a game that looks like it will probably make despite the bad club break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: hamp witing note for Welland|pg||
nt|chip: For Greco this is a good opening bid. Would certainly open if spade Q were the J, and probably if it were the 10.|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl shows 3@H?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS IS A MURKY AUCTION|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2NT a spade raise, like previous board|pg||
nt|athene: east has a pretty good hand for a passed hand, in a way|pg||
nt|roswolf: UNCLEAR|pg||
nt|royhughes: I suspect 2N says there may be game|pg||
nt|athene: but then again in another way he has a pretty bad hand :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, East has a good hand for having passed, but maybe a bad one for having bid a vulnerable spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes being talked out of game is a hideous sin|pg||
nt|athene: he will expect his partner to have a singleton heart but that isn't marvellous|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's ok as at least hearts aren't getting overruffed, as north has 4 (ha, ha)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Game is borderline: spades come and hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|royhughes: Are you allowed to psyche an artificial bid in this event?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think this is an interesting aspect of transfers over 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: both east and west know north may be at it |pg||
nt|athene: but you don't really want to have to try to ruff 3 hearts in the west hand|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is the one with the big spades|pg||
nt|chorush: To be clear Drew, that is the director's ruling, not the ruling of a potential appeals committee|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: even for roy I find it hard to believe the 3n call|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, by anyone.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N & S both writing notes for opps|pg||
nt|iceking: become more popular over the last years to play 1nt only semi-forcing over a 1major opening|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: yes, coupled with some artificial way to show the 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|athene: and sometimes invitational jump shifts as well|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|chip: Perhaps 3D was ART, asking.|pg||
nt|chip: Seems odd for Hampson to choose hearts, and looks like this can be beater by either tapping the dummy twice, or leading trumps.|pg||
nt|pef: 4h can be beaten fairly easily by forcing dummy to ruff a diamond.  but somewehre in the auciton hampson may have shown spade support|pg||
nt|pef: aren't we starting to run into time problems here?|pg||
nt|chip: yes|pg||
nt|pef: what's the time limit?  2 hours and 10 minutes or something like that?|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, 2:27 in the morning here :)|pg||
nt|chip: yes, 2:10 for 15 boards.|pg||
nt|pef: so we are up to 1 hour and 45 minutes for the first 9+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other treatment is that 1N still shows Weak NT but specifically 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: oddly rightsided in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland says umhummmmm|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: i should think so - these guys dont need to be molly coddled|pg||
nt|royhughes: I guess NS can beat 4S on a diamond overruff|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed there is in a way no use for forcing nt |pg||
nt|athene: if you play those it takes just about everything out of 1NT that means it really would have to be forcing|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland asks about the lead. Told Q or short. Asks shortness being.......... told 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: goodnight worthy folks:)  congratulations to Diamond team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: How can everyone be giving the match away with 6 comparisons left???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Screen down . Welland writing stuff . Greco nodding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Screen back up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: greco thinking|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy just said this is 575th board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I wonder if he knows how many cards left?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Welland fielding 4-man team     Diamond 6-man AND they had Bye into Round of 8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco still thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Other match Wolfson withdrew so Bathurst the original 10 seed in the finals|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Wish it was me losing to them instead :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I lost to the Wolfson team the previous match|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: safe contract|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it was close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 groups for that   1 says  forcing nt absolutely   the other says  semi-force absolutely     i'm sure they're both right  except when they're both wrong|pg||
nt|joest: 1Nt could be 11 or a bad 12 and could disguise a three card limit raise|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say i don't think the forcing notrump is a very good method|pg||
nt|joest: i agree|pg||
nt|iceking: i agree i could not play it forcing myself |pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: yes; no-one will really know if this is a good board or a bad board until the scoring-up :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: needs to cash|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: and does|pg||
nt|athene: you are trying to unwind things when both partners could have a huge range of hands AND no strength or fit is assured|pg||
nt|iceking: Hamman also agrees:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: the proof of that pudding is for the diners in the other room|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: i think welland psyched a transfer response to 1@C a day or two ago|pg||

pc|c8|nt|royhughes: I know I'm in with the Brits when I hear "molly coddled"|pg||

nt|mikam1: Perhaps 5@H is the right bid here...no black control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are in slam next door as Hampson just bid 5NT, pick a slam|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|Vugraphzfh: I'll adjust the score on mine after the set is finished because otherwise the auction and play will be erased|pg||
nt|joest: Hampson judging the hand too good.. with alternate spots.. to go with anything more than 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: action hands abound this set|pg||
nt|athene: do they just play transfers here?|pg||
nt|daman: 2@Cs shows @Cs     maybe they play brozel   @Cs + @Hs |pg||
nt|athene: 2@D hearts, 2@H spades, 2@S maybe a transfer to notrumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: hate the suit quality but he has 6 of them|pg||

nt|bessi2: west's hand looking better and better|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: can they recognise the non-controlled clubs?|pg||
nt|bessi2: difficult for west to envision his pd not having a @c control at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i haven't heard about  brozel since 1970s|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: they can stop now|pg||
nt|daman: I was just a kid in those days|pg||

nt|iceking: S knows slam is probably not good|pg||
nt|daman: you were old when I was young Jack :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: sorry  AL   lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: hampson now thinking of ways to let his pd declare the @h slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am asked can the opps cash out -well they can but might well not:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: this might easily be 980 for ew here on the way|pg||
nt|bessi2: vs 6@h west Roy might well lead a low @c :)|pg||
nt|chorush: so, subject to appeal, Diamond's lead is 48 imps|pg||
nt|athene: brozel was the first of the defences to 1nt which used a double artificially, wasn't it?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|roswolf: assuming south on lead = diamonds are not likely to score 2 tricks - spades likewise |pg||
nt|roswolf: therefore a club is the best hope for 2 tricks|pg||
nt|bessi2: Hampson desperately trying to get his pd to declare 6@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree with all specs who say the sequence is nizarre/strange/funny - it is awful by aspiring world champions|pg||
nt|roswolf: bizarre|pg||
nt|roswolf: but then who am i to quarrell|pg||
nt|bessi2: hampson's intention may be to bid 6@d if his pd bids 5@c maybe ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: 6@c i mean|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they are the current WC'S but aspire to be the next ones|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N/S have already mentioned the possibility|pg||
nt|bessi2: at least 3 imps for welland here.. 13 if he plays trumps right|pg||
nt|daman: I believe so|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: This all looks well-judged to me|pg||
nt|athene: lall has a pretty good hand, but on the likely club lead he might well need both pointed suits to run|pg||
nt|iceking: he does|pg||
nt|athene: specs suggest a club lead would be good, but of course north is declarer in spades remember|pg||
nt|athene: the transfers are designed to try to rightside but here they had exactly the opposite effect as north stole south's suit :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing  adjective bridge  you'd say   4N 6-ace key card   that way  Lall would know @DQ missing|pg||
nt|daman: he isw obviously considering 7   no?|pg||
mb|7S|nt|roswolf: this is how not to bid a hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very declarer friendly layout|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|iceking: might as well bid 7 as 6 is down|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: i think he should by the way.. east possibly had an easier overcall with void in @s than west did over 3@d|pg||
nt|joest: if south were declarer, Hampsons natutral lead might be the @Ck in which case declarer's losing diamond goes away on the club jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Can South score his diamond 8?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a sane contract|pg||
nt|royhughes: It looks to me like repeated spade leads may beat it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asks if lead attitude. Confirmed. Bramley says one more time so they leave the trick up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H split, @DA and opponent @C winner both in South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: Hampson will be very happy|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now the moment of truth|pg||
nt|bessi2: until they lead a @c,  if Bart can find it that is|pg||
nt|athene: it might well be a  "5 or 7" hand :)|pg||
nt|iceking: did Hampson really not dbl|pg||
nt|athene: if the diamonds don't run, you aren't making 6 on a club lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bessi2: it's not much.. but with nothing to go on anyways|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder why no lightner double from west|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s showed diamonds so it looks like Lall is just shooting out the diamonds, hoping for the queen, or maybe the jack|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: luck is on the side of the bold|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: King causes a pause|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bessi2: very difficult lead to find.. especially considering ew bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it does reduces chances doesn't it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: That is one of my pet peeves. Greco should have known what he would do on the king. Gave away the @c holding|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bessi2: nearly impossible in my opinion|pg||

pc|s4|nt|daman: this table is fast    they will finish at least 1/2 pack of smokes ahead of the Open Room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: south can win the @DK and play club and north plays more spades|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: and the @D8 grows up|pg||

nt|royhughes: but the heart shift was reasonable not seeing all 4 hands|pg||

nt|iceking: so if 2@S showed @D then 4@S could have been something like xx Qxx AQxxx txx and on @C lead slam really has almost no hope|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bessi2: how is Bart to know that his opps are in a 10 card fit ?.. pd could have a @h trick and a club lead could be the only lead to give up the contract|pg||
nt|athene: NS will hope that the other room plays 6@S-1 but of course with south declaring 6@S likely to make on the @Ck lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: many would give a positive with that east hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: ew may have to play 2N here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room still bidding  8|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well an easy game to bid and make|pg||
nt|athene: AK, 5-card major|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he needs to pray for more divine inspiration - it is Sunday after all|pg||
nt|joest: wow I'm a fan of offshape doubles but this pushes things|pg||
nt|athene: "equal level conversion" double i guess|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 1@H natural and forcing 1 round, maybe be only 4 hearts with a long suit, i think|pg||
nt|joest: it's going to work well though|pg||
nt|athene: (east intends to pull club bids to diamonds)|pg||
nt|joest: presumably he can remove without showing extras|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|athene: *with a longer suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: north must avoid the temptation to lead a @h honour|pg||
nt|chorush: they do. Welland Bramley play a strong club system so could stop at 1NT|pg||
nt|joest: on a bad day partner won't jump to 3@c|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=2/3 is the fallout from 1N rebid showing 17-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: a @S honour looks more attractive|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would have overcalled 2@d here with the south hand.. I even feel that it is pretty automatic|pg||
nt|drewsky: Ira, welland-bramley do not play a strong club|pg||
nt|chorush: Let me amend that. they do play that a one club opening followed by 1NT is 18 or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Nice club spots for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: another welland 3 imp pickup on 71 2@S-2 in the other room|pg||
nt|drewsky: Mr. Shermer has seen Mr. Moss's 1@C openers before :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: nice lead by Schermer|pg||
nt|bessi2: the best lead in fact.. when in with a @h he can play another club freezing the 3rd club trick  unless he wants to cash it and free north's remaining @c|pg||
nt|chorush: they have a good chance to beat this. Declarer is likely to win the club K in hand to play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|bessi2: welll.. not quite accurate on my part.. moss can lead low @h towards the 10 twice, forcing an entry|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|roswolf: they have the momentum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe  "side-effect" less pathological than "fallout"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson states that clubs by you would be natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  6@HX East  [Greco bid & made 5@H]|pg||
nt|athene: lall probably couldn't bid 1NT over the double as that would have been a transfer to clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|drewsky: Although the scorebaord shows Daimond up by 24 IMPS, the actual margin is really 35 as the director ruled 7@H back to 6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the argument for accept transfer guarantees 3  is that it aids competitive auctions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asks to see a convention card. Finally says just tell me about your leads. Told Russinow from 4 or more. So Greco says thats clearly NOT russinow so what can he have? told ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 109x 10x all possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  1N in West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS never bid!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Seeems to be alot of that going around|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: They bid 10 times here and never in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: lots of handling charges here even if north-south don't take their club ruff early|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|joest: i mean diamond ruff sorry|pg||
nt|iceking: yes doesnt look like this will go home|pg||
pc|dA|nt|royhughes: Tricky 3N to play on a diamond lead I think.  I think I win the king and run a club spot|pg||
nt|athene: i win in dummy and bash out @SKAx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but who's counting :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco wants the CC back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: checking it otu|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Throws it back under the screen|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|bessi2: if he does that... lead low @h twice towards the 10 he will always makes.. 2 @h 3@c 2@s and then throw south in with a @s or @d|pg||
nt|bessi2: sry.. correction.. he will have to play !Jack on the second round of the suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: @h jack|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: play for one or either major to come in|pg||
nt|athene: no way it's making with 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking cubic centimeter   guess he meant convention card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: asked about the carding . Told Suit preference|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Getting more lighthearted here as both sides know who is going to win|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: But no giving up yet|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|royhughes: interesting|pg||
pc|h7|nt|royhughes: My way is good if the diamond 10 holds at T1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they'll also appreciate that both tables will finish at same time|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: there was a 20 imp swing yesterday    so mathemagically the match isn't really over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  getting back to reality|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Reality bites!|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  a terrible place to be |pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: but you are missing the @D98 too so a lot of the time when south has the @DQJ his suit would be good enough to lead the queen|pg||
nt|bessi2: I bet Bart felt a little sick passing 3@d as it could be so wrong... but bidding could also have been Very wrong|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: who's got the @HK?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco still thinking . now takes a chug from his redbull!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if north, then it seems best to continue @C  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with @H pitch maybe it is moot point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asks if he is in his hand|pg||
nt|iceking: still a fine result 3@H was always makeing|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: i think just bashing out spades is better odds|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The 5th spade, @HAx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: He has good values and bad values; 5th spade and T9 are nice; xxx in diamonds not so nice KQx indifferent|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mikam1: It's on a finesse, but if South's hearts were Kxxxx game would be almost cold|pg||

nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: score on earlier board corrected|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: again, pending any appeal|pg||
nt|chorush: Will Moss content himself with a 1 diamond opening?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman in 2@S south|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Players agreeing that NS make 4@H on B12|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: well another solid game|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: we"re back?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry everyone, network issues|pg||
nt|pef: match has tightened up a little bit in our absence|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's not all there is to it, of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: another c*** overcall|pg||
nt|bessi2: not everybody's style to overcall there.. but pretty standard nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and more scope for n/s heree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=natural, one round force|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|pef: bramley maybe hoping they get to 3n?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Moss: OMG|pg||
nt|chorush: In America the "new" range for a 2NT opening is  a good "19-bad 21" and most of them have never seena bad 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1N from Moss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=11-13 bal|pg||
nt|daman: 11 IMPs to Diamond on Board 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: interesting play problem in the other room in 1N.. north overcalled 1@h and then rattled off 5@c tricks.. should Welland go for the make playing north with A@s and singleton @d or ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: try to reduce the number of -100|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: everyone approves of Fred's bidding|pg||
nt|chorush: In his defense, he has a couple of 10's, one melded to a J|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sure, but SOuth should double....|pg||
nt|drewsky: Ira, we are living in a era of upgrading....even I find myself opening 10 points hands with 5-5s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and against it, he has short AKQ of @H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: i see south gives north a lot of slack|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|royhughes: I meant clubs are 75% if you have enough entries, and you may be one short|pg||
nt|roswolf: that bidding was routine|pg||
nt|athene: it's good to overcall very aggressively over a precision-style 1@D because it's tactically vulnerable to intervention|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop both tables|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Surprisingly fast pass by Welland|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: that's a lot of passing with a near solid 7 card suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like his opening I must say|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland says this is our 8th 1NT contract in the last 20 boards. Informed that the contract is 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: responder can't raise easily when 1@D might be only a doubleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: yuck |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D was non-forcing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: nice to know|pg||
nt|iceking: going few down here again|pg||
nt|joest: this is brisk bidding!|pg||
nt|iceking: normal with Grues hand gamble on 3nt though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chorush: Schermer can now see how to beat this|pg||
nt|chorush: and the Welland-Bramley 1C followed by 1NT will gain imps again.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i started to type  3@D=to play   but then Joe bid 3N|pg||
nt|daman: we are 5 boards ahead of the Open Room|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hampson had to consider partner having Jx in trump|pg||
nt|athene: must lose three diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|athene: even if you managed to get some sort of elimination position, west can just stick up the @DJ so you are totally doomed|pg||
nt|athene: no way you can duck a diamond to east and endplay him|pg||
nt|athene: and you are short of about half-a dozen entries to strip the rounded suits anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west have to be awake when declarer plays a diamond off the board|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't see any way either.  And Hampson can rise with the jack if you get close|pg||
nt|royhughes: But Welland will give it a try, I'm sure|pg||
nt|athene: he'll use an entry to run the @CQ i guess - the king might be onside after all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson says: I wish you were declaring this one :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland lets out a big yawn|pg||
nt|joest: I think Grue will go wrong even if Hampson leads a low one back here|pg||
nt|joest: These suits are sometimes hard to run|pg||
nt|joest: Hampson may be worried that ducking the jack might seem logicail to partner in some layouts|pg||
nt|iceking: with this dummy i doubt Greco will ever duck|pg||
nt|joest: probably|pg||
nt|joest: probably right i mean|pg||
nt|iceking: most likely this is a cashout situation they both know that |pg||
nt|joest: after this long thought Grue might go right.  After a prompt low one back he would think "why didn't the jack smother the ten"?|pg||
nt|iceking: i think Hampson will return @C here|pg||
nt|joest: that could lead to a lot down b/c Grue's only chance for the game is to fly king|pg||
nt|iceking: he knows Grue has H in both majors |pg||
nt|joest: he might lead the queen of course|pg||
nt|iceking: i put my money on that|pg||
nt|joest: he knows from the spots that the most they have is four spade tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed and if Decler has like Kxx Axxx Kxx kxx he has to return @C|pg||
nt|joest: and hope declarer misguesses|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: welland trying a swindle|pg||
nt|royhughes: This looks dangerous to me -- might he not run into a diamond ruff on a hand that was makeable?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but roy is well versed in judging the table vibes|pg||
nt|royhughes: and I'm not sure -- maybe it's fairly safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially he puts max pressure on opps when others dont|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: now Bramley can afford to lose 3 trump tricks  [pitching @H on 3rd @D]|pg||
pc|c4|nt|royhughes: If East could put up a doubleton honor, take a ruff and exit in hearts, that would be one down if he had the club king|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|joest: good play by Grue|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bessi2: @h2 presumably shows @d interest|pg||
nt|drewsky: The defense has to 'strip squeeze declarer to beat it 2 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|royhughes: But as you say, it may create pressure on the opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt the way to bring Imps back.|pg||
nt|joest: and another good one by Hampson|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: the hand is over|pg||
pc|cA|nt|drewsky: Board 96 has been adjusted on our scoreboard|pg||

nt|bagman: If partner had only one bid and only one bid, opening a strong game forcing 2@H would be my choice :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume partner is not allowed to bid|pg||
nt|bagman: MIght be hard to find a partner playing that kind of two bids|pg||
nt|mikam1: At the other table, Roy opened the North hand 2@S - perhaps state of the match|pg||
nt|dburn: no - would bid four diamonds, which playing the "South is only allowed one bid" system asks for aces and round-suit queens|pg||
nt|mikam1: Bart bid 2N followed by 3@H...probably thought it was forcing...|pg||
nt|mikam1: can't know everything in a new partnership (even in a practiced one)|pg||

nt|bessi2: Welland's bidding style in general can be quite funky... which can make him an extremely dangerous and difficult opponent|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H forcing presumably, but north has to be tempted to break discipline and pass it anyway|pg||

pc|s2|nt|athene: same auction as before, so east has shown 5+ hearts? so i guess 2@H from west now|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe 2@C really is ambiguous|pg||
nt|athene: or hampson just doesn't care and wants to get out as soon as possible|pg||
nt|joest: obviously Lall sees it that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but wouldn't Greco bid 2@C if PASS was non-force|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he thinks it is fit-showing but it's not like the situation where you are very limited (say by failing to overcall your suit earlier or something)|pg||
nt|joest: no I agree fit-showing is overdone.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart says j with length but it is Roy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2 discouraging @H  tends to show @D values  [odd/even discard]|pg||
pc|sK|nt|royhughes: the alert said 5+H, 4+C for 2C|pg||
nt|athene: okie|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@D was alerted as a superaccept of @C|pg||
nt|joest: Grue has aproblem b/c he actually might even want to invite a @h game, something which a competitive 3@h doesn't accomplish|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bessi2: perhaps showing better @d than @h ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems plausible|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like this... maybe if I ever play transfers again I will play it like this :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with both  rd suits well held & great @C, he'd probably bid 3NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: i wonder what he does with the canapé hand - maybe he bids 1nt|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|athene: welland slightly on tilt; there are two segments left|pg||
nt|athene: no need to get this swingy|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so with Roy   10  promises the 10   but just barely??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart studying. Those that think about their discards always have 4 card suits left|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: also not really any need to direct a lead as north is on lead against spades|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|royhughes: Lots of finesses to take, but not so many entries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: canape hand does bid 1NT--Welland just asked|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|bessi2: some may feel Welland got what he deserved, but in my honest opinion, I feel this is another unlucky hand for him|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfh: Jack of @cs should make a @h play safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: But either red suit OK I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H sure seems to risk less|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and per Barry's comment    @CJ very thoughtful play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Room dead silent except for Welland making faces at me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is bidding final board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley sits up and fans his hand and then unfans it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: and ununfans it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: pulling the @h 3 out |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: headfake!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 120 board final over 2 days  will pit   Diamond vs Bathurst  to determine USA2 for 2011 Bermuda Bowl in Eindhoven, The Netherlands|pg||
nt|athene: well, yes, you might want to invite game in hearts sometimes, but north does know pretty closely what south has - 5332 with 5 hears and 14-16|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bessi2: +1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: So who won the Bulls game?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: tytytytytytytytytytytyty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know   but K J Choi won The Players Championship in sudden death|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: hope I got everyone :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: over David Toms?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   Toms 3-putted the playoff hole |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I guess Hampson wasnt ready for that play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Probably knew what to play if bramley played a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quoting    BULLS by a bunch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: thanks everyone :) got it :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: So a lot of bull|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|caitlin: hesitation on 6H bid..|pg||
nt|athene: i think he is supposed to just bid game or not when he knows his partner's hand that closely|pg||
mc|7|nt|royhughes: As the cards lie declarer can ruff a good heart to play trumps again|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|athene: you get extra style points for ruffing a winner to achieve some strategic end|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is bridge jim but not as we know it|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mikam1: However, things CAN turn around|pg||
nt|jcmax: I wonder whether with such a weak hand it might not be a better strategy to preempt in @C with the W hand instead of making a negative double.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mikam1: might be right...I guess you could miss a heart game that way, but still......|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mikam1: Partner is not barred from bidding 3@H with some 19 count, etc.|pg||
nt|bagman: Partner needs a real monster for a heart game; I would be worried about missing a club game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: if not show the preempt type of hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bathurst +62 before the last 30 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: shows his hand   making four|pg||
nt|jcmax: What would have happened onthis deal? Would both N and S have felt comfortable about passing out 3@C?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mikam1: 62 there and 59 here...big comebacks needed|pg||
nt|bagman: Axx x Qxxx AKxxx good for 5@C and many lesser hands also|pg||

nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Roy and Bill for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: welland definitely still in the match|pg||
nt|royhughes: And thank you, Geoffrey -- this was a fun segment|pg||
nt|athene: plenty of time yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 15 mins approx|pg||
nt|athene: but he was scared his partner was not going to stop over 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley: if you raise we're in slam|pg||
nt|chorush: srry I am half asleep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer in 5@S West |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: so tomorrow we will get Diamond and Bathurst. Game time at 10 in ruffly 12.5 hours|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: so with one board to go we're down to 27 imp difference with 76 boards to go|pg||
nt|pef: the match will resume very soon--in theory at 6:15, but maybe there will be a slightly longer break than that|pg||
nt|pef: thanks to the earlier commentators, chip martel, bill frisby, roland wald and others|pg||
nt|joest: ok last hand of the set|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: thx to eric and all my fellow commentators and the specs who i trust have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|bessi2: he made an action bid and was trying to rescue himself.. sure.. no one has ever done that before|pg||
nt|bessi2: my oh my... not the best play by Welland to go down in 3@d|pg||
nt|daman: last board now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: now roy might pass this|pg||
nt|roswolf: but some specs vote against|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@h?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|joest: natural 2@c by a passed hadn|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: tactical (and somewhat odd) 1nt from welland|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: most have some sort of bid for that north hand, like 3@S, say |pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect his pard makes all appropriate allowances|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I don't think it was alerted as forcing unless I missed it|pg||
nt|athene: well if 4@D is a cue it's an overbid|pg||
nt|royhughes: If Welland is cuebidding up the line, he has denied a club control :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now roy will lurch in-perhaps not|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not shy again Joe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did 2@C promise 4+  or was it  one of those   maybe bal game force|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asks about his raises and everyone wishes everyone a good match|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pef: possibly 1s denied as many as 4 spades there|pg||
nt|royhughes: something is rotten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on last hand  i'm told  Grue's PASS was normal  so if RDBL would have shown good hand, maybe Greco inferred Hampson had strong variety of meckwell dbl|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: after bd 73 welland leading the set 27-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is excessive althiugh the club hole has been highlighted |pg||
nt|roswolf: well diamond has had much the best of this set|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a 60 imp lead is unlikely to be pulled back|pg||
nt|passell: both matches  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|bessi2: Welland's operations will have to more successful if they wish to mount a comeback the last 30 boards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all for now|pg||
nt|bessi2: thx all.. been a pleasure|pg||
nt|darrene:  Cheers guys|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: will leave this room open until other room finishes|pg||
nt|bessi2: at first glance it seems like this will be a flat board|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|robinswr: lead five-card suit. if you don't have one then lead partner's five-card suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: 8 tricks.. I can't see a 9th anywhere|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: yes, west should be able to find the club lead, i think|pg||
nt|athene: on this auction|pg||
nt|royhughes: NS are fortunate hearts break|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pef: so a normal pretty dull contract to end this set|pg||
nt|pef: the heart overcall may gain declarer a trick, actually|pg||
nt|pef: unless greco leads a diamond instead of his partner's suit|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec ducks a diamond and def cash 3 hearts south gets squeezed in blacks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: WEst also |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pef: yep, hard not to lead partners vul. overcall suit when you have 3 of them|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pef: very quick claim because they are a couple minutes over the time limit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzfe: In the other match, Wolfson has withdrawn, so tomorrow's final will be Bathurst against the winner of this match. |pg||
nt|chorush: A lot of specs are asking about a potential appeal. A quick recap. NS bid to 7H on board 96 but the director found that !) there had beeen a hesitation before 6H was bid and 2) ...|pg||
nt|chorush: that the hesitation might have influenced South to bid 7H. 7H made but the result was retrned to 6H makeing 7. The board will probably be appealed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: The ruling is being appealed. It will be heard as soon as this table has finished play. We will start play in the final segment after the committee has heard from the players and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the director will tell the players the result of the appeal as soon as it is decided|pg||
nt|robinswr: too important points don't huddle and then sign off. If you're going to bid 7 bid 7 right away|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: if you keep on stopping in 5 of a major, eventually fate will get tired and rebuke you|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think West plays a diamond hoping for the ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 74 east is playing in 1@H|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|bessi2: Schermer better not play his pd for J109xx in @h|pg||
nt|robinswr: he now has an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|robinswr: entry to his hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: weak hand with diamond entry is playing it|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|royhughes: because it could go away if declarer is 5512|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing in 4   we'll actually finish before the other room|pg||
nt|iceking: this looks like will end 1 down|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished bidding  10  so when we're done, still a lot of bridge on vugraph before next set|pg||
nt|iceking: both pairs play rather fast here|pg||
nt|joest: from Grue's perspective there is a lot to think.  Many ways to make the hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Grue asking Qs about the OL...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: ...was told that if the top @S was the 7, he would have led it.|pg||
nt|joest: apparently Greco doesn't subscribe to that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Grue walking around ...|pg||
nt|joest: even if he leads a diamon to teh queen and finds himself in dummy what does he pitch on theclubs?|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed |pg||
nt|iceking: east will have to duck low @D he doesnt know N is 4-4-4-1|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  interesting problem because if declarer had @cK he would have 9 trucks unless the defense already has 5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bessi2: gitelman could just as easily have 2335 as his actual shape.. but then perhaps his play so far is suspect|pg||
nt|robinswr: must play a spade now|pg||
nt|bessi2: still.. they must not cash their hearts|pg||
nt|bessi2: that's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|bessi2: tricky hand for the defenders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: never mind   their score already posted :(|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|h8|nt|bessi2: north can play @s now or ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead signals where the jack of hearts lead is either top of three or four + to the QJxx|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|chorush: good play|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he can make it|pg||
nt|bessi2: ahh.. strip squeeze if @s now.. informed to me |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chorush: but stil makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my best guess     connectivity problem   and hand is over  players have left and are at the bar|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  but another way to give 9th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm afraid to leave|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Barry|pg||

nt|bessi2: nicely done by gitelman|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  Chamber's @dJ play gave contract|pg||
nt|barnets: unless return diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: only play|pg||
nt|bessi2: creating a little daylight before last segment|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|joest: playing for spades 4-4 plus endplay|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: now spade, diamond hoping east is down to the bare @DK and hearts|pg||
nt|joest: if diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: very reasonable shot|pg||
nt|joest: thx everybody|pg||
nt|iceking: thx everyone we will be back with second session shortly|pg||
nt|joest: they are playing the 'grand slam' in game in teh other room|pg||
