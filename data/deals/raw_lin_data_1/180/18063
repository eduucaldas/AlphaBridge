nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|pef: hi all|pg||
nt|stevo:  hi|pg||
nt|pef: welcome back to the finals|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Everyone discussing styles carding etc |pg||
nt|cherilou: hello all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pef: the bathurst time had a good last eighth with no swings more than 6 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge Hurd play light inititial actions and 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|stevo:  John Hurd's nickname is Jimmy I believe that its because Gavin Wolpert one time said why is your name Johnny you look like a Jimmy and it stuck|pg||
nt|pef: anyone for passing on the north hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: last 15 boards of the day. 60 more tomorrow|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|stevo:  i think pass is very reasonable but close|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: I don't like pass|pg||
nt|pef: of course a case could be made for passing on "jimmy" hurd's hand, also :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is close also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad says ty|pg||
nt|stevo:  not their way they play precision opening but standard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: checks their convention card|pg||
nt|pef: me too, certainly would pass if they were vul and us not|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|henryb:  now a low @d to the Q?|pg||
nt|stevo:  ealier in the tournament against Zia "jimmy" opened 1@H went double p p XX and Woolridge left  it in getting Zia to run with KQ9xxx|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pef: I gather that wasn't best?|pg||
nt|stevo:  the kids have a lot of poker in their game which I respect|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|stevo:  Zia would like it back im pretty sure|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzff: Woolridge spins the @h 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and flips it|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge has absolutely no fear and backs his judgement |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|stevo:  which can be said for many of the players in this final|pg||
nt|cherilou: must be the youngest final ever|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cherilou: by decades perhaps|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, this may be the only time nobody is eligible for the senior events|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: we all used to be young once|pg||

mb|2H|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|pef: welcome to the 5th of 8 segments in the US Bridge Championships finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: hi all|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|joest: welcome to the fourth set (of 8) of the U.S. TEam Trials finals|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: welcome everyone, Eric back on vugraph for you|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S denies 4@H unless game force|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d could be 2 andthe 2@c rebid is probably length ambiguous|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi jack & coliseum-goers|pg||
nt|pef: bathurst has a useful but certainly not unsurmountable 48 imp lead with 60 boards to go|pg||
nt|mikam1: This looks like a close 3N to start....I doubt the pass by Diamond|pg||
nt|iceking: welcome final day of a long grind|pg||
nt|mikam1: is that right?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: HI ALL|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Henry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  EW play precision|pg||
nt|henryb:  well stopped and presumably 140 at the end of the day|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|cherilou: welcome to the second set of the finals! Namrs should appear soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators for this set are Cheri, Geoffrey, Krishna and Magnus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Eric, Al  good evening|pg||
nt|joest: hey eric|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs playing a similar form of Precision   system summary forms available by clicking team name at  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Finals|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  NS 2/1|pg||
nt|joest: evening kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|pef: 2nt is probably the least favorite contract vul. at imps (well maybe 5nt is even worse)|pg||
nt|iceking: in Sayc is 2nt nf|pg||
nt|psyck: The play prec|pg||
nt|mikam1: Still...no 2/1 game force?|pg||
nt|iceking: so most likely they are not playing 2nt|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, operator likely lissed last bid|pg||
nt|psyck: *missed|pg||
nt|pef: I'm checking with the operator|pg||
nt|mikam1: If the contract is 3N, then Zagorin has to switch to a diamond here to have a chance to defeat|pg||
nt|iceking: W doesnt even have a bad 12hcp hand|pg||
nt|mikam1: He "knows" declarer has 5 hearts, 2 clubs and another spade to come|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder if the club 2 at trick one was upside down count|pg||
nt|pef: the operator tells me he is unsure of the contract--said it might be 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: dec can cover the @d9 to bloack the suit|pg||
nt|mikam1: if so, South can guess declarer's shape|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, but will he?|pg||
nt|psyck: no idea :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: I believe Fred Gitelman did find the shift at the other table...not covered|pg||
nt|iceking: thinking about when its wrong|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|pef: greco and hampson beat 3nt 2 in the open room, so an immediate chance for somewhere to a decent to large pickup on the first board for diamond|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back all:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cherilou: hello all|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Marshall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: hi all, Eric from the vugraph, welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Eric|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi eric  andy  & specs|pg||
nt|andyv:  after 30 boards, average is a little more than 4 imps per board total|pg||
nt|mikam1: This would be easier if South knew how many clubs partner had|pg||
pc|h7|nt|iceking: Welcome back|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: i can't figure out if the 6 of @ds might have been a Smith Echo|pg||
nt|joest: i.e. "I liked your spade lead", probably showing the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither pair mentions Smith|pg||
nt|kit: if Hampson had held QJ10 of spades he would have played the jack, not the 10, making it safe for his partner to continue|pg||
nt|kit: So Greco should know the spade position|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  which is normal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi henry|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and wayne|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Wayne|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Wayne|pg||
nt|henryb:  Marchall|pg||
nt|henryb:  with an s|pg||
nt|joest: right.  a little known play it seems but definitely the right one|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mikam1: "easier" in quotes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  Now he'd better play diampnds and get his ruff|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|nt|iceking: so flying start for Diamond|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jade: good evening from South Dakota|pg||
nt|joest: howdy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  trying to decide whether to cash Q@d now or ruff low |pg||
pc|c4|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  chose correctly|pg||
nt|wstuart: Seems like he's spending a lot of thought about an overtrick - he's cold for 2@S regardless.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jade|pg||
nt|kit: hi Jade|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Finals lets you access system summary forms for the finalists   click on the team name then appropriate pair|pg||
nt|psyck: Operator will enter the players names once he gets a chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 tricks but the auction was murky and i fancy we are in for some torture|pg||
nt|iceking: 13 imps cut the lead down to 35|pg||
nt|mikam1: In my partnerships I play that if the jack or lower could win in dummy at trick one, 3rd hand gives count|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: my guess is we again have  N:Grue  E:Greco S:Lall W:Hampson|pg||
nt|henryb:  The world wants to watch Fred and Joeboo. of 1100 kibitzers they have 900|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: at the risk of sounding like David Bird's parrot, hi Jade|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|iceking: same with me|pg||
nt|pef: yesterday, the bathurst team went 30 straight boards (both afternoon segments) without a single swing larger than|pg||
nt|pef: 6 imps against them|pg||
nt|mikam1: They play standard carding according to system notes, so I think the 2 was not helpful to Zagorin|pg||
mc|9|nt|wstuart: I forgot to shower and ran them all off.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think Fred paid them|pg||

nt|stevo:  1@S is very preemptive|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|!hs|mb|p|nt|pef: three nt makes on this hand e/w with spades 44 and the luck in clubs, but will they get there or come close?|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|stevo:  2@C is not pretty but really his only bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks to me like 5@c also makes|pg||
nt|stevo:  now 3@H I think|pg||
nt|pef: he punted with 2c, not good enough for 2h reverse of 2nt, anything else is just silly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurd thinking|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|cherilou: good auction|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge was worried about his spades hard to blame him|pg||
nt|pef: turns out this makes with the luck in clubs and luck in hearts|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pef: not a lot of losers, but need a lot of work to get to 11 winners|pg||
nt|stevo:  I think if west had the 9 of spades he wuold have bid 3NT as its a blocker|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: stop talking poker Stevo!|pg||
nt|henryb:  he needs at least one spade ruff|pg||
nt|pef: complicated hand.  is there a clear best line?|pg||
nt|stevo:  :) Barry is referring to blocking cards which is very common in pot limit omaha|pg||
nt|henryb:  or lots of diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurd staring back and forth between his ahnd and the dummy|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks natural to ruff @D's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: now in thinker pose|pg||
nt|henryb:  which would be more complicated and probably a losing option on this layout|pg||
nt|pef: 3nt might not be as good a contract, but has the advantage of being really easy to play :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might win and play a spade first for communication|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c3|pc|h2|nt|pef: indeed, they got to 3nt in the closed room|pg||

nt|stevo:  now trump shift looks like|pg||
nt|stevo:  but i think he survives on trump|pg||
nt|pef: once the 10 of hearts fell it seems like once it did you should switch direction|pg||
nt|stevo:  maybe need spade spade?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: @s @s works for defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: cant ruff the last @d|pg||
nt|stevo:  phew its cocktail hour at levin's house was nervous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: the 4th @d|pg||
nt|pef: this might be the first game swing of the afternoon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: LOL pour me a stiff one . ill be over soon!|pg||
nt|stevo:  i will drink it for you |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think everyone onto the @s @s defense now except Fred|pg||
nt|stevo:  on spade spade he cant cross and ruff out diamonds because q clubs is in short diamond hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the other room is visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|iceking: are we sure they were playing 2nt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: no, 250 people yawning "get ON with it"|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision 1@d|pg||
nt|pef: I'm trying to find out|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mikam1: EW system notes say 2/1 GF, so I think 3N was the contract|pg||
nt|pef: that was my guess also|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will Diamond compete here?|pg||
nt|iceking: will north gamble on 3nt here |pg||
nt|iceking: can he compete isnt 3@H forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Contract is corrected on B61|pg||
nt|mikam1: Problem is...his bid may be forcing (or at least invitational)|pg||
nt|psyck: System summary said Precision for EW & 2/1 for NS|pg||
nt|mikam1: Thanks Eric|pg||
nt|psyck: Standard carding for both|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=(10)11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, Marshall, they weren't yawning until you suggested it|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW are playing a strong @C with 2+ @D suits, 14-16 NT I think.|pg||
nt|iceking: cant play 3@H invitation here i think|pg||
nt|psyck: 14-16 NT here|pg||
nt|mikam1: So 13 imps to Diamond...what the doctor ordered so to speak|pg||
nt|iceking: N will bid 3nt i think|pg||
nt|pef: e/w can make 4h, but doesn't seem likely they will get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|pef: I think north will pass|pg||
nt|iceking: and wrong again|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks destined for 3nt|pg||
nt|iceking: Greco maybe 2 strong for 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: might just instead jump to 3nt now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  NS Platnick-Diamond also playing Big Club   Wooldridge-Hurd play jazzed up 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: he will think about it for sometime|pg||
nt|cherilou: X and bidding your suit shows this hand to me--about 8 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so 2/1 & not prec for NS then with this pair|pg||
nt|iceking: almost can play 3nt vs zero hcp|pg||
pc|s8|nt|iceking: he doesnt need much xx xx xx aqtxxxx and game good chance|pg||
nt|pef: so this should reverse the gain of the first board as e/w are in 4h in the closed room (or so I am told)|pg||
nt|mikam1: EW can make 4@H, so good bid by South...stole the pot|pg||
nt|iceking: or x xxx xx aqtxxxx even better|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|iceking: as it is this will work also |pg||
nt|iceking: but i dont really like this bid|pg||
nt|cherilou: he took a position and will make the contact|pg||
nt|roswolf: i always say thinking a lot leads too often to mistakes -imo this deserves to be a disaster|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  and their 2@d opener is short @ds and 11-15|pg||
nt|henryb:  The movement to play transfers after overcalls has not yet reached the States|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room   1@D(precision)-X-P-3@C//P-3@H-P-3N//all pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he lands on his feey|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: feet|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's slowly getting here, Henry...another 20 years:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: soloway was proselytizing for it decades ago|pg||
nt|wstuart: The 14-16 NT is very popular in the strong @C community these days.  Getting the balanced 16 HCP hands out of 1@C made a lot of difference to the Precision players.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: yes 2@h or 3N look better options|pg||
nt|iceking: he is just 2 good for 2@H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mikam1: And Hurd-Woolridge did just that in the other room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wstuart: Note that though the very popular Precision system is just starting to come around to this idea, I believe it first started with Shenkin's @C system in the 1960s and was also part ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: of the Orange @C used by Hamman in Wolff on the Aces teams.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for W to duck @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D to jackis likely|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but 4@H would be worthy of HH himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Wooldridge shows   response to DBL wasn't clearcut  either   2@C vs 3@C|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i overcall with upto bad 18 , so my x & bids are strong, & still this looks too strong for 2@h here|pg||
nt|iceking: yes Hampson must have been close to 3@C bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: but world champs tend to be right more often than not|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see all lines make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course 2@H rebid insufficient --  take away Hampson @CKJ and still game|pg||
nt|psyck: Maybe more likely to bid 3@c against a prec pair like other roon than a 2/1 pair this room, due to the @d holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|iceking: decl afraid @D are 5-1  |pg||
nt|iceking: he has no entry home if he playes 3rounds of @S|pg||
nt|pef: likely to make 4 odd here, so should be an 11 imp gain back to bathurst|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|mikam1: Those imps are going right back|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikam1: or most of them :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4  [since 1@H denied 5+]|pg||
nt|pef: they corrected the first board, diamond was indeed in 3nt|pg||
nt|mikam1: So this segment off with a bang|pg||
nt|pef: specs are wondering if 4h could have been beaten by repeated trump leads|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to play transfers here over 3@C then with weak hand you can compete|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What did they really play on 61, 2 or 3NT?|pg||
nt|iceking: 3nt|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: NS 1N opener is always 14-16|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hearts not much to crow about, but E angling for W to bid 3N, as spade holding may be tenuous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@S=waiting, not natural|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Rusinow leads probably|pg||
nt|jade: and that way its not his fault |pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: S playing W for 2452|pg||
nt|mikam1: agreed Magnus|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must be my eyes then. I am sure I saw 2NT at some point|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  j@c must as for @h switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Lall returning his lowest spade, so if his partner has 5 he will know they run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grue-lall  rusinow vs nt & suit    greco-hampson rusinow vs nt     |pg||
nt|marlowepi: also the 7 cant be a power spot|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson can also see it is lowest spade, and if spades 4-4 it can't hurt him to put up the queen|pg||
nt|kit: that is what Hampson is thinking about -- does he trust the 3 of spades?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|iceking: this will be a push 450 coming up in few sec|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is meaningless here  but  i just noticed on their system summary form|pg||
nt|jade: Q@S = 9, low @S = 10 or 11|pg||
nt|pef: yes, operator was trying to catch up and later corrected it, roland|pg||
nt|mikam1: So many sequences where transfers give you just a little extra room that's needed|pg||
nt|iceking: i play transfers after 3@C dbl p but i see its probably good here also|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks|pg||
nt|iceking: so something to think about |pg||
nt|mikam1: I actually play them on this sequence|pg||
nt|mikam1: But not so many others|pg||
nt|iceking: yes seems very right when i think about it |pg||
pc|d6|nt|jade: though pitching a @H costs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hurd playing 5@C East|pg||
nt|kit: Grue doesn't know the overall position, and from his point of view a club is safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but the real question i show can it help|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: is how|pg||
nt|mikam1: here it feels "free"...although you lose your natural 3@D bid|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W knows hearts likely to block|pg||
nt|wstuart: @D is betting that they can't run 5 @H tricks or that S wasn't winning the @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from most holdings that dont block, N would have led one|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now he has to guess - what kind of @H blockage is most likely.|pg||
nt|iceking: specially after 3@C you have alot of room|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: Note that a heart was discarded from dummy to try to talk opponents out of a diamond shift|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|robinswr: this is why you bid 3@c over 1nt and don't make a one-suited bid |pg||
nt|iceking: same after 2@C prec opening dbl pass you can play transfer only takes away the 2@D respond|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, on 3@c you can bid xfr with inv + hand, on others, more gf hands|pg||
nt|mikam1: If one can remember everything...you can play 3@S shows diamonds (but obviously only with a good hand)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mikam1: making 4 here one way or another|pg||
nt|mikam1: Sorry - 3|pg||
nt|pef: I'm a bit surprised he took the diamond finesse, but will still make 3 and that's still 11 imps|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@S playing transfers would be no major so either @D or stopper asking i assume |pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||

mc|9|nt|kit: But if Grue had held Qxx of clubs, that might not have worked so well -- could have been throwing away the ninth trick|pg||

nt|stevo:  I like his lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i thought they played 14-16|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: dead silence here|pg||

nt|pef: or even come very close|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: oh yea it is 16. half asleep here|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might win and play k@D hoping for duck by ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  according to the card 14-16 nv, 15-17 v|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: gitelman meditating|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|stevo:  not exacly happening|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|cherilou: and if not go -200?|pg||
nt|pef: probably playing for a doubleton ace of diamonds is his best bet to come close to making|pg||
nt|pef: or doubleton qj|pg||
nt|stevo:  I have to admit i like the K @D they duck it so often|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Greco hampson same auction and I know they play 14-16|pg||
nt|pef: probably not on this hand :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  im getting to use up all my bad luck running good|pg||
nt|pef: it's only the rueful rabbit who could duck with that diamond holding and be right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: that would make an interesting construction problem|pg||
nt|stevo:  to answer questions im getting its not that the k@D is such a great play I just find it to be winning they duck it with aq and aj so often|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: The tempo slows down the later rounds of the event|pg||
nt|pef: so what would you guys do after a strong nt with the east hand?|pg||
nt|stevo:  i would stayman |pg||
nt|pef: 2c wins if partner bids anything but 2h|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS probably play Smith--that should make this easy for Fred to return @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and if he bids 2H might keep the opps out of 2@h :)|pg||

nt|henryb:  You didn't know me until I was already old|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: you were old 30 years ago?:)|pg||
nt|stevo:  now he has to guess whether to play k or low @D |pg||
nt|henryb:  about then: one year of marriage to Kitty and I was old|pg||
nt|stevo:  yikes Henry |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge asking about carding but cant hear|pg||
nt|pef: boy, you seemed young at heart when I played with you, Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge leans back in his chair and hugs himself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: now fans open his cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  Young at heart but old in spirit|pg||
nt|stevo:  so is there a right @D play here Henry?|pg||
nt|pef: since they haven't played a spade yet, isn't low 2 to 1 right?  K would require an initial doubleton qj|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Expressing his thought process with his hands|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|stevo:  well qx might have ducked Peter|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|stevo:  seems like a guess to me|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pef: true, but seems less likely|pg||
nt|henryb:  If you assume that a person would win with Qx or Jx, and would win either with QJ, Ax is more likely than a remaining stiff honor|pg||
nt|pef: needs to cash the ace of hearts now to beat it 2|pg||
nt|stevo:  most people would duck qx there imo|pg||

nt|marlowepi: or did you mean Qxxx|pg||
nt|mikam1: So 2 double digit swings right out of the box|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   1st/2nd/3rd not vul   15-17  3rd vul/4th|pg||
nt|kit: but if declarer is playing clubs from the top to keep Lall off lead and Grue has Qxx, then it could matter.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but if N has Qxx, always making on D shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  47 should be pick up for Diamond as 5@c looks like it may be going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in OR, N led K@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had S been a PH, or had EW not been vul, there might have been stronger inferences leading to the overtrick line|pg||
nt|wstuart: As a bit of color, John and Brian were teammates of mine many years ago in the world junior championships.  John was affectionately named Blackwood and Brian went by Tuna.  If I ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: forget and refer to them by these names, please forgive me.  ;)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a max for their NT structure|pg||
nt|iceking: yes not like 2session yesterday first 6 boards were push|pg||
mb|2N|nt|iceking: again someone at the table has zero hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get pulverised|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: I think south will raise here|pg||
nt|pef: on the last board playing transfers would have been especially good if you wanted to play 4h as it's hard to lead a trump when you are void in them|pg||
nt|mikam1: no one ever really passes 2N when it's close, do they?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: Too bad the hand is marred by the @sT|pg||

nt|iceking: how strong is 2nt 20-21|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: 2@C dbl does not make|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: what did they call you?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Mr. Stuart|pg||
nt|wstuart: I'm not sure I can tell you in polite company.  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: drat no blood today|pg||
nt|iceking: 19-20 i been told |pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceking: if north had passed bidding would have ended there|pg||
nt|mikam1: See, I told you...no one ever passes|pg||
nt|pef: well declarer has 8 tricks with the j of spades onside.  can he possibly find a ninth?|pg||
nt|iceking: then iam not sure S should raise here looks very much against the odds 2 me|pg||
nt|mikam1: this shouldn't make...even with the spade jack on...as far as I can tell|pg||
nt|pef: yeah if 19-20 raising with a 4333 hand with a queen and two jacks looks too hungry even vul. at imps|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jade: opposite almost any range, really|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: W lucky, with this shape, to be able to develop the hand slowly against NV opps|pg||
nt|iceking: when you have 20hcp vs 4 it usually doesnt play as good as 12 vs 12|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C showed @C and higher and W passed accepted @C as trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  heading toward 3N|pg||
nt|kit: Grue might double this -- invittional auction, and he has heart stack|pg||
nt|kit: He didn't seem to give it much thought -- but that kind of double can really pay off.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2NT= 19-20(21)|pg||
nt|mikam1: If the diamond ten was elsewhere maybe...but here...defense would have to mess up|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: tough to punish opp  when  vul   especially vs not vul|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: not keen on the 5 spot lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: why not? He doesn't know Hampson has 5-bagger.|pg||
nt|jade: would you have doubled, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I like to think that I would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you lead into he bid major, you dont have a four bagger, so dont squander spots that mght grow up|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW  did make 5@c for a push on 47|pg||
nt|jade: That is a tough contract to make|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's interesting but impotant to note that after a 1@D response, 2@D was not forcing.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S hand not a joy to lead from|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  am I crazy, or is 6@c cold E-W?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both|pg||
nt|andyv:  not crazy, just hard to get to|pg||
nt|henryb:  I mean with clubs 3-2 and diamonds 4-3|pg||
nt|andyv:  be nice, marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is the standard answer i receive when i start a question that way, just paying it forward:)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Platnick should know shortly not to throw a heart I think, and that's all that really matters|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: how would they show @C and lower?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|iceking: still north has a hell of a def vs 2@C but maybe afraid pd has stiff for his takout dbl|pg||
nt|kit: I do think that doubling is a winner on balance with his hand, but I don't know if I would have found it at the table.|pg||
nt|mikam1: He knows the heart layout right now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|andyv:  can E afford to show the @c support and bypass 3N?|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|mikam1: It's conceivable he'll have to unblock the diamond king in some endings|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pef: winning the ace there seems wrong, certainly trivial to beat 3nt if he had ducked|pg||
nt|iceking: wasnt @S 3 then @S 2 udca so Diamond should duck here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|kit: Lall should not release his last heart just yet|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pef: maybe he was afraid of an endplay being forced to lead a diamond|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: well, the heart 3 survived the pip wars|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|iceking: but 1400 missed |pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should surely want to, having a maxish 1D and having bid a suit W is short in where E has  no values|pg||
nt|kit: Now Grue in cash it or lose it sitution.  That is why Lall should have led club back.|pg||
nt|jade: Greed is a terrible thing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room   same auction // same lead |pg||
nt|iceking: probably doesnt matter what count gives ducking seems always right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mikam1: Platnick will not allow himself to be endplayed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c7|nt|andyv:  now cash out?|pg||
nt|jade: at the same time.....I like greed|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|henryb:  not clear: Barnet is trying to convince me that is was cold by winning two trumps, ruffing a heart in dummy and later wndplaying East in the majors|pg||

nt|mikam1: If he bids 2N and partner raises, he doesn't know whether to bid on|pg||
nt|pef: 6d looks attractive, but declarer will need to guess the j of diamonds and a bit more|pg||
nt|mikam1: What would you bid here Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: on North hand?|pg||
nt|mikam1: 2N has the advantage of being lowest|pg||
nt|pef: south hand, kit|pg||
nt|kit: 31D seems clear for now, assuming 2@C is GF which I'm sure it is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Contract was 3NT on B61, not 2NT ... corrected on movie.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|henryb:  2@h = balanced minimum|pg||
nt|jade: though 4 x 1 might discourage him a bit|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 2@c was 2 over 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Edgar Kaplan professed NT overcall should be BETTER than Strong NT opener|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thinking, yes, but not salivating. if N has heart pictures there might not be enough trics|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i think its close call dbl isnt that pretty either|pg||
nt|iceking: but it is more save|pg||
nt|mikam1: This is the problem|pg||
nt|pef: some people play that you have to rebid 2d (with the north hand) if your diamonds are queen fifth or better|pg||
nt|mikam1: with 2N|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d would be 3 cards as no inv min earlier?|pg||
nt|kit: although actually 2NT makes good sense -- might get a club preference, and can now follow with 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Now sort of forced to bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: basically it is unfashionable to take penalties from very good players - they are mere mortals after all but their reps often save them|pg||
nt|mikam1: or not :)|pg||
nt|pef: an optional force :)|pg||
nt|pef: so this is another potential swing board|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: EW  upside-down count & attitude    NS standard carding|pg||
nt|pef: hampson and greco are on their way to slam in the open room|pg||
nt|kit: Unless the North hand has shown a minimal opener, which doesn't seem to be the case, South's pass of 3NT is quite conservative -- but right this time.|pg||
nt|pef: hey, you just said that 6d might make, kit|pg||
nt|kit: might and would are two different things|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'd be surprised to see 6@D make on this one|pg||
nt|pef: me too|pg||
nt|psyck: a swing coming up for sure either way|pg||
nt|kit: in fact, from declarer's point of view even 3NT isn't cold|pg||
nt|mikam1: In fact, they're in 6@D in open room|pg||
nt|mikam1: true Kit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: If 4@C were forcing (which I think it should be), that would have been Lall's best call toset the trump suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that seems the right auction|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mikam1: now, however............|pg||
nt|pef: indeed they are in 6d in the open room.  they got a heart lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iceking: its interesting what W should bid here and iam sure experience told Hampson dbl was better |pg||
nt|andyv:  playing limited opening bids, he may not have wanted any accidents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with that @S holding in dummy  attitude/count don't seem to apply   should @S2 show suit preference |pg||
nt|marlowepi: even SP seems otiose looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Should is always a very dangerous word when you change the meanings of signals on the fly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was the most non-committal one i could think of|pg||
nt|kit: I think that a signal should always have its default meaning unless the kibitzers 5 tables away and the janitor know it doesn't.|pg||
nt|andyv:  their notes say trick one exceptions on lead showing AK but don't tell you what the exceptions are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it right to define @S2 as suit pref   when dummy holding rules out need for attitude/count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at least that way default is not yours in de postmortem:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise UCDA and primary attitude signals|pg||
nt|jade: Whatever is the most meaningful signal to the person playing the card|pg||
nt|kit: the most meaningful signal is the one partner is sure to interpret correctly|pg||
nt|jade: exactly|pg||
nt|andyv:  told it was standard|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|wstuart: I hear that 2@C was 1 rd force initially, but I don't know they're system after that point.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|kit: is it so clear that the spade suit is known?  Gee, I'll bet none of us have ever overcalled on AKJx.|pg||
nt|jade: That good?|pg||
nt|jade: Sometimes I might have AKTx|pg||
nt|jade: or worse...|pg||
nt|kit: But my point is, if East has overcalled on a 4-bagger then he doesn't know that the play is intended as suit-preference|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some play ace attitude king count or the like|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer unfortunate that short diamonds on his left and short hearts on his right|pg||
nt|jade: Why is it necessary to change here? There was also an auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if in effect here, affect the pertinence of some of our observationbs|pg||
nt|jade: touche|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wstuart: *their|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|robinswr:  1@d pass 2@c is a very difficult auction in standard as you can see from this article http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202008-10a.aspx|pg||
nt|pef: spade to king and float the 9 of diamonds?|pg||
nt|kit: probably spade to king and ride 9 of diamonds now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|kit: Not clear to Greco whether to ruff this since he is rufing air|pg||
nt|compton: hello all, did not realize that i am a live commentator|pg||
nt|andyv:  better then a dead one, Chris|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can take 7 trump tricks, 1 heart, and 2 diamond -- he need onemore trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: E playing with fire|pg||
nt|wstuart: Risky line of play?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to say the least|pg||
nt|wstuart: the @H hook is 50%, East thinks he can improve on that because....  if S didn't lead one to start, maybe they either can't take 4+ @S tricks or he wont' lead them again.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade shify should be fairly clear on the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS do play udca so 4@h may have encouraged this line of play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S can count eight trix for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there's a lot you don;t realize:):) welcome amigo|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pef: now spade k and a diamond?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pef: this seems strange|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  he worked it out|pg||
nt|pef: he may have just held himself to 3|pg||
nt|kit: I think he miscounted his tricks|pg||
nt|pef: seemed like 5 was cold for awhile|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: surely N doesn not have ALL the hearts, so only chance is that N has Axx of spades|pg||
nt|pef: he had at least 3 spades, 3 hearts, 3 diamond, and 2 clubs by my primitive counting system|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: Now he can ruff one heart low, 2 hearts high, and the ace of diamonds lives, so he will make|pg||
nt|jade: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|kit: he had for sure 3 spades, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: the good news for him is that he will drop the jack of diamonds, unless he again miscounts his tricks|pg||
nt|pef: seems like bathurst doesn't deserve to be gaining imps on this board, but likely they will|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|pef: surely they will now that we see the result|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|iceking: Mike Passell knows this pair well and says Grecos style with W hand would probably be 1nt overcall, so often even pdship like this ew who played toghether for many years see things ...|pg||
nt|iceking: different |pg||
nt|mikam1: Well, not clear Peter...6@D is no lock|pg||
nt|kit: well they did get to a much better contract|pg||
nt|pef: unless he now takes a diamond finesse and goes down 1 to still gain 2 imps, that would be bizarre|pg||
nt|mikam1: Of course for all South knew, partner could have had the same hand with QJTxx of diamonds...then.........|pg||
nt|pef: true, as we all agreed, but I thought their auction was better in the open room|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: I think Greco had to not ruff to defeat the contract -- not sure|pg||
nt|kit: looks like just nerves -- if hecounts his tricks right he wouldn't be thinking at all here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mikam1: That's why he was worth another bid|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|an|South alerted|mb|p|nt|stevo:  many pairs would play Souths double as showing 3 hearts doesnt look like they play that or mabye he called it 3?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i wonder if N can snaggle a funny position against E who has both majors|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge did overcall 1N   he's younger than Hampson|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it may not, right. but isnt it more likely than there is no spade danger?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: South had this thumb on low spade for quite a while before he played it|pg||
nt|henryb:  East refused the @h finesse at the other table also|pg||
nt|wstuart: nice to have some way of making a dist 3 card limit on this hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: rsearch project for a graduate student|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after opening PASS, Moss did get to 5@C on 49|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Lall glad he has good spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: the question now is, will Zagorin-Bathurst be able to handle that kind of disaster psychologically|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: othewise opening 1C at these colors would be inviting army ants|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Some folks play 2NT as LR+ and 3+ trumps.  That has a lot going for it if you can move the natural 2NT bids into another auction.|pg||
nt|pef: uhoh, has to play 3nt again|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: transfer over 2N rebid??|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 4@D autosplinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s wont go overboard here - he says confidently|pg||
nt|iceking: if they play like that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H length purely coincidental|pg||
nt|pef: or not, actually 5c seems like a better game|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N rebid shows 17/18|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now @D shortness|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder if 1@S showed an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|pef: I know 5c goes down, specs.  but it is a better game than 3nt on a heart lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: so is this mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if alert says  short in your suit   or just as Magnus says  mild slam try|pg||
nt|iceking: so north will check keycards now with his maximum|pg||
nt|roswolf: my confidence ebbs away the more north thinks|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have like to show my shortness here, even N did open 1@D its usually the key reach slam show your shortness|pg||
nt|psyck: I play Xfrs after 2N rebid as Inv+ hands too & so this would be a mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diamond platnick will have strong 1@C auction   that will give them more room to explore|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lack of imagination is a blessing|pg||
nt|iceking: dont understand this bid at all|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@S may well now be bid:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick  3N north|pg||
nt|iceking: why not just check out keycards |pg||
nt|psyck: N did not check KC to check for trump quality instead maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because keycards won't give enough info|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant believe if 4@S here is slam invit 4nt is 2 play that doesnt make any sense to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this focuses directly on trump suit|pg||
nt|cherilou: 5@S sure seems aggressive when partber probably showed some mild slam interest and you have 2 little @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you want to be in slam opposite  @SAQxxxx  @CA ?|pg||
nt|iceking: north hand is super slammish though he has max in hcp and no jack in hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is utter lunancy if you ask me - but i am not playing for a place in the BermudaBowl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is an awful lot to bundle into a jump that takes us to the 3 level|pg||
nt|kit: The double of 2@D ends any chance that Platnick could find a brilliant heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Right Magnus, normal to make a try after this seq|pg||
nt|cherilou: N has minimum for his 2NT bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me IFF [keyword] bidding over 4@S  that 5@S is best bid|pg||
nt|psyck: N has a very good max as 2N is 17-18 for them|pg||
nt|iceking: that will just have to happen then, bypassing rkcb is just crime in my books as there is no defense if you reach silly slam with 2 keycards missing |pg||
nt|psyck: South should have just rebid 4@s on 2N maybe|pg||
nt|cherilou: S had entire 5 level to que bid and didn'r--N should pass 4 @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has no real extras - and his trump suit is not really robust|pg||
nt|iceking: its little soft not try for slam with south hand i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry entire FOUR leve;|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: the trick was to play 3nt from the north hand, as platnick would be hard pressed to find a heart lead from his hand|pg||
nt|kit: Potential swing -- played from South side, heart lead would have happened|pg||
pc|d4|nt|iceking: anyway they are at save level|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment but a scary few minutes|pg||
nt|pef: plus bathurst may be a better counter :)|pg||
nt|kit: and it did in the other room, so will be more IMPs for Bathurst|pg||
nt|mikam1: Every hand an adventure here :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iceking: safe sry|pg||
nt|jade: Fast hand|pg||
nt|jade: for about two tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the limited nature of 1@H  meant Lall wasn't tempted to explore slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S can only be motivated by possibility of a 4S save. but why not bring both blacks into pictures. enhances chance of club lead etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  also the limited nature of Justin's hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: i like LR+, but only with 4+ trumps|pg||
nt|kit: 6 heart tricks, 2 diamonds, 1 spade.  Is there a tenth?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|iceking: now @S to ace @D to dummy and @S to ten|pg||
nt|cherilou: 2nd hand of the five we've watched where bad bid caused no harm. |pg||
nt|jade: I would have chosen 2C|pg||
nt|ferlema: some more photos from last set in www.confsudbridge.org|pg||
nt|andyv:  doing so also gives additional info to opps when it's unlikely that you will win auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wstuart: Not really.  You make 2NT LR or slammins and put the bal min @S GFs into another sequence.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, must be you, mike, for 30 boards in a row yesterday, it was mainly a tense fight over part score swings.  here we have one game/slam swing after another|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iceking: ugh|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: halfway point of time just expired|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that;s true in general, but if your reason for bidding is hoping to fetch a good save, why not expand the search?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: now heart shift limits him to one ruf, and the diamond ruff will be 4 tricks for the defense -- 2 clubs, 1 spade, 1 ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jade: I also think 2@C chews up more real estate|pg||
nt|kit: But the spade shift might not work so well|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: Now declarer can get back to his hand via spade ruffs, and take 7 trumps, 1 spade, 2 diamonds|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfh: grue (laughing): back to this position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would @D play work if  greco shape was  5314|pg||
nt|jade: I am not sure I would have chosen this line|pg||
nt|kit: no.  I don't understand why he didn't just ruff club, queen of spades, spade ruff, draw trumps, claim|pg||

nt|kit: Now Grue still has to guess what to do|pg||
nt|jade: what guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Grue taking break to get some water|pg||
nt|kit: if trumps now 1-1,ruff diamond and claim|pg||
nt|jade: I believe that the contract is now dead as a doornail|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand would be easier to play if E had shown a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|kit: on actual layout he has worries, but spade ruff, club ruff, spade ruffis okay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: king of D, later ruff club|pg||
nt|kit: since king of diamonds lives|pg||
nt|jade: what about the fact he has already lost 3 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: but he has to decide which to play for|pg||

nt|jade: as I predicted....a fast hand for two tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  stay away from those tables, Kit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|wstuart: You have plenty of room to demux which hand it is after a 3@C ask then.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: another bits and pieces hand|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|iceking: bidding will end here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and then you can start your actual bidding at the four level:)|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@C nominally 11-15 with primary @C.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 49  Moss went down in 5@C|pg||
nt|pef: well he could have cashed one spade and thrown platnick in with a heart for the spade return after cashing one more club first, but really unlikely to be that hungry at imps|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: ew range varies  4th & 3rd vul = 15-17  otherwise 14-16      ns always 14-16|pg||
nt|iceking: @D lead looks normal here|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS will get to 3N here|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he has that|pg||
nt|pef: yet another wild board for our observation|pg||
nt|kit: apparently West doesn't have a bid to show weak hand with long spades immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i guess not|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing lead|pg||
nt|jade: DO we know the line he took?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  makes it hard for Wooldrtdge to bid 3N|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think the only consideration is whether to open 1@H or 2@C.  Openeing the bidding is a certainty with the east hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought N would bid 3N with his hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not close for me, 2C is the better suit & more preemptive|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Hurd should try 2N rather than 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4th highest of longest and strongest though|pg||
nt|iceking: @D lead in open room |pg||
nt|cherilou: that usually works the best--S following tried and true|pg||
nt|iceking: this lead might not matter though|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS still have time to get their @S, 2@H, 3@D and @C|pg||
nt|kit: you can see it from the movie Jade|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: i remember reading about rubber bridge games in england   there was a cash pool for winning 1st round of a suit with the 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: this looks best |pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is something to be said for a 1N rebid by W|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson might have rebid 1NT with his spade stopper|pg||
nt|jade: true enough, just wondered if it was anything unusual|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wstuart: N doesn't have enough to bid 3NT.  But he can make a vlaue showing 3@D which is both safe and allows S to bid on with an above avg hand.|pg||
nt|pef: 4 of either major is a tricky proposition, but 4h might fetch without a trump lead losing only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|mikam1: is this auction forcing?|pg||
nt|kit: Even with lucky spade lie 3@S looks to be limit -- but hearts plays very well unless South finds an impossible trump lead|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, agreed Peter|pg||
nt|psyck: NF auction|pg||
nt|psyck: normally correcting a suit at 3 level is frc, but not in this case with limited hands|pg||
nt|pef: and the lead is up to 56 imps now|pg||
nt|mikam1: in spades you're quite lucky not to have a trump loser, but still might not make game|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: now Zagorin needs to go for @S|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like 3@D|pg||
nt|pef: on a diamond lead I don't see any way to make 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: someon somewhere did a very long BOREL simulation and found that 4th highest of longest and strongest gain most tricks in any denomination over 51% of the time- a mind-boggling ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: statistic|pg||
nt|iceking: Ten would have been better i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: @S 10 is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid = 11-13 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: for example, if E has a bad hand with long mediocre hearts, he could bid 2H over 1N but will probably pass 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  biggest difference seems that Greco ruffed air here on @d and Hurd was able to ruff K@d|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a mixup -- apparently Lall thought his double of 2@D was penalties, Grue did not think so.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes new partnerships dont discuss what auctions mean at such high levels:)|pg||
nt|jade: Or maybe given his hand, he hoped it was takeout|pg||
nt|kit: and it will be an expensive mixup, as they don't have anything close to a home.|pg||
nt|kit: but in hearts you have 3 trump losers, yet can make game on no trump lead I believe|pg||
nt|mikam1: well, at least he'll go plus|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  and how does South guess that North has a club stopper?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem is, there are many hands WITHOUT extras than can make game|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why I prefer 3N...5 card suit and Q@c somewhat protected|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamonds is higher than clubs so cant ask for the stopper|pg||
nt|wstuart: If the t/o DBLer bids 3NT after a 3@D jump, should N think that he is taking is DBL back?|pg||
nt|andyv:  their requirements for dbl may be less once pd is a passed hand, so 3@d may be the saner bid for them.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2N is plenty on N hand. there are holes everywhere|pg||
nt|kit: but will Greco know to pass now, or will he think his partner has a stiff heart?|pg||
nt|jade: it will be expensive if Eric passes|pg||
nt|kit: Everybody plays these doubles as takeout, it seems, so partner never knows when they can pass.|pg||
nt|jade: and even then, Joe might get out for down 3|pg||
nt|jade: or 4|pg||
nt|jade: or 5|pg||
nt|jade: I think he will get out for down 2|pg||
nt|kit: I believe this sort of low-level double should always have at least a doubleton in their suit, so partner can pass with 4.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Lall's first pass apparently showed 1 spade, as he could have XXed to show 2 (per Grue)|pg||
nt|kit: I'm not so sure he will make this -- we can see how to make it, but he doesn't know QJ of spades is doubleton|pg||
nt|mikam1: Each EW player had a tough decision here...Diamond does have playability for hearts|pg||
nt|kit: so he will be trying for something else|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|iceking: so 3@S 2@H 2@D for onedown|pg||
nt|cherilou: Now 3@S, 2@H and 2@D|pg||
nt|cherilou: E just can't get to 7 before NS do|pg||
nt|roswolf: a small gain for diamond|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pef: he might try to ruff a diamond and lose 2 hearts, a spade and a diamond given how good his spade spots are|pg||
nt|pef: that works also, doesn't it?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|jade: more reason Joe should pass 2@D doubled|pg||
nt|kit: now ace of clubs, diamond ruff, clubscash, 4th round of clubs for 7 of hearts uppercut I believe.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: he will be looking to take club finesse for what he thinks is his ninth trick|pg||
nt|pef: and if bathurst plays a trump, he'll first see if it's qj doubleton before doing anything else|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes Kit...if he could ever get to his hand!|pg||
nt|kit: so he might play a heart now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|pef: but why does he need the club finesse, 6 spade in hand two aces in dummy, and a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: We need to see some imps soon :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: I think Lall had clear pass of 2@D.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mikam1: so much for the club finesse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jade: I agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totakky, esp w comfy lead|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: right -- this looks like the correct line of play|pg||
nt|mikam1: He doesn't know he has 6 spades in his hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: is the counting problem infectious, kit?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sA|nt|iceking: first 6hand all push|pg||
nt|iceking: dont see that often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well it was hard to imagine the teams maintaining the 5 imp per board average|pg||
nt|kit: hardly comfy lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  they got here by being super aggressive...hard to turn that off all of a sudden|pg||
nt|jade: but Lall did not and that means I still think Joe should pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but superaggressive in what kinds of situations?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  now the uppercut|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikam1: we know it, because a spade honor drops|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pef: oh, true, easier to count when you see all the hands :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|mikam1: that's the counting problem here...but maybe he has to assume it (on best defense)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|pef: I meant he could see if an honor drops first and then take the club finesse if necessary|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|kit: still, he needed a lot of luck to lose only 1 spade trick after ruffing with ace of spades|pg||

nt|pef: they stopped in 3h in the open room, did not get a trump lead, so will make 4 most likely to gain 1 imp|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: yes--I like this slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: DBL probably both minors here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is this a scramble or a transfer to clubs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't think that looking at his @s holding|pg||
nt|henryb:  DBL is "I had a trap pass over 1@s|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sry 2NT probably both minors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  which might have made a good investment for E to pass|pg||
nt|henryb:  either that or "I have a weak hand with long clubs"|pg||
nt|mikam1: probably puppet|pg||
nt|kit: puppet Stayman I would guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: correction   3N did show max   3@C rebid with all minimum hands    [thanks mike]|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is appears to be a squeeze on 50|pg||
nt|pef: ah, of course|pg||
nt|pef: thought for a moment they played weak nts, actually 14-16|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: W has a lot of useful cards, even with his @d wastage|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this is a slam try sequence i am told|pg||
nt|wstuart: Some play Lebensohl on some of the t/o DBL auctoins, such as (1@S)-P-(2@S)-DBL-(P)  but I don't know that many would play it on this auction.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Of course, given that west is likely to have long @S, short @H and a good hand, easts 2NT as natural and forward going has a lot going for it, too.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it doesnt look like a hand that yearns to play in NT to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the answer is....:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a grammar squeeze?|pg||
nt|jade: 9, 10 or 11?|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to find safest way to take 4 club tricks.  Anybody know what that is here?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mikam1: Kit, any chance you would have opened 2@S as South here?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: too tuf though :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some discussion, Diamond thought 2S would be minors and 2NT was natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  which sounds right|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will play ace of clubs first, guarding against 4 clubs in North hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck: at least they tried|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 6@H in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some relayers reverse   here 4@C puppet 4@D then 4@H slam try    others use direct bid as slam try  "puppet" to signoff|pg||
nt|cherilou: They bid it in open room so we'll see some imps|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe Hampson should have been more agressive here|pg||
nt|iceking: KJ of @C just has to be gold|pg||
nt|cherilou: @C J is a huge card|pg||
nt|roswolf: BATHURST BACK INTO THE LEAD|pg||
nt|marlowepi: king|pg||
nt|jade: my mom plays low to the 8\|pg||
nt|kit: I think club to 10, but not at all sure.|pg||
nt|jade: I have seen good players actually lead the 10 here|pg||
nt|pef: there is always a chance kit will preempt, particularly nv vs. vul. :)|pg||
nt|kit: is there any chance I wouldn't have :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: out of turn, too|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mikam1: They did in the other room...and blew out the opponents|pg||
nt|kit: if I mis-sorted my hand I might not|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jade: after crossing.....|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  If double is a trap, surely 2@s should be natural|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|nt|pef: to give you some idea of kit's partnership style.  his regular partner, fred steward held jx xx k10xx qxxxx nv vs vul and opened 3c earlier in this tournament|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|wstuart: That also makes sense.|pg||
nt|kit: Would have been more interesting on heart lead.  If defenders could make declarer think hearts 5-3, declarer could not afford to lose a club trick -- so might go down trying for ...|pg||
nt|kit: diamonds 3-3 and then spade finesse.|pg||
nt|mikam1: I TOLD you these preempts work Kit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jade: 48 imp lead now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still 60 boards to play tomorrow|pg||
nt|pef: was that routine, kit?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: but it could be a trap with only 4S. and since S not likely to open fourbagger at these colors, not sure that is the best treatment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i mean|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think if someone offered Platnkc -2 here he would jump on it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Diamond: We haven't discussed this auction. Obviously.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Good spade suit, white vs. red...believe it or not, even I might have done that one :0|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mikam1: So this will be 11 imps to the trailing team|pg||
nt|kit: I do preempt a lot, but I really think it should be right for any style on that South hand|pg||
nt|psyck: Even not playing Muiderberg or something, many would open 2@s here, with the vul, good suit, & side distribution|pg||
nt|pef: of course they don't always work.  I lost a vanderbilt match to the diamond team when hampson, holding aq10xxx of clubs nv vs vul did not open 3c when my teammate did.  3c ...|pg||
nt|pef: propelled them into a horrible vul. 3nt that was unbeatable.  without the preempt we avoided 3nt on our balanced 17 vs. 6|pg||
nt|psyck: some like to treat 5 card suit with a side 4 carder as a 6 card suit...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|kit: the 2@S opening was quite effective in open room.  West might have overcalled 2NT, but that could go for a number on a bad day.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|d2|nt|mikam1: Fourth double digit swing in 7 boards|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|kit: however not overcalling can lead to a missed vul game, so it isn't clear which action is "safer"|pg||
nt|pef: yep, after none in 30 yesterday|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pef: would you bid 2nt there, kit?  would it depend at all on state of the match?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|h9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mikam1: To be honest, the hands here wouldn't have even been described as that swingy...on a single dummy basis|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: good pickup for the pair playing standard|pg||
nt|roswolf: played it well|pg||
nt|kit: would have nothing to do with state of match, that's for sure|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pef: or perhaps on your opponents preempting tendencies?|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: would just be a judgment call -- I think it is a close decision|pg||

nt|pef: specs are asking me why hurd didn't bid 2h.  I think it's becfause his hand is a bit too good nv vs. vul and has good cards for play in the other two suits|pg||
nt|pef: what do you guys think?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|pef: now that's cruel, Barry|pg||
mb|p|nt|jade: just waiting for the sonambulists to cath up|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  I agree with Hurd hand too good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: well bid to the rightside|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pef: always play nt when you hold qx, right?|pg||
nt|stevo:  its very important to know if 3@H shows stopper here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|stevo:  which i think is very good way to play it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|stevo:  or advance q-bid slam try|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|pef: well he has a bit of both, doesn't he|pg||
nt|stevo:  well not really a slam try that would be way to hungry|pg||

nt|wstuart: Yep|pg||
nt|jade: true enough|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 boards in closed room taking over 75 minutes to play|pg||
nt|jade: are they breathing?|pg||
nt|kit: but I would probably pass|pg||
nt|pef: back down to 46 imps in this ping pong segment|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|mikam1: Well, NS have a slam...probably unbiddable, except by accident|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: another bidding test but easier to pass this time|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt  is 14-16hcp |pg||
nt|cherilou: this would be excellent slam if W's red suits reversed|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting auction anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=4/5@S|pg||
nt|kit: Quite a North hand -- opening bid on your right, and you nearly have slam in your own hand.|pg||
nt|mikam1: or the opponents helping out|pg||
nt|pef: six hearts is awfully good on this hand, is it possible to reach?|pg||
nt|psyck: Specs cannot complain about non swingy hands anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: maybe east has some bid to show @H shortness with both minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = @D|pg||
nt|cherilou: transfer to @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S pass this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not everyone would reach 3N on this lot|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sure|pg||
nt|mikam1: North has to guess how high to push, unlikely to get any help from partner|pg||
nt|kit: sure it is possible to reach -- North might just up and bid it.|pg||
nt|mikam1: true Kit...as I said, partner is not going to be assisting|pg||
nt|psyck: don't get dealt 2 loser hands daily after all|pg||
nt|mikam1: interesting to note....both tables are at the exact same point in the auction :)|pg||
nt|kit: hope for king of clubs in partner's hand, or no club lead and enough of some red suit in partner's hand to be able to draw trumps and discard club losers|pg||
nt|pef: suppose bathurst bids 5h here, is the king of clubs in the south hand enough to bid 6 on?|pg||
nt|mikam1: North thinking right here after 1@S-2@S-3@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: and i think might include weak 5@D & 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: then will 3@H show shortage|pg||
nt|iceking: if so then w would not bid 3@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C no super-accept of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might need better @D for 3@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a positive fit perhaps?|pg||
nt|cherilou: does W like or not like @D's with 3@C call--everyone plays one of the 2 methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what is default for "accept"   A/Kx  Hxx  Qxx  |pg||
nt|psyck: If as Al suggests, then E can pass with weak 55 minors here|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|iceking: that doesnt make any sense then they are in 3@C on 5-2fitt with 5-3 @D fitt|pg||
nt|cherilou: have to decide like or don't like no middle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW   1N-3@C = Puppet Stayman   1N-3@D = game force 5+@D & 5+@C|pg||
nt|kit: South won't be bidding anything whatever North does -- North will have to gamble it himself|pg||
nt|pef: he took the low road|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: remember 1nt = 14-16 0nly so east knows they are light on values for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S probably exactly 3@S|pg||
nt|mikam1: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: vwd|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade best|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for N not to bid, and 2@d would be a spade raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  and answer is no|pg||
nt|wstuart: He's far from cold in practice.  Don't pregloat them.  :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, only question was if he would pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but S doesnt have a clear 3N, and if he bids 2N maybe not all Ns would go, esp NV|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: halfway time limit just sounded|pg||
nt|wstuart: I must say, 3NT was not my first choice of rebid with the S hand.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wstuart: however, I would pass 1NT before rebidding 2@S with that suit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ouch|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think 2@s was in the radar|pg||
nt|pef: greco still pondering |pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: ok well done no danger go past 3nt now |pg||
nt|cherilou: no, just in case E was 5-5 weak in minors--not on this hand. Now 3@H is shortess and W's red suits have been described|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe i spoke to soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener shows @H holding for 3N    if Qxx is enough that implies  east hold @DAKxxxx   but that holding goes to game without asking|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the long tank suggests a further try may be made|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room|pg||
nt|mikam1: You "could" bid 4@S followed by 5@H...then blame partner for leaving you short of slam :)|pg||
nt|pef: or go down on a really bad day|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: I think that is too conservative.  5@H big favorite to make.  I like 4@S by North.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cherilou: then 3@C must have been like @D's--only reason to bid again with E|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|iceking: so 4@C looks like rkcb |pg||
nt|roswolf: agree sheri|pg||
nt|iceking: just guessing though|pg||
nt|roswolf: cheri - sorry|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes it does look like KC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  3@C said not @D good enough for 3N  and 3@H said i have game force [slam try] with 6+@D and short @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: in that case a quick sign off is in order|pg||
nt|iceking: so east is just overbidding now continue over 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 4@h rkc|pg||
nt|cherilou: hmmmmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right sided:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if so, then 2@s just min. hand/2@h?|pg||
nt|kit: This is a good example of the power of double showing 4or 5 spades -- East is on lead vs. spades.|pg||
nt|robinswr: I don't think you should Michaels when your major is longer than your minor|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pef: steve robinson has just joined us, welcome, steve|pg||
nt|mikam1: "You had 3 trumps and the club king...how could you pass"!!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|kit: Normally I would agree Steve, but when you can drive to the 5-level on your own there is not difference between a major and a minor.|pg||
nt|mikam1: But if you don't bid Michaels, you have to double...then it can get messy,no?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: they do appear to be groping around in the dark|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like some misunderstanding |pg||
nt|cherilou: N might lead @HA with @DK|pg||
nt|iceking: it seems like Hampson is responding to rkcb and Greco is just bidding natural 4@C|pg||
nt|psyck: Strange after E knew of @h wastage after 3N on 3@h showing shortness|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoa c'est tres incroyable|pg||
nt|henryb:  clearly declarer needed to play @d first, but that was not at all obvious|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|cherilou: seems pretty crazy|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is very hard for East to play a low spade -- we can all see that would beat it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not obvious, but maybe correct. if E has heart ace W will have a spade card so defence wll have the tempo. this may be the layout you have to play for|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cherilou: this bad bid will cost|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: now sit back and wait for the trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have guessed 4@H RKC @C  [bid 4@D to agree that suit]|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see in this bidding 4@H cannot be meant as quebid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  so it could still be beaten, but much much harder|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|iceking: reason is you do not que bid King after pd shows shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge playing 4N West|pg||
nt|iceking: aha so maybe 4@H was rkcb|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more sensible contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec surprised E did not lead from his substantially stronger minor|pg||
nt|pef: greco still contemplating the state of the universe :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jade: hand is getting more interesting|pg||
pc|dT|mc|12|nt|pef: unlike yesterday when both tables were in big time trouble, today things are moving along at a good clip|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|henryb:  color blind Barry?|pg||
nt|pef: double probably shows a heart suit with diamond support|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  yes good start for E/W|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I have to put in random clicks cause the computer is so loud. |pg||
nt|pef: specs point out that 4h actually doesn't make on the stiff diamond lead (or a less likely diamond from kxx if south on leas|pg||
nt|pef: on lead, I mean|pg||
nt|pef: but I still think n/s are going to bid 4s over 4h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Dont want to tip off the table as to whos bidding|pg||
mb|2D|nt|henryb:  understand that|pg||
nt|pef: JoAnna Stansby told me always to bid 4s over 4h|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|henryb:  Van Vogt wrote a Null-A|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: thats what it looks like|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pef: is a quasi alert like a pseudo alert, Barry|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  decent hand with 5 hearts or 6 bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: i call em like i see em Peter|pg||
nt|stevo:  sorry that was private as to what 2 hearts would have shown over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this might go down 2 to push the result|pg||
nt|pef: he's unlikely to play the hand the bid both red suits also for spade length|pg||
nt|henryb:  My guess is that the right way to play 4@s is to play @cA and a club. If clubs 2-2, play spades 2-2. Otherwise play the person with 3 clubs for a stiff spade|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|pef: true|pg||

nt|andyv:  while we went away, Diamond team did break in the scoring column with 9 imps on board 51|pg||
nt|kit: If North had bid 4@S followed by 5@H, South just might bid the slam.|pg||
nt|mikam1: he played it there...with 6@C cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: bathurst gallops away|pg||
nt|jade: and then you are always annoyed when you pitch the wrong card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D or 1N?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess there was a problem...and N was declarer|pg||
nt|kit: and the bragging rights bank when he goes wrong there :)|pg||
nt|jade: that adds to the irriatation bank, too|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|henryb:  I know it can always be beaten, but I still say it is harder|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think North should do at least that...sure, on a bad day you go minus, but.....|pg||
mb|1N|nt|iceking: seems like Greco just forgot 4@H was RKCB with @D as trumps i been told|pg||
nt|pef: greco just found a 4nt call |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S denies 4@H unless game force|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 1NT overcall, and will likely reach 4@S|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for discussion  if  2 suits potential trump  can you RKC in both of the suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I guess this is some kind of strong spade raise|pg||
nt|pef: maybe planning to convert partner's 5 of a minor to 5h |pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: the dam has burst - i venture to suggest e/w are on tilt|pg||
nt|iceking: its very easy to forget your system i do that also often |pg||
nt|psyck: Not good for Diamond team, 6@h would hanve been in trouble on a @s lead other table & the previous deal was an unforced error|pg||
nt|cherilou: W had 2 ways to avoid @D loser--lead Q hoping RHO had singleton J or hope LHO had singleton K. Neither happening this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: that double looks fairly crazy too|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: looks rather normal dbl to me i guess iam crazy then:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = @S raise   not sure if singleton promised|pg||
nt|jade: I get yelled at when I play that way|pg||
nt|kit: Meanwhile, E-W arebeing stolen from here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to say where E or W could have come in |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2H promises some variety of unbalanced spade raise|pg||
nt|kit: I think it is important to have ways to bid a hand like West's vs. a Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|kit: getting to 5@H down 1 never looks good, but missing a laydown slam is just as costly|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now Hampson is in the tank over 5@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: yes, playability in the 3 highest ranking suits should always be showable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually   2@H may be   natural or invitational @S raise|pg||
nt|jade: Ok, what would you have done, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: Personally, I play 1NT shows a 4-card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d showing 5+@d and 4@h would have been effective here (10-13hcp)|pg||
nt|kit: since that is probably the most awkward hand type|pg||
nt|jade: 2@D = majors, Kit|pg||
nt|kit: no, 2@D natural.  Double with both majors.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Raptor NT overcalls Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what that is, Al|pg||
nt|andyv:  those not bad either, Al|pg||
nt|jade: Raptor shows @H|pg||
nt|jade: at least as I remember playing it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: somebody doesnt like leading from Jxxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost time to claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: leading Q hoping for singleton J also works when K doesn;t cover--so it is winning play more often|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think you need to steady the ship|pg||
nt|iceking: remember here east isnt limited he could still have up good hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might fall here|pg||
nt|cherilou: I like X--already a passed hand and has 9 cards in the red suits--seems normal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco asking about 3@C bid...|pg||
nt|mikam1: agreed Kit|pg||
nt|pef: I sort of like that auction--maybe that gets partner to realize that a key card in either minor is enough for slam|pg||
nt|mikam1: Looks like a close game here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: what do you guys think?|pg||
nt|mikam1: but with hearts 3-3 I think it will make|pg||
nt|kit: opening bid puts red kings likely onside, which makes the play easier|pg||
nt|mikam1: Certainly a reasonable try Peter...I would have bid 4@S, but admit I didn't think of 4N|pg||
nt|pef: hampson still in the tank|pg||
nt|pef: I didn't either, Mike, but it looks like a really sensible way to try to get partner to cooperate|pg||
nt|mikam1: not any more...he passed|pg||
nt|pef: ah well, at least he gets bonus points for not stopping in 4h|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: not clear 3 small is a better bargain|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|iceking: Greco seen enuff bidding time to dbl|pg||
nt|kit: I prefer 4@S to 4NT -- I think that implies the spade void.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe one should show diamonds and the other clubs once you correct to 5@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|iceking: will Hampson lead trump maybe|pg||
nt|iceking: often right after bidding like this|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will certainly calm any berves that e/w may have|pg||
nt|cherilou: but only X'ing 4@S because partner acted earlier :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok touche|pg||
nt|iceking: and you cant blame S try for game here|pg||
nt|iceking: duck or cover with @S jack and then duck maybe|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west's double didnt augur well for a game contract|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  saved a lot of money that way, Jade|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iceking: other then @S 4-1 and @H king offside the hand breaks well|pg||
nt|henryb:  the other room is playing 2@h|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: declarer planning to ruff one club in short hand and pitch the other on the jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like he has to play ace and a spade now to hold this to 4, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|kit: will come to 5 spade tricks, 2 diamonds, 2 hearts, and 1 club on decent splits|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cherilou: if 3@C was game try I hate N's 4@S bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfh: rehi everybody, my computer crashed|pg||
nt|andyv:  stop dropping it|pg||
nt|jade: gave the other table a chance to catch up electronicly|pg||

nt|jade: Personally I appreciated the opportunity to grab a drink from the bar|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: wish I'd gotten one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did you pay for it?|pg||
nt|kit: Greco-Hampson did very well to get to 4@H after they had made 5 consecutive passes|pg||
nt|andyv:  whether he guesses or not, it's a good save against what appears to be a cold 4@h contract|pg||
nt|jade: hell no. I am the entertainment here at the local establishment|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  that will be no picnic|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||

pc|c9|nt|cherilou: when E Xed 3@H I'd be hoping to make 3|pg||

nt|pef: right, probably not something that even a really experienced partnership had necessarily discussed in advance|pg||
nt|mikam1: all of these things require deep discussion - as Peter says|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|pef: n/s are in the rather interesting contract of four clubs doubled in the closed room|pg||

nt|pef: he's going to have to play this carefully, but it looks like the spade spots enable him to succeed|pg||
nt|stevo:  so if declarer draws trumps here hes in good shape by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I wonder if i can get room service cocktails?  Stevo?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry, most of the play was lost while I was restarting and reconnecting|pg||
nt|jade: there is a divine entity|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think Eric is trying to catch up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: the last three tricks consisted of Grue ruffing a heart on the board and then correctly finessing trump|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mikam1: Will Diamond raise here...disruptive, but the colors.........|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm another action hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|iceking: 2@S enuff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat stray from system   2@C supposed to show 6+@C|pg||
nt|mikam1: And don't tell me colors are for children|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  uninformative auction in OR and E chose the more aggressive @c lead rather than either short suit sequence|pg||
nt|pef: will zagorin bid 2nt?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Zagorin might boost this|pg||
nt|kit: unlikely to go for a number, but might just be going down|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think the T9 of clubs is enough for a raise|pg||
nt|kit: Still, I think raise is probably winner since partner is limited -- if partner weren't unlimited, too dangerous to raise since he might bid too much|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like 3nt will likely fetch despite only 23 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS in 4@s undbld in OR on 54|pg||
nt|jade: That's not straying, that's a tactical diversion|pg||
nt|andyv:  with all th quacks, Joe probably trying to get his best suit in|pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Greco should do here.  He has a lot of defense.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a nice one with that @C suit   [and partner NOT having @S length]|pg||
nt|kit: And it isn't 100% that his partner has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jade: timing is everything|pg||
nt|kit: So he may well pass the double|pg||
nt|jade: Do you like the 2@C opener, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I seem to remember that spades outrank the red suits but clubs don't.|pg||
nt|jade: That doesn't really answer the question|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 4@h makes, dbl will only cost 3 imps to EW|pg||
nt|kit: I think it does|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Zagorin close to a 2NT call, but not quite there|pg||
nt|mikam1: low road again|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think I would have Kit...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|robinswr: unless you're play that 2@s shows a weak raise and 2@c or 2@H shows a 7-9 raise|pg||
nt|mikam1: But certainly pass is reasonable|pg||
nt|pef: platnick/diamond lead lower of touching honors |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: @HK lead won't be optimal, so good pull :)|pg||
nt|kit: ace of clubs likely lead|pg||
nt|jade: Well, you got the A part right|pg||
nt|kit: Will certainly shift to it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3nt-3 most likely|pg||
nt|kit: the danger is that partner can be lighter than normal for the 1NT bid, since otherwise he would have to go to the 2-level on some flat 5-count|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|jade: One of those "If I get out of this alive, God, I will never do it again" moments|pg||
nt|kit: looks like declarer can get 6 trump tricks and 1 diamond trick is all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentators in other room predicted 3rd seat 1@C from Brad Moss,  who opened 1@S|pg||
nt|jade: What options is Eric considering?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I can't tell but he clearly was having a hard choice in the auction and another one here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd wrestling with the screen which keeps threatening to fall down|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, I suppose you're right|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|psyck: only consolation is it may be a push|pg||
nt|iceking: yes its very normal result |pg||
nt|ahollan1: is duck here double dummy??|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it looks daftbut has some merit i suppose|pg||
nt|iceking: duck what|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS has 25 points--a push seems likely|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|kit: he is considering that his partner might have a singleton diamond, so ace and a diamond|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: again the 2@S was the warning bell - especially with the spades under the bidder|pg||
nt|iceking: though if N had opened 1@D bidding could have gone:: 1@D-p-1@H-1@S-2@C-p-3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: betting Hampson would overtake if duck -- but  this way easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick also opened 1N|pg||
nt|cherilou: W could have @C Q doubleton or third--then still make 3NT|pg||
nt|iceking: not very interesting the play here |pg||
nt|roswolf: on 24 3@S went off 1 so only a 2 imp loss|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kit: But I think this defense makes more sense|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: if the opening bid had been 1 of a minor, the1NT response to takeout double is more likely to have full values|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dQ|nt|kit: problem now is he has to play something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  4@H West|pg||
nt|kit: might have been better to duck the diamond|pg||
nt|jade: I agree|pg||
nt|kit: it doesn't really cost a trick even if declarer has a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: feeling endplayed 5 times is actually good thing when defending at the 4 level|pg||
nt|kit: Holding 4 aces is usually a good start when defending at the 4-level doubled.|pg||
nt|jade: I was considering exiting a low @H|pg||
nt|jade: actually still am|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson's carding of high spade and high-low in trumps would appear to indicate the king of hearts|pg||
nt|jade: @S might finesse partner|pg||
nt|jade: In this case either low or high is the same. But if Hampson has Kxx @H a low @H is better|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: wow   DIamond raised to 3N immediately    @H lead from Hurd|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|henryb:  not much to go on|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  fall back on Crane or 8 ever?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  4@h made 5 so 4 imps at stake here.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pef: in theory, platnick should have every remaining card except possibly the j of diamonds.  but will bathurst rely on that and take the heart finesse for overtricks?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: why not?  Contract secure anyway.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|henryb:  North has more clubs, South perhaps more spades|pg||
nt|pef: now it's safe to because he knows platnick only has 5 spades|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: will go less down then :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  both fail|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|jade: down 3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pef: if diamond hadn't pitched a spade it might not have been safe|pg||
mc|9|nt|mikam1: We haven't had an 11 imp swing in at least two boards now...what the heck is going on here?|pg||
nt|pef: well this board could be a 6 imp swing if they get to game in the open room|pg||

nt|kit: This looks like 8 tricks in comfort|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jade: I like 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same opening from Moss|pg||
nt|mikam1: And they did well to stay low here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mikam1: A response by North might have gotten them to game|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cherilou: odd 3@C bid with those @H's|pg||
nt|mikam1: South may have jump-shifted with all those controls|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd: if it's not natural, he's not going to make it|pg||
nt|kit: After 2 rounds of spades, the discarding will be very difficult on the run of the diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S splinter|pg||
nt|kit: It will be tough to stay out of game after the light opening bid by West|pg||
mb|p|nt|jade: at least when they were a lot younger|pg||
nt|kit: If Greco had overcalled 1@S, he would have quickly been in 4@S doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss  3N North|pg||
nt|jade: interesting|pg||
nt|kit: And the splinter keeps them out of the bad 3NT contract and into the decent (but unlucky) 5@C contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-(1@D)    EW never bid @S but Hurd led them|pg||
nt|kit: The double may say:  I can't stand a heart lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  why unfortunate?|pg||
nt|jade: not sure|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  with S playing it, is there a clear way to set 5@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S knows 3N may be best or only game, but the path there would be murky, and slow bidding might help EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hurd: bet it's not Michaels|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond will need to show stuff in both suit, probably by pitching middle spade first, and Platnick will have to work out the position and what to hold|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there once was a day when precision 1@C got some respect from opponents    but just 1 day|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe  DBL =  i|pg||
nt|iceking: did not think they would get to 5th level here NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like to bid more   [inversion]|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C will not make on any normal club play|pg||
nt|pef: pretty impossible on the east hand|pg||

pc|cA|nt|psyck: I play a defense to 1@c were every bid including pass & double has to be alerted :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: king of hearts shift|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: heart shift would be double-dummy|pg||
nt|kit: you guys are looking at all 4 hands.  Lall isn't.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has to take a deep position in the @c suit|pg||
nt|jade: I understand|pg||
nt|kit: he will either play low to the 10 or low to the ace.  Both fail.|pg||
nt|kit: Only question is down 1 or2 -- will declarer judge from the auction to take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will Platnick guess the hearts and hold it to down one?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|pef: 2 spade was down 2 on board 70, so 2 imps to diamond|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: maybe players were asking questions??|pg||

pc|d7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|pef: well we were all wrong on board 71.  playing a strong club they stopped in 1s|pg||
nt|pef: that's because the jxxxx of hearts overcalled 1h!|pg||
nt|mikam1: Woolridge overcalled, yes....and not unreasonably|pg||
nt|mikam1: an 8 count with Jxxxxx - aggressive, but ok|pg||
nt|pef: because you want a heart lead?|pg||
nt|pef: I suppose you might|pg||
nt|kit: Assuming stand signals, I see no reason why South should shift to a spade -- North did discard 10 of spades first.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Why he should or shouldn't?|pg||
nt|kit: why he shouldn't|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
nt|kit: when you can't work out the hand, follow partner's signal.  He may know something you don't.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Partner said to do it, so you do it....I'm with you|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: good technique by declarer is to lead the 2 of diamonds on his next to last diamond -- if opponents miscount, they may think it is your last diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but you might too, and then lead a side suit prematurely:)|pg||
nt|kit: and note that he ruffed with 6 of diamonds, so he may have exactly that in mind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no he was just unvlocking in case the 4 of diamonds was hidden and the trump 8 anbd 9 thus both fell on the first round|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|mikam1: so....he shifted to a diamond  :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W planning later discards|pg||
nt|kit: This is not easy at all.  Defense doesn't know if declarer is 2-2 in rounded suits -- he could be 3-1 either way.  Can they communicate?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he knows spade is safe|pg||
nt|andyv:  their carding is standard|pg||
nt|jade: and that pesky A@D  and a ruff|pg||
nt|kit: I have no problem overriding partner's signal when I can work out the hand and know it is right, but South can't do that here.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: Vinje signals would have cleared the shapes up long ago|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer has Kxx of clubs, West needs to keep all of his clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still a nice auction|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: decades ago Helge Vinje devised globals shape signals|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think that was his first name, not sure|pg||
nt|kit: When East doesn't pitch either a club or a heart, which he would from 4 of either suit, West should deduce the distribution|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all based on fact that every bridge hand has either one suit with an odd nu,mber of cards, or thgree of them|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  so much for the 2@d theory|pg||
nt|kit: Therefore, West should know that heart pitch is safe|pg||
nt|kit: and he should have pitched heart last turn I think -- make it clear that East has to guard hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: And, when both defenders pitch all their spades, that makes it safe for declarer to cash his last trump.  So better if one of them could have held a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Velcro finally fell off the top of the screen; W and S discussing carding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  E may think of just keeping parity with dummy here|pg||

nt|kit: actually, maybe Diamond can't afford to come down to stiff king of hearts|pg||
nt|jade: I do not see a successful line on any club play|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone quick to point out 2@c losers and @d loser...but, what if he leads J@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: it was a pre-empt--why does S think he should bid to 5@C when partner didn't?|pg||
nt|jade: cover and tap the dummy twice|pg||
nt|kit: easy -- let 4 of clubs ride|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=@H, mixed raise|pg||
nt|iceking: didnt like 5@C either|pg||
nt|andyv:  you let @c ride|pg||
nt|kit: That's what GIB would do|pg||
nt|kit: actually the high diamond from the doubleton made it more likely that hearts were 3-2|pg||
nt|mikam1: We've quieted down considerably...the lead remains at 44|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S will have to make do with this lot until a good hand comes along|pg||
nt|kit: if he does, declare can cash ace of clubs, low heart to king and ace, and scores the last trick in hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D has some potential value, takes away support double etc.....the danger in mildish preempts with lots of trumps and no values it that opps might be able yo make whatever they bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and your telling them extent of your fit might drive them there|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mikam1: Yes, but North might have discarded another spade with 5 too|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S hand almost good enough to open old fashioned 4NT asking for Aces|pg||
nt|kit: Wooldridge would have liked to have been able to bid old-fashioned (not keycard) Blackwood there.|pg||
nt|kit: Yes Andy.  I think it is good enough.|pg||
nt|kit: so you gamble on the jack of spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was hedging against specs who wanted the J@s:)|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is transfer, in case somebody can't figure that out.|pg||
nt|mikam1: On the other side of the argument|pg||
nt|kit: true|pg||
nt|mikam1: Do you think the North hand is worth a Drury bid here?|pg||
nt|kit: only if they open very light|pg||
nt|mikam1: Wow - look at the hand that Diamond didn't overcall!!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mikam1: Amazing really|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'm the biggest chicken in America and I would bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this looks a bit high|pg||
nt|kit: but we don't know how they play an opening 4NT -- may have some other meaning|pg||
nt|andyv:  main thing you don't want to do is what happened in the Vandy this year when both teams bid 7@d missing the A@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no, it doesn't promise 8|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson making a slam try, and game isn't making|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: will be unlucky that East will be playing it, so heart lead is obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: S took the passive action here|pg||
nt|kit: I would never let partner play a 4-4 spade fit with that heart suit.  KQJ10xx is called trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mikam1: EW can make 4@H at least|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cherilou: NS make 4@D so only 1 or 2 imps either way|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s can make some @D so maybe a small gain|pg||
nt|kit: Now, do they play 6@C is to play?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Played from West side would have gotten club lead|pg||
nt|kit: Would he finesse and risk going down 2 after the overcall?|pg||
nt|kit: We will never know.|pg||
nt|kit: guess he decided that with partner a passed hand and him holding Qxx of spades it wasn't right|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|kit: at least Wooldridge thinks so.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he may get overruled here|pg||
nt|kit: But is it to play, or TO PLAY?|pg||
nt|kit: in other words, is it a suggestion or a command?|pg||
nt|andyv:  + side for NS is there are 4 small slams that make|pg||
nt|andyv:  so they just need to stay out of 6@d|pg||
nt|wstuart: I hope Hurd doesn't interpret this as bid 7 with a 3rd round 1@C control.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S should fake-ask for queen of spades, then correct the 5S reply to 6C. maybe that would be the muzzle sequence|pg||
nt|andyv:  a new meaning to walking the dog, Marshall?|pg||
nt|kit: the question is, have they discussed the meaning of 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: If Hurd corrects to 6@H, that will be okay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes my remark was addressed to that in a roundabout way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because there could be two paths to 6C|pg||
nt|lml: oh you mean south|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't think this S will pass 6@H - it wouldn't be natural - he would correct to 6@S which will be sure to be playable.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "we've agreed spades"  _sure but how about clubs, instead, the suit i only bid once"  "no how about hearts instead, the suit i only bid once?"|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d was dbld in OR on 42 and 3 imp gain to Bathurst|pg||
nt|lml: I would open 1C too|pg||
nt|pef: despite all of that it's still hard to believe not overcalling on that hand|pg||
nt|kit: but too big a position for me|pg||
nt|mikam1: Still...a big position to take..|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|wstuart: In several of my partnerships, 6@C would be a 3rd rd control ask.|pg||
nt|kit: Now, will Wooldridge respect this?|pg||
nt|kit: I think overcalling is the coward's bid -- passing is the brave bid|pg||
nt|pef: you might actually get to four hearts if you bid 2d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mikam1: I understand the danger of Qxx of spades, but you might miss a game|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pef: 2s by north probably, now double responsive by east is possible which might get you there|pg||
nt|pef: kit makes a good point, people don't always realize that passing can be much braver or riskier (depending on|pg||
nt|mikam1: You actually could overcall, double (scary), or bid 1N (semi-scary and strange)|pg||
nt|pef: your point of view) than bidding|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  we all know that 6@h, 6@s and 6N make|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, 6@s may have saved or gained 2 imps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i were joel, it would be hard. if i dont get to play 6C, he dont get to play 6H:)|pg||
nt|kit: if no ace of hearts lead, makes 7 |pg||
nt|kit: rare that you can discard 6 losing hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes 6H inferior for that reason:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maych decided by 1 IMP|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@h the more tempting lead|pg||
nt|kit: and they got to 6@C in other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S ran from 6H so i think we wll see a D lead|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine he will lead a heart|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: when all else fails, consider your own name|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a 3 imp gain now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|kit: oh right -- he doesn't know trumps aren't 2-2, so would always go up ace|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, this time passing was wrong big time|pg||
nt|mikam1: maybe South should even preempt in 3rd seat |pg||
nt|pef: wooldridge also opened 1d on the west hand for a similar result on board 72|pg||

nt|andyv:  who leads the BAM this set, 5-4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Would you double if playing equal level conversion Kit?|pg||
nt|pef: so i guess Mike and I are dinosaurs because I too wouldn't have even considered opening 1d on that hand.  a really good Bailey weak 2 bid, though :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: so that's possibly a double digit swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: board 73, I mean|pg||
nt|pef: although if e/w get to 4 hearts, certainly possible n/s will be 4s at that vul.|pg||
nt|kit: diamond is thinking big thoughts here|pg||
nt|mikam1: In the other room they did bid to 4@S...up to 5@H now with the auction not over|pg||
nt|pef: wow, I'm told they are now at 5H (bid over 4S) in the poen room|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would double (thats why you play equal level conversions where correcting clubs to diamonds does not show extra vlaues |pg||
nt|mikam1: They can make a slam here|pg||
nt|kit: I would have made takeout double also on last hand, but style has to permit it.|pg||
nt|mikam1: A good hand for equal level conversion method, agreed Steve|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like 5H is cold.  unusual to see one table 3 levels higher than the other|pg||
nt|mikam1: I don't play it, so I couldn't do that|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond will certainly bid a small slam -- the danger is bidding a grand|pg||
nt|mikam1: How to handle Diamond's hand?|pg||
nt|pef: south is still thinking on whether to bid 5 spades (or maybe double) in the open room on board 73|pg||
nt|mikam1: Do you show your hand, or try to find out about partner's?|pg||
nt|kit: An immediate grand slam force isn't the worst bid I've ever seen -- odds on no club or heart loser decent|pg||
nt|psyck: I would hacoby|pg||
nt|kit: but it doesn't work well this time|pg||
nt|pef: he passed, I am told.  I dont see how 5H can fail so the will be a 13 imp swing to bathurst almost surely|pg||
nt|kit: West cannot possibly show this hand -- he has to take complete control whatever route he takes|pg||
nt|mikam1: Agreed - specs suggest splinter then RKC|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|pef: a lot of good partnerships now play advanced jacoby methods.  that would allow west to find out lots of things about east's hand|pg||
nt|mikam1: That's fine if it this discounts diamond ace|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pef: I really don't like 4 diamonds, what do you expect partner to bid?  it uses so much room|pg||
nt|mikam1: So a 13 imp swing to Bathurst on 73|pg||
nt|robinswr: with 3 keys east should bid 4@h|pg||
nt|kit: how can West possibly find out about the queen of hearts, or partner's exact club/heart length?  Unless playing a relay system, he can't.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, absolutely, assuming last train is clear to them|pg||
nt|mikam1: Unless 4@D showed a void, then I agree with Steve...shouldn't signoff|pg||
nt|mikam1: Eric, do we know if 4@D was a void?|pg||
nt|pef: the way Allan Falk and I play jacoby I could find out about club control and whether he had third round heart control and stop in 6|pg||
nt|robinswr: over 4@d, 4@s shows the worst, bidding over 4! shows the best and bidding !4H shows an inbetween hand saying nothing about hearts |pg||
nt|pef: and also about whether he had a or ak of diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: bidding over 4@s|pg||
nt|mikam1: We've got to teach you where to put your exclamation marks Steve :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
nt|robinswr: last train|pg||
nt|kit: I truly don't think West can expect East to make sensible evaluations here.  Queen of clubs worthless.  Queen of hearts gold.  And so on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jade: they make a fair number of @H|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|wstuart: South has an incredibly wide range for his bidding.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|roswolf: 3@S is a testosterone bid|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@S another agressive action |pg||
nt|cherilou: yes it's a 14-16 NT right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: for both pairs|pg||
nt|cherilou: Mighty big|pg||
nt|iceking: i would not have thought about it have to admit|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east is clearly contemplating game|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3nhAS NO PLAY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 27  platnick-diamond stay out of trouble  4@S Wooldridge [who thought long time about bidding more]|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3 has no play|pg||
nt|iceking: on a normal @C Jack lead its doomed|pg||
nt|cherilou: or @H lead or @S lead or small @D lead :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you have to wait for a heart control, you might wait forever |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: for those specs out there who don't know what last train is--it means when you have only one bid to make below the level of your game, that bid doesn't necessarily show a control ...|pg||
nt|pef: in that suit, simply that you had something extra and didn't want to just sign off|pg||
nt|mikam1: So apparently Platnick did not show the diamond ace|pg||
nt|psyck: looking at the rkc response, 4@d was a void|pg||
nt|pef: so in this case, 4 hearts over 4 diamonds would be last train|pg||
nt|robinswr: or splinter followed by keycard after signoff is exclusion|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now John has to decide whether to risk the grand facing AKxxx of trumps and the rest unknown|pg||
nt|psyck: if 4@d void, i would not bid 4@h either|pg||
nt|pef: that's a pretty unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pef: I mean 4 diamonds being a void splinter|pg||
nt|kit: So Diamond has found out the important stuff-- now he has to guess.|pg||
nt|kit: I would bid the grand holding his cards -- and be wrong again.|pg||
nt|psyck: i play void splinters over 1M, but only with limited hands, not big ones...|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes...all he has to go on was the signoff by Platnick with AKxxx of trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: even when partner couln't bid 4@h|pg||
nt|mikam1: maybe he can make one more try|pg||
nt|kit: which tells him nothing.  If partner were 5-2-3-3, the grand would be reasonable|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|kit: even opposite no high cards|pg||
nt|pef: maybe without terribly fancy methods you should bid 2h over 1s.  if partner raises that's sort of bad because you have to worry (but can probably find out about ) the queen of ...|pg||
nt|pef: hearts|pg||
mb|6D!|nt|kit: 18 HCP, but the dreaded 4-3-3-3 -- and he is right to open 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind the 18 hcp, I do mind the 2 tens|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but give Greco   K93  AJ32 98 AQ73   and 4@S looks good   so we shouldn't be too harse about 3@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's a minimum 1N opener|pg||
nt|iceking: even if Hampson had passed 2@S N would bal i believe |pg||
nt|kit: If partner is 5-2-4-2, grand is great opposite AKxxx of spades and out|pg||
mb|6H!|nt|mikam1: Uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: but the more diamonds you have opposite splinter the better your hand. Having one diamond is the worst|pg||
nt|kit: I think it is wrong to try to bring partner into the loop here -- just have to make the decision yourself|pg||
nt|mikam1: This might fetch a grand bid, unluckily|pg||
mb|6S|nt|iceking: then after p p 3@S looks rather normal |pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I thought he might|pg||
nt|wstuart: On an eaerlier hand he opened a 4432 14 count with 1NT now he bids 1NT with a very controllish 18 count|pg||
nt|kit: If you always deduct a point for 4-3-3-3, you won't be far wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: they play 14-16 but apparently not in 4th seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: If you count each ace as 4.5 points you won't be far wrong either.|pg||
nt|jade: as minimum hands go, this one is pretty good|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: having two is a little better and three or four is very good|pg||
nt|mikam1: Whew! |pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: here some photos from the first 15 boards courtesy: Catalina Bathurst Robles: www.confsudbridge.org |pg||

pc|cA|nt|andyv:  I don't quote commentators...too much work|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the way I heard Eric Rodwell describe it;  frequent upgrades infrequent downgrades.  Opening a 15-17 N with that hand would very much not be my choice.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 2@h and E jumped to 4|pg||
nt|kit: not clear what declarer should do here|pg||
nt|kit: fortunately for him, if he plays low it only costs an overtrick|pg||
nt|andyv:  stiff @d led in OR and ducked by declarer|pg||

nt|pef: in the open room west did respond 2h eventually east blackwooded and bid 5nt, west bid 6h, east signed off in 6 spades, west is now thinking about whether to respect the signoff ...|pg||
nt|pef: having not bid the grand over 5nt|pg||
mc|12|nt|kit: they bid the grand in other room, so a bunch of IMPs coming back|pg||
pg||
qx|o75|st||md|1SAJT983HA32DJ6CJ6,S4HKT76DQ5CAT9873,SK752HQJ84D9832CQ,SQ6H95DAKT74CK542|sv|o|nt|stevo:  i think he played for xx axxxxx qjx xx but declarer i think would win ace of @d with that|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that's right|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzff: for sure|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|pef: and indeed it was a push because played from the east side after a transfer auction so no dangerous diamond lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|pef: if pass by wooldridge wasn't forcing, brad would have a real problem what to bid, here he can wait |pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  i think will go xx p p now 2h by brad|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: but will east redouble of bid 2d?|pg||
nt|stevo:  ha|pg||
nt|pef: got you |pg||
nt|stevo:  Hurd has seen Joel's pass of XX too many times not going there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred asking about 2@d and also about the original pass . Shown the rdbl card |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: gets a note about the rest|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|pef: yes, I once won a match against a very good team (Chip was on it) because one of his teammates decided to add an extra digit to the score in such a situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: how do we get to 3@cs from here?|pg||
nt|pef: that seems a bit pushy by fred with such bad diamond spots|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Isn't 2N Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|pef: barnet shenkin just told me he thought 5c was cold here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: this si not your typical auction|pg||
nt|stevo:  this is getting dangerous for N/S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pef: although it would take some magic to get there|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pef: time to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred shaking his head |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: not sure at what|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge nervous 1Nt was a 3rd seat favorable psyche|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Woolridge whispered something|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|pef: this is going to be hard for hurd to lead|pg||
nt|pef: although if the j holds he knows fred doesn't have ak10|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pef: so it sort of pinpoints wooldridges holding|pg||
nt|stevo:  declarer will get squeezed on the 5th diamond for down 3 possibly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pef: hurd is going to think a while |pg||
nt|stevo:  or not :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thats what he came up with|pg||
nt|pef: I guess he didn't make the same inference I did :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|pef: north south in the closed room did really well to play 2 hearts making 4 here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c75|st||md|1SAJT983HA32DJ6CJ6,S4HKT76DQ5CAT9873,SK752HQJ84D9832CQ,SQ6H95DAKT74CK542|sv|o|nt|kit: he was trying for more here.  But play timed differently in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: last deal of this set|pg||
nt|wstuart: Any takers?|pg||
nt|pef: surprisingly he did not respect the signoff and bid the grand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and a feisty bd to finish this set|pg||
nt|kit: West will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: North might try 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: don;t go too far folks, out in the Lobby there is an open bar hosted by BBO, just show them your ticket stub from the VG room. strict 7-drink minimum|pg||
nt|andyv:  a good set so far for Bathurst|pg||
nt|kit: and then?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Much needed imps for Diamond|pg||
nt|pef: i say surprisingly because once he didn't just bid seven after 5nt he must have changed his mind|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mikam1: In this incredibly volatile set :)|pg||
nt|pef: so that is almost surely 17 imps for diamond|pg||
nt|mikam1: Platnick has a problem here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mikam1: If you enter, should you bid 2N?|pg||
nt|mikam1: He did...safer than 3@D I suppose|pg||
nt|kit: not clear -- and diamonds are much better|pg||
nt|kit: but 2NT sure works well on this hand|pg||
nt|pef: interesting, diamond won't overcall 2d with akqjx of diamonds and a 15 count, but Platnick bids 2nt here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceking: 3nt from S now|pg||
nt|jade: what was double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: not alerted|pg||
nt|kit: looks like a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|mikam1: Actually North had a good hand for some conventions...2@S allowed the opponents to compete|pg||
nt|robinswr: the problem is that partner with 3-3 in minors would prefer clubs |pg||
nt|mikam1: He will surely bid 4@C at least and maybe 5|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|roswolf: dont like dbl by north butanything is possible now|pg||
nt|iceking: hmm looks like normal 3nt bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@H confirmed 6@H   [5@H was possible]|pg||
nt|mikam1: Wonder what 4@H is?|pg||
nt|pef: 5 clubs certainly fetches here, may be another gain for diamond|pg||
nt|kit: an accident waiting to happen perhaps?|pg||
nt|mikam1: So that big swing gets the margin down to 40|pg||
nt|kit: it might logically be RKC for clubs|pg||
nt|robinswr: i play that 2NT is Michaels here showing hearts and a minor maybe thats the problem|pg||
nt|mikam1: I do too actually|pg||
nt|pef: so at least 6 large swings in this match|pg||
nt|mikam1: Eric, do we know what 4@H was intended as?|pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: maybe N believes this dbl is pen?|pg||
nt|jade: Penalty it is, then|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
nt|pef: time to thank all my fellow commentators, mike kamil, kit woolsey, steve robinson, and krishna (won't try to spell his last name)|pg||
nt|psyck: just CK is fine :)|pg||
nt|kit: this could be big accident if they aren'ton same page|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|pef: the match resumes in 15 minutes or so|pg||
nt|mikam1: If 2N was misinterpreted this could be tragic for Diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: had W started with 4@H that would have ended the auction--now NS likely to gey to good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: hope not the 2nt bidder always has trump support unless big balanced|pg||
nt|kit: Hurd hoping the surprise heart attack will defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: Lall thinks he should have picked Greco for his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|jade: I'M glad you have a good hand, maybe I'll make 2@H|pg||
nt|jade: I know that auction well.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the thing i learned today    many pairs treating 1N=14-16 as WEAK|pg||
nt|mikam1: yup|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pef: thanks of course to our vugraph operator and to bbo and usbf for making this possible|pg||
nt|kit: This shows how important it is to have things defined in advance.|pg||
nt|pef: actually a lot of pairs play that as hearts and a minor these days--but really surprising that as experienced a pair as diamond platnick didn't get it right|pg||
nt|mikam1: Bad time for this (no good time I suppose), but they'd just gotten a big swing...now....|pg||
nt|psyck: too bad, just when the gap was narrowing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|roswolf: well west bids but maybe he fears 5@C might make|pg||
nt|jade: certainly when it is opened in Third Seat|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: If this segment was any indication of things to come, we certainly have an exciting day ahead|pg||
nt|mikam1: I know this seems trivial, but I might argue with the club lead here|pg||
nt|pef: yes, yesterday mostly very well played especially by the bathurst team.  today lots of thrills and spills, particularly spills|pg||
nt|robinswr: behind screens platnick could figure out what happened. Without screens if his partner alerted and explained that 2NT showed hearts and a minor, he must pass  4@h|pg||
nt|pef: I agree, seems right to adopt a forcing defense with those trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wstuart: What we get is 11 tricks and a quick exit to said BBO lounge.  ;)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: well imo south lost the plot here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3rd seat always use weak nt mechanism|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it is good to walk the dog|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|iceking: how about north |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iceking: how can south think N has a normal 3@C overcall instead of normal dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think Justin's in the trading mode yet|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us...next set in 15 minutes, I believe|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: drink up me hearties, |pg||
pc|c7|nt|pef: bathurst, not knowing about partners heart length and club length, may not ruff here|pg||
nt|mikam1: Always hard to defend well when there's been a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mikam1: You just don't know anything about the shape|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: this will make an overtrick|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|iceking: 690 it is|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
nt|iceking: thx everyone back in over a hour i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: with no entry N had to decide if his partner had 1 or 2 @S--I think he should get it right when he knows E has 6 @H's|pg||
nt|psyck: 3:35 pdt|pg||
nt|psyck: 3:45|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if we get back on schedule |pg||
nt|ahollan1: about 30 minutes from now|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: On B16 EW were in 3NT making 3 ... will correct momentarily...|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty everyone for joining us|pg||
nt|jade: Thanks for listening!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: ty everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  both teams played very well so tomorrow promises to be another wonderful showing.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S has liked his hand so much, he dbld and then, when opps found @ds, bid 2NT...so may have fireworks there yet.|pg||
nt|jade: Tune in tomorrow for a great day of bridge from these superb teams|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a misunderstanding and NS are in 3NT|pg||
nt|jade: Wow|pg||
nt|jade: I say again....Wow|pg||
nt|jade: 3N undoubled?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes and awkward lead for W right this minute|pg||
nt|jade: Wooldridge on opening lead?|pg||
nt|robinswr: but 500 or 800 is not a big deal|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  yes, and he led a @d|pg||
nt|kit: So, what went wrong? Maybe diamond thought 2NT was any 2 suits, and 4@H was pass or correct|pg||
nt|mikam1: thanks Eric, if it was not alerted, then that probably means minors, no?|pg||
nt|kit: Clearly Platnick thought he was showing minors|pg||
nt|kit: And clearly Diamond thought otherwise|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder....if it's any two suiter is that alertable?|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes Kit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: we shall foregather anon|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pef: so it looks like the actual imp score of this segment is going to be nearly even with four bid swing to each side|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, that's big swings, actually three to diamond--but one REALLY big, and four to bathurst|pg||
nt|kit: Should Platnick have worked that out? After all, Diamond did pass over 1@S, so how could he be bidding 4@H to play if partner has shown minors?|pg||
nt|mikam1: The bridge was a little shoddy...and some was based on tough decisions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: The 2NT bid was not alerted, but was explained upon inquiry ... I did not see/hear the explanation.|pg||
nt|mikam1: some of the swings that is|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|mikam1: In the other room, Woolridge overcalled 2@C (very light) and avoided all issues|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|hT|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: superb job by our operator Eric, standing ovation pelase|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Eric|pg||
nt|andyv:  see all of you in a few minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  on continuous @d leads, S could go down 3 in OR|pg||
nt|jade: Grue has negotiated this hand well|pg||
nt|kit: I still wonder if 4@H might have been interpreted as RKC for clubs, in which case the pass would show no heart control|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|andyv:  he has played superbly|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all and good night|pg||
nt|jade: so it looks like another 10 to Bathurst|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: will leave room open until play finishes in open room|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pef: so only down 3, but with 5c making in the open room that 's 14 back to bathurst|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mikam1: so 14 imps back the other way|pg||
mc|7|nt|pef: who will be up 54 going into the final 45  boards|pg||
nt|mikam1: Bye all|pg||
nt|pef: bye all see if you again soon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Break time ....|pg||
pg||
