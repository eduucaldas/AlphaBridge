nt|othered1: Hi, everyone.|pg||
nt|benjent: I guess 2@c was some kind of Drury. The question is ... who really really pushed it out here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: director is here, all should be ok after this hand....|pg||
nt|benjent: I kinda get South's theory here, but she could have been a little more delicate|pg||
nt|benjent: At 3@c, it looks like partner could have @c shortage (good), not much in @d (good) but, as we see, not all parts of the plan came together|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: declarer has lost 3....penalty cards....:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: EW mapped out the @s problem nicely|pg||

nt|benjent: She's kind of mangled her entries here. If she were in hand after 2@c's, 5@c would be virtually cold|pg||
nt|phil: yes, the @cT at T1 might have made things more fluid|pg||
nt|benjent: Where she got to, she was on @h 3-3 or @dA with North|pg||
nt|phil: but it seems part of the work on this hand is guessing where the @dA is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this still makes although precarious|pg||
nt|phil: ok, win the King, ruff the spade, @hA, ruff heart....|pg||
nt|benjent: Guessing the @dA only matters if @h's are 4-2, but yes|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|benjent: This is a nice textbook hand in @s's. The play is to ruff @c's in hand (and @h's on the board) ... elope with your little trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anybody for double ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|phil: not what South wants to hear|pg||
nt|benjent: Breed smells blood|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: she does, but that @d5 just isn't that great|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|benjent: Sure, but the @d5 is a fair shot to score ... on a @c ruff|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzfj: good matchpoint double :)|pg||
nt|benjent: 3@s is touch and go from here. @d lead was clear but not the best lead for the defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real issue was west raised on 3 trumps|pg||
nt|phil: subtle timing to this hand - as Ben says, declarer needs to elope with her baby trump, so using the @hK for an entry to the club ruff is superior to @hK, A, ruff..|pg||
nt|benjent: In 3@s, she's going to need to score the @dQ OR the @sA as a ruff. That's where the @d lead is problematic - it's working, surprisingly, on declarer's problem, not the defenders' ...|pg||
nt|benjent: problem|pg||
nt|phil: but with a trump return, how can she do better than two ruffs in dummy, four trump in hand and two hearts? |pg||

nt|othered1: Really, they are playing 16 board sets, here 33-48|pg||
nt|phil: of course|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: @C lead looks best, others will make it easy ,as cards lie|pg||
nt|phil: defense is forked when declarer leads a spade off the board, no? |pg||
nt|phil: but has to guess between 2-2 spades and 3-1 spades + 3-3 diamonds|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|othered1: right|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|benjent: Good to duck one of these|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: got 48 :)|pg||
nt|othered1: That was the only lead to make declarer work things out.|pg||
nt|phil: yes - it does not hurt and you might get a little info - or a switch|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjent: Ducking a @c would have given Robertson the opportunity to guess incorrectly between @s's 2-2 and @d 3-3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|phil: thats interesting|pg||
pc|c3|nt|benjent: Can't hurt to pop @dK on the table and see if you can sniff it out|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|benjent: Feels like she's going the simple path ...|pg||
nt|benjent: Team mates (and NPC) cross their fingers|pg||

nt|othered1: She is at the key decision point|pg||
nt|benjent: Bite some fingernails|pg||
nt|benjent: Look around for the rosary beads|pg||
nt|othered1: it fees percentage to play @S and go down |pg||
nt|othered1: feels|pg||
nt|phil: and try to remember if @sJ8 is more likely than @s8 :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Hmm. That's seems upside down|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|othered1: do have some information in the @C suit . . . |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: got it now, tech gone|pg||
nt|phil: Im not exactly sure what the @sK gained|pg||
nt|benjent: Clear to finesse @s now, with @c 5-2|pg||
mc|10|nt|phil: wlel done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: finessed spade|pg||
nt|phil: (well)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: well done robertson|pg||
nt|othered1: Nicely worked out in the end|pg||
nt|benjent: Well done in the end, but that was a pretty strange way to play it|pg||
nt|phil: seems she could have exited the club and received the same intel|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: guessed at some, hope it was right (think so)|pg||
