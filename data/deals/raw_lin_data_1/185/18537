mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Operator is Jan Martel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators Barnet Shenkin and Peter Crouch|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hi guys|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcwla: W may dredge up a 1NT response and E will have to find a rebid, potentially something like 3@D.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hi roland|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|pitiful:  6@d pretty good|pg||
nt|chorush: Good day everyone. Welcome to segment 3 of the finals for USA1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like some conventional understandings in play here and a @D lead will cause E no consternation whatever.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@H can also make but that is lucky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D by East is a very good contract|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@d now from west?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  has extras|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcwla: Really not a fan of this double, which should say this is the only place I can contribute so unless you have your own clear lead, demands @D.  Not the case with this middling suit. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla:  And obviously competing is not in the picture.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@d was a nice bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Wow - not a good stop with a @D lead coming.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pitiful:  6NT was not a nice bid|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|barnets: now a guess on a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, North is not Fisher|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs hearts -3-3|pg||
nt|pitiful:  why not bid 5N pick a slam if available rather than 6N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher as West is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Lair's partner is not Fisher|pg||
nt|barnets: it is weichsel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weichsel|pg||
nt|barnets: this contract is less than 20 percent|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i suspect you would prefer most of your bids to be assigned to another name Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT is a poor contract, even by my standards|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but 6@d by east would be what 90% +|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we can always blame it on Fisher|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, not any more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: south led ten of clubs out of turn, but screen was not opened, so director ruled no harm and north can lead normally|pg||
nt|barnets: not exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice Jerry|pg||
nt|barnets: if hearts split 4-2 and diamonds 4-1 declarer has problems|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: True Barnet, but if you don't want to be in 6@D, you require too much for your slams|pg||
nt|barnets: no it is decent |pg||
nt|barnets: in 6N dec would play 3top hearts and then lead a spade|pg||
nt|pitiful:  can you not play 2 trumps, ace of @h ruff a @h, draw trump, cross to @c?|pg||
nt|barnets: on a club lead which is best|pg||
nt|barnets: you cant do that|pg||
nt|pitiful:  why not|pg||
nt|barnets: as you have no entry back to hand if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not knowing that diamonds are not 5-0, declarer can't claim, so there is thinking|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|chorush: Hello Ben|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chorush: These will be boars 31-45 of a scheduled 90 board event. the winner will be USA1. the loser will get the evening off tomorrow to recover, then play a 60 board final against a team ...|pg||
nt|chorush: in USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi all|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: Will draw trump, unblock @CA, go over to @DQ, pitch a @H on @CK, and try the @H hook to make 4.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|benjent: I'm glad you're explaining the format Ira. I've got a firm grip on the Women's format, but the Senior's has goes for the extra degree of difficulty|pg||

nt|jcwla: Could it go the other way - yeah, there might be trouble on say a trump lead.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  win @c ace, play 2 trumps, @h ace, ruff @h, draw trump, cross to @c King?|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe thats right|pg||
nt|barnets: yes you are right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet would find that line at the table :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so it is much better|pg||
nt|chorush: Wolff is a legendary player with 11 World chapionships and more than 30 National championships to his credit. He and Dan Morse have played together for several years. Lair and ...|pg||
nt|chorush: Weischel are both great players, but their partnership is quite newly formed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps after 21 minutes but find it he would :)|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Weischel has a difficult decision. 1S or 1NT?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|pitiful:  anyone wouldn't be an issue for Roland, he could never reach 6@d playing acol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teasing Barnet is as much fun as teasing Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  anyway|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: E chose a 3NT rebid in the OR and made four.  That was the other possibility.|pg||
nt|jcwla: So as predicted 6 to Schwartz.|pg||
nt|barnets: top spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Correct, 6 to Lynch, the teams are not ID'd properly here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lynch is getting the scores for EW here for some reason.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Acol would get you to 6@D without any sweat|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 2NT is all the rage but I quite like 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Allow me to recommend that system|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: with one partner we had a system to show 2 suiters over 2N|pg||
nt|chorush: 3NT seems a bit the better contract but 4 spades is slated to make because the the club 9 is onside and even without that there would be an endplay|pg||
nt|benjent: Finessing the @c7 would be pretty obscure. I'm sure Weichsel will go for an endplay|pg||
nt|chorush: 4 spades has been set a trick in the other room. Hard to see how that happend|pg||
nt|benjent: He might be considering (after drawing trumps and eliminating @h) playing a @c to the 10 as some sort of endplay on Wolff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Will be corrected I'm sure, pls bear with us.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, folks, we've got it - the team names are reversed - thank you.|pg||
nt|barnets: not that we ever used it|pg||
nt|barnets: but once wechsel sontag used it to bagainst me in the trialsgame id |pg||
nt|barnets: to bid game|pg||
nt|pitiful:  did they get a good result?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes they bid and made game|pg||
nt|barnets: not bid in the other room|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|benjent: That wouldn't work|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, I think he will duck this and when no diamond comes back the layout will be apparent. He will elimanate hearts, and play ace and a diamond|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Query whether this was the actual uction.|pg||
nt|jcwla: *auction|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: That is certainly giving pd room...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|chorush: This wins against any holding where East has the club Q|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|sJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|benjent: The @d exit works regardless of where the @dK is ... if East has @cQ|pg||
nt|chorush: Right. Even if there had been a trump lead in the other room I would think the best line would still have been to draw trumps, eliminate hearts and play A of diamonds and a diamond|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcwla: So score it up - precision bidding.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|benjent: CR went down by doing the elimination and ... @c to the 10. That works if East has AQ or West has A9 (with his @dKQ)|pg||
nt|chorush: Best defense is to give a ruff and sluff|pg||
nt|benjent: Curiously, leading @cJ works ... best is then Q-K-duck. But now declarer gets out in diamonds for the endplay again|pg||
nt|chorush: This makes declarer guess the club layout|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|benjent: Funny thing about the @d lead is that it's possible that East has K109(x) ... so you start thinking about if you can endplay East, and ...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|sK|nt|benjent: Even though this looks like a residual guess, it's not|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|barnets: down 1 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends on the lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what would open as west?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Am I alone?|pg||
nt|barnets: If I was playing Polish 2@H|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well i hate to admit that i would never pass|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 suiter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish or not, 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't pass in 3rd favourable with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a fan of Acol 2's, so 2@H it will be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: not much chance in 4 @H unless defense give you something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have that funny feeling .......|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and it is not a good feeling|pg||
nt|barnets: in the local duplicate @DA and another @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet, your bid|pg||
nt|barnets: are the players there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E: KQ2, KQT83, 9, J872|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Its true that there is a slam but not a real good one|pg||
nt|benjent: That's a good-bad start from a slam-bidding point of view|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfd: short break turned out longer than expected|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Took a while for Lair to pass; he had a tough decision to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: S; AJ865, 97, K42, Q94|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: W: T4, 642, AJ53, K65|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jcwla: 4@S down on a @C lead with two quick entries in S.|pg||
nt|barnets: to lose only one diamond trick you need the single Q in west or 10 in east singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: It gets the @d suit front and center, but Lair may not visualise the side stuff|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: so dont hold your breath|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: west needs one more |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nine of hearts lead|pg||
nt|barnets: cards and point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be easy when you have 51 cards :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: won by ten.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, the new board was played in 4@H next door and made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: spade king to ace, heart to ace, third heart|pg||
nt|swanson: There was no club ace - West needs it for his bidding.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: club to king, ace, third club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: soiuth wins Q of clubs, plays diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ace of  diamonds, club|pg||
nt|barnets: its hard enough when you can see the hands :)|pg||
nt|swanson: This is more mystifying than watching the original 18.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have to lead a card, then claim Jerry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: just any card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hearts, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: four hearts down one|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ady: easy 3NT    10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: n ot the kind of board that Schwartz will like|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Straightforward 3NT. Not quite what the Schwartzes are looking for at minus 52|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hlortz: some much-needed imps for schwartz who now trails 48-17 (names reversed on scoreboard)|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|barnets: s|pg||
nt|swanson: 6NT is the best slam here.   Tough to discover the secondary red suit winners in time.|pg||
nt|barnets: south x 4@S and north strangely passed|pg||
nt|barnets: so Lynch gained 3 |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hackenbush: otherwise 3@h seems right on values, partner will raise to game fairly aggressively with any working hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: its just a 21st century game try - bid game, try to make it :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|barnets: South has shown the @SQ and @HK here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Sweden, @CK is always singleton offside, so on that basis they should bid the grand slam (just kidding)|pg||
nt|barnets: but dnied the @Ck|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - I meant not comfortable with 1Nt- would be terrified of missing diamond slam|pg||

nt|hackenbush: decent contract, but frozen suit in clubs and 4-1 trumps will doom declarer|pg||

nt|swanson: It is difficult to convince partner that you hold four card support for spades if you don't raise them immediately (with a splinter or a simple raise).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Weichsel says he's glad Lair didn't  have 5 hearts, because then he has a good play for seven.|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks all specs for your comments|pg||

nt|benjent: Ah - I'm still looking at the hand backwards, with East as dummy|pg||
nt|ady: would east play the 8@S from that holding?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: short break|pg||
nt|benjent: NS will keep on hammering on the @h's, but Morse counters by hammering on the @c's|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|wolkowitz: it's possible that any of the other hands would have acted in other events, true|pg||
