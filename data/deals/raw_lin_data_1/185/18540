pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|nt|athene: so there would be no chance to fall back on the spade finesse|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, as long as declarer's hand is not in discarding trouble|pg||
nt|athene: there are lots of other intriguing possibilities such as throwing north in with a club|pg||
nt|athene: but you could look very silly if you e.g. cashed the @SAK to drop north's spades then threw her in|pg||
nt|athene: and she led a diamond to south's ace and south cashed the @SQ :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||

nt|athene: Molson will not be too hopeful - if declarer's trumps were susceptible to a trump promotion she would probably not ruff the diamond with the king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Short break.|pg||
nt|jpes: need help|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: would prefer to ruff low, lead king, and if that is allowed to hold, come to hand with heart ruff|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@h here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Yes|pg||
nt|reisig: Hard to avoid 4@c|pg||
nt|jpes: a player with sporting blood|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = non-force  denies 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you sorta want to show both majors with that south hand|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@h -- not best|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|athene: normally if you are going to compete with a modest 44 majors you bid 1@S intending 2@H next|pg||
nt|athene: but south didn't really want to do that because she wants the heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: so if she started with 1@S and opps went into a fast 3nt or something, she would not feel so good|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, this hand exception, also a consideration if partner reads you for 5S 4H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: i wold bid 4@h.you?|pg||
nt|dinos1: i'dt bid|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is now she has to bid 2@S|pg||
nt|tez: would|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how auction will go in other room    1@C[nat]-1@H//??   1N??|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: was not here at that time|pg||
nt|athene: but she feels ok, if partner didn't raise my hearts she should have four spades|pg||
nt|tez: if parner has !q of @d enuf:)|pg||
nt|reisig: 5-5 .w 4+ fit ...yes|pg||
nt|jpes: absolutely and the dummy would annoy me|pg||
nt|tez: dummy has very bad for me|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: it all comes down to how much the doubler needs just to make a "courtesy" raise|pg||
nt|athene: in the old days you needed a really big hand but the requirements are dropping steadily|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: people prefer to just raise on anything if they have 4-card support|pg||
nt|athene: quite right too :) gotta get in there|pg||
nt|peachy: In competition (over the Dbl) even sttricter pdships allow raise with less if pure sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a 17 count with 4 hearts she can surely redouble first or cue or something|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 2@H over the double of 1@H should show the world|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Missed the auction.  2H is contract.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dinos1: even then only -1|pg||
nt|sybarra2: np |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway....the end result is that south has had to go a level higher than necessary|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: breathing can cost too|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: trump is certainly possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamonds wicked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the alternative is tap declarer if possible and duck diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chambers must think lead could be from KJ10xxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: this was made in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is why i like jack denies, and for sure in this situation|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|3H|an|!|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal  [since 1N=15-17 in 3rd/4th]|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jpes: never|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: E apparently on route to show 3-card limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force  9 to  non-opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H natural AND ask  support/controls|pg||
nt|athene: she will just bid game now|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S changed the picture|pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 1nt intending to show a 3-card limit raise and partner rebids the major you generally just bid game|pg||
nt|athene: the more thin games you play the more you appreciate that nice ninth trump|pg||
nt|athene: not sure quite what 4@C is all about|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's actually a 4@S bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C is alerted and explained as "i can't find my 4@S bid, but this will do, in a poor light"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Long conversation about the 4C, but I couldn't read.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|athene: ok a spectator suggests east might have thought west rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@s ...end|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|athene: in which case 4@C would be a reasonable control bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: undo pls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C at least @HQxx or @Hxxxx  0-2 controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|santyclz: The next session is supposed to start in about 6 minutes, it may be delayed slightly.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H undoubled :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead from correct hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: or maybe west DID rebid 3@S! :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2N :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: someday software will allow  insert pass instead of all undo|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think so|pg||
nt|peachy: Kathy alerted 4C after the fact, surely then the bid was 4C|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i think east seeing 2@S as 3@S is the most likely explanation|pg||
nt|dinos1: all suits were bid, what to lead? :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d9?|pg||
nt|tez: nt:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tez: duck @d|pg||

pc|h8|pc|s3|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||

mc|10|nt|santyclz: I doubt that's a high priority item on the release changes plan.|pg||
