nt|stc: I like Indy, less science and more judgement :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ntmon: but you need to know the system anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a stright-forward 4@h which probably makes 5|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. has to cash 3 first tricks out, if they succceed i predict they'll get a big reward and a close to top result|pg||
nt|psridhar: versatile game this Bridge-engages varied interests , since the game has many facets-science, judgment, analysis , psychology, etc|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: of course, small @c lead from N means 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: yes, not easy for N to play @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is IMPs right? OTs have less importance ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: no|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d on 2N was transfer accordimng to cc|pg||
nt|yuval10: MP's i'm affraid|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe E forgot, so this sequence should be slam interest|pg||
nt|ntmon: MP for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: but our scoreboard above says IMPs....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but it is MP|pg||
nt|stc: I don't think it may be Individual at IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php  look|pg||
nt|psyck: bbo cannot show scores with 1 mp table shown|pg||
mb|5C|nt|psridhar: so Matchpoints it is ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|yuval10: now after W denied @s control|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: perhaps it's easier for N to find the winning lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of MP's are in stake now|pg||
nt|psyck: the def will get it right, very costly for E to forget the cc|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yuval10: very well done by N|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 pages should not be hard to remember :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: i agree that this sequence by E is slammish in many conventions -but very few define it, in other words what is opener required to do ?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|psyck: with fit and max hand, i suppose opener is to make a forward going bid or rkc|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
mc|10|nt|psridhar: if responder is looking for fit, he has a balanced hand realtively? else he can trf and bid a 2nd suit-say 2-7-2-2 type ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: will KX,K109XXXX,XX,QX do?|pg||
nt|stc: Many players accept the transfer only with fit - it is a big advantage for such hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: i suggest you play it as = i dont need any fit ; i need a control rich hand -either pure all aces and kings in 20hcp OR some source of tricks like KQJXX in side suit with opener ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: with controls outside|pg||
nt|stc: the price is that you risk be too high |pg||
nt|psyck: that is an interesting & sensible treatment PS.  |pg||
nt|stc: do we have standings after first session ?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php|pg||
nt|psridhar: the logic is -thats the only value the responder cannot find out easily since 2N opg is space consuming|pg||

nt|psridhar: accurate bidding by Schwartz -his seq shows about what he has here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He will lose a trick in hearts I predict|pg||
nt|yuval10: then maybe a ruff too|pg||
pc|d6|nt|stc: the %play is to finesse the 2nd round of @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he leads @d, and he does|pg||

nt|stc: safety plays at MP are not a must|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|psridhar: at IMPs he doesnt mind losing a trump trick to W , so when E drops honor he can play 2nd top card...but this is MPs..|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|psridhar: a good lesson on moysian fits -good trumps|pg||
nt|stc: better than 3NT+2|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a very good score in an MP field|pg||
nt|psridhar: short trump hand haviing ruffing potential|pg||
nt|stc: and who plays 6@c  ?|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Goodbye to the 12th trick|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well, thought ruffing @h would have been normal|pg||
nt|stc: don't understand his play|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He can no longer ruff a heart and get back to hand to draw|pg||
nt|stc: after droping the Q@c he sees 11 NT tricks, so he needs 12 in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: may be plannig to play for @s33 then|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe he will play for spades 3-3 now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: diamond to ace, ruff a heart and overtake @SQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: he should, as he knows he's in a bad score already|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He really should with this format|pg||
nt|stc: making things much worse|pg||
nt|stc: 1 trick worse :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: The current standing after 10 (out of 19) rounds:  1st: Dror Padon,  2nd: Sergiu Covaliu|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He erred at trick 3 by not ruffing a heart|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Playing for clubs 3-1 instead with singleton in West|pg||
nt|stc: hoping W plays H|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If they don't one, they don't have one|pg||
nt|Walddk3: says Garozzo|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|Walddk3: don't lead one|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|psridhar: if @c are 3-1 he can see 3N fares poorly so taking even 10 triks is ok -so shd hv catered to 2-2|pg||
nt|stc: 10 or 11 ?|pg||
nt|stc: 620 not far from zero|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: unless i curse him|pg||
nt|stc: needs Axx to X 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: AXX @h ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: passing 2@s with that 2 suitor -he will know it will go all pass as pd is marked with 4card @s|pg||
nt|stc: support X for @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: there is no support X here|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he wants to support he does that with 2 @h or a cuebid|pg||
nt|psyck: x just shows honor i suppose|pg||

nt|psridhar: -140 instead of +130..|pg||
nt|yuval10: and not assume that partner "tricks" you|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you think your partner "tricks" you all the time...well, you're lucky , because it's an individual event and he'll be gone by next round :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 2@s Birman knew his pd held 4-2 in Majors, how costly can 3@c be?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3 great scored for EW here anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: W will surely overtake N|pg||

nt|psyck: about a loser in each suit in 2@s|pg||

nt|psyck: but S has good hand for @s|pg||
nt|stc: even if not forcing, he has too much|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: simple rule for me-if i wd hv originally super-accepted a trf , then I raise to 3@S here|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: the KCB response of 6@C by E shows odd no of keys and a useful void-needed for slam here|pg||
nt|psridhar: else Lazar thinks 2 keys are missing|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, many play 5N as even with void & 6x as odd with void|pg||
nt|granguru:  the importance of showing valuable voids in RKCB is ofoveerwhelming importance|pg||
nt|psridhar: now E has to 'punt' 6@H|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see any reason not to lead @d against 6@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of bid that will invite more criticism when it fails than accolade when it wins( oh u got lucky! )|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  if W would have shown a 2 suited with 2N then W probably would have played 6@D instead of 6@H by E|pg||
nt|psyck: I E was going to bid on 5@h, he may have tried 6@d |pg||
nt|psyck: *If E|pg||
nt|psridhar: the two suits lack parity acutely ..so perhaps E decided to hide it|pg||

nt|granguru:  defense must manage not to clash @s tricks|pg||
