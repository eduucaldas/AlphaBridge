nt|tez: hmmm.surprized pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Interesting that Peter chose not to open 2@s in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|swanson: That was unexpected.  Shows how little they can rely on opening bid values for an opening bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: he is at adverse vul|pg||
nt|peachy: I was thinking the same, opp passed partner red he perhaps thought it would bee too risky|pg||

nt|hackenbush: in the modern style, doubling then raising partner's suit in competition is just competitive, so East doesn't go on even holding 2 aces|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|phil: interesting choice for South; 2 suiters are hard to show after 2@c|pg||
mb|3C|nt|phil: unless you have a gadget|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if 3@c promises a good suit, this will excite South|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: . . . through 3@D, but north rebid @C, probably confirming suit quality|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|swanson: I except E-W to reach 4@S here, but it has no real chance of coming home.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|swanson: A takeout double is possible here by Levin.  That gives E-W as chance for a plus by defending.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: on 50   Meyers opened 2N so playing 3N west|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: NS still should be able to find 3N, but 5@D will work also, as cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joel planning a 2-step to show good hand with 6@S & 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably with weaker hand she would rebid 2@S immediately|pg||
nt|hackenbush: assuming this guarantees 2 of top 3, NS can drive to 7@c, hopefully 5 clubs, 6 diamonds, 1 spade, and a heart ruff|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|barnets: his is down a couple|pg||
nt|hackenbush: especially after the 4@c rebid now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|swanson: Defending is for children - bid those games.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: 1 Key Card|pg||
mb|7C|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w limit is 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: weichsel relatively lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is nice -- i forgot to think about options if Sokolow bidding 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: North can only lead one round of trumps, so the simple defense of winning two diamonds and shifting to a spade seems best.|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe E hopes supp 4th , the only reason to bid 3@H over X|pg||
nt|swanson: East might have redoubled 2@S to indicate a good hand and then listen to what partner has to say.|pg||
nt|ybob: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 11 tricks likely here, too, as @SQ comes down while cashing out|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well done|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|hackenbush: natural to finesse trump now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- retain ability to ruff @H if finesse loses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  Rusinow vs NT  [so Q promised K]    upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|swanson: North shouldn't be concerned about solving a spade guess for declarer; the double has already given away the spade situation.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|ritong: in that sense that 3@s is down, so the board was lost already  but yes, probably 4@d makes|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|hackenbush: good shift, knockout late entry to spades|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play was too fast -- i was contemplating @S @S ruff then @DJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|s8|nt|swanson: South doesn't mind this cross ruff - her spades are looking better and better.|pg||
nt|tez: down 1|pg||
nt|tez: whats your choise with west hand..2@s or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff and @D ... ?|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s showed 4+ right?|pg||
nt|swanson: I expect that the 1@S bid showed five cards, so the raise is routine.|pg||
nt|tez: in europe 1@c 1@d 1 major 4+|pg||
nt|ybob: Both tables raise with 3 cards|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@h 1@s 5+|pg||
nt|ybob: I play 1@S as 4 + over 1@D , X = 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: mark me down for 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|swanson: Doesn't have to show five, but I would raise unless I knew for certain that partner held only four spades.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@d dbl shows both majors|pg||
nt|swanson: Some play that the negative double of 1@D is exactly four spades and four or more hearts (using the theory that you can bid spades, then hearts with five spades).|pg||
nt|tez: migry's connection bad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I think she will never play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and here i was checking to see what Radid would respond to 1@H :(|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: but West is 2N opener regardless of  how Walter the Walrus counts points|pg||

nt|swanson: I would have guessed from the timing of the bids that East and South are on the same side of the screen.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|othered1: north's 3@H is unnderstandable and catches south with  the perfect flat minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry led @Sx   [and it was her artificial 2@D last hand not stansby]|pg||

nt|ritong: would you, barnet?|pg||
nt|barnets: that is if he knows how to bid it|pg||
nt|barnets: souths diamonds should be at worst what he is showing with 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: he could have AKQ xxx|pg||
nt|ritong: that s ok, but still|pg||
nt|peachy: Is it possible S forgot they played 2D artificial|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@D shold be RKC|pg||
nt|barnets: do they play 2@D as artificial ?|pg||
nt|barnets: if they do he forgot|pg||
nt|hackenbush: this double is aggressive, unfav opposite passed partner when you have to bid at 2-level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C natural??   only if playing YBYSIBM convention [you bid your suit i bid mine]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N this time?  nope|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|daman: she may as well try 2@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|hackenbush: and they have the boss suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Missed the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will try to catch you up to what's happened on the first 4 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Ed|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  very little to this hand unless E overbids his values|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, 2D = 1 Major|pg||
nt|barnets: i think 2@D is natural and weak|pg||
nt|daman: we are starting with Board 5     we missed the first 4 boards    will catch up with them later|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D now by South should show this sort of hand    but 3NT is a stone on the layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Debbie Rosenberg did very well not to bid on with the known 11+ fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|barnets: how do you know this raija?|pg||
nt|daman: pass was not on my radar|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes have to keep the auction open with 3 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The play on this hand is dependent on deciding which defender is more likely to hold the doubleton ace of clubs.  An easy choice off the auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: some west's might open, which could facilitate getting a bit high . . . |pg||
nt|peachy: System Summary is 100% clear, so either the summary submitted is wrong, or S forgot|pg||
nt|barnets: well the summary submitted must be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: h spots and cl break helps|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: opposite a weak major|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: Actually, It was not clear, I was looking wrong!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ybob: clear hand to E, N have 4@D after the lead and 4@S, S can´t have 4@H so N is 4342|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|barnets: north would not have stopped in 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks on board 3 a relatively easy grand was not bid in this room|pg||
nt|othered1: Few grands are easy, but that one was an exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: What is the format 3H by E on Board 4 making 3|pg||
nt|vbman: l think radin overlooked poss. that pard cd have passed 1h|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  S hand rich in high card points but poor in playing quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin still thought East was 1@S opener|pg||
nt|hackenbush: maybe they play equal-level conversion, where if North bids 2@c, and South 2@d showing @h+@d but not extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@S-DBL    3N north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S really put pressure on NS|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|peachy: I have to go, will leave you all in the capable hands of Barnet Shenkin, Ed Shapiro, and Henri "ritong" Schweitzer. Thx all|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a good question to ask in these situation is, "do I want to defend"?|pg||

nt|mr murray: 5 diamonds down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting 3@d here|pg||
nt|vbman: and most wd find a bid with norths hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that is if EW come in|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: good x by east in open|pg||
nt|barnets: he knew his partner had 1 spade on auction|pg||
nt|barnets: so he knew he was taking first 4 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: But what if partner had 0 @S?|pg||
nt|barnets: and his partner had 1 for luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, the luck element once again enters|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c and 3@s all look makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wonder how close Rosenberg was to reopening DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: still had chances|pg||
nt|tez: dont lead j of @d:)|pg||
nt|swanson: I hope South doesn't get tricky and lead the @DJ!|pg||
nt|ybob: i choice 3@D in 1st or 3th position|pg||
nt|tez: but you have T of @d|pg||
nt|othered1: Getting a bit high|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  hi Murray|pg||
nt|mr murray: hi|pg||
nt|mr murray: 4 hearts not making|pg||
nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|othered1: well  you do pretty much need to bring in @C with one loser but game is likely good enough vul|pg||
nt|barnets: to beat it|pg||
nt|barnets: i like the x|pg||
nt|daman: North should pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defending 2@S when 6@D actually has a [single dummy] play    conclusion: sometimes preempts work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be fun to watch if they find all their defensive tricks   well Moss won't enjoy it|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 3N may make because of the blockage in @d suit|pg||
nt|vbman: getting strange|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i wonder if 3@h is limited, otherwise not worth a strong jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: And nobody here took any pep pills . . .|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: 3N would have better play as cards lie|pg||
nt|andyv:  both rooms should get to 4@h..only question is whether EW will take the 5@d push|pg||
nt|othered1: more like will west solo to 5@D, since east doesn't have much positive  to say with those tricks in defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  and spec points out that 4@s is another possible EW contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: So do I|pg||
nt|barnets: and will be a nice swing for lynch|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|othered1: unless they get the ruffs right now, then a lesser swing|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tez: nonevuln:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  a lot of handling problems for declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: I think 4@S has more disaster potential than 5@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...the handling problems would be very difficult esp. if W hand gets tapped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there goes 1 ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|daman: looks like declarer will make at least 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|swanson: After South shows with six diamond to the AKJ there isn't any possibility she also holds the @SK so declarer will take the winning club finesse.|pg||
nt|tez: probably equal|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @h shift followed by @d swith may be hard to handle|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  like here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hackenbush: or possibly the player with shortness has to be more aggressive|pg||

nt|vbman: 2 h was my choice|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: probably   but point is   make 'em guess often enough, they'll guess wrong|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  so down 1 looks most likely|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: on 52 [our 4@D -1]  Stansby-Migry pushed themselves to 5@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|andyv:  borderline 2@c opener for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  might open in 2NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N-type auction coming up|pg||
nt|othered1: "Nobody" opens a simple 1@S any more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Make a large number of @D EW, but that may be the 4th suit and could be hard to find|pg||
nt|hackenbush: too weak for michaels, if better spades then 1@s|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a reasonable slam - until clubs go 4-1.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|daman: this must be multi landy?|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D = one major|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E's @h bid will make it harder to get to the slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Every time I make a contrarian play like that, turns out it was contrary to *our* success |pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S is the winning bid here|pg||
nt|othered1: And was made in the OR|pg||
nt|barnets: although 3N may make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with prime controls and 5 card major, it's a difficult choice|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  should get to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2H = pass or correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same start -- but Jill Meyers balanced with West hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close decision to double, with Radin's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on next board  NS did push to 5@C but Meyers in 5@S  [@H never bid after 1@C opening]|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tez: not good percantage slam..|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you get to 4@S from here?  Puppet Stayman?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm surprised at the 2N rebid...with pd's neg. dbl, I would think 2@s was pretty automatic with the N hand|pg||
nt|othered1: But 2@S may force the auction too high.  A reason for opening 1@S (then east, not knowing you have that good a hand, will double and you'll eventually play @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec suggests 5@d...it would mean S would have to do a lot of bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: club lead is best|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec cant set up spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and has only 8 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but west is known to hold 7 @hs|pg||
nt|barnets: but can make a ninth in hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: big bob would not open 3@h a six bagger first seat at equal vul, would he?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if you can trust partner to pass when it's right, then you can double 4@h more often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or close for Moss to re-open|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  E should raise here|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but @H bid opposite void won't improve west hand a whole lot.|pg||
nt|othered1: What would west open with 4=1=4=4?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: who shuffled these boards?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a conventional treatment here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I'm not impressed|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 4D was meant to play according to the new discussion at the table|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's really the auction, seems like south really evaluates hands up (see board 6 for another example)\|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: EW were going to make 2@S     that was a very bold and competitive bid by North|pg||
nt|ybob: 630 next ...|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think easier for Moss than Radin|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|barnets: yes a spec points out|pg||

pc|dT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bob makes the efficient bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  in OR, 4@h was bid and made|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: that west may duck a heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: in the end game|pg||
nt|barnets: giving dec a losing option|pg||

pc|s2|pg||

nt|tez: duck j of @c and give 1 imp to opps every hand:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|barnets: like to see it though|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever the case, the Moss team should have to gain some imps|pg||
nt|othered1: did south take 2N over the double neg 2@H as a replacement bid showing long @H?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: after dec cashes his 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @c was led and W never got his ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|swanson: East is going to have to underlead the @SA to get three tricks - otherwise North will cash all the winners and lead towards the spade.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: weichsel is known to hold three aces|pg||
nt|barnets: and leads a heart|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ybob: now small @S = 630, OTHERS 660|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: is Rule of 11 still enforced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: donating 14 imps "out of thin air" means you better not get rattled and better pick up imps with your style elsewhere.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  Moss picked up 6 imps on board 6 where 2N made 4 in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Just another pushy game you shouldn't bid non-vul, but can't avoid if east's hand is an opening bid in your methods|pg||

mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the recommended defense against that 2@H opener  --  wouldn't be surprised if DBL did show bal hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: it probably does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sokolow over 2@S  --  tough  give credit to the EW system|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 6 more for Joel on Board 7|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but from South's perspective, needs partner to have a max to have a shot at 3nt, and might not even make 14 vs 11 with no source of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true  partner was passed hand|pg||
nt|ybob: yes here :)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ritong: @s to the A, back to dummy and another @s, right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|athene: with four spade tricks declarer just wants to get the trumps drawn, but it's slightly awkward to get to dummy fast|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to take advantage of the free finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no @s losers, he may just play A@h and @h|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA yes|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will be in game here.  4@S is down, but 3NT is on.|pg||
nt|ybob: AQ stiff @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm never sure about whether to start South hand with 2@C or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 4@S was -2 if guessed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: in other room he played a club now|pg||
nt|daman: hard not to lead @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: first books read were Acol so instinct says 2@C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tez: play @h..safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in 2/1 that establishes game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm still not sure|pg||
nt|hackenbush: apparently one of them plays that 4@d shows a good 5-card suit, and the other doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: In my notes, it's a max 1-loser suit|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that or 2 of top 3 is a good agreement|pg||
nt|hackenbush: helps partner count tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ritong: yes, say you lose a @d ruff now, you do not lose the @h anymore|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this auction probably easier to get to NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp   but  not surely NOT 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 3H is correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how N went down on last hand|pg||
nt|vbman: what a miracle helps me get 12 here????|pg||
pc|sK|nt|swanson: Declarer will grind it out looking for an overtrick, but by that time she will have nine in the bank.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hackenbush: 9 or 10 tricks here after ruffing a diamond|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: not sure you can afford to give up on the trump finesse quite that happily - if trumps are 3-1, and the defender with @HKxx plays a third round, you only have nine tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|swanson: Guarding against 5-1 spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well now i am sure that 2@C better than 1@S   [at least for this hand]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: unless the lead was stiff K|pg||
nt|daman: South has a "surround" in @Ss|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you have to be unlucky in both minors|pg||

nt|othered1: Agree and 3N looks to be the better spot on the auction bymore than a little|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|h4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|paulg:  generally i think it's better to show your strong balanced hand, especially if you have spades stopped, than support double |pg||
nt|mich-b: Quite lucky for EW that 3NT seems to fail as well (on a @C lead)|pg||
nt|mich-b: Yes, Paul , me and pd have agreed specifically that a jump to 2NT does not deny 3 card support|pg||
nt|othered1: That could be the reasoning, though I can't seem to make the idea that not support doubling denies 3 trumps work in practice|pg||
nt|paulg:  i presume 3@c is checkback, but perhaps undiscussed after North's intervention|pg||

nt|ahollan1: people who know me will be shocked by even the slightest hint of seeing a silver lining|pg||
nt|othered1: do  you double 1@C with south hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hackenbush: Will Moss open in 3rd?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised he opened 1nt - not because of the 5422 but just because it's a bit good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reliable source tells me  "dbl was 13-15 or 19-plus bal but not essential with that hand opposite a ph"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S or something slower?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: hamman sticks to his convictions|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H far from obligatory|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d looks like a good raise to 2@h|pg||

nt|ybob: i like 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter is nice choice|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: passing 12 decent|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: end of auction, I presume|pg||
nt|ritong: quacks, etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D transfer   [better raise than 2@H]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and North should double again|pg||
nt|swanson: Too much playing strength for 3@S.  3@H invites game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I don't know if 2@H is controls or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and NS earns 50, rather than the 130 that *might* have been attainable|pg||
nt|barnets: X could get 500  now if they pass it|pg||

pc|c3|nt|andyv:  everyone hates to pass 14 point hands:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|ybob: O.R. bids 3@S over 2@S|pg||
nt|swanson: A club lead would hold the contract to nine tricks, but East has no reason to lead anything but a heart.|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. ones that have such great shape |pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I entered 2 score corrections in the movie, 1NT previously did make|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|barnets: xx was 3 card support|pg||

pc|s9|nt|daman: 3@C was Puppet|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  or 120|pg||
nt|athene: having given up control in trumps, north has to be a bit worried about declarer running the spades|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect him to try to cash out in the minors - he would have to find his partner with one king and get him in to lead to the other AQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: and 3@Sx showed extra values|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry 3@Dx |pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|daman: 3@H showed no major|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: but i guess he just didn't want to commit to one or other suit|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|paulg:  4NT showed two places to play and over 5@c Migry was able to show a max raise to 5@h|pg||

nt|paulg:  She would not have been able to show the max raise over a 5@d response|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: even if south's heart WAS suit-pref, he didn't really have any preference between the minors :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: reaching game would be an achievement  winning the partials battle will bring in 6 already|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: NS can make @Cs or @Ds|pg||

mb|4H|nt|barnets: well game is lucky with @CK falling|pg||
nt|othered1: and you  have to get the position right if you're as  high as 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now how will South get her values across...|pg||
nt|vbman: 4h correct?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: ah that should work, then dummy can enjoy the 2nd heart trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: you could play east for kX club|pg||
nt|barnets: doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: that loses here|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of alert explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force   jump to 3N should show 1N strength [but some flaw for 1N open]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and we have our answer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be less or more than 1N opening strength|pg||
nt|ybob: 130 here i hope|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: same bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: next board is promising as well|pg||
nt|barnets: now it went all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was probably a close call for Joel|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: maybe Passell was playing his partner for the @SK rather than a minor-suit king|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N says they never bypass 4-card majors in responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the 14 imps on board 7, the Moss team jumps ahead|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|barnets: and so it goes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: personally i think if north shows a club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: south should support him|pg||
nt|barnets: but that my view  who knows|pg||
nt|daman: this will be down quickly    once East wins the @C Ace     EW will cash 2 @Hs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ritong: rather weird, yes  a ten cards fit buried in both rooms|pg||
nt|othered1: @DQ doesn't look very positive and @S were bid on his left, but still A9x is above expectations|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N shows clubs to all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: north has bid his suit with 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she was going to guess the @H10 anyway|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|barnets: I am not sure on their system what 2@C would mean|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ritong: ok thanks|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: when south responds 1@D here it's not saying "I have no 4-card major" but it is saying "you can ignore your 4-card majors to rebid 1nt, i will check back for them if i want to"|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room 1N was clearly alerted to show clubs?|pg||
nt|barnets: can you say if it was clearly alerted here ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause = negotiating claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decision to bid 2@S instead of something else worked well|pg||
mc|11|nt|hackenbush: if East had played back a low heart, inserting @h9 is indicated from restricted choice, besides the fact that East might've tried @hK or spade from @hKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please let that be the case|pg||
nt|swanson: It seems a bit out of charater that Jill Meyers didn't open 1NT.  The hand does offer significant potential should partner have a big pointed suit fit.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: it's debatable whether one should be allowed to bid 4@h, but if they play it as bad hand non-solid 7-card suit then South hand certainly qualifies|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|andyv:  lucky slam hand here|pg||

nt|andyv:  spec likes responsive dbl here|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C from north, 5@C from east is quite possible|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C might be a bit pushy.  Maybe dangerous responsive double|pg||
nt|daman: if they open 2@H    it is weak with both majors|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT?|pg||
nt|ybob: with @S lead N-S win 3NT|pg||
nt|ybob: only this lead|pg||
nt|swanson: 3NT is quite reasonable here - and will make unless East ducks the @DQ and declarer misguess on the second round.|pg||
nt|othered1: a quiet 3N looks very normal here.  And, just in case, 5@D also is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I like 4@c|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: EW 1N always 14-16   and Radin downgrades    when was last time you saw THAT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: repeating @hs will show 6/5|pg||
nt|barnets: slam is not wonderfull but it makes|pg||
nt|barnets: just one entry to south hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the question is: at which level|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wonder why south didn't bid 4@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which 5?   [sorry  i gotta be me]|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  when pd asks you to pick a major, do you like to torment him by bidding the other minor?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: East not too interested opposite 18-19 balanced|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hackenbush: @sT will be an encouraging card for Moss, partner ostensibly showing @sHx|pg||
nt|swanson: West might have bid 4@C over 3NT, being unwilling to allow the opponents a shot at a vulnerable 3NT.|pg||
nt|vbman: did radin underestimate dias?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: every imp is vital now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to distinguish  serious vs non-serious slam tries|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 10 tricks and time for coffee.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  this should be over quickly...S will take the @s hook into W hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so weichsel showed a rockcrushing 6/5 and lair declined|pg||
nt|barnets: a 1 imp swing could be very important for deutsch |pg||
nt|andyv:  black here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so that decision only affects which hand declares 4@S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ybob: after the 3@C bid, could win 5@D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: and as the cards lie -- it just doesn't matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57  the one where we talked about Rosenberg decision to respond 1@S or 2@C then they ended in 3@H [gulp]   Stansby did start with 2@C and is playing 3N South|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ybob: need guess @D only ...|pg||
nt|swanson: In 3NT with a spade lead declarer leads the @DQ.  If East covers (the reflex play) declarer ducks and has nine winners.|pg||
nt|ybob: scary if E play small :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||

nt|andyv:  claim time |pg||
pc|d7|pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: on 57  3N South after Stansby responded 2@C vs Rosenberg 1@S  [then the glitch that ended in 3@H]|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ybob: or bid 4@D over 3@S ...|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ritong: 3@d likely infers three cards raise|pg||

nt|barnets: unless its 7 of course !|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: they are going to have a small BW problem imo|pg||
nt|ritong: about the trump suit|pg||
nt|barnets: lynch have a likely pick up on the last board so this hand may be decisive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting decision from Seamon-Molson|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: whatever he leads helps declarer to an extent|pg||
nt|barnets: north will place the final contract\|pg||
nt|ritong: one of weichsel's problems currently is: if i raise @ds, what will be the agreed suit|pg||
nt|daman: a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok   and from Rosenberg with 1N |pg||
nt|hackenbush: if they play better minor and support double, North is guaranteed to have 4 clubs|pg||
nt|vbman: if they play they have sps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer might throw a club on a spade and play for a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively try and get the diamonds going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has Sokolow had ANY easy bids this set?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||

nt|othered1: Turns out 2N wasn't free here.  Wonder what 4@D would have meant over 2@S?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|barnets: north still is not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean, south answers with @s fit|pg||
nt|barnets: where to play|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D could be right|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|barnets: now south is worried  he has shown more diamonds than he has|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ybob: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ritong: saving 2 imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hackenbush: this double partner almost certainly has 4 spades, looking for the big payoff when both 2@h and 2@s makes|pg||
nt|hackenbush: though Balderson might be worried that 3@c would show more values|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barnets: souths decision could have been a match winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Dummy showed max, stiff heart|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks sure to be flat|pg||
nt|ritong: lair took a huge view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 & 6 imp swings also add up quickly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: definitely|pg||

nt|swanson: And guess diamonds.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: looks innocuous, but is enormous|pg||

nt|mich-b: a (forcing) 4@C?|pg||

nt|hackenbush: well Valerie Westheimer in the BBO Junior club calls that the flying ace syndrome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C by many would be artificial  [example: same bid as if RHO opened 1N]  so PASS/DBL/3@C were her options|pg||
nt|hackenbush: most play double as negative here over 3@c|pg||

mb|2C|nt|othered1: no board passes out any more, even if two players pass 11 counts in 1 and 2 pos, a rarity in some circles |pg||
nt|ahollan1: stopped NS from finding @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sutherlin knows everyone has about a ten count|pg||
nt|athene: bramley has to be dead min to pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it makes!|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@c = gazilli, natural with clubs, 17+, or 5(332) shape|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|daman: oh my|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N seems reasonable|pg||
nt|vbman: saves opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would bid 2@C on the south hand i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  usually, responder shouldn't have more points than opener:)|pg||
nt|athene: you just don't get rich letting opps play in 1 of things|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Sx for the BAM win|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should bid 5@c now|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: Radin using her entries to lead up to dummy's kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 16+|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: now on that lead e/w can hold dec to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ybob: good spot here|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d was 8+ asking, and 3@c showed a strong hand with spades and clubs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: Except that, absent @S lead, there are 3 losers.  But @H might play worse, when north gets tapped with @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: One possible imp pick up here to Deutsch . . . |pg||
nt|ritong: 9 for sure, let s see about the tenth|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 460, next|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in the other match  with 5 to play  Sprung leads Westheimer by 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of alerting and telling|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Judi just said she misbid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: which could be a very vital imp|pg||
nt|barnets: there is a chance this match could finished tied at the end |pg||
nt|barnets: of the 60|pg||
nt|vbman: small dia l bet|pg||
nt|hackenbush: looks like should've bid 2@s, 4-7 with 2 spades|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|othered1: You have a twice-passed partner and little defense . . . |pg||
nt|athene: i guess he decided there was not much point; most of the time it would just push opps from 1@S making 8 into 2@S making 8 :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  S might have bid 3@d the first time, showing invite values in both suits|pg||
nt|hackenbush: thanks to Stacy Jacobs for helping with the Moss-Radin system|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|ybob: good try by Migry|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: everything in place now|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like 9 only|pg||
nt|daman: they could have gleaned 500 from 4@S doubled|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: I guess the real key is that EW never got @S into the auction|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: exciting stuff|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
nt|barnets: dont leave your seats anyone|pg||

nt|barnets: if n/s play 4@H the match is a tie|pg||
nt|barnets: 13 imps to lynch|pg||
nt|daman: 2@S   1@H   1@C   2@D|pg||
nt|daman: last board now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may just be push or win 4 but still  beating par is always nice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is weak 2@D available?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: started at BAM reverted back to IMP :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but at this stage 1 imp probably not a factor|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the 4@h game would have been reached...or, over 4@c, bid 4@h to give pd a choice of contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: and there will be extra boards|pg||
nt|barnets: if the scoring is corect|pg||
nt|hackenbush: this has been a fast-paced set so far, still 50 minutes left on the clock for the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 140 minutes allotted for each 16-board segment|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|daman: for future matches     http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php     bookmark it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer 3N here|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d is a weak 2 bid in hearts|pg||
nt|hackenbush: EW system summary:|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: Quite a 2@S bid in OR.  Do they play it 2-suited by definition?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, good point barnet|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=833&pid=225|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: in other room west opened 2@S|pg||
nt|daman: sorry folks    we have 16 board quarters    I thought 15   like yesterday    one more after this|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl will get you 4@h too often|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: 3NT from the Nprth hand is the best spot|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead and declarer has only 1 chance to win|pg||
nt|ybob: Now W shows 9 cards @C @H so ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this match or  Schwartz who leads O'Rourke by 45|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|athene: on the rule of 11, north has one club higher than the six|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the king or jack you want to play low in dummy; if it's the 9 or 8 you want to stick in the ten|pg||
nt|othered1: Deutsch has gotten into the lead on the basis of that potential slam on board 42, where they found 6@D in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you can get south on lead next|pg||
nt|andyv:  so odds about 2-1 in favor of 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  as most don't lead away from Jacks|pg||
nt|athene: isn't it exactly 50-50?|pg||
nt|barnets: and this made it more difficult for /s|pg||
nt|daman: North*|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h down 2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: If partner's gonna bid to the 4-level, we probably want to be higher|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ybob: S will play 4@S anyway, now X p 4@S|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@C is a 'fit bid' showing clubs with heart support.  I guess partner has to work out whether it shows any real values or not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
nt|tez: maybe they will stay here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: a good tactical bid|pg||
nt|hackenbush: tempting to pass with West but priority still goes to bidding your own contract first|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: well, he sort of wants to be in dummy to finesse spades|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hackenbush: with 3 defensive tricks, and a fairly offensive hand, both @d and @s might be making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct to 4@H far from automatic with Moss' hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other match  with 4 to score in the set  Sprung leads Westheimer by 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after long dinner break   30 more boards to complete the USA1 semi-final matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winners advance to USA1 Final   losers got to USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good lead, holding values in both unbid suits|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
nt|swanson: I would think that North would take an essentially certain profit against 4@H.  Wrong again.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
nt|ybob: true moment :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
nt|othered1: And indeed with the lucky @D position, EW have slam in either minor or NT|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ybob: can win too|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Profits are good|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@D rounds pitch @C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
nt|hackenbush: still making, as NS can't get in to lead trumps again|pg||
nt|andyv:  what would you bid with: x, Q10xxxxx, Qxx, xx?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting that is:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: in Seniors   Milner leads Lynch by 23     Schwartz over O'Rourke by 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd even wager that most would sit 3N|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hackenbush: wasn't vital to safety play in trumps since can get a spade pitch on the hearts|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: he will see south has five diamonds and one heart|pg||
nt|daman: has to get busy and knock out the @H Ace|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  the perennial double or overcall your major question ... 1@h for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: @H10 lead to the king in dummy and @C7 passed|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mich-b: declarer in the CR took a very unlucky line:|pg||
nt|mich-b: win the @HK in dummy , and immediately @C finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Yes that is 1 down, but 4??|pg||
nt|mich-b: East did well to find a @S switch , and then declarer tried the @D finesse for the 9th trick, and was down 4|pg||
nt|paulg:  just goes to show, finessing is overrated|pg||
nt|Walddk6: What made her take the anti-percentage line clubs I wonder|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mich-b: Actually , I think it was a reasonable effort by declarer , playing on one of 2 minor suit finesses|pg||
nt|Walddk6: yes, and @HQ still protected|pg||
nt|mich-b: instead of trying to run the clubs , and surely going down with @CQxx onside|pg||
nt|mich-b: Note both declarers running the 7 , to keep the @C10 as a re-entry to dummy for a @D finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Same could happen here if Sprung finds the spade switch|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Nothing is clear from her point of view|pg||
nt|mich-b: Was the @C6 by West a subtle signal for a @S stitch?|pg||
nt|mich-b: switch|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps Smith Peter?|pg||
nt|mich-b: It is clear that @C6 was West's highest card , since declarer ran the 7|pg||

nt|andyv:  my point is that pd would bid 4@h with that hand over dbl..so I prefer 3N because I'm simple|pg||
nt|othered1: Really bid 41H over double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with my example hand?  sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C anyone?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 50% grand    do NS think they need it?|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: next session begins in roughly 40 minutes|pg||

nt|hackenbush: many pairs like to play that 3-level preempts have tighter range, depending on colors|pg||
nt|tez: last here.ty all.enjoyed .ty Roberto. TY SPECS|pg||
nt|hackenbush: the players will have a dinner break, and the 3rd segment will start at 6pm eastern time, in a little less than 3 hours|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hackenbush: last board of the set now|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|hackenbush: so favorable 3@c = bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable = random hand  but 2nd seat ??|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes 2nd seat should usually be stronger|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 3@c certainly works better for this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  true.  the problem is the 2@s bid announced some values so slam becomes more problematical.  If you bid 3N, pd should expect that type of hand so may she may be able to bid on.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: an inspired lead|pg||
nt|ybob: Ty Tezcan|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: even 6@D may be challenge after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: no reason to get too fancy|pg||
nt|daman: over to a @S    @C finesse    @C Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might sound heretical, but i never liked 2@C with hand this flexible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- i'm a big clubber so very biased|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: Ty gary:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice clean auction to finish this first set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the more i watch, the more convinced i am that transfers over the DBL work much better than standard  [i.e. a forcing 1@H feels wrong]|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 6@D a reasonable shot now|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to run.  Thanks operator for the solid presentation.  Thanks everyone else and bye|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: Sokolow DBL = 3@H  [support dbl]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: NS did avoid going for 800 in 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminds me of my grandfather     i saved $100,000 dollars today   saw a house i loved and didn't buy it     [it was a long time ago]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: certainly pairs that play transfers over 1@c opening, play it over the double, e.g. Garner-Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if not playing them over 1@C-P   many play them over 1@C-X and 1@D-X|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many more play them over 1M-Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of agony here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those have been around longer|pg||
