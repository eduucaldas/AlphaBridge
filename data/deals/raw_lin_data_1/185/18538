nt|ybob: Hi :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|swanson: A spade overcall and preemptive raise will annoy E-W, but they will still bid game.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the end of it all  there will be 2 USA teams for the 2011 Venice Cup this October in The Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: 14-16 NT for EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|tez: dbl now|pg||
nt|ybob: now X and 4@C or 4@H ?|pg||
nt|swanson: 500 is adequate compensation for game should East pass a reopening double.|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@h|pg||
nt|tez: to dbl|pg||
nt|swanson: (I would pass.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Barnet|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hackenbush: should make easily, 4 clubs a heart and 2+ spades|pg||
nt|tez: hmmm.surprized pass|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a great hand to be using an artificial 2@C rebid - East might even pass.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Interesting that Peter chose not to open 2@s in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|swanson: That was unexpected.  Shows how little they can rely on opening bid values for an opening bid.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 2@C is gazilli 2c, showing either natural or 16+ artificial. |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|barnets: he is at adverse vul|pg||
nt|peachy: I was thinking the same, opp passed partner red he perhaps thought it would bee too risky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes, but even so|pg||
nt|barnets: i wouldn't chance it|pg||
nt|peachy: North in other table also chose Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back, to stay we hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: And welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@C is limited to 7 HCP in the E-W system. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: now what?   @C ruff then .... @D to Q or  @SQ|pg||
nt|hackenbush: should lose 3 more hearts and a diamond at least|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: excellent contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ybob: If you bid 2@H, later you can´t pass to pree of opp at level 3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: or is @DJ better than @D to Q|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Hello Paul|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|hackenbush: in the modern style, doubling then raising partner's suit in competition is just competitive, so East doesn't go on even holding 2 aces|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Ah, my mistake from the distant past, sorry John!|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Too many Swansons, too little time|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|swanson: I except E-W to reach 4@S here, but it has no real chance of coming home.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|swanson: A takeout double is possible here by Levin.  That gives E-W as chance for a plus by defending.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on 50   Meyers opened 2N so playing 3N west|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: NS still should be able to find 3N, but 5@D will work also, as cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joel planning a 2-step to show good hand with 6@S & 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably with weaker hand she would rebid 2@S immediately|pg||
nt|hackenbush: assuming this guarantees 2 of top 3, NS can drive to 7@c, hopefully 5 clubs, 6 diamonds, 1 spade, and a heart ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|barnets: his is down a couple|pg||
nt|hackenbush: especially after the 4@c rebid now|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Defending is for children - bid those games.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: 1 Key Card|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w limit is 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: weichsel relatively lucky|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  good afternoon all|pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT is a game forcing raise (Jacoby) in hearts.  There are many versions of responses after that.  3@H surely showed no shortness.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: this is nice -- i forgot to think about options if Sokolow bidding 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: North can only lead one round of trumps, so the simple defense of winning two diamonds and shifting to a spade seems best.|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe E hopes supp 4th , the only reason to bid 3@H over X|pg||
nt|swanson: East might have redoubled 2@S to indicate a good hand and then listen to what partner has to say.|pg||
nt|ybob: agree|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: 11 tricks likely here, too, as @SQ comes down while cashing out|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well done|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hackenbush: natural to finesse trump now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- retain ability to ruff @H if finesse loses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  Rusinow vs NT  [so Q promised K]    upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|swanson: North shouldn't be concerned about solving a spade guess for declarer; the double has already given away the spade situation.|pg||
nt|swanson: The Larry Cohen version of Jacoby published in the ACBL Bulletin July 2010 is very good - requires a bit of memory work initially.|pg||
nt|othered1: pull trumps then two high @S, just in case the queen is coming down early . . . |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|ritong: in that sense that 3@s is down, so the board was lost already  but yes, probably 4@d makes|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hackenbush: good shift, knockout late entry to spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: play was too fast -- i was contemplating @S @S ruff then @DJ|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|swanson: South doesn't mind this cross ruff - her spades are looking better and better.|pg||
nt|tez: down 1|pg||
nt|tez: whats your choise with west hand..2@s or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff and @D ... ?|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s showed 4+ right?|pg||
nt|swanson: I expect that the 1@S bid showed five cards, so the raise is routine.|pg||
nt|tez: in europe 1@c 1@d 1 major 4+|pg||
nt|ybob: Both tables raise with 3 cards|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@h 1@s 5+|pg||
nt|ybob: I play 1@S as 4 + over 1@D , X = 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: mark me down for 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|swanson: Doesn't have to show five, but I would raise unless I knew for certain that partner held only four spades.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@d dbl shows both majors|pg||
nt|swanson: Some play that the negative double of 1@D is exactly four spades and four or more hearts (using the theory that you can bid spades, then hearts with five spades).|pg||
nt|tez: migry's connection bad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I think she will never play|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|h8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room in 2@S   Stansby's 2@D over the 2@C rebid focused on @H|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|hackenbush: oops unguarded spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did she really do that?|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@H in this case as more than a minimum, balanced (no shortness).|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: it's the sort of 23-hcp 3NT you might wander into, depending on your notrump ranges|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: for example if north showed 12-14 and south invited, north might bid it on the strength of a 5-card suit with side aces|pg||

nt|athene: sure, she has no aces, but still...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if you raise frequently with 4-card support, it's not so appealing to make a game try as you can often be going down at the 3-level|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pef: I think 2s on the north hand is automatic, but there are those who refuse to raise with only three card support|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: i have to say i am not a big fan of frequent 3-card raises - when i can rebid 1NT i like to do that|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|s7|pc|cA|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: i assume on board 35 2@C was gazzilli or some variant thereof|pg||
nt|athene: after which 3@C shows long clubs but a weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: and opener decided to give up|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pef: yes, that seems right, although gazilli is still rare among most american pairs|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That will change|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pef: for those wondering, gazilli means a 2c rebid after a forcing 1nt with most good hands where some other|pg||

nt|othered1: I@D-P-1@S-P-?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: EW  1N=14-16 throughout   wonder if that means 2N = 19- something|pg||
nt|hackenbush: perhaps an upgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: some number of @H likely but 4 could be tricky.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and here i was checking to see what Radid would respond to 1@H :(|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: but West is 2N opener regardless of  how Walter the Walrus counts points|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but this will be an unhappy contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That's my choice, but it wouldn't be allowed in France :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S, rather|pg||
nt|swanson: One hates to rebid 1NT holding a weak doubleton and 3-card support for partner's bid major.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|swanson: The negative is that partner may get your side too high trying for game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: North will balance with 2@S, having denies real values by passing over 2@H.|pg||
nt|swanson: denied|pg||
nt|tez: another part score swing coming?|pg||
nt|othered1: south's game try is certainly understandable|pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT is an inquiry about the raise.  3@D denies four card support.|pg||
nt|swanson: It was North who bid 3@D - not West.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|barnets: bad trump split puts this down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably Seamon-Moss 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: E-W will sell.|pg||
nt|tez: brave @h levin:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vbman: tt|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi Kursat|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|swanson: 3 hearts, 2 diamonds and 1 spade for the defense; nothing either side can do about it.|pg||
nt|swanson: The cards are nicely played for declarer; might well take 10 tricks despite the 4-3 fit and 23 combined HCP.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tez: S/W Have scereen.they sitting same place|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have guessed from the timing of the bids that East and South are on the same side of the screen.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|othered1: north's 3@H is unnderstandable and catches south with  the perfect flat minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry led @Sx   [and it was her artificial 2@D last hand not stansby]|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|hackenbush: should make, playing spade overcaller for club shortness|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|hackenbush: and push out a spade|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|swanson: West has a typical defensive problem: cover the @D10 and eliminate the guess for declarer, or duck and give up a trick if declarer gets it right.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Joel's @S2 says  i can't help @S    Sokolow knows @C is wrong   that seems to limit her choices|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ybob: interesting choice if W had K9x or K10X, uppercout to defeat by 1 on 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: That is correct|pg||
nt|ybob: 4th round @H if that ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Sorry, not correct, E and N on same side|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|swanson: It would be a good try, but declarer could discard a diamond on the fourth round of hearts.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||

nt|swanson: I believe a better play for declarer would have been to not cash the @SA, but to lead to her hand and the finesse again in diamonds.  And, of course, lead out of the correct hand.|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||

nt|barnets: north may bid more|pg||
nt|barnets: slam is less than 50 percent|pg||
nt|barnets: needing no trump loser|pg||
nt|peachy: Curiously enough, NS system summary shows 2D = 1Major|pg||
nt|barnets: north may use key card|pg||
nt|barnets: to find out about the trump Q|pg||
nt|ritong: would you, barnet?|pg||
nt|barnets: that is if he knows how to bid it|pg||
nt|barnets: souths diamonds should be at worst what he is showing with 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: he could have AKQ xxx|pg||
nt|ritong: that s ok, but still|pg||
nt|peachy: Is it possible S forgot they played 2D artificial|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@D shold be RKC|pg||
nt|barnets: do they play 2@D as artificial ?|pg||
nt|barnets: if they do he forgot|pg||
nt|hackenbush: this double is aggressive, unfav opposite passed partner when you have to bid at 2-level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C natural??   only if playing YBYSIBM convention [you bid your suit i bid mine]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N this time?  nope|pg||
nt|swanson: Accidents do happen (not if you play on BBO!).|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Ed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  very little to this hand unless E overbids his values|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, 2D = 1 Major|pg||
nt|barnets: i think 2@D is natural and weak|pg||
nt|daman: we are starting with Board 5     we missed the first 4 boards    will catch up with them later|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D now by South should show this sort of hand    but 3NT is a stone on the layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Debbie Rosenberg did very well not to bid on with the known 11+ fit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|swanson: The biggest problem and a mechanical error (or other blunder) is to put it behind you and spend all you energy on the remaining deals.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|barnets: how do you know this raija?|pg||
nt|daman: pass was not on my radar|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes have to keep the auction open with 3 aces|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|swanson: The play on this hand is dependent on deciding which defender is more likely to hold the doubleton ace of clubs.  An easy choice off the auction.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: some west's might open, which could facilitate getting a bit high . . . |pg||
nt|peachy: System Summary is 100% clear, so either the summary submitted is wrong, or S forgot|pg||
nt|barnets: well the summary submitted must be wrong|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vbman: h spots and cl break helps|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|peachy: Actually, It was not clear, I was looking wrong!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ybob: clear hand to E, N have 4@D after the lead and 4@S, S can´t have 4@H so N is 4342|pg||
nt|swanson: probelm after a mechanical error|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|barnets: north would not have stopped in 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks on board 3 a relatively easy grand was not bid in this room|pg||
nt|othered1: Few grands are easy, but that one was an exception|pg||

nt|vbman: l think radin overlooked poss. that pard cd have passed 1h|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: The A took the 3rd club|pg||

nt|ritong: cards begin to weight a bit more than usuall|pg||
nt|barnets: the contract is in no danger|pg||
nt|barnets: only overtricks|pg||

mb|1C|nt|andyv:  S hand rich in high card points but poor in playing quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin still thought East was 1@S opener|pg||
nt|hackenbush: maybe they play equal-level conversion, where if North bids 2@c, and South 2@d showing @h+@d but not extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@S-DBL    3N north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S really put pressure on NS|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close double decision with Joel, here only 3 hearts with minimum values, but singleton spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I have to go, will leave you all in the capable hands of Barnet Shenkin, Ed Shapiro, and Henri "ritong" Schweitzer. Thx all|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andyv:  the spot cards are not good|pg||

nt|swanson: Seem right to have some bid in your arsenal which shows this diamond suit.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|andyv:  and S should bid the game|pg||

nt|mr murray: 5 diamonds down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting 3@d here|pg||
nt|vbman: and most wd find a bid with norths hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that is if EW come in|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: good x by east in open|pg||
nt|barnets: he knew his partner had 1 spade on auction|pg||
nt|barnets: so he knew he was taking first 4 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: But what if partner had 0 @S?|pg||
nt|barnets: and his partner had 1 for luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, the luck element once again enters|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c and 3@s all look makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wonder how close Rosenberg was to reopening DBL|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mr murray: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: still had chances|pg||
nt|tez: dont lead j of @d:)|pg||
nt|swanson: I hope South doesn't get tricky and lead the @DJ!|pg||
nt|ybob: i choice 3@D in 1st or 3th position|pg||
nt|tez: but you have T of @d|pg||
nt|othered1: Getting a bit high|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer might be able to scrable 7 tricks: 2 spades, 3 hearts and 2 clubs.  The defense can't unscrable their diamond tricks.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  hi Murray|pg||
nt|mr murray: hi|pg||
nt|mr murray: 4 hearts not making|pg||
nt|andyv:  right|pg||

nt|barnets: to beat it|pg||
nt|barnets: i like the x|pg||
nt|daman: North should pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defending 2@S when 6@D actually has a [single dummy] play    conclusion: sometimes preempts work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be fun to watch if they find all their defensive tricks   well Moss won't enjoy it|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 3N may make because of the blockage in @d suit|pg||
nt|vbman: getting strange|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i wonder if 3@h is limited, otherwise not worth a strong jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: And nobody here took any pep pills . . .|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: 3N would have better play as cards lie|pg||
nt|andyv:  both rooms should get to 4@h..only question is whether EW will take the 5@d push|pg||
nt|othered1: more like will west solo to 5@D, since east doesn't have much positive  to say with those tricks in defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  and spec points out that 4@s is another possible EW contract|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: So do I|pg||
nt|barnets: and will be a nice swing for lynch|pg||
nt|othered1: that will take a specific play in the @S suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: unless they get the ruffs right now, then a lesser swing|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: nonevuln:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  a lot of handling problems for declarer|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|swanson: It's understandable because the opening bids are so scratchy.  West has a fourth seat pass using the Pearson point count: number of spades plus high card count needs to totoal 15 ...|pg||
nt|swanson: or more.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: I think 4@S has more disaster potential than 5@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...the handling problems would be very difficult esp. if W hand gets tapped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there goes 1 ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|daman: looks like declarer will make at least 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|swanson: After South shows with six diamond to the AKJ there isn't any possibility she also holds the @SK so declarer will take the winning club finesse.|pg||
nt|tez: probably equal|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a good start, but entries back to @S are lacking|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  a @h shift followed by @d swith may be hard to handle|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  like here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hackenbush: or possibly the player with shortness has to be more aggressive|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|andyv:  need to ruff @h and ruff @d and still be able to pull trump|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vbman: 2 h was my choice|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: probably   but point is   make 'em guess often enough, they'll guess wrong|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  so down 1 looks most likely|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|athene: but they knew she wasn't serious, because she didn't pull out the stop card first :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will West also pass this hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: that seems unlikely :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Now you should play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|pef: 6 clubs an easy make here for east west, but harder to bid than play|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of hand that Gazzilli can help with - if you have to start with a jump shift to 3@C you are eating up a lot of space|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 2@C by West|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Much better|pg||
nt|athene: playing Gazzilli the jump shifts are always real two-suiters (5-5)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: either 11-15 with clubs or any 16+ hand|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway|pg||
nt|pef: yes, we Americans have much to learn from your Europeans, Roland :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: Well put|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: after that start it's had to imagine east west not getting to slam|pg||
nt|pef: note that bidding 4c here always shows good support, usually 5 because when not playing gazzilli, a 3c jump shift is always a little suspect|pg||
nt|pef: so bidding pass 3nt is not likely without very good clubs and a good hand|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes indeed, but Gazilli would diagnose the club fit one level lower and get point range across to|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No one knows hhow strong East is|pg||
nt|pef: yes, I guess I'll have to add gazzilli to my partnership with JoAnna, now, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Definitely|pg||
nt|pef: but we'll call it Wald, ok?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and after 2 hours you will realise that Gazzilli is the best convention there is, alongside negative doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: wow, that's shocking|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: This was not convincing, was it?|pg||
nt|pef: the pass, I mean, not your comment|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with ever bidding 5 of a minor in any strong auction is, partner can't bid blackwood over it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: I agree about Gazzilli being great, but not sure it shows great advantage here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||

nt|othered1: Those 3 imps on the previous board become more significant . . . |pg||
nt|barnets: yes north would not want to lose by 2 or 3|pg||
nt|daman: South will open 1NT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential fireworks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Moss bid over 1@H?  shape nice, suits bad  and vul ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in 10!|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that 3NT was makeable without a @d stopper |pg||
nt|vbman: brb|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anyone for Gazzilli to bid this cold slam? You should be able to bid it without that gadget too, mind you|pg||
nt|othered1: Another possible gazilli hand.  Opener rebids 2@C (may be artificial), east 2@D (artificial 8+ hcp)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|daman: East will bid 2@S    and that will end the auction     |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|andyv:  borderline 2@c opener for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  might open in 2NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N-type auction coming up|pg||
nt|othered1: "Nobody" opens a simple 1@S any more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Make a large number of @D EW, but that may be the 4th suit and could be hard to find|pg||
nt|hackenbush: too weak for michaels, if better spades then 1@s|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a reasonable slam - until clubs go 4-1.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|daman: this must be multi landy?|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D = one major|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E's @h bid will make it harder to get to the slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Every time I make a contrarian play like that, turns out it was contrary to *our* success |pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S is the winning bid here|pg||
nt|othered1: And was made in the OR|pg||
nt|barnets: although 3N may make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with prime controls and 5 card major, it's a difficult choice|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|andyv:  should get to 4@s|pg||
nt|othered1: Then 3@C by opener is 16+ hcp with natural @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, they play that!|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, we had a gazilli auction earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2H = pass or correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same start -- but Jill Meyers balanced with West hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close decision to double, with Radin's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on next board  NS did push to 5@C but Meyers in 5@S  [@H never bid after 1@C opening]|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|tez: not good percantage slam..|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you get to 4@S from here?  Puppet Stayman?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm surprised at the 2N rebid...with pd's neg. dbl, I would think 2@s was pretty automatic with the N hand|pg||
nt|othered1: But 2@S may force the auction too high.  A reason for opening 1@S (then east, not knowing you have that good a hand, will double and you'll eventually play @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec suggests 5@d...it would mean S would have to do a lot of bidding|pg||
nt|swanson: 6@C is an excellent contract - my guess is that E-W will bid it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: club lead is best|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec cant set up spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and has only 8 top tricks|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ritong: but west is known to hold 7 @hs|pg||
nt|barnets: but can make a ninth in hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: big bob would not open 3@h a six bagger first seat at equal vul, would he?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if you can trust partner to pass when it's right, then you can double 4@h more often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or close for Moss to re-open|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|andyv:  E should raise here|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but @H bid opposite void won't improve west hand a whole lot.|pg||
nt|othered1: What would west open with 4=1=4=4?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C support, 4@D  RKC|pg||
nt|othered1: jkIn the OR, west rebid 3@C and they still didn't find it.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C should not be RKC|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The weaker hand should not be captain|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C may be RKC in @C, |pg||
nt|swanson: East should have bid it at the other table after the start 1@S - 1NT; 3@C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: who shuffled these boards?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a conventional treatment here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I'm not impressed|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 4D was meant to play according to the new discussion at the table|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's really the auction, seems like south really evaluates hands up (see board 6 for another example)\|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|daman: EW were going to make 2@S     that was a very bold and competitive bid by North|pg||
nt|ybob: 630 next ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think easier for Moss than Radin|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|othered1: I'm told they play 1430 responses, so it's likely that 4@C wasn't RKC|pg||
nt|swanson: Looks like 4@D was RKC and East has shown 1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: yes a spec points out|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a bit pushy here, but West worth 3@s if @hQ is working|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  Bob makes the efficient bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in OR, 4@h was bid and made|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: that west may duck a heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: in the end game|pg||
nt|barnets: giving dec a losing option|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets: maybe|pg||
nt|swanson: My view is that East should jump in clubs (at either table, over 3@C).|pg||
nt|othered1: This hand hasn't shown the methods at either table well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hackenbush: can really go for a number though with West hand, if South has extras instead of East|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ybob: K98x @S is safety to 600 or 660|pg||
nt|tez: duck j of @c and give 1 imp to opps every hand:)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|barnets: like to see it though|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever the case, the Moss team should have to gain some imps|pg||
nt|othered1: did south take 2N over the double neg 2@H as a replacement bid showing long @H?|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, often a jump raise gets the key point across -- great trumps and extras|pg||
nt|swanson: There is nothing like giving partner a warm, fuzzy feeling about the trump suit.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: after dec cashes his 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  a @c was led and W never got his ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|swanson: East is going to have to underlead the @SA to get three tricks - otherwise North will cash all the winners and lead towards the spade.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: weichsel is known to hold three aces|pg||
nt|barnets: and leads a heart|pg||
nt|othered1: I can't imagine that a jump to 5@C would be considered "fast arrival"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ybob: now small @S = 630, OTHERS 660|pg||
nt|swanson: No, East can hold on to a long heart.|pg||
nt|swanson: Another view: "fast arrival" is one or the worst ideas ever to enter the game of bridge.|pg||
mc|12|nt|andyv:  we are told that 4@d was to play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: She started spade ace, spade ruff then claimed a couple of tricks later|pg||

mb|4D|an|good 4 spade bid|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: 4@D has to be a cue for spades here as south would not introduce another suit at this late stage|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: do I need to explain?|pg||
nt|pef: well I think the key thing is that east would be able to show a club suit and a game forcing hand, right?  after that west certainly won't stop below slam|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure she really has that many extras, given that 2@C was obviously GF|pg||
nt|athene: but i admit that QJ doubleton gets a lot nicer once partner has shown six of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes  3@C is game-forcing after opener showed 16+|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And opener does not know if she should pull to 4@S or not|pg||
nt|athene: you might think that sometimes the contract will depend on a diamond guess and so not want to lead the diamond|pg||
nt|pef: the initial trump lead was really a killer on this hand|pg||

pc|sK|nt|athene: many would not want to lead into KJx from the queen in case it just gave declarer a trick in the suit|pg||
nt|pef: west lost 3 imps with her passout on board 38.  e/w made 1nt (although it looks like it could have been defeated)|pg||
nt|athene: but of course west can see that if declarer has @DAx she is never going to need the diamonds|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: she will just go to dummy with a trump, ruff the clubs good, draw trumps and go over there with a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: smoke break for Migry (and it is a ways to smoke here)|pg||
nt|athene: one other point worth a mention here|pg||
nt|athene: it's very easy, as defenders, to give up when opps have had a strong auction (4@D vaguely slammy in spades)|pg||
nt|athene: then dummy comes down and it would be easy to think "15 hcp in dummy, this isn't going down"|pg||
nt|athene: but when the hand is a misfit declarer often has all sorts of problems|pg||
nt|pef: east west are playing gazzilli in the closed room.  so the auction on board 38 started 1s 1n 2c 2d 3c (roland had|pg||
nt|pef: suggested 2s, not 3c as the opener's third call|pg||
nt|pef: and east raised 3c to 4c|pg||
nt|pef: now 4d which was blackwood, 4h (I guess showing 1 or 4) and a signoff in 5c).  So not a very good showing by either pair with that hand|pg||
nt|pef: 6 clubs seemed like at least a 65% contract |pg||
nt|Walddk2: She could and should have asked for @CQ after the 4@H response|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 4@S, not so difficult|pg||
nt|pef: I agree, I guess she was also worried about the j of diamonds, but why blackwood if you weren't going to bid slam if you weren't missing 2 key cards (including the trump queen)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: OK -- we are back|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|hackenbush: will do well to get out for down 1, late endplay in diamonds|pg||
nt|swanson: 1@D is a transfer to hearts.  West shows a minimum range opening bid and four hearts with 2@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: is e trembling?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: dangerous double at imps when opps have shown game-forcing values|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Judi never trembles, just folds and waits|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: is Rule of 11 still enforced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: donating 14 imps "out of thin air" means you better not get rattled and better pick up imps with your style elsewhere.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Moss picked up 6 imps on board 6 where 2N made 4 in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Just another pushy game you shouldn't bid non-vul, but can't avoid if east's hand is an opening bid in your methods|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|ritong: a standard push, i d say|pg||
nt|othered1: since it's become standard to open east's hand, it is indeed a standard push|pg||
nt|ybob: A@C and K @D to 10 tricks |pg||
nt|swanson: 3NT is best here, but 4@S is sound also. |pg||
pc|h9|nt|swanson: West had to lead a low heart to have any chance.|pg||

nt|hackenbush: helps partner count tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: can you play east for @CJx and a @D position that comes in for two discards?|pg||
nt|othered1: or a @H position that comes in for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: yes, say you lose a @d ruff now, you do not lose the @h anymore|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: on this auction probably easier to get to NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp   but  not surely NOT 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 3H is correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how N went down on last hand|pg||
nt|vbman: what a miracle helps me get 12 here????|pg||
pc|h7|nt|swanson: Declarer will grind it out looking for an overtrick, but by that time she will have nine in the bank.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 9 or 10 tricks here after ruffing a diamond|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|swanson: The only play for the contract I see is KJ doubleton of hearts in the East hand or 3-3 hearts and 2-2 clubs.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: not sure you can afford to give up on the trump finesse quite that happily - if trumps are 3-1, and the defender with @HKxx plays a third round, you only have nine tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|swanson: Guarding against 5-1 spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well now i am sure that 2@C better than 1@S   [at least for this hand]|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: unless the lead was stiff K|pg||
nt|daman: South has a "surround" in @Ss|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  then you have to be unlucky in both minors|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he was hoping something good would happen, and he doesn't want to incur a spade ruff|pg||
nt|vbman: dia to dummy and pray for a h back|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzff: They played too fastj Judi got 3h, 3c and spade A|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: of course this will score better than 4@H|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: found recommended defense of that 2@H opening http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/2c.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL should have been takeout for @C & @D|pg||
nt|swanson: The @D8 establishes a red suit squeeze on West.  Spot cards can be important.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: no more tricks for EW |pg||
pc|d5|pc|s8|pg||

nt|swanson: North might have help her partner by playing the @D10 on the the second round.  That would have saved the overtick.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: people who know me will be shocked by even the slightest hint of seeing a silver lining|pg||
nt|othered1: do  you double 1@C with south hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not strong opinion about it either way|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: will north open 1N or 1@D?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D 1@S 2@D double, seems a possible start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now they hope that the other room in 4@H and defense take their @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: Will Moss open in 3rd?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised he opened 1nt - not because of the 5422 but just because it's a bit good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reliable source tells me  "dbl was 13-15 or 19-plus bal but not essential with that hand opposite a ph"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S or something slower?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hamman sticks to his convictions|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 1@H far from obligatory|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d looks like a good raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|ybob: now 3@H or 3@S ?|pg||
nt|ybob: i like 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter is nice choice|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N didn't occur to me.|pg||
nt|othered1: South *really* comes to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: passing 12 decent|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: end of auction, I presume|pg||
nt|ritong: quacks, etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D transfer   [better raise than 2@H]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and North should double again|pg||
nt|swanson: Too much playing strength for 3@S.  3@H invites game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|daman: I don't know if 2@H is controls or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I don't think anyone knew the 4 of diamonds was high|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and NS earns 50, rather than the 130 that *might* have been attainable|pg||
nt|barnets: X could get 500  now if they pass it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S-P-P-4N?     gulp   didn't anticipate 5@S |pg||
nt|othered1: It wasn't a matter of spots, since 12 @D h ad been played|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  everyone hates to pass 14 point hands:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ybob: O.R. bids 3@S over 2@S|pg||
nt|swanson: A club lead would hold the contract to nine tricks, but East has no reason to lead anything but a heart.|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. ones that have such great shape |pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I entered 2 score corrections in the movie, 1NT previously did make|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: xx was 3 card support|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then again, defending is right if they're only in a 7-card fit|pg||
nt|vbman: will be difficult|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: 3@C was Puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or 120|pg||
nt|athene: having given up control in trumps, north has to be a bit worried about declarer running the spades|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect him to try to cash out in the minors - he would have to find his partner with one king and get him in to lead to the other AQ|pg||
mb|6S|nt|barnets: and 3@Sx showed extra values|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry 3@Dx |pg||
nt|barnets: showed extras|pg||
nt|barnets: looking at all the hands you can make 10 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder why @CK instead of @CA  then @H9|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 3@H showed no major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but i guess he just didn't want to commit to one or other suit|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer is not a lock for 9 tricks should spades be 3-1 and the @DA in the West hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: a race here, but defenders can set up clubs first|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  ty|pg||

nt|ritong: bramley now knows his pard had 3@d for his t/o double|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|athene: maybe south's heart spot|pg||
nt|hackenbush: have to get a club ruff to beat it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss really had no other choice|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ybob: after cue by E one Ace there|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Levin is playing very slowly|pg||
nt|swanson: East should duck the diamond to give the defense any chance.  If West wins the @DJ and returns the @CJ it might get interesting.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I'm not sure we'll ever finish lol|pg||
nt|ybob: now she needs only 4/2 @D |pg||
nt|ybob: @S to K, @D to K @D ruff , @H ruff, @D ruff|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff both @H´s to go to the 5th @D and discard|pg||

nt|athene: there was a hand with this theme earlier on|pg||
nt|pef: 2 diamonds, 1 spade, 1 heart, and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but they only have two club tricks because of the trump promotion|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|pef: no, since he can't get to dummy to take a club finesse, he always has 2 club losers|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pef: well they let him get to dummy, so he has a choice of a club finesse or a diamond finesse now, but can't do both at once :)|pg||

nt|barnets: in open north bid an artificial 1N which i believe showed clubs|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: Peter has his coffee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about the rest of you   but i really enjoy watching good defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the question becomes   over 4@S do EW find 5@C  and if so -- does it make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: couldn't players wait until we figure all of that out?|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Things often move here at lightening speed with Judi in the room|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: NS can make @Cs or @Ds|pg||

nt|hackenbush: now how will South get her values across...|pg||
nt|vbman: 4h correct?|pg||

nt|barnets: that loses here|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of alert explanations|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force   jump to 3N should show 1N strength [but some flaw for 1N open]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and we have our answer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be less or more than 1N opening strength|pg||
nt|ybob: 130 here i hope|pg||
pc|c8|nt|barnets: same bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: next board is promising as well|pg||
nt|barnets: now it went all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was probably a close call for Joel|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: maybe Passell was playing his partner for the @SK rather than a minor-suit king|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N says they never bypass 4-card majors in responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the 14 imps on board 7, the Moss team jumps ahead|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|barnets: and so it goes|pg||
nt|swanson: The @CA would be a reasonable lead on this hand.  West has at least one side entry and might be able to squash a doubleton jack on the second round or unblock the suit.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barnets: personally i think if north shows a club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: south should support him|pg||
nt|barnets: but that my view  who knows|pg||
nt|daman: this will be down quickly    once East wins the @C Ace     EW will cash 2 @Hs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ritong: rather weird, yes  a ten cards fit buried in both rooms|pg||
nt|othered1: @DQ doesn't look very positive and @S were bid on his left, but still A9x is above expectations|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N shows clubs to all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: north has bid his suit with 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she was going to guess the @H10 anyway|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: I am not sure on their system what 2@C would mean|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: when south responds 1@D here it's not saying "I have no 4-card major" but it is saying "you can ignore your 4-card majors to rebid 1nt, i will check back for them if i want to"|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room 1N was clearly alerted to show clubs?|pg||
nt|barnets: can you say if it was clearly alerted here ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause = negotiating claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decision to bid 2@S instead of something else worked well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hackenbush: if East had played back a low heart, inserting @h9 is indicated from restricted choice, besides the fact that East might've tried @hK or spade from @hKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please let that be the case|pg||
nt|swanson: It seems a bit out of charater that Jill Meyers didn't open 1NT.  The hand does offer significant potential should partner have a big pointed suit fit.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: it's debatable whether one should be allowed to bid 4@h, but if they play it as bad hand non-solid 7-card suit then South hand certainly qualifies|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: mary said so|pg||
nt|barnets: if 1n showed clubs 2@C would likely be a cue bid , as would 2@D|pg||

nt|pef: oh, so 1s is 2-3 and 2s is 4 and a minimum after a 1h response?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: would accept the transfer with 2-3 of major and min bal; bid 2 of the M with 4|pg||
nt|athene: this gives you some measure of safety when you respond off zero counts|pg||
nt|athene: you can stop in 1 of the major|pg||
nt|athene: but more importantly it gives you more room with the strong hands|pg||

nt|othered1: a quiet 3N looks very normal here.  And, just in case, 5@D also is OK|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  I like 4@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: on the news they sad the weather in the midwest is the hottest in 5 years|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: 5@C by east / 4@C lets south make a forcing pass, w hich may help their auction|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT asks    3@C shows a bad hand|pg||
nt|daman: Ogustish|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW 1N always 14-16   and Radin downgrades    when was last time you saw THAT|pg||
nt|othered1: could that be construed as a support double?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told by an authoritative source, it is a support double|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Discussion about the double|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: repeating @hs will show 6/5|pg||
nt|barnets: slam is not wonderfull but it makes|pg||
nt|barnets: just one entry to south hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the question is: at which level|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wonder why south didn't bid 4@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which 5?   [sorry  i gotta be me]|pg||
nt|swanson: Depends on partnership agreement.  North might bid 3NT now - it will make with a major suit lead.|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N can't be beaten|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  when pd asks you to pick a major, do you like to torment him by bidding the other minor?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: East not too interested opposite 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|othered1: with the really lucky @S position|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: @sT will be an encouraging card for Moss, partner ostensibly showing @sHx|pg||
nt|swanson: West might have bid 4@C over 3NT, being unwilling to allow the opponents a shot at a vulnerable 3NT.|pg||
nt|vbman: did radin underestimate dias?|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: every imp is vital now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to distinguish  serious vs non-serious slam tries|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 10 tricks and time for coffee.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should be over quickly...S will take the @s hook into W hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so weichsel showed a rockcrushing 6/5 and lair declined|pg||
nt|barnets: a 1 imp swing could be very important for deutsch |pg||
nt|andyv:  black here|pg||
nt|swanson: Yes - the doubleton @SK onside is enough - if declarer goes for it.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: so that decision only affects which hand declares 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: What chhoice does she have on the auction?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ybob: after the 3@C bid, could win 5@D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: and as the cards lie -- it just doesn't matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57  the one where we talked about Rosenberg decision to respond 1@S or 2@C then they ended in 3@H [gulp]   Stansby did start with 2@C and is playing 3N South|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ybob: need guess @D only ...|pg||
nt|swanson: In 3NT with a spade lead declarer leads the @DQ.  If East covers (the reflex play) declarer ducks and has nine winners.|pg||
nt|ybob: scary if E play small :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Judi Radin is leading the @D8 again.  But this time she has better backup - the 4,3 rather than the 3,2.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|othered1: actually this line makes also|pg||
nt|swanson: West has to win and the clubs are blocked, so declarer is still OK.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|swanson: It's clearly the correct play - but one has to make it in tempo (like many good plays) to be successful.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|swanson: These ladies are so aggressive with their opening bids and in other situations, I'm surprised that South didn't take a shot at 3NT.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  claim time |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: on 57  3N South after Stansby responded 2@C vs Rosenberg 1@S  [then the glitch that ended in 3@H]|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ybob: or bid 4@D over 3@S ...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|swanson: The downside is that if diamonds don't come it 3NT will be set multiple tricks.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: minimum number of tricks again|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I entered wrong, it was +450|pg||
nt|ritong: yah|pg||
nt|barnets: that is very important|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|barnets: that makes the score 12 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lost 2 trumpt tricks only|pg||
nt|barnets: to deutsch|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|swanson: But it is down - I didn't count defensive winners - 1 spade, 1 heart - 3 clubs.|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|pef: that;s a lot of winners in the es|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pef: sorry, that's a lot of winners in the west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think it's time for Easely now|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pef: but 4s is the limit on a none heart lead and east west might easily get to the five level|pg||
nt|athene: and west agrees with me|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: unless Joanna leads the ace of hearts this will be defeated|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: small heart lead is possible|pg||
nt|athene: you know west has a monster|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Wheeler:  hope your hand is better than mine|pg||
nt|athene: and surely not two losing hearts |pg||
pc|d6|nt|pef: that was my guess knowing JoAnna|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|pef: and with the huge hand in dummy, this will be easy defense|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: there are many layouts where the small heart is necessary - for example when west has 5-2-1-5 or so and hearts are going on clubs|pg||
nt|pef: 3nt was made on board 44 in closed room to narrow the gap, but I think moss will gain back a bunch of imps on this board|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess there are others where it is costly, such as a stiff heart in declarer's or dummy's hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west unlikely to have 55 in the blacks if they play leaping michaels|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, private commentary gone awry|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|swanson: I wonder if East would have considered a pass to the double with 3-4-3-3?  My guess would be yes.|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, east bid a simple 2@S over the double and west Blackberried into 5|pg||
nt|othered1: and the 3-0 @S break and no @H lead put it -1|pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT is Lebensohl - a relay to 3@C.  A 3@D would then show fewer than 8 HCP.  There is no convention to show this bad of a hand.|pg||
nt|othered1: it does avoid misadventures like that in the OR, at least for the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: which black?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  this 4@h contract will have a lot of work|pg||
nt|athene: west isn't too happy on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: if they dont play support she has 4 cl|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ritong: 3@d likely infers three cards raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Thx|pg||
nt|barnets: if n/s play slam in diamonds they could lose  a couple of vital imps|pg||
nt|barnets: unless its 7 of course !|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: they are going to have a small BW problem imo|pg||
nt|ritong: about the trump suit|pg||
nt|barnets: lynch have a likely pick up on the last board so this hand may be decisive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting decision from Seamon-Molson|pg||
nt|swanson: 4NT doesn't make with a diamond lead - the West hand would be squeezed at trick two.|pg||
nt|othered1: Auction there does seem reasonable, as all east needs is @D9 or any 4 to  have a decent play for 5|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: whatever he leads helps declarer to an extent|pg||
nt|barnets: north will place the final contract\|pg||
nt|ritong: one of weichsel's problems currently is: if i raise @ds, what will be the agreed suit|pg||
nt|daman: a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok   and from Rosenberg with 1N |pg||
nt|hackenbush: if they play better minor and support double, North is guaranteed to have 4 clubs|pg||
nt|vbman: if they play they have sps|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer might throw a club on a spade and play for a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively try and get the diamonds going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has Sokolow had ANY easy bids this set?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|barnets: souths 3@D shows 3  card spade support|pg||
nt|othered1: Turns out 2N wasn't free here.  Wonder what 4@D would have meant over 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1430 response, but here they've right-sided the contract and north may lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|swanson: Why shouldn't 4NT here be natural?  I would cue bid 3@H, then 4NT to use RKC.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: some play it has 3 and a non minimum|pg||
nt|barnets: now a cue bid|pg||
nt|barnets: meanwhile north has not supported diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|othered1: OK, that will  change the situation|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: now it is @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  W took a pretty conservative stance on this one...lebonsohl should have applied and she should have been able to compete in 3@ds|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|barnets: north still is not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean, south answers with @s fit|pg||
nt|barnets: where to play|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D could be right|pg||
nt|swanson: No reason to lead a heart now.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|barnets: now south is worried  he has shown more diamonds than he has|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ybob: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: saving 2 imps|pg||
nt|reisig: YES!!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hackenbush: this double partner almost certainly has 4 spades, looking for the big payoff when both 2@h and 2@s makes|pg||
nt|hackenbush: though Balderson might be worried that 3@c would show more values|pg||
nt|swanson: Good choice by JoAnn on lead.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: souths decision could have been a match winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Dummy showed max, stiff heart|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks sure to be flat|pg||
nt|ritong: lair took a huge view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 & 6 imp swings also add up quickly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: definitely|pg||
nt|ybob: she needs run the first @S to 12|pg||
nt|swanson: And guess diamonds.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: looks innocuous, but is enormous|pg||
nt|barnets: of course north had not guaranteed 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: so the whole situation is wooly to say the least|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: and good double by Janet, given the chance|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: seems she should have gotten that right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just don't ask me why|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is going to go for a club ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time to claim|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: now needs exact @S layout  and that will mean Radin holds @CQ  else she would have opened 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is just for down 1|pg||
nt|hackenbush: unfortunately can't get to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right  needed @HK as entry|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  one of the key facets in defense is to try not to break new suits for declarer hence Bob's return of a @s|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: finally getting some real help from opp|pg||
nt|swanson: Good choice by Janet to double.  That was not clear at all.|pg||
nt|reisig: a push ...WOW|pg||
pc|c6|nt|swanson: Still has to guess diamonds for 11. |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vbman: might ve dbl partscore swing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  the tough part is now|pg||
nt|andyv:  best seems AK @h and ruff @c|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only worry now is holding the trump losers to one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you ruff a diamond now|pg||
nt|athene: you know west has the king still so that isn't getting overruffed|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @d ruff, E pitches @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but you might still be able to combine chances in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: with some trump coup possibilities|pg||
nt|andyv:  so basically the same thing but ruff 1@d first then AK@h?  that works too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: she will take the money and run    no finesses|pg||
nt|ybob: now 11 surely|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: does doubleton trump Q help here?     @C finesse, @SA @SK   nope doesn't help|pg||
nt|ybob: with 4/1 @S|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: declarer's main problem here is he wants to take the trump finesse if east has four trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  nicely done|pg||
nt|athene: but that would be very bad if west could win from Qxx and return a trump to kill the club ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||

nt|athene: so the one thing you don't want to do in those situations is a bid a 3-card major|pg||
nt|athene: because partner always gets over-excited|pg||
nt|pef: I would just grit my teeth and bid 2n lebensohl and show the suit I sort of actually have|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|pef: very unlucky spades were 3-0 so no dummy entry, but in a sense deserved|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: not Al Roth's idea of an opening bid :)|pg||
mb|1S|an|various; diamonds or bal|nt|athene: he might open the north hand, i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|pef: possibly :)|pg||
nt|pef: but I bet he'd be in slam with the north hand if partner opened the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now when north bids 2@S she has shown a game force with 5+@D and 4+@S i guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pef: and if the south hand was dummy there would be blood on the table :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this might just go 2nt, 4nt, end|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: 4NT "have you got an opening bid, pd?"  pass "no, and i wish we were in 3nt, not 4"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, Migry doesn't even bother to make a slam try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Stansby:  as usual, you have me happily covered|pg||
nt|pef: on the previous hand, east west are playing 5 spades, also, but at least from the correct side and north might lead a heart from qx|pg||
nt|athene: it's not such a great hand i guess with no fit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: Rose quickly with club A|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yuk|pg||
nt|andyv:  E must have been endplayed in trump suit.  That should be a very good result for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there might be a more technical term|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what will Moss do over 1N overcall?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if there was some sequence that could induce opp to win @S and then play another @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: soooo....|pg||
nt|ritong: is that one mundane?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the idea of ruffing some diamonds was that you might then be able to cash the @HAK and even if west showed out you would not necessarily be dead|pg||
nt|athene: as you might have a trump coup against east|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hand|pg||
nt|daman: NS will end up in another lazy 4@H contract|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well Valerie Westheimer in the BBO Junior club calls that the flying ace syndrome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C by many would be artificial  [example: same bid as if RHO opened 1N]  so PASS/DBL/3@C were her options|pg||
nt|hackenbush: most play double as negative here over 3@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but might be scary if partner passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with the lack of values  negative would definitely apply|pg||
nt|othered1: double is reasoned -- after the blackwood, she has a strong idea that declarer isn't losing >1@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: well|pg||
nt|daman: now they satnd to gain an IMP or 2|pg||
nt|daman: stand*|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you handle north's hand.  Doesn't look exactly right for 2N, but I guess it gets at least 10 of your cards into the auction|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: good 3@C bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: no board passes out any more, even if two players pass 11 counts in 1 and 2 pos, a rarity in some circles |pg||
nt|ahollan1: stopped NS from finding @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: sutherlin knows everyone has about a ten count|pg||
nt|athene: bramley has to be dead min to pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it makes!|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@c = gazilli, natural with clubs, 17+, or 5(332) shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: oh my|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N seems reasonable|pg||
nt|vbman: saves opps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: i would bid 2@C on the south hand i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  usually, responder shouldn't have more points than opener:)|pg||
nt|athene: you just don't get rich letting opps play in 1 of things|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Sx for the BAM win|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should bid 5@c now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Radin using her entries to lead up to dummy's kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: choice of evils raise by south|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: now on that lead e/w can hold dec to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ybob: good spot here|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d was 8+ asking, and 3@c showed a strong hand with spades and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Except that, absent @S lead, there are 3 losers.  But @H might play worse, when north gets tapped with @D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: One possible imp pick up here to Deutsch . . . |pg||
nt|ritong: 9 for sure, let s see about the tenth|pg||
nt|reisig: will gain 1-2 IMPs here|pg||
nt|reisig: N S|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer can win six high card outside of trump and then cross ruff as many as possible.|pg||
nt|othered1: In the CR, south opened the 10-count and north still let the auction die at 3N|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ybob: 460, next|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: in the other match  with 5 to play  Sprung leads Westheimer by 7|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|barnets: which could be a very vital imp|pg||
nt|barnets: there is a chance this match could finished tied at the end |pg||
nt|barnets: of the 60|pg||
nt|vbman: small dia l bet|pg||
nt|hackenbush: looks like should've bid 2@s, 4-7 with 2 spades|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|othered1: You have a twice-passed partner and little defense . . . |pg||
nt|athene: i guess he decided there was not much point; most of the time it would just push opps from 1@S making 8 into 2@S making 8 :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  S might have bid 3@d the first time, showing invite values in both suits|pg||
nt|hackenbush: thanks to Stacy Jacobs for helping with the Moss-Radin system|pg||

nt|pef: but east responded blackwood|pg||
nt|athene: Radin had to pass 4nt to get a positive score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: 2 more this segment and we'll resume in about 1/2 hour|pg||
nt|pef: yet another bid hand for west|pg||
nt|athene: actually, passing 4nt is no good|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: defence can cash the @DAK and striup squeeze west|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: right because on a diamond lead your hand gets squeezed and there are four losers|pg||
nt|athene: you have to pitch a winner to keep @HKx and then they put you in with  a black card and take two hearts at the end|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pef: but at least it had a chance|pg||
nt|athene: so it seems there is just no way to get a plus score with that west hand :) a pity , it looks so nice :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|pef: 3s here must have been a mixed raise, because it seems far too strong for a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|athene: many would bid 3@H with east as some sort of mixed raise thingie|pg||
nt|pef: but if that is so, I would have tried a lot harder for slam on the west hand.  finesses rate to work.  all you really needed from partner was a shape where you only had one club ...|pg||
nt|pef: loser|pg||
nt|athene: if you don't have a special bid available to show that sort of middling 4-card raise then it's probably better to use the jump raise to show it because that is a much more frequent ...|pg||
nt|athene: hand type than the pure pre-empt, after 3rd seat has passed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: West was going to bid game the minute she knew her partner had four spades, anyway, of course|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h4|pc|s5|nt|pef: west has to guess the minor suit distribution well to make 6|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if they will double 1@H in the other room? very strong for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|pef: she has to guess that south has 2 clubs and 3 diamonds instead of the other way around|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pef: but now that she's played 2 trumps, south can always win a club and play back a third trump|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|d6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|sJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pef: to maike six she needed to play a diamond to the king and lead a club early, then play two more diamonds pitching a club, ruff a club ruff a heart, ruf a club, etc.|pg||

nt|daman: last board now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may just be push or win 4 but still  beating par is always nice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is weak 2@D available?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: started at BAM reverted back to IMP :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but at this stage 1 imp probably not a factor|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the 4@h game would have been reached...or, over 4@c, bid 4@h to give pd a choice of contracts|pg||
mb|1H|nt|barnets: and there will be extra boards|pg||
nt|barnets: if the scoring is corect|pg||
nt|hackenbush: this has been a fast-paced set so far, still 50 minutes left on the clock for the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 140 minutes allotted for each 16-board segment|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: for future matches     http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php     bookmark it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer 3N here|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d is a weak 2 bid in hearts|pg||
nt|hackenbush: EW system summary:|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Quite a 2@S bid in OR.  Do they play it 2-suited by definition?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, good point barnet|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=833&pid=225|pg||
mb|1S|nt|barnets: in other room west opened 2@S|pg||
nt|daman: sorry folks    we have 16 board quarters    I thought 15   like yesterday    one more after this|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl will get you 4@h too often|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|daman: 3NT from the Nprth hand is the best spot|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead and declarer has only 1 chance to win|pg||
nt|ybob: Now W shows 9 cards @C @H so ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this match or  Schwartz who leads O'Rourke by 45|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Another bid hand where the opponents open first|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: on the rule of 11, north has one club higher than the six|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the king or jack you want to play low in dummy; if it's the 9 or 8 you want to stick in the ten|pg||
nt|othered1: Deutsch has gotten into the lead on the basis of that potential slam on board 42, where they found 6@D in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you can get south on lead next|pg||
nt|andyv:  so odds about 2-1 in favor of 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  as most don't lead away from Jacks|pg||
nt|athene: isn't it exactly 50-50?|pg||
nt|barnets: and this made it more difficult for /s|pg||
nt|daman: North*|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: If partner's gonna bid to the 4-level, we probably want to be higher|pg||
nt|othered1: big hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ybob: S will play 4@S anyway, now X p 4@S|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@C is a 'fit bid' showing clubs with heart support.  I guess partner has to work out whether it shows any real values or not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
nt|tez: maybe they will stay here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: a good tactical bid|pg||
nt|hackenbush: tempting to pass with West but priority still goes to bidding your own contract first|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: well, he sort of wants to be in dummy to finesse spades|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hackenbush: with 3 defensive tricks, and a fairly offensive hand, both @d and @s might be making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct to 4@H far from automatic with Moss' hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: in other match  with 4 to score in the set  Sprung leads Westheimer by 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after long dinner break   30 more boards to complete the USA1 semi-final matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winners advance to USA1 Final   losers got to USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good lead, holding values in both unbid suits|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
nt|swanson: I would think that North would take an essentially certain profit against 4@H.  Wrong again.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
nt|ybob: true moment :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
nt|othered1: And indeed with the lucky @D position, EW have slam in either minor or NT|pg||
nt|swanson: West wasn't ambitious enough with these card - but after 5@S down 1 a couple hands ago it is easy to understand.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ybob: can win too|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Profits are good|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@D rounds pitch @C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
nt|hackenbush: still making, as NS can't get in to lead trumps again|pg||
nt|andyv:  what would you bid with: x, Q10xxxxx, Qxx, xx?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting that is:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Seniors   Milner leads Lynch by 23     Schwartz over O'Rourke by 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd even wager that most would sit 3N|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hackenbush: wasn't vital to safety play in trumps since can get a spade pitch on the hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: he will see south has five diamonds and one heart|pg||
nt|daman: has to get busy and knock out the @H Ace|pg||
nt|othered1: west was really quick with her auction.   Change the @HK for the @CQ and slam would be excellent, if y ou could find it.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
mc|11|nt|barnets: so we have a 6 board play off and hope to bring it to you|pg||

mb|2N|nt|pef: and thanks for both bbo and the usbf for making this all possible.  the fourth of six segments will begin in about 15-20 minutes right here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: if there is anything to dampen the enthusisasm of a player with 8 spades, it's hearing partner bid an unusual 2nt :)|pg||
nt|pef: well at least she isn't 1-1 in the minors :)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C Unusual vs Unusual - the lower cue to show a strong hand with hearts|pg||
nt|pef: 3c was limit raise or better in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be strong with spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pef: actually many reverse that now, 3d would be competitive or really strong in spades and 3s forcing in spades.  that's so you can still play 3h if necessary|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|pc|d2|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pef: JoAnna is very aggressive nv v vul, but 4 spades does seem like a lot here|pg||
nt|pef: but she is going to turn out right since down 3 beats the easy heart game|pg||
nt|athene: well, it wasn't that easy in the other room, apparently|pg||
nt|pef: which actually went down in the closed room, hmm|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: north wins the @HA and the defence crossruff the pointed suits|pg||
nt|pef: does a diamond lead actually beat 4h?  I guess it does|pg||
nt|pef: wow that's unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: it's a bit harsh when you have that south hand and partner still has enough defence to beat 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: for an unusual 2nt overcall!|pg||
nt|pef: very harsh indeed|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pef: I guess you can say you have that much defense :)  since two of the tricks are your king of clubs and your diamond ruff|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pef: so this will be 10 imps and a tie match at the halfway point|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|reisig: Now ...we have a MATCH!!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: we had a match before, but now someone has lit it :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the set   restart in about 2.5 hours|pg||
nt|ybob: OR lead was J@C and declarer win the first trick and go down|pg||
nt|ybob: if she duck 1 @C cold too |pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board for us -- other rooms still in play  and lots of bridge tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  my point is that pd would bid 4@h with that hand over dbl..so I prefer 3N because I'm simple|pg||
nt|othered1: Really bid 41H over double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with my example hand?  sure|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzff: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C anyone?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 50% grand    do NS think they need it?|pg||
nt|othered1: partner doesn't need a miracle hand to have 12 top tricks, just 2K and a couple of @C|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3C!|nt|hackenbush: too bad they're favorable|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C likely shows a decent hand with @H (invitational+)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: no trf response after X|pg||
nt|vbman: not moss 3cl off course|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|daman: next session begins in roughly 40 minutes|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C must show @Cs obviously|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many pairs like to play that 3-level preempts have tighter range, depending on colors|pg||
nt|tez: last here.ty all.enjoyed .ty Roberto. TY SPECS|pg||
nt|hackenbush: the players will have a dinner break, and the 3rd segment will start at 6pm eastern time, in a little less than 3 hours|pg||
nt|othered1: "Unusual oer Unusual" some call it|pg||
nt|othered1: over|pg||
nt|swanson: Another good chance for South to double.|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe just a good  hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: last board of the set now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|hackenbush: so favorable 3@c = bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable = random hand  but 2nd seat ??|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes 2nd seat should usually be stronger|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 3@c certainly works better for this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  true.  the problem is the 2@s bid announced some values so slam becomes more problematical.  If you bid 3N, pd should expect that type of hand so may she may be able to bid on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: an inspired lead|pg||
nt|ybob: Ty Tezcan|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even 6@D may be challenge after this start|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: no reason to get too fancy|pg||
nt|daman: over to a @S    @C finesse    @C Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might sound heretical, but i never liked 2@C with hand this flexible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- i'm a big clubber so very biased|pg||
nt|swanson: The defense can get a club, a heart and two ruffs after a diamond lead.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tez: Ty gary:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice clean auction to finish this first set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: the more i watch, the more convinced i am that transfers over the DBL work much better than standard  [i.e. a forcing 1@H feels wrong]|pg||
nt|othered1: 9, showing suit preference?|pg||
nt|swanson: North leads a high diamond to indicate a spade return.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: 6@D a reasonable shot now|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to run.  Thanks operator for the solid presentation.  Thanks everyone else and bye|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: Sokolow DBL = 3@H  [support dbl]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: NS did avoid going for 800 in 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminds me of my grandfather     i saved $100,000 dollars today   saw a house i loved and didn't buy it     [it was a long time ago]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: certainly pairs that play transfers over 1@c opening, play it over the double, e.g. Garner-Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if not playing them over 1@C-P   many play them over 1@C-X and 1@D-X|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many more play them over 1M-Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of agony here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those have been around longer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: from the players or the specs following our ramblings?>|pg||
nt|vbman: no finesse|pg||
nt|hackenbush: right, because not enough tricks if it loses|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Debbie|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe cl finesse then dia finesse she thinks|pg||

nt|hackenbush: good spade play by EW|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
mc|9|nt|othered1: Well defended|pg||
nt|othered1: and you did need a low @C lead to beat 3N, as cards lie|pg||
nt|swanson: Leading a diamond rather than a club was a thoughtful play by North.  The defense is more like to get a club trick but the diamond has a better chance of producing a ruff.|pg||
nt|othered1: and south had a chance to double 3@C and didn't.|pg||
nt|swanson: A club lead would set the contract also (could).  the defense could take two clubs and a spade ruff and the @HA.|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have doubled because I would prefer a club lead (not know that partner had trump control and a spade void).|pg||
nt|swanson: Thanks everyone, an exciting set of boards.|pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR, south chose to bid her 8-bagger after partner's unusual NT, bringing Team Sprung within one IMP of Team Moss.|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks, everyone.  Next set should be up shortly.|pg||
