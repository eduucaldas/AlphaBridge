nt|yorkbeach:  and welcome back everyone|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  system card for NS http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=747&pid=978|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW should reach game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT by East looks to be making|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s lead from North would be more of a problem|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting East to open 1@h, West to respond 2@c and East to rebid 2@d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is well worth a 2/1 game force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hopefully we will see the actual bidding in a moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  hello again everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  action may take place quickly|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  West has found the 2@s rebid, which avoids wrong-siding 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: club lead made 4|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|yorkbeach:  South's overcall will keep EW out of their 4-4 fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: club lead, made 6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the diamonds blocked, 3NT would make|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: WHEW!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we have probably caught up now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  many thanks Mary|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW close to game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  but duplication in @h (3 cards in each hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  though @h diacrd from dummy on the @cA could be useful|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no equal level conversion x?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: classic!|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  with her good values, East might have X 1NT (for takeout) knowing she could convery clubs to diamonds without raising the level|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: she told me ceeske, but ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: is that correct?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Ns have done well to buy the contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yorkbeach:  EW have 4 top winners|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  double dummy lead of the @cK would have beaten this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could underlead the @sA and cash the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: real time now :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  nobody is going to find that|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  second chance to draw dummy's trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still tough to find|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: fondles ace s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: fondles d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East needs to think 'if declarer has the @cA, how are we beating this?'|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: asks q|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably East wants to know what 1@h-3@c shows|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: fondles low spade!|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|sJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  brilliant by Mildred Breed|pg||
mc|7|nt|yorkbeach:  just to lose 1 IMP!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bridge can be a cruel game sometimes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: other room problems, hope we get results for bds 1 and 2|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|andyv:  nobody wanted to play a simple 4@h:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they might play a penalty double over 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: heart queen lead if cindy passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  their card confirms 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  E guessed the N's major was not @ss|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: could have been though, S had 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|irwinbo: was 3 d really three clubs?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  looks like E can make this easily on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may be playing transfers where 3@D would be stayman|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|pc|s7|nt|hackenbush: ah, EW one of few pairs to have submitted a convention card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense needed to shift to spades after second heart ducked|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/docs/2011uswbc/acblcards/PollackBjerkan.bmp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however disa should not have discarded a diamond, if in fact she did|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wonder if east's 2nt would be the winning bid in the bridge world   many would double|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h5|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|andyv:  NS have no response to final 3 tricks for EW.  In hindsight, S probably wished she'd led a @s|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  West will probably insist on game|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: real time :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @cQ lead looks normal|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will need to take a bit of care|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  making sure she can enjoy the spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  low @c probably best now but declarer can prevail|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: that's the play my reg partners never make...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play standard count, so North was keeping her options open by playing the @s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might duck a @h next|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer cashes the @sJ first, there would be a danger of a ruff by the hand with a doubleton trump|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  both sides can make 11 tricks with their chosen trump suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  more on the wrong lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yorkbeach:  hard to predict what is going to happen|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  correction 5@c is not on - 3 top losers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  more losers in 5@h if North scores a @c ruff or two|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is trying to work out whether 5@c is to play or just a lead-directing bid in case NS bid 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  plus wondering whether her partner could be void in @s, when a slam could be on|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  given the vulnerability, NS could easily have 10 @s between them|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfj: count or attitude? :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  king|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card says @d2 is standad attitude|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps South is more confidet that her partner has only 6@s than that she has fewer than 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: that's my thought|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  just so long as North does not think South is void in @h :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: that's my worry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: heart!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
