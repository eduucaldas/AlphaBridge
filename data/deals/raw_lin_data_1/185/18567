mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: This may die in 1NT.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Vugraphzfj: must be good.bad 2nt, so 3c is good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: hi all|pg||
nt|jcwla: W scrapes up 2@H and N may X.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|pef: seems like only last year this event began :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: north, who has held boring cards, now excited|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Hi, I'm Mary Smith, hope we have a commentator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: north sighs|pg||
nt|jcwla: A DSI double it would be but none forthcoming so 2@H the spot.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: a bit surprising north didn't double, but joel was a third hand opener and it is imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: Still it was a 1-opener and I don't think S is the most apt to get frisky in this context.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|pef: looks like we are just fighting for undertricks at 50 per at the moment|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: With the @D count S could safely duck the @DK later but with @CJ coming down doubleton in either case not a major factor here.|pg||

nt|pef: I believe it is 15-17, but I'll check|pg||
nt|jcwla: 14-16 I'm told, thanks.|pg||
nt|pef: ah, ok|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcwla: I certainly agree with bidding 1NT so long as the hand is within the agreed range.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sometimes you hear people say "But you have an easy 1@S rebid" - so often that is not the case.|pg||
nt|pef: not sure if I like 1nt on that hand anyway with the 4252 shape, but some believe in opening 1nt whenever it's even barely conceivable|pg||

pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfj: ron says he showed 22-23|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|tez: i bet it will not end at 4@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|peachy: One of Benito Garozzo's "rules" says one must have agood reason not to lead trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: real slow 3h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|puncher99: east worried about spades|pg||
nt|peachy: The club values though good in isolation, have lost their luster|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: west thinks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: you were right|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@s quickly at the end|pg||
nt|pef: vul. with partner probably having a yarborough on this auction?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s6|nt|puncher99: non trump lead usually means honor is offsides|pg||

nt|tez: i know we are vuln..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: I'|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcwla: Levin's wafer thin raise kept NS out of @H - but fairly astounding that W settled for a GT with a red bonus at stake.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|peachy: I've been reminded it was lustre (luster is a person who, hm, er, lusts)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pef: that I certainly agree with.  vul at imps a game try is to bid game and try to make it, especially on a hand like west|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|cJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|vagabond3: i like to define weak jump shift as a hand that woudln't invite facing a strong notrump - that makes opener's decision easier|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: pushing when so far down won't work here, surprised no double|pg||
nt|pef: many expert pairs have specific agreements as to different types of maximums after opening 2nt and getting a transfer|pg||
nt|jcwla: Both N's super-accepted.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S a bit undisciplined? - 3@S not really inviting; she has 3@H for that|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: all the swings went the other way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree william|pg||
nt|athene: and spade finesses likely to be wrong on the auction - still it's hardly the worst vul game ever bid|pg||
nt|peachy: Partner has surprise diamond card, but even if that were in clubs, still not great|pg||
nt|athene: and i guess might well be bid in the other room|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pef: so 4 hearts here would show a good three card acceptance and 3s a true super accept with four trumps.  I don't know if that's how they play it but it is very useful to discuss|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: and note the score,  we have a new match (almost)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|peachy: The vulnerability inspires to bid game, if borderline. Normal enough|pg||

nt|athene: 2@H opener from South might cause them a little bit of bother but not that much|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H p 4@H would present challenges|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|pef: if you are going to feel moderately sick if partner bids 4 hearts, I don't think you want to double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pef: for what it's worth I agree with her pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whether you agree with her style or not, you have to respect Joel's consistency.  The one thing that is too tough on partner is to change your style on similar decisions from one ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: hand to the next.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: what do you bid to 3@s?..hard hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: but I don't like the three spade bid particularly|pg||

nt|fabsayc: does it really matter they were mislabeled, if the same at both tables|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose the laws define what vulnerabilities are in each board number and the game cannot be played with boards that are not "legal", I am just guessing of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if it takes away a good result and replaces with a worst one, i have a feeling this entire match may go to commitee|pg||

mb|p|nt|heyz:  3@d would allow 3@s|pg||
nt|heyz:  debating 4N quantitative again?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and bringing home the 3 nt was +10 for n/s |pg||
nt|heyz:  i don'y know if i can personnally stand multiple 4N mixups per 16 board set, debbie is probably made of stronger stuff|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree, you really need to have that sorted out |pg||
nt|heyz:  29 was a really neat hand i wish i could have seen the position faster|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|pef: auction here likely to duplciate the open room. |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: and it has so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play with one pard (from Neth.)  who NEVER plays quanti |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: think we are off to the races here|pg||
nt|heyz:  now this has to be really good news|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: 2d was alerted, don't think it showed support|pg||
nt|pef: and it stopped duplicating|pg||
nt|sybarra: remind me bill, lets not to rubber bridge agst n/s|pg||
nt|sybarra: not play that is, even if asked|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: i am told they actually played different boards at the two tables, there are two sets of boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this is going to take a lot of work to make.  it may not even be possible|pg||
nt|pef: the straightforward line would be to rely on the diamond finesse but we can see that that fails|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|pef: the only route to success would seem to be to use both heart entries to ruff clubs and then be lucky that the doubleton heart was with the stiff spade|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|fabsayc: that would explain the necessity to redeal|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator,  think we have a pass too many |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: E-W ran out of pass cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Gary, you need to relook at auction on screen :)|pg||
nt|heyz:  this asks Q@s 5@h North|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: mohan has a dilemma now, as he knows clubs will run|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: but not unreasonably she is taking the diamond finesse and failing a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 8 imps to the Joel team|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|heyz:  wonder why 5N not 6@d, but weren't bidding 7 anyway|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|Vugraphzfj: must show good hheart raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: henry has corrected me, it's that if the suit is hearts :)|pg||

mb|2H|nt|pef: with four hearts cold east west|pg||
mb|p|nt|heyz:  is 4@c a big @h raise here|pg||
nt|heyz:  ?|pg||

nt|peachy: This sounds natural to me, am I alone in that?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you are :)|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm|pg||
nt|pef: north bid 2n unusual.  sokolow doesn't much like her diamond suit, but it does seem right to do something with the north hand|pg||
nt|pef: so this hand might win those 8 imps right back|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but we will throw cards agst the wall and make 6 hts? |pg||
mb|4D|nt|Vugraphzfj: action|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S looks cold but is not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: trump best?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: breathing can cost too|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only +1 |pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: trump is certainly possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamonds wicked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the alternative is tap declarer if possible and duck diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chambers must think lead could be from KJ10xxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: this was made in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is why i like jack denies, and for sure in this situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: they say it costs but in 7 years has never hurt me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no way to pick up the hts |pg||
nt|heyz:  y, cant make six|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: for the specs asking, it's not clear to me why sokolow doubled with only 2 spades either.  usually that double would be a good hand with heart shortness and the other three suits|pg||

nt|heyz:  good stop|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: this appears to be a better contract than 3nt simply because at worst it goes one down|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|pef: which spade she plays here doesn't matter much.  the final hurdle is going to decide how to play diamonds.  we can all see the finesse works, but it wouldn't be ridiculous to play ...|pg||
nt|pef: east for qx or q stiff queen given how the play has gone so far|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|heyz:  diamond tap looks deadly|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|pef: and she's thinking|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pef: she is almost certain east doesn't have stiff small|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|sybarra: or does she try to cross ruff it out?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|heyz:  spade 8 comes into play|pg||

pc|s3|nt|pef: and playing the preempter for two aces is hard|pg||
