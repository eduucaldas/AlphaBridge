mb|p|mb|2S|nt|007 joosth: 6S will be down on a club lead.  thats why the 9card fit is safer :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|bobh1: well at least somebody mentioned @Cs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but also 6C is not a very good slam  when spades are not 3-3 you nead very many ruffs|pg||
nt|sybarra: can N lead ace and a @C if they land in 6 @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  it might be a Q in this context though|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: Something wrong with auction|pg||

nt|sybarra: some will say,  "god gave you singletons to lead"|pg||
nt|sybarra: but only defending 4 |pg||
nt|noodle:  since Fisher didn t bid 2@h  I suspect he expected a 5 card @s suit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if canapee, would 3H mean 4 clubs  and 3S  5 clubs?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but then you cant bid hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: i just looked at the Fisher Hamilton card|pg||
nt|bobh1: 5-cd majors|pg||
nt|bobh1: no mention of canape|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a club between that nice spades maybe|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe had a club in with the spades |pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|noodle:  then it was a 'decision' 1@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think Fred just made a battlefield decision|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well 1 reason might be the quality of the suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "good news" is the short spade hand will be ruffing @D's|pg||
nt|noodle:  there is a lot to be said to open the suit over your singleton, but then we played 4 card majors when I learned that :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he will not go for ruffs. but just play the clubs first|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|007 joosth: can afford a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am old fashioned 2/1 player,  I still prefer 1 @C  (if not a club system)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: me 2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe not in 3d hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: in the other room they got to a much worse contract|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this is a nice duck to, though not necesary|pg||
nt|bobh1: was lucky to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes how did they make it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ducked a @D or 2 |pg||
nt|bobh1: South has no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: south asking w about 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: and prayed for no ace of clubs with S |pg||
nt|noodle:  in 4@s ducking a @D to retain control is very good  trumps will often be 4-2|pg||

pc|cK|pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|peachy: the play also, surely ace was not used to capture a trick when 10 was enough|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hlortz: seems likely n opened 1@S s bid a drury 2@C and n bid 4@S|pg||
nt|007 joosth: miskl  or  thinking about 5C ?|pg||

nt|noodle:  does BBO vuGraph add pressure  or the stakes are already big enough ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jcwla: Not sure what the redouble is.  You and your partner should have agreements on what you do over the opps' conventional doubles of 1NT, as well as penalty doubles of 1NT.|pg||

nt|007 joosth: i pla2 2D with 3card spades  2H with 4 cards   both invitational,  but 3S is better here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|sybarra: lets all bid the other suits |pg||

pc|cA|nt|phil: well, I see 8....|pg||
nt|jcwla: The real money was in passing and awaiting pd's card-showing X.|pg||
nt|phil: west will need to be careful to not provide a spade entry to the board|pg||
nt|santyclz: That would have worked very well here, about 8 tricks on defense.|pg||
nt|phil: looking at all 4, testing hearts and then a diamond from the board works fine, but is that best?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|phil: seems you can also establish the heart and play the @dQ from hand too|pg||
nt|bobh1: the difference in the other room is W bid 4@S not 3@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: this ultimately deprived them of RKC in @Cs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not easy for S to discover the singl D, a king of spades and the Q of hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and why no bid 4?  jam the bidding  you are passed hand,  pard can not take you too seriously|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Both rely on @da(x)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 4S can be a singleton|pg||
nt|bobh1: hard to bid grands without RKC|pg||
nt|sybarra: I meant by W|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Hamilton might have bids 1 or 2 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S=1 Key Card   5@D [i think] asks specific kings  so 5@S = @SK and known @CK|pg||
nt|bobh1: S doesn't know about the stiff @D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then high preëmpting is easier for W|pg||
pc|c9|nt|stc: 1NT by N seems to confirm "special agreements"|pg||
nt|hlortz: seems a bit much to raise @S with south's 5 count|pg||
nt|stc: unlimited confidence in partner's skills|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes  but then that needed Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: how can N go on?  aceless |pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobh1: 5@D guaranteed all the keycards|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: maybe S should have tried 5N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobh1: anything but huddle and then 6@C|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only a specific suit ask like Kantar does can solve the problem, but 4NT is to high to start RKB  when its about a minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree with Bob   5N keeps 7 alive -- but doubtful Bates will know key is stiff @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: the key is the stiff @D |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bobh1: 5N is kind of a last train grand slam try|pg||
