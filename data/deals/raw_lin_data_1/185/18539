nt|henryb:  Hello all. Welcome to the fourth segment of the USA Seniors matcch to determine USA1|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Operator is Jan Martel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators Barnet Shenkin and Peter Crouch|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Hi guys|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lynch has a useful lead, but there are 45 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: W may dredge up a 1NT response and E will have to find a rebid, potentially something like 3@D.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hi roland|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  these 15 and 30 tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  6@d pretty good|pg||
nt|chorush: Good day everyone. Welcome to segment 3 of the finals for USA1|pg||
nt|henryb:  The loser then waits for a challenger to emerge from USA2 for an all day match Saturday|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|jcwla: Looks like some conventional understandings in play here and a @D lead will cause E no consternation whatever.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: 6@H can also make but that is lucky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D by East is a very good contract|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@d now from west?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  has extras|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcwla: Really not a fan of this double, which should say this is the only place I can contribute so unless you have your own clear lead, demands @D.  Not the case with this middling suit. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla:  And obviously competing is not in the picture.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  North is sort of squeezed on this trick, and probably will pitch a club|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pitiful:  4@d was a nice bid|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: Wow - not a good stop with a @D lead coming.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  Although we can see that declarer has no real hope, this defense will take a long time|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suspect Lair will duck this eventually. |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  6NT was not a nice bid|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|barnets: now a guess on a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, North is not Fisher|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs hearts -3-3|pg||
nt|pitiful:  why not bid 5N pick a slam if available rather than 6N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher as West is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Lair's partner is not Fisher|pg||
nt|barnets: it is weichsel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weichsel|pg||
nt|barnets: this contract is less than 20 percent|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i suspect you would prefer most of your bids to be assigned to another name Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT is a poor contract, even by my standards|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but 6@d by east would be what 90% +|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we can always blame it on Fisher|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, not any more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: south led ten of clubs out of turn, but screen was not opened, so director ruled no harm and north can lead normally|pg||
nt|barnets: not exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice Jerry|pg||
nt|barnets: if hearts split 4-2 and diamonds 4-1 declarer has problems|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|henryb:  wrong again|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True Barnet, but if you don't want to be in 6@D, you require too much for your slams|pg||
nt|barnets: no it is decent |pg||
nt|barnets: in 6N dec would play 3top hearts and then lead a spade|pg||
nt|pitiful:  can you not play 2 trumps, ace of @h ruff a @h, draw trump, cross to @c?|pg||
nt|barnets: on a club lead which is best|pg||
nt|barnets: you cant do that|pg||
nt|pitiful:  why not|pg||
nt|barnets: as you have no entry back to hand if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not knowing that diamonds are not 5-0, declarer can't claim, so there is thinking|pg||
nt|henryb:  a @d now will end the hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|chorush: Hello Ben|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chorush: These will be boars 31-45 of a scheduled 90 board event. the winner will be USA1. the loser will get the evening off tomorrow to recover, then play a 60 board final against a team ...|pg||
nt|chorush: in USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi all|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  He has to play a minor now|pg||
nt|henryb:  and not the @sA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|jcwla: Will draw trump, unblock @CA, go over to @DQ, pitch a @H on @CK, and try the @H hook to make 4.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  now cold|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good news   4@H isn't making either   but will other table get that high?|pg||

nt|jcwla: Could it go the other way - yeah, there might be trouble on say a trump lead.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  win @c ace, play 2 trumps, @h ace, ruff @h, draw trump, cross to @c King?|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe thats right|pg||
nt|barnets: yes you are right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet would find that line at the table :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so it is much better|pg||
nt|chorush: Wolff is a legendary player with 11 World chapionships and more than 30 National championships to his credit. He and Dan Morse have played together for several years. Lair and ...|pg||
nt|chorush: Weischel are both great players, but their partnership is quite newly formed|pg||
nt|henryb:  from the perspective of an exciting match, that is a good result for us as spectators|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps after 21 minutes but find it he would :)|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks roland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chorush: Weischel has a difficult decision. 1S or 1NT?|pg||
mb|d|nt|pitiful:  anyone wouldn't be an issue for Roland, he could never reach 6@d playing acol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teasing Barnet is as much fun as teasing Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  anyway|pg||
mb|2S|an|shows 4|mb|4H|nt|henryb:  Notice that 4@sX goes 2 down: 3@c and 2 aces|pg||
nt|henryb:  So there shouldn't be more than an imp or two changing hands|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcwla: E chose a 3NT rebid in the OR and made four.  That was the other possibility.|pg||
nt|jcwla: So as predicted 6 to Schwartz.|pg||
nt|barnets: top spot here|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jcwla: Correct, 6 to Lynch, the teams are not ID'd properly here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lynch is getting the scores for EW here for some reason.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Acol would get you to 6@D without any sweat|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 2NT is all the rage but I quite like 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Allow me to recommend that system|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: with one partner we had a system to show 2 suiters over 2N|pg||
nt|chorush: 3NT seems a bit the better contract but 4 spades is slated to make because the the club 9 is onside and even without that there would be an endplay|pg||
nt|benjent: Finessing the @c7 would be pretty obscure. I'm sure Weichsel will go for an endplay|pg||
nt|chorush: 4 spades has been set a trick in the other room. Hard to see how that happend|pg||
nt|benjent: He might be considering (after drawing trumps and eliminating @h) playing a @c to the 10 as some sort of endplay on Wolff|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Will be corrected I'm sure, pls bear with us.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, folks, we've got it - the team names are reversed - thank you.|pg||
nt|barnets: not that we ever used it|pg||
nt|barnets: but once wechsel sontag used it to bagainst me in the trialsgame id |pg||
nt|barnets: to bid game|pg||
nt|pitiful:  did they get a good result?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes they bid and made game|pg||
nt|barnets: not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  or more if Weichsel acts again|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|benjent: That wouldn't work|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, I think he will duck this and when no diamond comes back the layout will be apparent. He will elimanate hearts, and play ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|henryb:  when Fisher finds the @hA he will also drop the @dK|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb:  since Lair needs it for his opening bid|pg||

nt|ralphk: Hello Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is bizzare isn't it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other pair is fixed   no sense of humor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, when Passell submitted all those summary forms I said something about playing all the time and he said "I like to play all the time"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: team bios and access to the SSFs under http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=807&Itemid=353|pg||
nt|ralphk: Passell is easy to play with. You would think he could keep a partner for more than 1 session.:):)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wolff may think that Morse's bid is better than Morse thinks - both alerted, Hayden didn't ask, Wolff sort of waved his hand around as if to say "in between"|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: it's the height   very intimidating|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: annoying description of bids from college days     "it shows the values for 2@S in this auction"|pg||
nt|ralphk: King of diamonds lead is the only lead to beat 6 hearts. Afternorth shows up with the heart ace the declarer will drop the single king.|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Normal looking 4@S but not laydown|pg||
nt|barnets: down 1 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends on the lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what would open as west?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Am I alone?|pg||
nt|barnets: If I was playing Polish 2@H|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well i hate to admit that i would never pass|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 suiter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish or not, 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't pass in 3rd favourable with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a fan of Acol 2's, so 2@H it will be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: not much chance in 4 @H unless defense give you something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have that funny feeling .......|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and it is not a good feeling|pg||
nt|barnets: in the local duplicate @DA and another @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet, your bid|pg||
nt|barnets: are the players there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E: KQ2, KQT83, 9, J872|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chorush: Its true that there is a slam but not a real good one|pg||
nt|benjent: That's a good-bad start from a slam-bidding point of view|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfd: short break turned out longer than expected|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Took a while for Lair to pass; he had a tough decision to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: S; AJ865, 97, K42, Q94|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the other table East opened a Precision 1@d and North overcalled 3N. E led the @c9, won in dummy, and declarer finessed! the @d.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: W: T4, 642, AJ53, K65|pg||
nt|henryb:  for down 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  West opened 1@d, not East, sorry|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4@S down on a @C lead with two quick entries in S.|pg||
nt|barnets: to lose only one diamond trick you need the single Q in west or 10 in east singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: It gets the @d suit front and center, but Lair may not visualise the side stuff|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: so dont hold your breath|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: west needs one more |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nine of hearts lead|pg||
nt|barnets: cards and point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be easy when you have 51 cards :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: won by ten.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, the new board was played in 4@H next door and made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: spade king to ace, heart to ace, third heart|pg||
nt|swanson: There was no club ace - West needs it for his bidding.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: club to king, ace, third club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: soiuth wins Q of clubs, plays diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ace of  diamonds, club|pg||
nt|barnets: its hard enough when you can see the hands :)|pg||
nt|swanson: This is more mystifying than watching the original 18.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have to lead a card, then claim Jerry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: just any card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hearts, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: four hearts down one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: doesn't matter which card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lead a card and claim down 1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but Hamilton must lead something|pg||

nt|markf:  Not anymore|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N probably a 4 of minor preempt - using 4@c and 4@d as Namyats|pg||
nt|henryb:  they have a chance for a pickup for making 4@c|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|chorush: IMO on the bidding and defense Weischsel had only 3 clubs so I don't like the play|pg||
nt|ady: rather play 4@H  than 3NT|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@h and 3NT are both easy enough here|pg||
nt|jbennet: lucky in the other room.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not much interest here except that 4H scores 650 |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|benjent: 6@d is vaguely plausible but (a) poor and (b) going down|pg||
nt|jbennet: think 3 NT is to unilateral.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  4@d, I suppose, says lets play here if that is your suit, otherwise 5@c|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|hackenbush: Schwartz had an awkward hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H still likely to make if diamond position not so favourable   but 3NT could go down|pg||
nt|jbennet: black suit holdings not typical for NT-play. 4th suit then 3 NT would express more doubt. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant afford to safety play diamonds so d to ace and then the good news|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|swanson: I would bid game with Weichsel's hand.  The kings behind the overcall get promoted.|pg||

mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: was he really thinking that long?|pg||
nt|ralphk: 6 more imps for Schwartz on BD 53. east didn't open so they stayed very low.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not an ideal Michaels|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no -East passed in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: If either of North's singleton honors was in the spade suit, North would have a routine Michaels call.  Vulnerable with a 10 high suit is pushy.|pg||
nt|markf:  A push in 5@D is the most likely outcome, but from what we've seen wouldnt count on it.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the @sJ or K are very unlikely leads|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ralphk: Had morse held 3 spades, i suspect he would have bid a slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that deadly worthless holding in @S  screams discretion|pg||
nt|ralphk: partner is allowed to have a spade control.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: always allowed to have perfecta  but how often  does he   AND bid only 5@D|pg||

nt|ralphk: VUL opponents don't always bids alot with 10 spades, espcially when many of their points are in hearts.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure i'm trying to thread a needle here|pg||
nt|ralphk: It is a style issue. Some, if 4D was forcing would play you deny a spade control.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i was trying to get you to say Ralph :)   it is partnership/style issue|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hackenbush: otherwise 3@h seems right on values, partner will raise to game fairly aggressively with any working hand|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|barnets: South has shown the @SQ and @HK here|pg||
