mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pef: several possible games for north south here.  but all will have some difficulties with best defense|pg||
nt|pef: migry and stansby open very light which explains why JoAnna Stansby only bid 2nt here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|pef: in the closed room on a spade lead, west ducked the return of the 10 of spades and 3n made 4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pef: south had bid 2d not 1nt so west played south for 4 spades.  here, I don't see how she can go wrong|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pef: since she knows south doesn't have 4 spades from the auction|pg||
nt|pef: but she's thinking :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s6|pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we'll guess who's declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good evening everyone (it´s 17.40 here in Sweden)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: East, Judi 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 19.40!|pg||
nt|othered1: Her opponents are allowed to m aintain their own pace and not get drawn into playing "fast and bad."|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: The opponents have to participate at their own peril|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: Missed the Auction|pg||
nt|hackenbush: welcome to the second segment of the 2011 Women's USA1 final|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hackenbush: wonder what happened to hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: They didn't give me time to get the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Open and Women's playing different boards :(|pg||
nt|hackenbush: open room also in 3nt after a 1@d-2@c start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is USA1 Semi-Final   winners advance to  USA1 Final    losers get second chance to become USA2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the two team will represent USA at October Venice Cup in The Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: team rosters online at http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=21&task=list   if you click on specific pair that will bring up their System Summary Form|pg||
nt|hackenbush: winner becomes USA1, while loser plays the winner of Joel-Westheimer match for USA2|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Hello all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible using  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Missed everything but the result, setup was slightly late|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|swanson: That's a very light game try by Meyers, but consistent with the agressive bidding we have seen in this match.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 2N natural game force    very retro|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: unlucky for Sprung to wrong-side the contract|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: Decision here for Moss -- 7 off the top as cards lie, but I guess there are positions where it could be right to duck.|pg||
nt|othered1: Like east holding @SA10x and a key entry|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|swanson: There is a play for the contract if the @SQ was onside, but it is where the bidding tells you to expect it.|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s9|nt|swanson: A heart return would likely have led to a 2-trick set, now declarer has the communication to try the spade finesse and ruff the club.|pg||

nt|othered1: one more @S and she's home|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: Migry:  I should have opened 1NT|pg||
nt|pef: this should be a good battle between spades and clubs|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|pef: I'm not crazy about the five club bid here,  too many aces.  hard to partner to judge, but it looks like it was a real winner on the actual hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: the record shows a 6c opener in the closed room, but I'm not sure I believe that was the entire auction|pg||
nt|pef: specs have been asking me about that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: very likely not the auction inthe CR.  operator probably had some catching up to do and just entered the final contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: so JoAnna Stansby can push the board with a spade lead, or lose one imp on any other|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Stansby probably unhappy at the dummy -- will be glad to learn it didn't matter (much)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pef: it seems like claiming 7 at this point would be a good idea :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: she is playing but I stopped paying attention.   now claiming|pg||
nt|pef: although I suppose you could play for 18 or 19 tricks if you wanted|pg||
mc|13|nt|Vugraphzfk: Stansby:  I dodged a bullett with my lead|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzff: They reversed the board, Moss opened 4C, Judi bid 6C|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ybob: @H 3/3 to win 4@H or 5@C here|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi :)|pg||
nt|tez: hi Roberto|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: A spade overcall and preemptive raise will annoy E-W, but they will still bid game.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the end of it all  there will be 2 USA teams for the 2011 Venice Cup this October in The Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: 14-16 NT for EW|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|tez: dbl now|pg||
nt|ybob: now X and 4@C or 4@H ?|pg||
nt|swanson: 500 is adequate compensation for game should East pass a reopening double.|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@h|pg||
nt|tez: to dbl|pg||
nt|swanson: (I would pass.)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: Hi Barnet|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hackenbush: should make easily, 4 clubs a heart and 2+ spades|pg||
nt|tez: hmmm.surprized pass|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a great hand to be using an artificial 2@C rebid - East might even pass.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting that Peter chose not to open 2@s in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|swanson: That was unexpected.  Shows how little they can rely on opening bid values for an opening bid.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 2@C is gazilli 2c, showing either natural or 16+ artificial. |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: In any case, 6@C is a good spot|pg||
pc|c7|nt|barnets: he is at adverse vul|pg||
nt|peachy: I was thinking the same, opp passed partner red he perhaps thought it would bee too risky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes, but even so|pg||
nt|barnets: i wouldn't chance it|pg||
nt|peachy: North in other table also chose Pass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back, to stay we hope|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: And welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@C is limited to 7 HCP in the E-W system. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: now what?   @C ruff then .... @D to Q or  @SQ|pg||
nt|hackenbush: should lose 3 more hearts and a diamond at least|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|barnets: excellent contract|pg||
mc|12|nt|ybob: If you bid 2@H, later you can´t pass to pree of opp at level 3|pg||
pg||
qx|o51|st||md|1S6532HDAQJT954C74,SAHA62D832CKT8653,SKQT94H9754D6CQJ9,SJ87HKQJT83DK7CA2|sv|e|nt|pef: and another hand liikely to get up to a high level|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|pef: that was quite a pass by west, I think.  but she was right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|pef: of course in the closed room, east passed out 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pef: which I think is bizarre|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: hot now -- better today -- playing rooms are great -- a wall of glass overlooking the riverbetw USA and Can|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: sry, but you might like to know as well :)|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|h6|pc|s9|pg||

pc|sT|pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||

nt|othered1: lead could gain an imp|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: I except E-W to reach 4@S here, but it has no real chance of coming home.|pg||
nt|othered1: IN OR first board got to 3N -3, when they worked out the position|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|swanson: A takeout double is possible here by Levin.  That gives E-W as chance for a plus by defending.|pg||
nt|othered1: so Team Sprung now has a 10-imp lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: on 50   Meyers opened 2N so playing 3N west|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: NS still should be able to find 3N, but 5@D will work also, as cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joel planning a 2-step to show good hand with 6@S & 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably with weaker hand she would rebid 2@S immediately|pg||
nt|hackenbush: assuming this guarantees 2 of top 3, NS can drive to 7@c, hopefully 5 clubs, 6 diamonds, 1 spade, and a heart ruff|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|barnets: his is down a couple|pg||
nt|hackenbush: especially after the 4@c rebid now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|swanson: Defending is for children - bid those games.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 1 Key Card|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w limit is 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: weichsel relatively lucky|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  good afternoon all|pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT is a game forcing raise (Jacoby) in hearts.  There are many versions of responses after that.  3@H surely showed no shortness.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: this is nice -- i forgot to think about options if Sokolow bidding 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: North can only lead one round of trumps, so the simple defense of winning two diamonds and shifting to a spade seems best.|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe E hopes supp 4th , the only reason to bid 3@H over X|pg||
nt|swanson: East might have redoubled 2@S to indicate a good hand and then listen to what partner has to say.|pg||
nt|ybob: agree|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|othered1: 11 tricks likely here, too, as @SQ comes down while cashing out|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well done|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|hackenbush: natural to finesse trump now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- retain ability to ruff @H if finesse loses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  Rusinow vs NT  [so Q promised K]    upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|swanson: North shouldn't be concerned about solving a spade guess for declarer; the double has already given away the spade situation.|pg||
nt|swanson: The Larry Cohen version of Jacoby published in the ACBL Bulletin July 2010 is very good - requires a bit of memory work initially.|pg||
nt|othered1: pull trumps then two high @S, just in case the queen is coming down early . . . |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|ritong: in that sense that 3@s is down, so the board was lost already  but yes, probably 4@d makes|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|hackenbush: good shift, knockout late entry to spades|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play was too fast -- i was contemplating @S @S ruff then @DJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|swanson: South doesn't mind this cross ruff - her spades are looking better and better.|pg||
nt|tez: down 1|pg||
nt|tez: whats your choise with west hand..2@s or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff and @D ... ?|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s showed 4+ right?|pg||
nt|swanson: I expect that the 1@S bid showed five cards, so the raise is routine.|pg||
nt|tez: in europe 1@c 1@d 1 major 4+|pg||
nt|ybob: Both tables raise with 3 cards|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@h 1@s 5+|pg||
nt|ybob: I play 1@S as 4 + over 1@D , X = 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: mark me down for 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|swanson: Doesn't have to show five, but I would raise unless I knew for certain that partner held only four spades.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@d dbl shows both majors|pg||
nt|swanson: Some play that the negative double of 1@D is exactly four spades and four or more hearts (using the theory that you can bid spades, then hearts with five spades).|pg||
nt|tez: migry's connection bad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I think she will never play|pg||

nt|pbundy: exciting to see these two teams in the final|pg||

nt|othered1: I@D-P-1@S-P-?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW  1N=14-16 throughout   wonder if that means 2N = 19- something|pg||
nt|hackenbush: perhaps an upgrade|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: some number of @H likely but 4 could be tricky.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and here i was checking to see what Radid would respond to 1@H :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but West is 2N opener regardless of  how Walter the Walrus counts points|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but this will be an unhappy contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same in other room|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: That's my choice, but it wouldn't be allowed in France :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S, rather|pg||
nt|swanson: One hates to rebid 1NT holding a weak doubleton and 3-card support for partner's bid major.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The negative is that partner may get your side too high trying for game.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|swanson: North will balance with 2@S, having denies real values by passing over 2@H.|pg||
nt|swanson: denied|pg||
nt|tez: another part score swing coming?|pg||
nt|othered1: south's game try is certainly understandable|pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT is an inquiry about the raise.  3@D denies four card support.|pg||
nt|swanson: It was North who bid 3@D - not West.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: bad trump split puts this down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably Seamon-Moss 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: E-W will sell.|pg||
nt|tez: brave @h levin:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so a vul game missed and a swing for Deutsch|pg||
nt|othered1: A normal auction, if west's hand is outside of your opening 1N range|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: maybe not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vbman: tt|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi Kursat|pg||
nt|othered1: Likely making 4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|swanson: 3 hearts, 2 diamonds and 1 spade for the defense; nothing either side can do about it.|pg||
nt|swanson: The cards are nicely played for declarer; might well take 10 tricks despite the 4-3 fit and 23 combined HCP.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tez: S/W Have scereen.they sitting same place|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have guessed from the timing of the bids that East and South are on the same side of the screen.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|othered1: north's 3@H is unnderstandable and catches south with  the perfect flat minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry led @Sx   [and it was her artificial 2@D last hand not stansby]|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hackenbush: should make, playing spade overcaller for club shortness|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hackenbush: and push out a spade|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|swanson: West has a typical defensive problem: cover the @D10 and eliminate the guess for declarer, or duck and give up a trick if declarer gets it right.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joel's @S2 says  i can't help @S    Sokolow knows @C is wrong   that seems to limit her choices|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ybob: interesting choice if W had K9x or K10X, uppercout to defeat by 1 on 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: That is correct|pg||
nt|ybob: 4th round @H if that ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Sorry, not correct, E and N on same side|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|swanson: It would be a good try, but declarer could discard a diamond on the fourth round of hearts.|pg||

nt|pef: there might be some snifing at a grand her|pg||
nt|pef: here, I mean, it's pretty much exactly on the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pbundy: one of those hands where you are delighted if you somehow fall into the grand and the hook works - and - vice versa|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|pef: 3 spades is a very strong slam try with good spades here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: although I imagine in JoAnna's mind it's more than just a try|pg||
nt|pbundy: indeed|pg||
nt|pef: vugraph operator tried to scare us there|pg||
nt|pbundy: i was scared!|pg||
nt|pbundy: i suspect the moss crowd went into cardiac arrest!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphzfk: a mild stutter|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 4d now by JoAnna?|pg||
nt|pef: or blackwood?|pg||
nt|pbundy: blackwood works for me.  |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|pef: I'm not sure if 4 hearts was clackwood or a cuebid for them, but since 4s wasn't a blackwood response, I guess justa  cuebid|pg||
nt|pbundy: my auction would have gone exactly like that in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|pbundy: interesting that migry shows the spade Q because of her extra length|pg||
nt|pef: 5 spades because of the extra length|pg||
nt|pef: but I think that's dangerous|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|pbundy: pointed out to me that her extra good spots helped motivate the 5@S call - indeed|pg||
nt|pef: i still don't like it.  if JoAnna's queenof spades was the queen of clubs they'd almost surely be in the inferior grand then|pg||
nt|pef: once JoAnna bid 3 spades, I don't see the need for the 5 spade response|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|pbundy: now i would NOT be thinking once my partner denied the diamond K|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: I guess 5N was invitational to a grand, and the pause now was, let me make sure I don't want to bid one without you :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course - never hurts to check a time or two in the slam zone|pg||
nt|pbundy: as joey silver says - NEXT|pg||
nt|pef: the play does not rate to be complicated :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: there is confusion according to Wheeler - so she is asking Stansby for her thoughts.  4@C was serious slam try (3NT would be non serious).|pg||
nt|pef: but wheeler may believe a lot may be at stake on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh sure; much easier from up here in the clouds|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|pbundy: and of course you can't swoop in and tell them it doesn't matter - 'cause then when you do NOT swoop, they have that inference|pg||

nt|othered1: Welcome to Michael Kamil|pg||
nt|mikam1: Hi all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this isn't first 12 card fit of the evening|pg||
nt|mikam1: This looks like a small slam...grand on a finesse (which fails)|pg||
nt|othered1: This should be an easy 2/1 auction to slam|pg||
mb|2C|nt|barnets: lucky card lie allows a slam to make here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe the other was in Seniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The ACBL dealing program is in a funk.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ritong: undo pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|barnets: this shows a strong diamond suit|pg||
nt|barnets: north may bid more|pg||
nt|barnets: slam is less than 50 percent|pg||
nt|barnets: needing no trump loser|pg||
nt|peachy: Curiously enough, NS system summary shows 2D = 1Major|pg||
nt|barnets: north may use key card|pg||
nt|barnets: to find out about the trump Q|pg||
nt|ritong: would you, barnet?|pg||
nt|barnets: that is if he knows how to bid it|pg||
nt|barnets: souths diamonds should be at worst what he is showing with 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: he could have AKQ xxx|pg||
nt|ritong: that s ok, but still|pg||
nt|peachy: Is it possible S forgot they played 2D artificial|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@D shold be RKC|pg||
nt|barnets: do they play 2@D as artificial ?|pg||
nt|barnets: if they do he forgot|pg||
nt|hackenbush: this double is aggressive, unfav opposite passed partner when you have to bid at 2-level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C natural??   only if playing YBYSIBM convention [you bid your suit i bid mine]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N this time?  nope|pg||
nt|swanson: Accidents do happen (not if you play on BBO!).|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Shows 6 spades|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: she may as well try 2@D|pg||
nt|vbman: if passes after a majör response its an error|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now, I wonder if they play any kind of non-serious or serious 3N slam tries|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hackenbush: and they have the boss suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Missed the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will try to catch you up to what's happened on the first 4 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  very little to this hand unless E overbids his values|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, 2D = 1 Major|pg||
nt|barnets: i think 2@D is natural and weak|pg||
nt|daman: we are starting with Board 5     we missed the first 4 boards    will catch up with them later|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D now by South should show this sort of hand    but 3NT is a stone on the layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Debbie Rosenberg did very well not to bid on with the known 11+ fit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|swanson: The biggest problem and a mechanical error (or other blunder) is to put it behind you and spend all you energy on the remaining deals.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: how do you know this raija?|pg||
nt|daman: pass was not on my radar|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes have to keep the auction open with 3 aces|pg||
mb|5H|nt|swanson: The play on this hand is dependent on deciding which defender is more likely to hold the doubleton ace of clubs.  An easy choice off the auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: some west's might open, which could facilitate getting a bit high . . . |pg||
nt|peachy: System Summary is 100% clear, so either the summary submitted is wrong, or S forgot|pg||
nt|barnets: well the summary submitted must be wrong|pg||
nt|mikam1: South may search for 7, but will not get there|pg||
nt|othered1: She can look for @DK, but even then can count only 12 tricks|pg||
mb|5N|nt|vbman: h spots and cl break helps|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: opposite a weak major|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N confirms solid trumps and all side aces and seeks more info, usually additional kings in north's hand.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|peachy: Actually, It was not clear, I was looking wrong!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ybob: clear hand to E, N have 4@D after the lead and 4@S, S can´t have 4@H so N is 4342|pg||
nt|swanson: probelm after a mechanical error|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: north would not have stopped in 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks on board 3 a relatively easy grand was not bid in this room|pg||
nt|othered1: Few grands are easy, but that one was an exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: What is the format 3H by E on Board 4 making 3|pg||
nt|vbman: l think radin overlooked poss. that pard cd have passed 1h|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: perhaps a help-suit game try in clubs would have propelled them to the thin game|pg||
nt|mikam1: When North denies a king...which I presume she will..|pg||
pc|h8|nt|peachy: The summaru is right, I was wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: np|pg||
nt|mikam1: This will not take long|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|ritong: 10 comparisons left after that one|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzff: The A took the 3rd club|pg||
nt|barnets: he can afford a diamond finesse now|pg||
nt|ritong: cards begin to weight a bit more than usuall|pg||
nt|barnets: the contract is in no danger|pg||
nt|barnets: only overtricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: North must have thought the weak action was her partner's DBL|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vbman: its nonvuln. so no need to push|pg||
nt|hackenbush: looks like 2nt is asking, and 3@h = 4 trumps minimum|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: four spades is cold north south here, but not a whole lot of hcp|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pbundy: yep - even with a wasted heart Q|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pef: yes, it's really 9 opposite 10 on only an eight card fit|pg||
nt|pbundy: will this propel them there?|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|pef: and east west can make 3 hearts so that's 19 tricks when the LAW says only 16.  What is the world coming to?  Must be global bridge change|pg||
nt|pbundy: stansby is a pretty aggressive bidder|pg||
nt|pbundy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: i am betting this does produce 4@S ...|pg||
nt|pbundy: let's see|pg||
nt|pef: yes, JoAnna is.  I just try to make the doubled contracts in my partnership with her :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: i  love the AKx of diaimonds and the spade 10|pg||
nt|pbundy: :)|pg||
nt|pef: It seems very likely she'll bid game at imps now|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think i was at the table kibitzing once peter when she bid a forcing NT over your opener with zero hcp|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pbundy: of course - she did have shape - 3-3-4-3 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: Joanna won a bunch of imps with her aggressive jump.  they didn't jump in the closed room and played only 2 spades|pg||
nt|pef: so moss will strike back here|pg||
nt|pbundy: makes for a more exciting friday morning, for sure :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfk: Migry:  "sorry about the whole thing"  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|pef: I think I remember that, wasn't that against robinson and boyd?|pg||
nt|pbundy: hmmmmmm - with 2 hearts, tho - declarer must find the J of spades - so it would seem|pg||
nt|pbundy: and another.......|pg||
nt|pbundy: don't remember the opps.  just remember looking with awe at the dummy :)|pg||
nt|pef: sorry specs, my eyes are going, I thought Joanna jumped to 3 spades|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|pbundy: no - but she was not forced to bid over 3@C so should be something tiny extra at least - and - the stiff QC is|pg||
nt|pbundy: if the defenders time it right, at least they can put joanna to the test|pg||
nt|pbundy: i like overtaking and a heart thru myself :)|pg||
nt|pef: yes, although is it clear west doesn't have a stiff club?|pg||
nt|pbundy: you would think she would have led it at trick 1 if it were singleton|pg||
nt|pef: so not obvious whether to overtake and return a club or a heart|pg||
nt|pbundy: but - never 100% with these situations, i don't think, unless you have very very clear rules|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, these 2 have played together a long time, so perhaps they have discussed this|pg||
nt|pbundy: claude and i were lucky if we knew if we were playing transfers over NT or not :)|pg||
nt|pef: yes, bernstein wheeler are a very long established partnership|pg||
nt|pef: stansby and migry just started to play together for this event, but have played very well to this point|pg||
nt|pbundy: both fine players|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|pef: JoAnna believes very strongly in rules.  The first time we played together she said we should keep it simple so she only handed me 67 pages of notes|pg||

nt|ybob: 2@D :) at second seat|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  S hand rich in high card points but poor in playing quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin still thought East was 1@S opener|pg||
nt|hackenbush: maybe they play equal-level conversion, where if North bids 2@c, and South 2@d showing @h+@d but not extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@S-DBL    3N north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S really put pressure on NS|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close double decision with Joel, here only 3 hearts with minimum values, but singleton spade|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: I have to go, will leave you all in the capable hands of Barnet Shenkin, Ed Shapiro, and Henri "ritong" Schweitzer. Thx all|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a good question to ask in these situation is, "do I want to defend"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Brief Restroom Break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does radin action red vs white  affect Joel's decision of PASS vs DBL?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: beats me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: full credit to Radin for decision to open 2@S|pg||
nt|mikam1: NS have a thin game here...if they guess the trumps on the third round of hearts by the defense|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  the spot cards are not good|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will raise|pg||
nt|swanson: Seem right to have some bid in your arsenal which shows this diamond suit.|pg||

nt|othered1: bye|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and S should bid the game|pg||
nt|andyv:  his Ks should all be working|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @c lead will do 4@h in though|pg||
nt|mr murray: 5 diamonds down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting 3@d here|pg||
nt|vbman: and most wd find a bid with norths hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that is if EW come in|pg||
nt|othered1: 11 more for Team Sprung, when east in OR didn't sell out over the 4@D opening on board 51 -- bidding the @H game for +620|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think they'll stop shy of game anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: good x by east in open|pg||
nt|barnets: he knew his partner had 1 spade on auction|pg||
nt|barnets: so he knew he was taking first 4 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: But what if partner had 0 @S?|pg||
nt|barnets: and his partner had 1 for luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, the luck element once again enters|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c and 3@s all look makeable|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: wonder how close Rosenberg was to reopening DBL|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mr murray: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: still had chances|pg||
nt|tez: dont lead j of @d:)|pg||
nt|swanson: I hope South doesn't get tricky and lead the @DJ!|pg||
nt|ybob: i choice 3@D in 1st or 3th position|pg||
nt|tez: but you have T of @d|pg||
nt|othered1: Getting a bit high|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer might be able to scrable 7 tricks: 2 spades, 3 hearts and 2 clubs.  The defense can't unscrable their diamond tricks.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  hi Murray|pg||
nt|mr murray: hi|pg||
nt|mr murray: 4 hearts not making|pg||
nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|othered1: well  you do pretty much need to bring in @C with one loser but game is likely good enough vul|pg||
nt|barnets: to beat it|pg||
nt|barnets: i like the x|pg||
nt|daman: North should pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defending 2@S when 6@D actually has a [single dummy] play    conclusion: sometimes preempts work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be fun to watch if they find all their defensive tricks   well Moss won't enjoy it|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 3N may make because of the blockage in @d suit|pg||
nt|vbman: getting strange|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i wonder if 3@h is limited, otherwise not worth a strong jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: And nobody here took any pep pills . . .|pg||
nt|mikam1: Right Ed...surprised that Judi didn't balance over the 4@D opening|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N would have better play as cards lie|pg||
nt|andyv:  both rooms should get to 4@h..only question is whether EW will take the 5@d push|pg||
nt|othered1: more like will west solo to 5@D, since east doesn't have much positive  to say with those tricks in defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  and spec points out that 4@s is another possible EW contract|pg||
nt|othered1: Obviously, NS will make the 2@S rebid without loads of extras, the modern approach to get the fit into the auction asap.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: So do I|pg||
nt|barnets: and will be a nice swing for lynch|pg||
nt|othered1: that will take a specific play in the @S suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: unless they get the ruffs right now, then a lesser swing|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: nonevuln:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of handling problems for declarer|pg||
pc|c3|nt|swanson: It's understandable because the opening bids are so scratchy.  West has a fourth seat pass using the Pearson point count: number of spades plus high card count needs to totoal 15 ...|pg||
nt|swanson: or more.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: I think 4@S has more disaster potential than 5@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...the handling problems would be very difficult esp. if W hand gets tapped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there goes 1 ruff|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|daman: looks like declarer will make at least 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|swanson: After South shows with six diamond to the AKJ there isn't any possibility she also holds the @SK so declarer will take the winning club finesse.|pg||
nt|tez: probably equal|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a good start, but entries back to @S are lacking|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  a @h shift followed by @d swith may be hard to handle|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  like here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hackenbush: or possibly the player with shortness has to be more aggressive|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: there goes another|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: @D King now|pg||
nt|ybob: anyway squeezed 3 suits|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Making 4 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Declarer said she trusted Judi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: This brought a lot of fun conversation|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|tez: another @d for sqz:)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: ok  not quite double dummy|pg||
nt|andyv:  need to ruff @h and ruff @d and still be able to pull trump|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vbman: 2 h was my choice|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: probably   but point is   make 'em guess often enough, they'll guess wrong|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  so down 1 looks most likely|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: on 52 [our 4@D -1]  Stansby-Migry pushed themselves to 5@D|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2N|nt|pef: it's useful in this situation to be able to bid 3d to show a modest hand with spades|pg||
nt|pef: although perhaps usually a bit more than north has|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes - tho i think most usually bid 3@S with the average hand and 3@D with the good one (at least limit)|pg||
nt|pef: and for 3 spades to be forcing with spades|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4D|nt|pef: although the 3d treatment is being adopted by many expert partnerships specifically on this auction|pg||
nt|pef: Allan Falk may have invented it, at least he taught it to me, but I think a bunch invented it independently|pg||

nt|othered1: Those 3 imps on the previous board become more significant . . . |pg||
nt|barnets: yes north would not want to lose by 2 or 3|pg||
nt|daman: South will open 1NT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential fireworks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Moss bid over 1@H?  shape nice, suits bad  and vul ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in 10!|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that 3NT was makeable without a @d stopper |pg||
nt|vbman: brb|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anyone for Gazzilli to bid this cold slam? You should be able to bid it without that gadget too, mind you|pg||
nt|othered1: Another possible gazilli hand.  Opener rebids 2@C (may be artificial), east 2@D (artificial 8+ hcp)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: This Board reversed at the table|pg||
nt|mikam1: The hands here are not boring|pg||
nt|mikam1: Another double fit hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2N|nt|daman: East will bid 2@S    and that will end the auction     |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|andyv:  borderline 2@c opener for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  might open in 2NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N-type auction coming up|pg||
nt|othered1: "Nobody" opens a simple 1@S any more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
nt|othered1: Not at all.  There has been lots of room for action |pg||
nt|mikam1: EW can make 5 exactly in either minor|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: Make a large number of @D EW, but that may be the 4th suit and could be hard to find|pg||
nt|hackenbush: too weak for michaels, if better spades then 1@s|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a reasonable slam - until clubs go 4-1.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|daman: this must be multi landy?|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D = one major|pg||
nt|mikam1: Of course if South leads the heart ace against a slam............|pg||
nt|othered1: West will go, t hen the lead will determine the number of overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E's @h bid will make it harder to get to the slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Every time I make a contrarian play like that, turns out it was contrary to *our* success |pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S is the winning bid here|pg||
nt|othered1: And was made in the OR|pg||
nt|barnets: although 3N may make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with prime controls and 5 card major, it's a difficult choice|pg||
nt|mikam1: Moss should surely cuebid here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andyv:  should get to 4@s|pg||
nt|othered1: Then 3@C by opener is 16+ hcp with natural @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, they play that!|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, we had a gazilli auction earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2H = pass or correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same start -- but Jill Meyers balanced with West hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close decision to double, with Radin's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on next board  NS did push to 5@C but Meyers in 5@S  [@H never bid after 1@C opening]|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: not good percantage slam..|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you get to 4@S from here?  Puppet Stayman?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm surprised at the 2N rebid...with pd's neg. dbl, I would think 2@s was pretty automatic with the N hand|pg||
nt|othered1: But 2@S may force the auction too high.  A reason for opening 1@S (then east, not knowing you have that good a hand, will double and you'll eventually play @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec suggests 5@d...it would mean S would have to do a lot of bidding|pg||
nt|swanson: 6@C is an excellent contract - my guess is that E-W will bid it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: club lead is best|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec cant set up spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and has only 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Sylvia is playing it, she bid 4D|pg||
nt|mikam1: Ummm - should have said surely NOT cuebid :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: but west is known to hold 7 @hs|pg||
nt|barnets: but can make a ninth in hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: big bob would not open 3@h a six bagger first seat at equal vul, would he?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if you can trust partner to pass when it's right, then you can double 4@h more often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or close for Moss to re-open|pg||
nt|mikam1: Sorry - hands switched|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  E should raise here|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but @H bid opposite void won't improve west hand a whole lot.|pg||
nt|othered1: What would west open with 4=1=4=4?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C support, 4@D  RKC|pg||
nt|othered1: jkIn the OR, west rebid 3@C and they still didn't find it.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C should not be RKC|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The weaker hand should not be captain|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C may be RKC in @C, |pg||
nt|swanson: East should have bid it at the other table after the start 1@S - 1NT; 3@C.|pg||
nt|mikam1: In either case they would have stayed in game only|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who shuffled these boards?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a conventional treatment here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I'm not impressed|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 4D was meant to play according to the new discussion at the table|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's really the auction, seems like south really evaluates hands up (see board 6 for another example)\|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, this will be a very quick 600|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: EW were going to make 2@S     that was a very bold and competitive bid by North|pg||
nt|ybob: 630 next ...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: i think easier for Moss than Radin|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: I'm told they play 1430 responses, so it's likely that 4@C wasn't RKC|pg||
nt|swanson: Looks like 4@D was RKC and East has shown 1.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|barnets: yes a spec points out|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a bit pushy here, but West worth 3@s if @hQ is working|pg||
nt|mikam1: yup|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|andyv:  Bob makes the efficient bid|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  in OR, 4@h was bid and made|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|barnets: that west may duck a heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: in the end game|pg||
nt|barnets: giving dec a losing option|pg||
pc|d8|nt|barnets: maybe|pg||
nt|swanson: My view is that East should jump in clubs (at either table, over 3@C).|pg||
nt|othered1: This hand hasn't shown the methods at either table well|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hackenbush: can really go for a number though with West hand, if South has extras instead of East|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ybob: K98x @S is safety to 600 or 660|pg||
nt|tez: duck j of @c and give 1 imp to opps every hand:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|barnets: like to see it though|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever the case, the Moss team should have to gain some imps|pg||
nt|othered1: did south take 2N over the double neg 2@H as a replacement bid showing long @H?|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, often a jump raise gets the key point across -- great trumps and extras|pg||
nt|swanson: There is nothing like giving partner a warm, fuzzy feeling about the trump suit.|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|pef: probably a polish style two suited two bid, radin bid 4 hearts and that bought it|pg||
nt|pbundy: no - 3@S bought it, peter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Migry claiming with 4 clubs (losing one) 6 diamonds, and two aces|pg||
nt|pef: oh sorry, you are right.  would you have bid over 3s on the south hand.  or balanced with the north hand?|pg||
nt|pbundy: did you hear how seymon's team ultimately lost their seniors match?|pg||
mc|12|nt|pef: I know it was on the last board, but I forget what happened.  whny don't you tellus?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: smoke break for Migry now -- takes about 10 minutes at this venue (far to go)|pg||
nt|pbundy: last hand other team opened 2@S with KJxxx and QJxxx.  then seymon's guys got to 3nt instead of 4@H cold - and when they took the 1st five @D they went into a tie|pg||
nt|pbundy: AND lost the tie breaker|pg||
nt|pef: ah yes.|pg||
nt|pef: so would you have acted with either north or south at the other table?|pg||
nt|pbundy: hard to think of a bid for bernstein, hwoever, unless you have that specific tool|pg||
nt|pbundy: what is the range for 2@H?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i have a vote for double with the north hand.|pg||
nt|pef: usually like 4-10|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that white i would have done something.  can't let folks steal from you!|pg||
nt|pbundy: i like X, too, i think.  if you go for a number - such is life.  danger (as we see) in passing AND bidding.|pg||
nt|pef: i agree with double on the north hand|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that's a very good point that kit woolsey often makes.  sometimes more dangerous to not bid than to bid|pg||
nt|pef: or as Lew Stansby says (always good to know which bridge great to quote) sometimes you just close your eyes and bid|pg||
nt|pbundy: my partners are always fearful of that :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: they tell me "not against the rules to look at your cards, bundy"|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think the event will be done by the time migry's smoke break ends|pg||
nt|pbundy: they are starting board 60 now|pg||
nt|pef: they are up to 16 board segments now, Peggy, so they'd have to finish 5 while we are waiting--not impossilbe I agree|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|daman: Joel is off the schneid     gained 3 IMPs on board6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so   bidding is dangerous   and passing is dangerous    tough game|pg||
nt|mikam1: Weak with both majors I'm told|pg||
nt|othered1: West  had a tool for this hand.   If she handn't, the auction likely would have come back to her in 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h will make on good guess of @s or a @s lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=weak  5/4+ in  @H & @S|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hackenbush: will do well to get out for down 1, late endplay in diamonds|pg||
nt|swanson: 1@D is a transfer to hearts.  West shows a minimum range opening bid and four hearts with 2@H.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vbman: is e trembling?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: dangerous double at imps when opps have shown game-forcing values|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Judi never trembles, just folds and waits|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: is Rule of 11 still enforced?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: donating 14 imps "out of thin air" means you better not get rattled and better pick up imps with your style elsewhere.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  Moss picked up 6 imps on board 6 where 2N made 4 in OR|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe North should get in there and double 2@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Just another pushy game you shouldn't bid non-vul, but can't avoid if east's hand is an opening bid in your methods|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|ritong: a standard push, i d say|pg||
nt|othered1: since it's become standard to open east's hand, it is indeed a standard push|pg||
nt|ybob: A@C and K @D to 10 tricks |pg||
nt|swanson: 3NT is best here, but 4@S is sound also. |pg||
pc|d9|nt|swanson: West had to lead a low heart to have any chance.|pg||
nt|othered1: right suit to lead, but not the winning|pg||
nt|othered1: winning card, that is|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: she might duck a @S now|pg||

nt|hackenbush: fortunately unpunished this time|pg||
nt|mikam1: All has risk though...that's why this is tough convention to play against|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: not an easy hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|swanson: If you are going to lead a suit (defending notrump) when an opponents is known to have four cards, leading from a 3-card honor sequence is not going to work as often as fourth ...|pg||
nt|swanson: best.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer needs to ruff a diamond in the West hand after discovering the 4-0 trump split.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pbundy: ok|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: this is a complicated hand to figure out where the offense or defense wins at 3nt.  declarer eventually|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: has 9 winners, 2 hearts 3 spades 2 diamonds and 2 clubs, but east west may have 5 winners first|pg||
nt|pbundy: interesting lead from wheeler's hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: nothing appeals to me!|pg||
nt|pbundy: i abstain :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: she might lead a heart which is probably best for the declarer|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes - i was thinking that|pg||
nt|pef: at any rate, a chance for a nearly tie match again after this hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: partner didn't double spades.......... LHO opened clubs........ south showed diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pbundy: and if she leads the @H2, hard for bernstein to know to shift|pg||
nt|pbundy: THERE it is|pg||

nt|hackenbush: but from South's perspective, needs partner to have a max to have a shot at 3nt, and might not even make 14 vs 11 with no source of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true  partner was passed hand|pg||
nt|ybob: yes here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: @s to the A, back to dummy and another @s, right?|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@C shouldn't make, but is a save against a double-dummy make in 4@S|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have doubled 3@D with the North cards to indicate defensive values, then make a decision about how many clubs to bid.  But 5@C is perfectly reasonable.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director called, apparently possibly a mis-alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Back to the table|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|athene: with four spade tricks declarer just wants to get the trumps drawn, but it's slightly awkward to get to dummy fast|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to take advantage of the free finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no @s losers, he may just play A@h and @h|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA yes|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will be in game here.  4@S is down, but 3NT is on.|pg||
nt|ybob: AQ stiff @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm never sure about whether to start South hand with 2@C or 1@S|pg||
nt|othered1: south simplifies the auction, avoiding giving the opponents more information through 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|mikam1: Moss had a horrible lead problem|pg||
nt|mikam1: But this didn't hurt|pg||
nt|mikam1: This is a tricky contract...touch and go|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Actually, no lead hurts|pg||
nt|mikam1: true Gary|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ybob: 4@S was -2 if guessed|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room he played a club now|pg||
nt|daman: hard not to lead @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: first books read were Acol so instinct says 2@C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: play @h..safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in 2/1 that establishes game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm still not sure|pg||
nt|hackenbush: apparently one of them plays that 4@d shows a good 5-card suit, and the other doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: In my notes, it's a max 1-loser suit|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that or 2 of top 3 is a good agreement|pg||
nt|hackenbush: helps partner count tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: can you play east for @CJx and a @D position that comes in for two discards?|pg||
nt|othered1: or a @H position that comes in for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: yes, say you lose a @d ruff now, you do not lose the @h anymore|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this auction probably easier to get to NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp   but  not surely NOT 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 3H is correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how N went down on last hand|pg||
nt|vbman: what a miracle helps me get 12 here????|pg||
nt|othered1: Aggressive opening bids get you to spots like this.  there are some entry problems on the NS cards alone|pg||
nt|mikam1: Even though things are favorable - so much to do|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: Declarer will grind it out looking for an overtrick, but by that time she will have nine in the bank.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hackenbush: 9 or 10 tricks here after ruffing a diamond|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|swanson: The only play for the contract I see is KJ doubleton of hearts in the East hand or 3-3 hearts and 2-2 clubs.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: not sure you can afford to give up on the trump finesse quite that happily - if trumps are 3-1, and the defender with @HKxx plays a third round, you only have nine tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|swanson: Guarding against 5-1 spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well now i am sure that 2@C better than 1@S   [at least for this hand]|pg||
nt|mikam1: Dummy getting slightly squeezed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: unless the lead was stiff K|pg||
nt|daman: South has a "surround" in @Ss|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mikam1: Defense can come out on top if they're careful I believe|pg||
nt|mikam1: Declarer has to knock out 2 diamonds and a spade|pg||
nt|mikam1: And the defense can set up hearts for 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mikam1: But some care is required for EW|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you have to be unlucky in both minors|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he was hoping something good would happen, and he doesn't want to incur a spade ruff|pg||
nt|vbman: dia to dummy and pray for a h back|pg||
nt|mikam1: In retrospect, declarer might have played on hearts early...but very tough|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mikam1: now a heart|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzff: They played too fastj Judi got 3h, 3c and spade A|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mikam1: I don't see how declarer can win now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: of course this will score better than 4@H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: found recommended defense of that 2@H opening http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/2c.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL should have been takeout for @C & @D|pg||
nt|swanson: The @D8 establishes a red suit squeeze on West.  Spot cards can be important.|pg||
nt|othered1: nor I|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|daman: no more tricks for EW |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|daman: well   that isn't true either|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: sorta endplay dummy?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c7|nt|daman: so dummy can endplay North?|pg||
nt|daman: rock/hard place for South|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hackenbush: ah, thanks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hQ|nt|othered1: actually there is a squeeze against west, since east didn't retain the high @D|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzff: Isn't hearts the only "source" of an extra trick?|pg||

nt|pef: and it seems like only yesterday this segment started.|pg||
nt|pbundy: :)|pg||
nt|pef: will the NBA finals game finish before this session does?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: will detroit's electricity in the marriott stay on long enough?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|pef: Since the failure has been going on for at least 5 hours, I think if they are not out already we are safe|pg||
nt|pbundy: let's hope, peter!|pg||
mb|r|nt|pef: JoAnna might bid here|pg||
nt|pef: typically she bid where in the same situation in the closed room robertson passed|pg||
nt|pbundy: XX?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Stansby writing a lengthy note|pg||
nt|pbundy: i might raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|pef: I believe that's like a responsive double|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh -and perhaps this showed a raise with the AKQ?|pg||
nt|pef: values and the other two suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: XX is either 2 spades with 8+ HCPs or Qx of spades and a side ace|pg||
nt|pbundy: close enough|pg||
nt|pef: but it could be just a spade raise.  I think she wanted me to play the former.|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm a 2@C bidder here.  gotta show that nice suit|pg||
nt|pef: ok, so basically competitive with two spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Migry back to reading the Bible, the only book in the hotel room. They took away her Kindle and she likes to read when possible.|pg||

nt|ybob: i don´t like show stiff with A but here works fine|pg||
nt|swanson: North might have help her partner by playing the @D10 on the the second round.  That would have saved the overtick.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: people who know me will be shocked by even the slightest hint of seeing a silver lining|pg||
nt|othered1: do  you double 1@C with south hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not strong opinion about it either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: will north open 1N or 1@D?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D 1@S 2@D double, seems a possible start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now they hope that the other room in 4@H and defense take their @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: Will Moss open in 3rd?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised he opened 1nt - not because of the 5422 but just because it's a bit good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reliable source tells me  "dbl was 13-15 or 19-plus bal but not essential with that hand opposite a ph"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S or something slower?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: hamman sticks to his convictions|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@H far from obligatory|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d looks like a good raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|ybob: now 3@H or 3@S ?|pg||
nt|ybob: i like 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter is nice choice|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N didn't occur to me.|pg||
nt|othered1: South *really* comes to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: passing 12 decent|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: end of auction, I presume|pg||
nt|ritong: quacks, etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D transfer   [better raise than 2@H]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and North should double again|pg||
nt|swanson: Too much playing strength for 3@S.  3@H invites game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|daman: I don't know if 2@H is controls or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I don't think anyone knew the 4 of diamonds was high|pg||
nt|othered1: Likely, but the @S spot was a bit ambiguous and if from 8xx, there were 4 tricks in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and NS earns 50, rather than the 130 that *might* have been attainable|pg||
nt|barnets: X could get 500  now if they pass it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S-P-P-4N?     gulp   didn't anticipate 5@S |pg||
nt|othered1: It wasn't a matter of spots, since 12 @D h ad been played|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  everyone hates to pass 14 point hands:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: Put up the Q of spades then?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Another touch and go contract...tough to beat though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ybob: O.R. bids 3@S over 2@S|pg||
nt|swanson: A club lead would hold the contract to nine tricks, but East has no reason to lead anything but a heart.|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. ones that have such great shape |pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I entered 2 score corrections in the movie, 1NT previously did make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: xx was 3 card support|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then again, defending is right if they're only in a 7-card fit|pg||
nt|vbman: will be difficult|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: 3@C was Puppet|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 120|pg||
nt|athene: having given up control in trumps, north has to be a bit worried about declarer running the spades|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect him to try to cash out in the minors - he would have to find his partner with one king and get him in to lead to the other AQ|pg||
nt|mikam1: An "interesting" lead.... |pg||
pc|h6|nt|barnets: and 3@Sx showed extra values|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry 3@Dx |pg||
nt|barnets: showed extras|pg||
nt|barnets: looking at all the hands you can make 10 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder why @CK instead of @CA  then @H9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: 3@H showed no major|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but i guess he just didn't want to commit to one or other suit|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer is not a lock for 9 tricks should spades be 3-1 and the @DA in the West hand.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a race here, but defenders can set up clubs first|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|othered1: west's 2@D rebid is interesting as well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: maybe north's heart spot should be suit preference for the minors|pg||
nt|swanson: Things looking good now.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: bramley now knows his pard had 3@d for his t/o double|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|athene: maybe south's heart spot|pg||
nt|hackenbush: have to get a club ruff to beat it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss really had no other choice|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ybob: after cue by E one Ace there|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Levin is playing very slowly|pg||
nt|swanson: East should duck the diamond to give the defense any chance.  If West wins the @DJ and returns the @CJ it might get interesting.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I'm not sure we'll ever finish lol|pg||
nt|ybob: now she needs only 4/2 @D |pg||
nt|ybob: @S to K, @D to K @D ruff , @H ruff, @D ruff|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff both @H´s to go to the 5th @D and discard|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can guess spades now then give up 2 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes Ed, agreed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  good result for EW|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting that a natural 1@D opening likely would have facilitated the defense|pg||
nt|ritong: time considerations?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: are you sure about that??|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzff: She must have a blind spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Even Weichsel would have finished in 2 minutes max|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ritong: am i wrong supposing weichsel wanted to signal slow opponents?|pg||
nt|othered1: today's negative doubles on this auction are very @H-centric, as opposed to the old "unbid suits"|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Judi commented on the 2D hehe|pg||
nt|mikam1: Looks like making 3 anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vbman: nothing left|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Joel has the trump tenace|pg||
pc|s2|nt|swanson: This is an attempt to go set - should East by some chance have started with a doubleton club.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mikam1: Yes, wouldn't have done that either :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hackenbush: true, they just have to avoid blowing a black suit trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @D tap works too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd be much more confident at the table :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzff: Peter wants some coffee|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I got the play messed up|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzff: The Aces of Spades and Clubs look exactly the same on these cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Other Vu-Graph Operators have said the same|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|mikam1: I have exactly the same problem when playing Gary...no wonder I keep blowing all those tricks :)|pg||

nt|pbundy: i am not in favor of that with only 4@C myself|pg||
nt|pef: what would you bid, 2nt?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i might bid 3@C - not as strong a raise|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: i sort of like 2nt at imps. you have the tenaces and a potential source of tricks|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|pef: not sure why sally wheeler returned a trump in that position|pg||
nt|pbundy: much longer and i start getting overtime, peter|pg||
nt|pef: that would seem to be helpful to declarer|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would have returned a heart - i think.|pg||
nt|pbundy: she didn't seem interested in game .... likely to not have super hearts|pg||
nt|pef: hey you started 6 boards into this.  |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|pef: yes, she know her diamond holding, knows she surely has at least the queen of spades and at least one high club honor|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pbundy: plus then she is potentially pumping the long trump hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: on the other hand.... i might have led a trump with cindy's hand|pg||

nt|barnets: chance for lynch here|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can make a lot of clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, clearly so|pg||
nt|barnets: in open north bid an artificial 1N which i believe showed clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: but south never supported|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Peter has his coffee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about the rest of you   but i really enjoy watching good defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the question becomes   over 4@S do EW find 5@C  and if so -- does it make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: couldn't players wait until we figure all of that out?|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Things often move here at lightening speed with Judi in the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: You're still a bridge spring chicken!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  might even have won the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: even if south's heart WAS suit-pref, he didn't really have any preference between the minors :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: reaching game would be an achievement  winning the partials battle will bring in 6 already|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: NS can make @Cs or @Ds|pg||
nt|daman: South should pass|pg||
nt|daman: here is the vugraph sked for future matches      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|vbman: win 1 st cl with ace?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|barnets: well game is lucky with @CK falling|pg||
nt|othered1: and you  have to get the position right if you're as  high as 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now how will South get her values across...|pg||
nt|vbman: 4h correct?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: ah that should work, then dummy can enjoy the 2nd heart trick|pg||
nt|mikam1: And North will have an interesting problem over the 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Either 2@S, 3@C or 2N|pg||
mb|2N|nt|barnets: you could play east for kX club|pg||
nt|barnets: doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: that loses here|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of alert explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force   jump to 3N should show 1N strength [but some flaw for 1N open]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and we have our answer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be less or more than 1N opening strength|pg||
nt|ybob: 130 here i hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: same bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: next board is promising as well|pg||
nt|barnets: now it went all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was probably a close call for Joel|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe Passell was playing his partner for the @SK rather than a minor-suit king|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N says they never bypass 4-card majors in responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
nt|mikam1: Reasonable choice by North|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the 14 imps on board 7, the Moss team jumps ahead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: and so it goes|pg||
nt|swanson: The @CA would be a reasonable lead on this hand.  West has at least one side entry and might be able to squash a doubleton jack on the second round or unblock the suit.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|barnets: personally i think if north shows a club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: south should support him|pg||
nt|barnets: but that my view  who knows|pg||
nt|daman: this will be down quickly    once East wins the @C Ace     EW will cash 2 @Hs|pg||
nt|mikam1: Another play problem here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|ritong: rather weird, yes  a ten cards fit buried in both rooms|pg||
nt|othered1: @DQ doesn't look very positive and @S were bid on his left, but still A9x is above expectations|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N shows clubs to all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: north has bid his suit with 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she was going to guess the @H10 anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mikam1: I think I'd play on spades here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mikam1: as declarer did|pg||
nt|mikam1: We'll deal with the clubs later|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will Judi play a heart?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|nt|barnets: I am not sure on their system what 2@C would mean|pg||
nt|ritong: operator, can you confirm there was no alert of 1 NT please?|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Alerted|pg||
nt|mikam1: or a club|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: ok thanks|pg||
nt|mikam1: or a diamond? :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: She couldn't read partner's 8 on opening lead|pg||
nt|mikam1: Good hand to be playing suit preference in the suit declarer plays...then Moss could have followed with the spade eight|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mikam1: And Radin would have shifted to hearts|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|othered1: interesting play in @C, given the possible entry problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Smith echo might accomplish the same thing|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|athene: when south responds 1@D here it's not saying "I have no 4-card major" but it is saying "you can ignore your 4-card majors to rebid 1nt, i will check back for them if i want to"|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room 1N was clearly alerted to show clubs?|pg||
nt|barnets: can you say if it was clearly alerted here ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause = negotiating claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decision to bid 2@S instead of something else worked well|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hackenbush: if East had played back a low heart, inserting @h9 is indicated from restricted choice, besides the fact that East might've tried @hK or spade from @hKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please let that be the case|pg||
nt|swanson: It seems a bit out of charater that Jill Meyers didn't open 1NT.  The hand does offer significant potential should partner have a big pointed suit fit.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: it's debatable whether one should be allowed to bid 4@h, but if they play it as bad hand non-solid 7-card suit then South hand certainly qualifies|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mikam1: This endgame will be like a chess match|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|ritong: mary said so|pg||
nt|barnets: if 1n showed clubs 2@C would likely be a cue bid , as would 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I'm Gary and the alerts were lengthy, though I couldn't see or hear them|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks gary|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Mary fell into the river hehe|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I'm not responsible, don't know how to change it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: never mind  no big deal|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: The pace has slowed to zero|pg||

nt|daman: claim|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mikam1: South and West...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: one of us miscounted tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mikam1: Declarer actually must make the non-intuitive play of a heart from the dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: really the J?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Great play by declarer|pg||
nt|mikam1: No answer for West now|pg||
nt|mikam1: If declarer had played ace and a club from the dummy...West would have come out on top|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: i guess there were 12 tricks if Radin held both @S honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but taking 11 tricks seems right to me|pg||
nt|hackenbush: usually a match won't come down to these overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  thru 25  Sprung over Westheimer by 10|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but the Deutsch-Lynch match yesterday in the senior trials went to overtime after 60 boards!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USWBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Match remains quite tight|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  lucky slam hand here|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c now|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec likes responsive dbl here|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C from north, 5@C from east is quite possible|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C might be a bit pushy.  Maybe dangerous responsive double|pg||
nt|daman: if they open 2@H    it is weak with both majors|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT?|pg||
nt|ybob: with @S lead N-S win 3NT|pg||
nt|ybob: only this lead|pg||
nt|swanson: 3NT is quite reasonable here - and will make unless East ducks the @DQ and declarer misguess on the second round.|pg||
nt|othered1: a quiet 3N looks very normal here.  And, just in case, 5@D also is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I like 4@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: on the news they sad the weather in the midwest is the hottest in 5 years|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: 5@C by east / 4@C lets south make a forcing pass, w hich may help their auction|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT asks    3@C shows a bad hand|pg||
nt|daman: Ogustish|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: EW 1N always 14-16   and Radin downgrades    when was last time you saw THAT|pg||
nt|othered1: could that be construed as a support double?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told by an authoritative source, it is a support double|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Discussion about the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: repeating @hs will show 6/5|pg||
nt|barnets: slam is not wonderfull but it makes|pg||
nt|barnets: just one entry to south hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the question is: at which level|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: wonder why south didn't bid 4@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which 5?   [sorry  i gotta be me]|pg||
nt|swanson: Depends on partnership agreement.  North might bid 3NT now - it will make with a major suit lead.|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N can't be beaten|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  when pd asks you to pick a major, do you like to torment him by bidding the other minor?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: East not too interested opposite 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|othered1: with the really lucky @S position|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hackenbush: @sT will be an encouraging card for Moss, partner ostensibly showing @sHx|pg||
nt|swanson: West might have bid 4@C over 3NT, being unwilling to allow the opponents a shot at a vulnerable 3NT.|pg||
nt|vbman: did radin underestimate dias?|pg||
nt|mikam1: 4@S Blackwood?|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: every imp is vital now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to distinguish  serious vs non-serious slam tries|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 10 tricks and time for coffee.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  this should be over quickly...S will take the @s hook into W hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so weichsel showed a rockcrushing 6/5 and lair declined|pg||
nt|barnets: a 1 imp swing could be very important for deutsch |pg||
nt|andyv:  black here|pg||
nt|swanson: Yes - the doubleton @SK onside is enough - if declarer goes for it.|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so that decision only affects which hand declares 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: What chhoice does she have on the auction?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ybob: after the 3@C bid, could win 5@D|pg||
nt|mikam1: Something is amiss here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and as the cards lie -- it just doesn't matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57  the one where we talked about Rosenberg decision to respond 1@S or 2@C then they ended in 3@H [gulp]   Stansby did start with 2@C and is playing 3N South|pg||
nt|othered1: But what's 5@S with a key card off?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mikam1: Perhaps Judi was considering 6N if partner had the king of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: need guess @D only ...|pg||
nt|swanson: In 3NT with a spade lead declarer leads the @DQ.  If East covers (the reflex play) declarer ducks and has nine winners.|pg||
nt|ybob: scary if E play small :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Judi Radin is leading the @D8 again.  But this time she has better backup - the 4,3 rather than the 3,2.|pg||
mb|7H|nt|mikam1: I don't think this will fetch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: actually this line makes also|pg||
nt|swanson: West has to win and the clubs are blocked, so declarer is still OK.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: It's clearly the correct play - but one has to make it in tempo (like many good plays) to be successful.|pg||
nt|mikam1: The good news is that 6 was too high on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Where do you think the wheels came off?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Interesting to be on lead against a freely bid grand when holding an ace|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps 5@C showed 1 or 4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: if 4@S was indeed blackwood, @SA looks normal|pg||
nt|mikam1: or perhaps East miscounted?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|swanson: These ladies are so aggressive with their opening bids and in other situations, I'm surprised that South didn't take a shot at 3NT.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time |pg||
nt|vugraphzff: There was apparently a RKC misunderstanding|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 1430 was mentioned|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, but as I say...6 wouldn't have made, so...........|pg||
nt|mikam1: good time for this|pg||
nt|othered1: No guarantee you must get to 6 on this.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes - all true|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: on 57  3N South after Stansby responded 2@C vs Rosenberg 1@S  [then the glitch that ended in 3@H]|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ybob: or bid 4@D over 3@S ...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|swanson: The downside is that if diamonds don't come it 3NT will be set multiple tricks.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: minimum number of tricks again|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I entered wrong, it was +450|pg||
nt|ritong: yah|pg||
nt|barnets: that is very important|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||

nt|othered1: A good test of keeping your cool for the remaining 4 boards of the set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|andyv:  sorry, private commentary gone awry|pg||
mb|d|mb|1D|nt|othered1: doubling on the off-shape minimum has become popular|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|swanson: I wonder if East would have considered a pass to the double with 3-4-3-3?  My guess would be yes.|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, east bid a simple 2@S over the double and west Blackberried into 5|pg||
nt|othered1: and the 3-0 @S break and no @H lead put it -1|pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT is Lebensohl - a relay to 3@C.  A 3@D would then show fewer than 8 HCP.  There is no convention to show this bad of a hand.|pg||
nt|othered1: it does avoid misadventures like that in the OR, at least for the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: which black?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this 4@h contract will have a lot of work|pg||
nt|athene: west isn't too happy on lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vbman: if they dont play support she has 4 cl|pg||
nt|othered1: This hand is a good reason why.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: 3@d likely infers three cards raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Thx|pg||
nt|barnets: if n/s play slam in diamonds they could lose  a couple of vital imps|pg||
nt|barnets: unless its 7 of course !|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: they are going to have a small BW problem imo|pg||
nt|ritong: about the trump suit|pg||
nt|barnets: lynch have a likely pick up on the last board so this hand may be decisive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting decision from Seamon-Molson|pg||
nt|swanson: 4NT doesn't make with a diamond lead - the West hand would be squeezed at trick two.|pg||
nt|othered1: Auction there does seem reasonable, as all east needs is @D9 or any 4 to  have a decent play for 5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: whatever he leads helps declarer to an extent|pg||
nt|barnets: north will place the final contract\|pg||
nt|ritong: one of weichsel's problems currently is: if i raise @ds, what will be the agreed suit|pg||
nt|daman: a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok   and from Rosenberg with 1N |pg||
nt|hackenbush: if they play better minor and support double, North is guaranteed to have 4 clubs|pg||
nt|vbman: if they play they have sps|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer might throw a club on a spade and play for a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively try and get the diamonds going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has Sokolow had ANY easy bids this set?|pg||
nt|othered1: Things are friendly enough that 8 tricks should be no problem|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|barnets: souths 3@D shows 3  card spade support|pg||
nt|othered1: Turns out 2N wasn't free here.  Wonder what 4@D would have meant over 2@S?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: 1430 response, but here they've right-sided the contract and north may lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|swanson: Why shouldn't 4NT here be natural?  I would cue bid 3@H, then 4NT to use RKC.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|barnets: some play it has 3 and a non minimum|pg||
nt|barnets: now a cue bid|pg||
nt|barnets: meanwhile north has not supported diamonds|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|othered1: OK, that will  change the situation|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: now it is @ss|pg||

pc|s8|nt|barnets: now south is worried  he has shown more diamonds than he has|pg||
nt|othered1: now,clear @D and play on @H|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ybob: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: saving 2 imps|pg||
nt|reisig: YES!!|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hackenbush: this double partner almost certainly has 4 spades, looking for the big payoff when both 2@h and 2@s makes|pg||
nt|hackenbush: though Balderson might be worried that 3@c would show more values|pg||
nt|swanson: Good choice by JoAnn on lead.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: souths decision could have been a match winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Dummy showed max, stiff heart|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks sure to be flat|pg||
nt|ritong: lair took a huge view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 & 6 imp swings also add up quickly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: definitely|pg||
nt|ybob: she needs run the first @S to 12|pg||
nt|swanson: And guess diamonds.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: looks innocuous, but is enormous|pg||
nt|barnets: of course north had not guaranteed 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: so the whole situation is wooly to say the least|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: and good double by Janet, given the chance|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems she should have gotten that right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just don't ask me why|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|athene: declarer is going to go for a club ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time to claim|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now needs exact @S layout  and that will mean Radin holds @CQ  else she would have opened 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is just for down 1|pg||
nt|hackenbush: unfortunately can't get to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right  needed @HK as entry|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  one of the key facets in defense is to try not to break new suits for declarer hence Bob's return of a @s|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finally getting some real help from opp|pg||
nt|swanson: Good choice by Janet to double.  That was not clear at all.|pg||
nt|reisig: a push ...WOW|pg||
pc|h8|nt|swanson: Still has to guess diamonds for 11. |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|vbman: might ve dbl partscore swing|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  the tough part is now|pg||
nt|andyv:  best seems AK @h and ruff @c|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only worry now is holding the trump losers to one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you ruff a diamond now|pg||
nt|athene: you know west has the king still so that isn't getting overruffed|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @d ruff, E pitches @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but you might still be able to combine chances in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: with some trump coup possibilities|pg||
nt|andyv:  so basically the same thing but ruff 1@d first then AK@h?  that works too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: she will take the money and run    no finesses|pg||
nt|ybob: now 11 surely|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: does doubleton trump Q help here?     @C finesse, @SA @SK   nope doesn't help|pg||

nt|daman: this is the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what just happened?    i blinked|pg||
nt|hackenbush: could've been down more, don't think that @cA was going away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh she really did fly @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Rose quickly with club A|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yuk|pg||
nt|andyv:  E must have been endplayed in trump suit.  That should be a very good result for NS|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: there might be a more technical term|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what will Moss do over 1N overcall?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if there was some sequence that could induce opp to win @S and then play another @D|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D = weak 2 in @H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: soooo....|pg||
nt|ritong: is that one mundane?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: the idea of ruffing some diamonds was that you might then be able to cash the @HAK and even if west showed out you would not necessarily be dead|pg||
nt|athene: as you might have a trump coup against east|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hand|pg||
nt|daman: NS will end up in another lazy 4@H contract|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well Valerie Westheimer in the BBO Junior club calls that the flying ace syndrome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C by many would be artificial  [example: same bid as if RHO opened 1N]  so PASS/DBL/3@C were her options|pg||
nt|hackenbush: most play double as negative here over 3@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but might be scary if partner passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with the lack of values  negative would definitely apply|pg||
nt|othered1: double is reasoned -- after the blackwood, she has a strong idea that declarer isn't losing >1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: well|pg||
nt|daman: now they satnd to gain an IMP or 2|pg||
nt|daman: stand*|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you handle north's hand.  Doesn't look exactly right for 2N, but I guess it gets at least 10 of your cards into the auction|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: good 3@C bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: no board passes out any more, even if two players pass 11 counts in 1 and 2 pos, a rarity in some circles |pg||
nt|ahollan1: stopped NS from finding @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sutherlin knows everyone has about a ten count|pg||
nt|athene: bramley has to be dead min to pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it makes!|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@c = gazilli, natural with clubs, 17+, or 5(332) shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: oh my|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N seems reasonable|pg||
nt|vbman: saves opps|pg||
nt|othered1: 41H looks touch and go, with likely endplay in @S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: i would bid 2@C on the south hand i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  usually, responder shouldn't have more points than opener:)|pg||
nt|athene: you just don't get rich letting opps play in 1 of things|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Sx for the BAM win|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should bid 5@c now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Radin using her entries to lead up to dummy's kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: choice of evils raise by south|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@D wold h ave been an excellent save, so lots of imps are in play on this board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barnets: now on that lead e/w can hold dec to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ybob: good spot here|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d was 8+ asking, and 3@c showed a strong hand with spades and clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Except that, absent @S lead, there are 3 losers.  But @H might play worse, when north gets tapped with @D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: One possible imp pick up here to Deutsch . . . |pg||
nt|ritong: 9 for sure, let s see about the tenth|pg||
nt|reisig: will gain 1-2 IMPs here|pg||
nt|reisig: N S|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer can win six high card outside of trump and then cross ruff as many as possible.|pg||
nt|othered1: In the CR, south opened the 10-count and north still let the auction die at 3N|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ybob: 460, next|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: in the other match  with 5 to play  Sprung leads Westheimer by 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of alerting and telling|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Judi just said she misbid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: which could be a very vital imp|pg||
nt|barnets: there is a chance this match could finished tied at the end |pg||
nt|barnets: of the 60|pg||
nt|vbman: small dia l bet|pg||
nt|hackenbush: looks like should've bid 2@s, 4-7 with 2 spades|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|othered1: You have a twice-passed partner and little defense . . . |pg||
nt|athene: i guess he decided there was not much point; most of the time it would just push opps from 1@S making 8 into 2@S making 8 :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  S might have bid 3@d the first time, showing invite values in both suits|pg||
nt|hackenbush: thanks to Stacy Jacobs for helping with the Moss-Radin system|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ybob: good try by Migry|pg||
nt|othered1: That has simplified things for declarer, but the end position in @S was there, but not automatic|pg||
nt|othered1: playing @SA and another works here, but would be wrong if south had @SKQ without 10|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: everything in place now|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like 9 only|pg||
nt|daman: they could have gleaned 500 from 4@S doubled|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: I guess the real key is that EW never got @S into the auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: exciting stuff|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but at this stage 1 imp probably not a factor|pg||

nt|hackenbush: 2@d is a weak 2 bid in hearts|pg||
nt|hackenbush: EW system summary:|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: Quite a 2@S bid in OR.  Do they play it 2-suited by definition?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, good point barnet|pg||

nt|andyv:  dbl will get you 4@h too often|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Team Moss has regained the lead by making 3N on board 57 in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 3NT from the Nprth hand is the best spot|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead and declarer has only 1 chance to win|pg||
nt|ybob: Now W shows 9 cards @C @H so ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this match or  Schwartz who leads O'Rourke by 45|pg||
nt|othered1: ... where they got a @H lead (played from north)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: Another bid hand where the opponents open first|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: on the rule of 11, north has one club higher than the six|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the king or jack you want to play low in dummy; if it's the 9 or 8 you want to stick in the ten|pg||
nt|othered1: Deutsch has gotten into the lead on the basis of that potential slam on board 42, where they found 6@D in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you can get south on lead next|pg||
nt|andyv:  so odds about 2-1 in favor of 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  as most don't lead away from Jacks|pg||
nt|athene: isn't it exactly 50-50?|pg||
nt|barnets: and this made it more difficult for /s|pg||
nt|daman: North*|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h down 2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: If partner's gonna bid to the 4-level, we probably want to be higher|pg||
nt|othered1: big hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: S will play 4@S anyway, now X p 4@S|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@C is a 'fit bid' showing clubs with heart support.  I guess partner has to work out whether it shows any real values or not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
nt|tez: maybe they will stay here|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: a good tactical bid|pg||
nt|hackenbush: tempting to pass with West but priority still goes to bidding your own contract first|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, he sort of wants to be in dummy to finesse spades|pg||
nt|othered1: @S lead would be nasty here, while leading p;artner's suit will make things easy for declarer|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hackenbush: with 3 defensive tricks, and a fairly offensive hand, both @d and @s might be making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct to 4@H far from automatic with Moss' hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: in other match  with 4 to score in the set  Sprung leads Westheimer by 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after long dinner break   30 more boards to complete the USA1 semi-final matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winners advance to USA1 Final   losers got to USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good lead, holding values in both unbid suits|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
nt|swanson: I would think that North would take an essentially certain profit against 4@H.  Wrong again.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
nt|ybob: true moment :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: non-lead directing overcalls -- why do you think @H lead is mandatory? -- do have a cost now and then.|pg||
nt|othered1: But at these colors, east has overcalled with less|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
nt|othered1: And indeed with the lucky @D position, EW have slam in either minor or NT|pg||
nt|swanson: West wasn't ambitious enough with these card - but after 5@S down 1 a couple hands ago it is easy to understand.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ybob: can win too|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Profits are good|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@D rounds pitch @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
nt|hackenbush: still making, as NS can't get in to lead trumps again|pg||
nt|andyv:  what would you bid with: x, Q10xxxxx, Qxx, xx?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting that is:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: in Seniors   Milner leads Lynch by 23     Schwartz over O'Rourke by 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd even wager that most would sit 3N|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hackenbush: wasn't vital to safety play in trumps since can get a spade pitch on the hearts|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: he will see south has five diamonds and one heart|pg||
nt|daman: has to get busy and knock out the @H Ace|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfk: thanks to all -- pls join us tomorrow|pg||
nt|pef: westart again tomorrow at some ridiculously early hour pacific daylight time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 32 boards to go in this match |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: 8 Pacific :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|p m g: Are W to weak for a new try?|pg||
nt|pef: seems I may have complimented Henry too early.  both John Swanson and michael rosenberg just pointed out that with 6-2 spades and the heart ace onside cashing the A of clubs would ...|pg||
nt|pef: be a serious mistake|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: sry|pg||
nt|pef: or maybe not :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: that stutter again|pg||
nt|pef: just trying to allow me to look stupid, Joe after I say something nice about you|pg||
nt|pef: although 3nt dowsn't strike me as a great bargain on this hand|pg||
nt|p m g: Can't be else that pass or 5@C now.|pg||
nt|p m g: *than|pg||
nt|pef: at the other table east bid 3 hearts instead of 2, west bid 3nt and got a spade lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|p m g: Waited NT but there system|pg||
nt|pef: and that was more likely than a stiff k of clubs unless you were sure spades were 5-3|pg||
nt|pef: and finally a big swing back to moss|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: wow pass on the west hand at imps.  Did that actually happen?|pg||
nt|pbundy: very kind of the players for keeping the score so close and the match so exciting :)|pg||
nt|pef: peggy can you imagine passing 4c on the west hand on that auction?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pef: vul at imps?|pg||
nt|pbundy: well...... with a trump lead, not sure what i can make here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|pbundy: and partner might have less than she actually has|pg||
nt|pbundy: PLUS - heart cards do not seem terrifically appealing in a 5@C contract|pg||
nt|pef: to quote a lot of famous bridge players.  vul at imps a game try is bid a game and try to make it|pg||
nt|pef: well so 10 imps or so back to moss and we end on a slight lead for sprung going into tomorrow|pg||
nt|p m g: A spec asked me: Why not 3@S from E at the road to 3NT. I would have taken that as a que with @C. But agreements and style. U are normaly right Ed,|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am getting many messages from people about the lead.  some say "spade for sure" lead and others saying "how can a trump not be led?"|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would be a trump leader myself - particularly if they got to 5@C|pg||
nt|pef: open leads are definitely an art not a science, but in this case with that heart holding I think a trump lead stands out|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|c8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|p m g: By partscore a thrump normaly use to be right. Agree that spec Peg.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|pef: making hmm I don't see why she didn't cash the queen of hearts pitching a spade first and make 7, but maybe it's more embarrassing to be in 4 making 7 than 4 making 6 :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|h3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pbundy: for all those talking about the spade lead because west did not bid 3nt - it is very tough to bid it over 4@C|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dT|mc|12|nt|pbundy: and there is no reason for nt to be bid when partner is showing a weakish hand with long hearts|pg||
nt|pef: good night all.  see you all tomorrow |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: GN all|pg||
nt|pbundy: tnx all - see you tomorrow|pg||

nt|daman: thanks to our operator Gary Hann    super job|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the set   restart in about 2.5 hours|pg||
nt|ybob: OR lead was J@C and declarer win the first trick and go down|pg||
nt|ybob: if she duck 1 @C cold too |pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board for us -- other rooms still in play  and lots of bridge tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  my point is that pd would bid 4@h with that hand over dbl..so I prefer 3N because I'm simple|pg||
nt|othered1: Really bid 41H over double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with my example hand?  sure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzff: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C anyone?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 50% grand    do NS think they need it?|pg||
nt|othered1: partner doesn't need a miracle hand to have 12 top tricks, just 2K and a couple of @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|hackenbush: too bad they're favorable|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C likely shows a decent hand with @H (invitational+)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: no trf response after X|pg||
nt|vbman: not moss 3cl off course|pg||
mb|2C|nt|daman: next session begins in roughly 40 minutes|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C must show @Cs obviously|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many pairs like to play that 3-level preempts have tighter range, depending on colors|pg||
nt|tez: last here.ty all.enjoyed .ty Roberto. TY SPECS|pg||
nt|hackenbush: the players will have a dinner break, and the 3rd segment will start at 6pm eastern time, in a little less than 3 hours|pg||
nt|othered1: "Unusual oer Unusual" some call it|pg||
nt|othered1: over|pg||
nt|swanson: Another good chance for South to double.|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe just a good  hand|pg||
nt|othered1: This is the last board of tonight's set -- two more tomorrow in about 12.75 hours.  The other room is considerably behind.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: last board of the set now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|hackenbush: so favorable 3@c = bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable = random hand  but 2nd seat ??|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes 2nd seat should usually be stronger|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 3@c certainly works better for this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  true.  the problem is the 2@s bid announced some values so slam becomes more problematical.  If you bid 3N, pd should expect that type of hand so may she may be able to bid on.|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks are due our operator, Gary Hann and to the USBF for bringing this high-level event to BBO vugraph.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: an inspired lead|pg||
nt|ybob: Ty Tezcan|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even 6@D may be challenge after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: no reason to get too fancy|pg||
nt|daman: over to a @S    @C finesse    @C Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might sound heretical, but i never liked 2@C with hand this flexible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- i'm a big clubber so very biased|pg||
nt|swanson: The defense can get a club, a heart and two ruffs after a diamond lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: Ty gary:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice clean auction to finish this first set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Pleasantries all around at the table :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: the more i watch, the more convinced i am that transfers over the DBL work much better than standard  [i.e. a forcing 1@H feels wrong]|pg||
nt|othered1: 9, showing suit preference?|pg||
nt|swanson: North leads a high diamond to indicate a spade return.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: 6@D a reasonable shot now|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to run.  Thanks operator for the solid presentation.  Thanks everyone else and bye|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sokolow DBL = 3@H  [support dbl]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: NS did avoid going for 800 in 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminds me of my grandfather     i saved $100,000 dollars today   saw a house i loved and didn't buy it     [it was a long time ago]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: certainly pairs that play transfers over 1@c opening, play it over the double, e.g. Garner-Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if not playing them over 1@C-P   many play them over 1@C-X and 1@D-X|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many more play them over 1M-Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of agony here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those have been around longer|pg||
nt|othered1: That lead ensures 9 tricks for declarer, but she likely would have found them anyway.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: from the players or the specs following our ramblings?>|pg||
nt|vbman: no finesse|pg||
nt|hackenbush: right, because not enough tricks if it loses|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Debbie|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe cl finesse then dia finesse she thinks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: It was a bit of an ordeal lol :)|pg||
nt|swanson: There is another set of 16 boards to decided this match - will start in 15-20 minutes.|pg||
nt|swanson: THanks all.|pg||
nt|ybob: Thx all|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d3|nt|daman: now a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I will pass that on|pg||
nt|hackenbush: easier from up here|pg||
nt|hackenbush: would've been right if @cQxx(x)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please proceed to open tables in orderly fashion|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: making 3|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good spade play by EW|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|othered1: Well defended|pg||
nt|othered1: and you did need a low @C lead to beat 3N, as cards lie|pg||
nt|swanson: Leading a diamond rather than a club was a thoughtful play by North.  The defense is more like to get a club trick but the diamond has a better chance of producing a ruff.|pg||
nt|othered1: and south had a chance to double 3@C and didn't.|pg||
nt|swanson: A club lead would set the contract also (could).  the defense could take two clubs and a spade ruff and the @HA.|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have doubled because I would prefer a club lead (not know that partner had trump control and a spade void).|pg||
nt|swanson: Thanks everyone, an exciting set of boards.|pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR, south chose to bid her 8-bagger after partner's unusual NT, bringing Team Sprung within one IMP of Team Moss.|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks, everyone.  Next set should be up shortly.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|daman: see you soon|pg||
