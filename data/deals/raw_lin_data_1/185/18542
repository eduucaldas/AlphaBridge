mb|1D|mb|p|nt|hackenbush: different NT range allowed the open room to diagnose the @s weakness and reach 5@c|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1H - 1S - 1Nt  i think|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: looked like 9 tricks for the taking agree specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nobody wanted to play a simple 4@h:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they might play a penalty double over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joost and Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: heart queen lead if cindy passes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  their card confirms 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  E guessed the N's major was not @ss|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dull as long they are not in 5 again|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: could have been though, S had 4|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of defensive tricks in the 2 suits bid by NS|pg||
mb|3S|nt|irwinbo: was 3 d really three clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead other room|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|joest: i suspect we see Cohen work diamonds next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i was going to vote for the @C4...  but i think i'll change to the @D6 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the result as we see it operator ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, forgot to cash heart|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like E can make this easily on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may be playing transfers where 3@D would be stayman|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|joest: an interesting switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is makeable from here, but unlikely at the table imo|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: in the other room, they played 2@s when south chose to raise instead of bidding 1NT: a very plausible alternative|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hackenbush: ah, EW one of few pairs to have submitted a convention card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense needed to shift to spades after second heart ducked|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/docs/2011uswbc/acblcards/PollackBjerkan.bmp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however disa should not have discarded a diamond, if in fact she did|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wonder if east's 2nt would be the winning bid in the bridge world   many would double|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: likely finesse |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: but no thought to leading @S?    North figures to have exactly 4 [pull w/5]  and South exactly 2  [pass w/3]|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't like leading from broken 4-card suits...  to costly in the long run|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: Bates covered in case Cohen only had 10x of spades and Wold had 8xx left|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  NS have no response to final 3 tricks for EW.  In hindsight, S probably wished she'd led a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like leading     period|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bigtrain: aint that the truth (says the president of the overbidder club)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just ask partners     no good can come from having me on opening lead|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: now a club back but Mark Cohen has nine tricks|pg||

mb|4N|nt|kirp:  I agree, opening 1 H with N is more sensible|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2@H transfer then 4nt is quantative|pg||

nt|joest: this could be a swing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2NT maybe|pg||
nt|joest: if north-south play puppet stayman, they might land in 4@s|pg||
nt|joest: that should still fetch it looks like but its a bit harder than 3NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: guess the @d lead worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and/or @S switch    and/or   sunspot activity|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting implications for declarer|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: E will never be on lead. so Kx of clubs stay protected|pg||
nt|joest: treating his hand as too big for an initial 2NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  on board 34, 5@c was made in OR, slicing the lead to 13 imps|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: was a very poor effort|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h probably shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can understand it with so many controls|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: quick attack on transportation|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing East bid 2@d instead of North|pg||
nt|sybarra: suport X |pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  good guess Howard:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|007 joosth: J of diamonds may be the entry for club tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter  do you use coded 10/9 leads in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  a hand where almost all finesses are off|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: so they are playing puppet|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sybarra: suspect we missed a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: could be gazilli but nothing much on their system summary form|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=838&pid=607|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm guessing that 2@d was xfer to @hs showing a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that's more likely, if 2@c and 2@h not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Two diamonds was alerted by West but not by East.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: referring to Stewart's @S shift|pg||
nt|007 joosth: might be 1/3 lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  we use something thats referred to as foster returns|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd from garbage?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  when dummy has small cards we lead second highest unless we want partner to do some high banging|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: as in other room no puppet here|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|joest: actually you can't determine that by a 3@s rebid :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed:)|pg||
nt|joest: so this presents the ninth trick but the contract is always cold just by keeping east off lead, for overtricks even|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems strange  but the possible entry has gone|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be a push around the room |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades may even make 5   she will probably make 4 hearts here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not the lead at 4S  :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|hackenbush: NS play precision|pg||
nt|joest: third seat a good four card major is a possibility|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 5C as expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: tons of pressure now.  Rosenberg could just grab it with 3NT but that's a big statement|pg||
nt|joest: but if he makes a 'responsive double' or some such they are probably headed to 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: 5@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|007 joosth: 3NT seems best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wonder what Casen would bid over  3@C-4@S-5@C-?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: an 800 point gift|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: takes teh pressure off partner which is always appreciated|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: club finesse is needed  after that at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: Wold knows where the spade king is (or thinks he does)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  he may be right:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing Eddie leads a @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this lead and auction should help Wheeler pick up trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: both partners seem to have been ticketed for speeding here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 5 down even?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand 4@D bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he get out for 800?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|joest: well I guess at IMPS too!|pg||

nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|007 joosth: I dont think  such a bid has to be strong.  so 3S seems some rough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen liked his pure holdings in majors  -- and i'm sure not a high card invite -- that would be 2N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice double fit,  but a doubtful K|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew basing it on the dbl major suit fit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade lead gives it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  and seems impossible to keep N from gaining lead if you don't lead a @s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: it does seem that they should have considered a slam at least|pg||
nt|joest: ok so I have misguessed Rosenberg at every opportunity|pg||

pc|hA|nt|chick: right now, pollack is praying for a bad club split :)|pg||

nt|007 joosth: a heart lead seems obvious   the Q or K   according to what agreement you have|pg||

nt|hackenbush: should get diamonds right after West shows up with lots of black cards|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well Jack,  maybe he just wanted to visit the toilet?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no unbloch here  thats strange|pg||

nt|007 joosth: y|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: partnerships differ about whether 2NT is Lebensohl after a 2@d opener|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT gets the nature of the hand across well|pg||
nt|007 joosth: In the Netherlands almost everybody plays multi,  so I don't know|pg||
nt|joest: Bates may be asking himself: "do we play Lebensohl here"?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hope he asked it before|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is possible that they do and that Wold follows up with 3@h over a forced 3@c rebid showing four hearts in a NT hand and offering a choice of games|pg||

nt|007 joosth: not when you change the 7 and 8?|pg||

nt|007 joosth: playing with a Cohen  I would expect some more law|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished|pg||

nt|007 joosth: yes indeed I can recommend the Lawrnce book 2/1 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like limit raise|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: i think this 2@C has 4@H/@S only if 6+@C|pg||
nt|joest: yes he has a well thought out method in his book|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hackenbush: routine 4@s here, Westheimer's opening will have to come on one of the last 4 boards|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes  2@D=5+|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: EW slightly stole this one, though they will have to do some scrambling to make this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some play 2D as balanced   11/12  maybe only 3 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL was lead-direct|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E might play for a ruff|pg||

nt|007 joosth: then 2NT can be 13/14  gf  or  18/19|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 2@D didn't deny 4@H/@S  but 3@D did|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @h suit will provide one pitch so S should immediately play it |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: but Bates-Wold play precision so |pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead maybe  but N did not double 3H|pg||

nt|007 joosth: now an endplay with clubs:)|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: but looks like Woolsey can be endplayed |pg||
pc|sT|nt|007 joosth: well AQ  diamonds are known|pg||
nt|007 joosth: endplay with a diamond?|pg||

nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|007 joosth: should be automatic indeed|pg||

nt|kirp:  I predict 1@D by W or N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat not vul   1N=10-12   that's my bet for West|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|10-12|mb|p|nt|kirp:  you have the better knowledge of their systemÂ¨$|pg||
mb|2D!|an|gf stay|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=game force stayman   [NOT transfer]|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@S does not deny 4@H   with 44 they show best suit first|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 5+   the only way to force with 1 suit|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 3H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul should damper NS's hopes here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfe: Short break.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: responsive dbl first??|pg||
mb|1H|nt|007 joosth: Cohen has no good bid    |pg||
mb|d|nt|jwit: This contract doesn't rate to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stewart opened 1N=10-12 and described exact shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: have seen this hand make 4 hts but e/w were only in 2 |pg||
mb|r|mb|2C|nt|andyv:  N has too much defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: sure almost a double|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1 quickly|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  those who think down 2 are optomists or pessimists|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: diff lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: S will reason that N is broke|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok almost:)|pg||
nt|joest: i like that reasoning|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can't on drugs be an option?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  always is, Al|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: i had a feeling the the ten was coming|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|007 joosth: spade again|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|007 joosth: trying not to be endplayed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jwit: This should fail by 2 or 3 tricks, but NS can probably make a part score, so no disaster|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce should try the @h finesse even though his sure it won't work|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems dropping K of H is last chance|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: with 1 to play in the set  Kasle 100  Milner 69   winner of that match plays winner of this match tomorrow in USA2 "Semi-Final"|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: @H lead in other room was killer|pg||
nt|joest: not a comfortable pitch here for cohen|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jwit: Of course, diamonds would have been a better contract for EW, or even spades.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D10 probably makes it tougher for declarer|pg||
nt|joest: Wold playing this great so far|pg||
nt|007 joosth: for the moment S problem is over|pg||
nt|007 joosth: should play 7|pg||
nt|joest: on the heart lead was it down one trivially?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: otherwise he is down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe N should have played the T  easy from here|pg||
nt|joest: if he holds off the queen, cohen will have to give him a red trick |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: i don't think anything was trivial about the play at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: cos winning the heart queen and shooting a club up is a strong start for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @CQ was allowed to win|pg||
nt|joest: at teh risk of repetition: Eddie has played this well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when Stewart then attacked @D it was all over|pg||
nt|joest: ic|pg||
nt|joest: and clubs were abandoned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Jack says  Wold playing this well -- honestly this is 2nd time i've seen all 4 hands and still don't now how to declare it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Wold did well indeed,  but I think N missed a chance by not playing the T of diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Joost  then @Dx from Cohen and Wold is on a guess|pg||

nt|007 joosth: ok ty all for kibitzing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Jack and and All thanks 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 2 hours|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|joest: and to Kathy our operator|pg||
nt|joest: classic Michaels call|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our operator |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c so looks like 2@c is natural|pg||
nt|joest: I would expect to see the closed room auction duplicated|pg||
mb|3H|nt|007 joosth: play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably the same opening lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: to see it yourself move your mouse over the open room result|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jwit: EW will get to 4H here. Will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our thanks to Jan Martel who organizes everything, and thx to USBF for bringing this to bbo |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW may be able to find a cheap save in @hs |pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably 4-7 hcp|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@S easy, an overtrick on the expected heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|joest: my prediction wasn't so hot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N might have done better to bid 3@h|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|007 joosth: a light opener. maybe getting to high now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could come home, but not enough imps |pg||
pc|dA|nt|jwit: South did well not to double. Knowledge of bad trump break might have given declarer a fighting chance.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good lead for defense|pg||
nt|joest: i can't leave AKxx of hearts unbid.  If they double me, I apologize I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack if it makes you feel any better   i made same prediction 40 minutes ago|pg||
nt|007 joosth: haha|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  S can afford to lose 2@s and a @c|pg||
nt|chick: will lose only one of each on this lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here is there opportunity|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential pickup for Westheimer here, open room stopping in 3NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: very bad hand for 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|007 joosth: glad I did not say a word:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: the USA2 Senior matches are 60 boards   USA1 Senior Final is 90    Women are playing 96 board matches now  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 bracket = undefeated teams   USA2 = 1 loss  [so lose again, go home]|pg||
nt|pef: sorry Joanne Sprung|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us....final set of this segment to start in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what a lead...|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a chance now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW haven't played much together  otherwise Ferguson might have just tried 2N|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little too deep for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe thinking Casen could bid this way with 1435 and singleton @SQ/J ??|pg||
nt|andyv:  still a pretty deep position to take.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a lead that isn't??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D fairly passive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is this an auction that calls for passive lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew still stunned by the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem is augmented by the holding of 10x with the K, blowing the whole suit apart for the defense if you are wrong|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cohen with a surpised winner |pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: in any event it is going to prove to be an expensive pass resulting in a double game swing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  and you can be sure that lead will not be duplicated at other table|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: no, wrong|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries and W known to be long in 2 other suits, lead the 10 and run it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|007 joosth: the biggest swing of the session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but IF [keyword] you expect a better hand in West   what does partner hold  and which lead works for that holding|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hackenbush: can't really go wrong here, clubs 5-2 and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: O'Rourke will finish with 13 more and take the lead at the half|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  almost:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: probably not same auction either|pg||
pc|s8|nt|007 joosth: as I said N might be advised to read the book of the other Cohen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: why a heart to the Q    KJxx might be in N to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 44  Bates did double 4@H|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  gtg...bye all!|pg||

nt|joest: ok thanks Al|pg||
nt|joest: bye all|pg||
nt|007 joosth: bye|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer deep in thought.  Head on table.|pg||
