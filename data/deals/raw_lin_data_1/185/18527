mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: this isn't first 12 card fit of the evening|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: lucky card lie allows a slam to make here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe the other was in Seniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The ACBL dealing program is in a funk.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: undo pls|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|barnets: this shows a strong diamond suit|pg||
nt|barnets: north may bid more|pg||
nt|barnets: slam is less than 50 percent|pg||
nt|barnets: needing no trump loser|pg||
nt|peachy: Curiously enough, NS system summary shows 2D = 1Major|pg||
nt|barnets: north may use key card|pg||
nt|barnets: to find out about the trump Q|pg||
nt|ritong: would you, barnet?|pg||
nt|barnets: that is if he knows how to bid it|pg||
nt|barnets: souths diamonds should be at worst what he is showing with 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: he could have AKQ xxx|pg||
nt|ritong: that s ok, but still|pg||
nt|peachy: Is it possible S forgot they played 2D artificial|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@D shold be RKC|pg||
nt|barnets: do they play 2@D as artificial ?|pg||
nt|barnets: if they do he forgot|pg||
nt|hackenbush: this double is aggressive, unfav opposite passed partner when you have to bid at 2-level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C natural??   only if playing YBYSIBM convention [you bid your suit i bid mine]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N this time?  nope|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|daman: she may as well try 2@D|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and they have the boss suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Missed the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will try to catch you up to what's happened on the first 4 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Ed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  very little to this hand unless E overbids his values|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, 2D = 1 Major|pg||
nt|barnets: i think 2@D is natural and weak|pg||
nt|daman: we are starting with Board 5     we missed the first 4 boards    will catch up with them later|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D now by South should show this sort of hand    but 3NT is a stone on the layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Debbie Rosenberg did very well not to bid on with the known 11+ fit|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|barnets: how do you know this raija?|pg||
nt|daman: pass was not on my radar|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|swanson: The play on this hand is dependent on deciding which defender is more likely to hold the doubleton ace of clubs.  An easy choice off the auction.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: some west's might open, which could facilitate getting a bit high . . . |pg||
nt|peachy: System Summary is 100% clear, so either the summary submitted is wrong, or S forgot|pg||
nt|barnets: well the summary submitted must be wrong|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|barnets: opposite a weak major|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|peachy: Actually, It was not clear, I was looking wrong!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ybob: clear hand to E, N have 4@D after the lead and 4@S, S can´t have 4@H so N is 4342|pg||
pc|hA|mc|10|nt|barnets: north would not have stopped in 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks on board 3 a relatively easy grand was not bid in this room|pg||
nt|othered1: Few grands are easy, but that one was an exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: What is the format 3H by E on Board 4 making 3|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: 3@d pls:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Antoher possible 1N opening, but this may go less quietly\|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D :) at second seat|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  S hand rich in high card points but poor in playing quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin still thought East was 1@S opener|pg||
nt|hackenbush: maybe they play equal-level conversion, where if North bids 2@c, and South 2@d showing @h+@d but not extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@S-DBL    3N north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S really put pressure on NS|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close double decision with Joel, here only 3 hearts with minimum values, but singleton spade|pg||
mb|2C|nt|peachy: I have to go, will leave you all in the capable hands of Barnet Shenkin, Ed Shapiro, and Henri "ritong" Schweitzer. Thx all|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a good question to ask in these situation is, "do I want to defend"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Brief Restroom Break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does radin action red vs white  affect Joel's decision of PASS vs DBL?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: beats me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: full credit to Radin for decision to open 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the spot cards are not good|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will raise|pg||
nt|swanson: Seem right to have some bid in your arsenal which shows this diamond suit.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|barnets: bye|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao raija|pg||
nt|othered1: bye|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and S should bid the game|pg||
nt|andyv:  his Ks should all be working|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @c lead will do 4@h in though|pg||
nt|mr murray: 5 diamonds down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting 3@d here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|barnets: good x by east in open|pg||
nt|barnets: he knew his partner had 1 spade on auction|pg||
nt|barnets: so he knew he was taking first 4 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: But what if partner had 0 @S?|pg||
nt|barnets: and his partner had 1 for luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, the luck element once again enters|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c and 3@s all look makeable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: wonder how close Rosenberg was to reopening DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: still had chances|pg||
nt|tez: dont lead j of @d:)|pg||
nt|swanson: I hope South doesn't get tricky and lead the @DJ!|pg||
nt|ybob: i choice 3@D in 1st or 3th position|pg||
nt|tez: but you have T of @d|pg||
nt|othered1: Getting a bit high|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hi Murray|pg||
nt|mr murray: hi|pg||
nt|mr murray: 4 hearts not making|pg||
nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|othered1: well  you do pretty much need to bring in @C with one loser but game is likely good enough vul|pg||
nt|barnets: to beat it|pg||
nt|barnets: i like the x|pg||
nt|daman: North should pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defending 2@S when 6@D actually has a [single dummy] play    conclusion: sometimes preempts work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be fun to watch if they find all their defensive tricks   well Moss won't enjoy it|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 3N may make because of the blockage in @d suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3N would have better play as cards lie|pg||
nt|andyv:  both rooms should get to 4@h..only question is whether EW will take the 5@d push|pg||
nt|othered1: more like will west solo to 5@D, since east doesn't have much positive  to say with those tricks in defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  and spec points out that 4@s is another possible EW contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: So do I|pg||
nt|barnets: and will be a nice swing for lynch|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: unless they get the ruffs right now, then a lesser swing|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tez: nonevuln:)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of handling problems for declarer|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|othered1: I think 4@S has more disaster potential than 5@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...the handling problems would be very difficult esp. if W hand gets tapped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there goes 1 ruff|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: looks like declarer will make at least 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|swanson: After South shows with six diamond to the AKJ there isn't any possibility she also holds the @SK so declarer will take the winning club finesse.|pg||
nt|tez: probably equal|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  a @h shift followed by @d swith may be hard to handle|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  like here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hackenbush: or possibly the player with shortness has to be more aggressive|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: there goes another|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: @D King now|pg||
nt|ybob: anyway squeezed 3 suits|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|tez: another @d for sqz:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: ok  not quite double dummy|pg||
nt|andyv:  need to ruff @h and ruff @d and still be able to pull trump|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: probably   but point is   make 'em guess often enough, they'll guess wrong|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  so down 1 looks most likely|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: on 52 [our 4@D -1]  Stansby-Migry pushed themselves to 5@D|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|kerasidis: i can almosto see migry resent about the previous for not bidding 3 nt :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: is 4@h right scor.....misunderstanding between partners?|pg||
nt|psyck: S must have meant 4@d as nat & N took it as transfer other room|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h on 2@c=busted hand (Q high or worse)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: even in that level players forget their agreements|pg||
nt|psyck: if S had used puppet, to find major fit, could have gotten to 4@s|pg||
nt|kerasidis: problems?|pg||
nt|psyck: possibly...|pg||
nt|psyck: there were some hiccups at start , but things seemed to have settled down|pg||

nt|othered1: Those 3 imps on the previous board become more significant . . . |pg||
nt|barnets: yes north would not want to lose by 2 or 3|pg||
nt|daman: South will open 1NT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential fireworks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Moss bid over 1@H?  shape nice, suits bad  and vul ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in 10!|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that 3NT was makeable without a @d stopper |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: East will bid 2@S    and that will end the auction     |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|andyv:  borderline 2@c opener for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  might open in 2NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N-type auction coming up|pg||
nt|othered1: "Nobody" opens a simple 1@S any more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: Make a large number of @D EW, but that may be the 4th suit and could be hard to find|pg||
nt|hackenbush: too weak for michaels, if better spades then 1@s|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a reasonable slam - until clubs go 4-1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this must be multi landy?|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D = one major|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|andyv:  E's @h bid will make it harder to get to the slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Every time I make a contrarian play like that, turns out it was contrary to *our* success |pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S is the winning bid here|pg||
nt|othered1: And was made in the OR|pg||
nt|barnets: although 3N may make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with prime controls and 5 card major, it's a difficult choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  should get to 4@s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|daman: 2H = pass or correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same start -- but Jill Meyers balanced with West hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close decision to double, with Radin's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on next board  NS did push to 5@C but Meyers in 5@S  [@H never bid after 1@C opening]|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: not good percantage slam..|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you get to 4@S from here?  Puppet Stayman?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm surprised at the 2N rebid...with pd's neg. dbl, I would think 2@s was pretty automatic with the N hand|pg||
nt|othered1: But 2@S may force the auction too high.  A reason for opening 1@S (then east, not knowing you have that good a hand, will double and you'll eventually play @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec suggests 5@d...it would mean S would have to do a lot of bidding|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|barnets: club lead is best|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec cant set up spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and has only 8 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but west is known to hold 7 @hs|pg||
nt|barnets: but can make a ninth in hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: big bob would not open 3@h a six bagger first seat at equal vul, would he?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if you can trust partner to pass when it's right, then you can double 4@h more often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or close for Moss to re-open|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  E should raise here|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but @H bid opposite void won't improve west hand a whole lot.|pg||
nt|othered1: What would west open with 4=1=4=4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: who shuffled these boards?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a conventional treatment here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I'm not impressed|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 4D was meant to play according to the new discussion at the table|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's really the auction, seems like south really evaluates hands up (see board 6 for another example)\|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: EW were going to make 2@S     that was a very bold and competitive bid by North|pg||
nt|ybob: 630 next ...|pg||

nt|tez: duck j of @c and give 1 imp to opps every hand:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: like to see it though|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever the case, the Moss team should have to gain some imps|pg||
nt|othered1: did south take 2N over the double neg 2@H as a replacement bid showing long @H?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|barnets: after dec cashes his 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  a @c was led and W never got his ruff|pg||
pc|d5|nt|swanson: East is going to have to underlead the @SA to get three tricks - otherwise North will cash all the winners and lead towards the spade.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: weichsel is known to hold three aces|pg||
nt|barnets: and leads a heart|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
nt|othered1: donating 14 imps "out of thin air" means you better not get rattled and better pick up imps with your style elsewhere.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  Moss picked up 6 imps on board 6 where 2N made 4 in OR|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Just another pushy game you shouldn't bid non-vul, but can't avoid if east's hand is an opening bid in your methods|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Sokolow over 2@S  --  tough  give credit to the EW system|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 6 more for Joel on Board 7|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but from South's perspective, needs partner to have a max to have a shot at 3nt, and might not even make 14 vs 11 with no source of tricks|pg||

nt|ybob: yes here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: @s to the A, back to dummy and another @s, right?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|athene: with four spade tricks declarer just wants to get the trumps drawn, but it's slightly awkward to get to dummy fast|pg||

nt|andyv:  with no @s losers, he may just play A@h and @h|pg||

pc|h2|nt|tez: play @h..safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in 2/1 that establishes game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm still not sure|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: on this auction probably easier to get to NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: 3H is correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how N went down on last hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|swanson: Declarer will grind it out looking for an overtrick, but by that time she will have nine in the bank.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hackenbush: 9 or 10 tricks here after ruffing a diamond|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|athene: not sure you can afford to give up on the trump finesse quite that happily - if trumps are 3-1, and the defender with @HKxx plays a third round, you only have nine tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|swanson: Guarding against 5-1 spades.|pg||

nt|ybob: i like 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter is nice choice|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ritong: passing 12 decent|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: end of auction, I presume|pg||
nt|ritong: quacks, etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D transfer   [better raise than 2@H]|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

pc|h6|nt|othered1: and NS earns 50, rather than the 130 that *might* have been attainable|pg||
nt|barnets: X could get 500  now if they pass it|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  everyone hates to pass 14 point hands:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ybob: O.R. bids 3@S over 2@S|pg||
nt|swanson: A club lead would hold the contract to nine tricks, but East has no reason to lead anything but a heart.|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. ones that have such great shape |pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I entered 2 score corrections in the movie, 1NT previously did make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: xx was 3 card support|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then again, defending is right if they're only in a 7-card fit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: 3@C was Puppet|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  or 120|pg||
nt|athene: having given up control in trumps, north has to be a bit worried about declarer running the spades|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect him to try to cash out in the minors - he would have to find his partner with one king and get him in to lead to the other AQ|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: and 3@Sx showed extra values|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry 3@Dx |pg||

nt|ahollan1: wonder why @CK instead of @CA  then @H9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: 3@H showed no major|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but i guess he just didn't want to commit to one or other suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  might even have won the auction|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: even if south's heart WAS suit-pref, he didn't really have any preference between the minors :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: reaching game would be an achievement  winning the partials battle will bring in 6 already|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: NS can make @Cs or @Ds|pg||
nt|daman: South should pass|pg||
nt|daman: here is the vugraph sked for future matches      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|2H|nt|barnets: well game is lucky with @CK falling|pg||
nt|othered1: and you  have to get the position right if you're as  high as 5|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now how will South get her values across...|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: you could play east for kX club|pg||
nt|barnets: doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: that loses here|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of alert explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force   jump to 3N should show 1N strength [but some flaw for 1N open]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and we have our answer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be less or more than 1N opening strength|pg||
nt|ybob: 130 here i hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: same bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: next board is promising as well|pg||
nt|barnets: now it went all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was probably a close call for Joel|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: maybe Passell was playing his partner for the @SK rather than a minor-suit king|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N says they never bypass 4-card majors in responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the 14 imps on board 7, the Moss team jumps ahead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: and so it goes|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|barnets: personally i think if north shows a club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: south should support him|pg||
nt|barnets: but that my view  who knows|pg||
nt|daman: this will be down quickly    once East wins the @C Ace     EW will cash 2 @Hs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|ritong: rather weird, yes  a ten cards fit buried in both rooms|pg||
nt|othered1: @DQ doesn't look very positive and @S were bid on his left, but still A9x is above expectations|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N shows clubs to all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: north has bid his suit with 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she was going to guess the @H10 anyway|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|barnets: I am not sure on their system what 2@C would mean|pg||
nt|ritong: operator, can you confirm there was no alert of 1 NT please?|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Alerted|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: ok thanks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|d2|nt|athene: when south responds 1@D here it's not saying "I have no 4-card major" but it is saying "you can ignore your 4-card majors to rebid 1nt, i will check back for them if i want to"|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room 1N was clearly alerted to show clubs?|pg||
nt|barnets: can you say if it was clearly alerted here ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause = negotiating claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decision to bid 2@S instead of something else worked well|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if East had played back a low heart, inserting @h9 is indicated from restricted choice, besides the fact that East might've tried @hK or spade from @hKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please let that be the case|pg||
nt|swanson: It seems a bit out of charater that Jill Meyers didn't open 1NT.  The hand does offer significant potential should partner have a big pointed suit fit.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|ritong: mary said so|pg||
nt|barnets: if 1n showed clubs 2@C would likely be a cue bid , as would 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I'm Gary and the alerts were lengthy, though I couldn't see or hear them|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks gary|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Mary fell into the river hehe|pg||

nt|ahollan1: almost a full 4 boards ahead of the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@D is transfer preempt, showing weak 2 bid in hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USWBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  lucky slam hand here|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c now|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec likes responsive dbl here|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C from north, 5@C from east is quite possible|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C might be a bit pushy.  Maybe dangerous responsive double|pg||
nt|daman: if they open 2@H    it is weak with both majors|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT?|pg||
nt|ybob: with @S lead N-S win 3NT|pg||
nt|ybob: only this lead|pg||
nt|swanson: 3NT is quite reasonable here - and will make unless East ducks the @DQ and declarer misguess on the second round.|pg||
nt|othered1: a quiet 3N looks very normal here.  And, just in case, 5@D also is OK|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  I like 4@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: on the news they sad the weather in the midwest is the hottest in 5 years|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: 5@C by east / 4@C lets south make a forcing pass, w hich may help their auction|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT asks    3@C shows a bad hand|pg||
nt|daman: Ogustish|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW 1N always 14-16   and Radin downgrades    when was last time you saw THAT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: repeating @hs will show 6/5|pg||
nt|barnets: slam is not wonderfull but it makes|pg||
nt|barnets: just one entry to south hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the question is: at which level|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wonder why south didn't bid 4@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which 5?   [sorry  i gotta be me]|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  when pd asks you to pick a major, do you like to torment him by bidding the other minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: @sT will be an encouraging card for Moss, partner ostensibly showing @sHx|pg||
nt|swanson: West might have bid 4@C over 3NT, being unwilling to allow the opponents a shot at a vulnerable 3NT.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: every imp is vital now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to distinguish  serious vs non-serious slam tries|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 10 tricks and time for coffee.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  this should be over quickly...S will take the @s hook into W hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so weichsel showed a rockcrushing 6/5 and lair declined|pg||
nt|barnets: a 1 imp swing could be very important for deutsch |pg||
nt|andyv:  black here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: so that decision only affects which hand declares 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ybob: after the 3@C bid, could win 5@D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: and as the cards lie -- it just doesn't matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57  the one where we talked about Rosenberg decision to respond 1@S or 2@C then they ended in 3@H [gulp]   Stansby did start with 2@C and is playing 3N South|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|ybob: need guess @D only ...|pg||
nt|swanson: In 3NT with a spade lead declarer leads the @DQ.  If East covers (the reflex play) declarer ducks and has nine winners.|pg||
nt|ybob: scary if E play small :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|swanson: It's clearly the correct play - but one has to make it in tempo (like many good plays) to be successful.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|swanson: These ladies are so aggressive with their opening bids and in other situations, I'm surprised that South didn't take a shot at 3NT.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d8|nt|andyv:  claim time |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: on 57  3N South after Stansby responded 2@C vs Rosenberg 1@S  [then the glitch that ended in 3@H]|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ybob: or bid 4@D over 3@S ...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|swanson: The downside is that if diamonds don't come it 3NT will be set multiple tricks.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: minimum number of tricks again|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I entered wrong, it was +450|pg||
nt|ritong: yah|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: Thx|pg||
nt|barnets: if n/s play slam in diamonds they could lose  a couple of vital imps|pg||
nt|barnets: unless its 7 of course !|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: they are going to have a small BW problem imo|pg||
nt|ritong: about the trump suit|pg||
nt|barnets: lynch have a likely pick up on the last board so this hand may be decisive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting decision from Seamon-Molson|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: whatever he leads helps declarer to an extent|pg||
nt|barnets: north will place the final contract\|pg||
nt|ritong: one of weichsel's problems currently is: if i raise @ds, what will be the agreed suit|pg||
nt|daman: a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok   and from Rosenberg with 1N |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer might throw a club on a spade and play for a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively try and get the diamonds going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has Sokolow had ANY easy bids this set?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|barnets: souths 3@D shows 3  card spade support|pg||
nt|othered1: Turns out 2N wasn't free here.  Wonder what 4@D would have meant over 2@S?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barnets: some play it has 3 and a non minimum|pg||
nt|barnets: now a cue bid|pg||
nt|barnets: meanwhile north has not supported diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: now it is @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  W took a pretty conservative stance on this one...lebonsohl should have applied and she should have been able to compete in 3@ds|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: north still is not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean, south answers with @s fit|pg||
nt|barnets: where to play|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D could be right|pg||
pc|d7|pc|sA|nt|barnets: now south is worried  he has shown more diamonds than he has|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ybob: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: saving 2 imps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hackenbush: this double partner almost certainly has 4 spades, looking for the big payoff when both 2@h and 2@s makes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|barnets: souths decision could have been a match winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Dummy showed max, stiff heart|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks sure to be flat|pg||
nt|ritong: lair took a huge view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 & 6 imp swings also add up quickly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: definitely|pg||
nt|ybob: she needs run the first @S to 12|pg||
nt|swanson: And guess diamonds.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: looks innocuous, but is enormous|pg||
nt|barnets: of course north had not guaranteed 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: so the whole situation is wooly to say the least|pg||

nt|ahollan1: just don't ask me why|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh right  needed @HK as entry|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there might be a more technical term|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what will Moss do over 1N overcall?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if there was some sequence that could induce opp to win @S and then play another @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: soooo....|pg||
nt|ritong: is that one mundane?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: the idea of ruffing some diamonds was that you might then be able to cash the @HAK and even if west showed out you would not necessarily be dead|pg||
nt|athene: as you might have a trump coup against east|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hand|pg||
nt|daman: NS will end up in another lazy 4@H contract|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well Valerie Westheimer in the BBO Junior club calls that the flying ace syndrome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C by many would be artificial  [example: same bid as if RHO opened 1N]  so PASS/DBL/3@C were her options|pg||
nt|hackenbush: most play double as negative here over 3@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but might be scary if partner passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with the lack of values  negative would definitely apply|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: well|pg||
nt|daman: now they satnd to gain an IMP or 2|pg||
nt|daman: stand*|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you handle north's hand.  Doesn't look exactly right for 2N, but I guess it gets at least 10 of your cards into the auction|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: good 3@C bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: no board passes out any more, even if two players pass 11 counts in 1 and 2 pos, a rarity in some circles |pg||
nt|ahollan1: stopped NS from finding @S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: sutherlin knows everyone has about a ten count|pg||
nt|athene: bramley has to be dead min to pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it makes!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|daman: oh my|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N seems reasonable|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: i would bid 2@C on the south hand i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  usually, responder shouldn't have more points than opener:)|pg||
nt|athene: you just don't get rich letting opps play in 1 of things|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Sx for the BAM win|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfk: migry (after 2@C);  again.  there should be an allowance per match|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|psyck: dealer is in a SDAM mood|pg||
nt|psyck: (6@d always makes)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: or @c or NT i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|psyck: 4@c baron or stayman variety...|pg||

nt|barnets: if n/s play 4@H the match is a tie|pg||
nt|barnets: 13 imps to lynch|pg||
nt|daman: 2@S   1@H   1@C   2@D|pg||
nt|daman: last board now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may just be push or win 4 but still  beating par is always nice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is weak 2@D available?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: started at BAM reverted back to IMP :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but at this stage 1 imp probably not a factor|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the 4@h game would have been reached...or, over 4@c, bid 4@h to give pd a choice of contracts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|barnets: and there will be extra boards|pg||
nt|barnets: if the scoring is corect|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: for future matches     http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php     bookmark it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Quite a 2@S bid in OR.  Do they play it 2-suited by definition?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, good point barnet|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|barnets: in other room west opened 2@S|pg||
nt|daman: sorry folks    we have 16 board quarters    I thought 15   like yesterday    one more after this|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl will get you 4@h too often|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|daman: 3NT from the Nprth hand is the best spot|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead and declarer has only 1 chance to win|pg||
nt|ybob: Now W shows 9 cards @C @H so ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this match or  Schwartz who leads O'Rourke by 45|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: on the rule of 11, north has one club higher than the six|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the king or jack you want to play low in dummy; if it's the 9 or 8 you want to stick in the ten|pg||
nt|othered1: Deutsch has gotten into the lead on the basis of that potential slam on board 42, where they found 6@D in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you can get south on lead next|pg||
nt|andyv:  so odds about 2-1 in favor of 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  as most don't lead away from Jacks|pg||
nt|athene: isn't it exactly 50-50?|pg||
nt|barnets: and this made it more difficult for /s|pg||
nt|daman: North*|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: If partner's gonna bid to the 4-level, we probably want to be higher|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ybob: S will play 4@S anyway, now X p 4@S|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@C is a 'fit bid' showing clubs with heart support.  I guess partner has to work out whether it shows any real values or not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
nt|tez: maybe they will stay here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: a good tactical bid|pg||
nt|hackenbush: tempting to pass with West but priority still goes to bidding your own contract first|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: well, he sort of wants to be in dummy to finesse spades|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|hackenbush: with 3 defensive tricks, and a fairly offensive hand, both @d and @s might be making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct to 4@H far from automatic with Moss' hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: in other match  with 4 to score in the set  Sprung leads Westheimer by 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after long dinner break   30 more boards to complete the USA1 semi-final matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winners advance to USA1 Final   losers got to USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good lead, holding values in both unbid suits|pg||
pc|c8|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
nt|swanson: I would think that North would take an essentially certain profit against 4@H.  Wrong again.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
nt|ybob: true moment :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
nt|othered1: And indeed with the lucky @D position, EW have slam in either minor or NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ybob: can win too|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Profits are good|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@D rounds pitch @C|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
nt|hackenbush: still making, as NS can't get in to lead trumps again|pg||
nt|andyv:  what would you bid with: x, Q10xxxxx, Qxx, xx?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting that is:)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Seniors   Milner leads Lynch by 23     Schwartz over O'Rourke by 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd even wager that most would sit 3N|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s9|nt|athene: he will see south has five diamonds and one heart|pg||
nt|daman: has to get busy and knock out the @H Ace|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|barnets: so we have a 6 board play off and hope to bring it to you|pg||
nt|daman: that's the end of the defense|pg||
nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|daman: claim|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: and just the type of opportunity Joel needs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: first needs confirmation of the tie|pg||
nt|barnets: if the scores we have are accurate|pg||
nt|ritong: in any case, this room will be closed|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to load the playoff boards|pg||
nt|ritong: if any|pg||
nt|barnets: while we are waiting all those interested in extraordinary bridge stories from the past and hands from the present|pg||
nt|barnets: visit www.shenkinbridge.com|pg||
nt|ritong: do we have an operator again?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|nt|othered1: Incidentally, on board 42, east in OR did bid 5@C over north's 4@C cue-bid, south made the expected forcing pass then raised north's 5@D to slam.  |pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  bye everyone for now|pg||
nt|athene: Bramley rose @HA i guess because if he had finessed and north had won and cleared clubs, the spade finesse would no longer have been safe|pg||
nt|athene: ok thanks all|pg||
nt|othered1: THanks to our operator for the fine presentation of a pretty fast-paced set, not an easy job.  Thanks everyone else and bye.|pg||
nt|othered1: Depends on my lebensohl methods.  I'd bid 2N, intending to punt 4@H, but partner's 3N would pull me up short.|pg||

nt|daman: thanks to our operator Gary Hann    super job|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the set   restart in about 2.5 hours|pg||
nt|ybob: OR lead was J@C and declarer win the first trick and go down|pg||
nt|ybob: if she duck 1 @C cold too |pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board for us -- other rooms still in play  and lots of bridge tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  my point is that pd would bid 4@h with that hand over dbl..so I prefer 3N because I'm simple|pg||
nt|othered1: Really bid 41H over double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with my example hand?  sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C anyone?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 50% grand    do NS think they need it?|pg||
nt|othered1: partner doesn't need a miracle hand to have 12 top tricks, just 2K and a couple of @C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hackenbush: too bad they're favorable|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ybob: no trf response after X|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: next session begins in roughly 40 minutes|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C must show @Cs obviously|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many pairs like to play that 3-level preempts have tighter range, depending on colors|pg||
nt|tez: last here.ty all.enjoyed .ty Roberto. TY SPECS|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|hackenbush: so favorable 3@c = bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable = random hand  but 2nd seat ??|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes 2nd seat should usually be stronger|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 3@c certainly works better for this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  true.  the problem is the 2@s bid announced some values so slam becomes more problematical.  If you bid 3N, pd should expect that type of hand so may she may be able to bid on.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: an inspired lead|pg||
nt|ybob: Ty Tezcan|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even 6@D may be challenge after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: no reason to get too fancy|pg||
nt|daman: over to a @S    @C finesse    @C Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might sound heretical, but i never liked 2@C with hand this flexible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- i'm a big clubber so very biased|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tez: Ty gary:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice clean auction to finish this first set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: the more i watch, the more convinced i am that transfers over the DBL work much better than standard  [i.e. a forcing 1@H feels wrong]|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D a reasonable shot now|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to run.  Thanks operator for the solid presentation.  Thanks everyone else and bye|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Sokolow DBL = 3@H  [support dbl]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: NS did avoid going for 800 in 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminds me of my grandfather     i saved $100,000 dollars today   saw a house i loved and didn't buy it     [it was a long time ago]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: certainly pairs that play transfers over 1@c opening, play it over the double, e.g. Garner-Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if not playing them over 1@C-P   many play them over 1@C-X and 1@D-X|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many more play them over 1M-Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of agony here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those have been around longer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: from the players or the specs following our ramblings?>|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice bid Debbie|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzff: It was a bit of an ordeal lol :)|pg||
