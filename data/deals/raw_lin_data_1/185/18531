nt|roswolf: ty mary|pg||

nt|drg: the intervention may also cause you to misguess the clubs if they are trump|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: breed looks a bit confused, previous hand asked for a review etc|pg||

nt|drg: the trump back would actually fail if the trick could be won in either hand by squeezing west, but north must win the trick and west can discard a heart|pg||

pc|h5|nt|peachy: yes, as long as declarer's hand is not in discarding trouble|pg||
nt|athene: there are lots of other intriguing possibilities such as throwing north in with a club|pg||
nt|athene: but you could look very silly if you e.g. cashed the @SAK to drop north's spades then threw her in|pg||
nt|athene: and she led a diamond to south's ace and south cashed the @SQ :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d6|pc|s6|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: EW keep bidding @D    scary stuff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: easy for us :)|pg||
nt|athene: so often you feel you probably ought to lead a trump but you decide to lay down just ONE top honour first to see dummy|pg||
nt|athene: and what you see is, yes, ya shouldda led that trump|pg||
nt|peachy: Garozzo's rule: Freely paraphrased:  You must have a good reason not to lead trump|pg||
nt|athene: the auction does suggest north might be ruffing diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so i think a trump lead is not impossible to find|pg||
nt|athene: west might be a bit scared that if she leads trumps declarer might get the clubs going, but partner's job is to hold a nice big club card|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, N could be 5-4 though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Long discussion with Rosenburg and N-S as to the meaning of N bids.|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure 2@C promises six|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: no-one plays it as 5+ any more|pg||

nt|peachy: I dont know their styule exactly but 5-4 is possible in addition to 6-3 and 6-4|pg||
nt|peachy: the way many play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: It was described as 6-4 or cue.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: 660 other room|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I am behind the times then, no surprise there|pg||
nt|peachy: Thx Kathy|pg||
nt|athene: most strong club pairs these days give up a bit of definition on the 1@D opener in order to have 2@C promise six cards|pg||
nt|athene: so with e.g. 4M225@C they are opening 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: (or 1nt of course, hahaha)|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps some judgment allowed with a very sparkly club suit of 5 cards, I would assume|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @CAKQJ10 might decide that isn't a 1@D opener :)|pg||

nt|athene: Molson will not be too hopeful - if declarer's trumps were susceptible to a trump promotion she would probably not ruff the diamond with the king|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: would prefer to ruff low, lead king, and if that is allowed to hold, come to hand with heart ruff|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = non-force  denies 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|d|an|!|nt|athene: you sorta want to show both majors with that south hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: normally if you are going to compete with a modest 44 majors you bid 1@S intending 2@H next|pg||
nt|athene: but south didn't really want to do that because she wants the heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: so if she started with 1@S and opps went into a fast 3nt or something, she would not feel so good|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, this hand exception, also a consideration if partner reads you for 5S 4H|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: the problem is now she has to bid 2@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how auction will go in other room    1@C[nat]-1@H//??   1N??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: was not here at that time|pg||
nt|athene: but she feels ok, if partner didn't raise my hearts she should have four spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it all comes down to how much the doubler needs just to make a "courtesy" raise|pg||
nt|athene: in the old days you needed a really big hand but the requirements are dropping steadily|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: people prefer to just raise on anything if they have 4-card support|pg||
nt|athene: quite right too :) gotta get in there|pg||
nt|peachy: In competition (over the Dbl) even sttricter pdships allow raise with less if pure sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a 17 count with 4 hearts she can surely redouble first or cue or something|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 2@H over the double of 1@H should show the world|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway....the end result is that south has had to go a level higher than necessary|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: hearts often get pushed to the 3-level by troublesome spade competition - but it's a little embarrassing when it's you who supplied the competition|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 3 boards missing from the movie - so dont believe this running total|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good start for declarer but it doesn't seem to be enough.|pg||
