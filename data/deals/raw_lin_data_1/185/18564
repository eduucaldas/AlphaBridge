nt|007 joosth: many would open 1H maybe  but I prefer 1C|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like we are almost ready, Wold Bates play Precision Club, Std approach for NS|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk3: we can't have a broadcast with invisible operators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw last set that side 5-card major isn't a deterent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S max of 15 HCP  [ew play a form of precision]|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk3: Now or we shall have to boot you|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hello  all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a side 6-card major isn't a deterent...  clubs just have to be the primary suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably right Martin   very common to use same convention after 1N overcall as over 1N opener|pg||
nt|kirp:  why not open 3@C to begin with?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less common to have a 3@C bid over 1N overcall when you couldn't open 3@C|pg||

nt|007 joosth: I hoped to learn some english here:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  how many spades by E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some take it a step further  after nebulous 1@D [like precision]  2@D=nat  2@H=weak michaels|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 2@H probably inv+ @C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: just reporting the fact  --   i'm positive i'm not sure which is better/best|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but ot here with that singl of clubs may be. |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Cindy Bernstein and Sally Wheeler sitting EW|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not|pg||
nt|baldfriede: operator, what was the result in board 1?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4 s by north down 2--cant enter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when both of opp suits known [michaels for @H & @S, unusual NT for 2 lowest]  you have 2 cue bids to show the other suits|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|andyv:  they play a 12-14 NT |pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  neither side can attack @ds, so 3 rounds of @hs may allow declarer to bring this home|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=21&task=list|pg||
nt|hackenbush: for players list and system summary forms|pg||
nt|kirp:  Wonder if they will go to slam, dont think it makes without help|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there are 2 ways to play    low for 4th suit or low for lowest suit    [1st better theoretically,  latter more common]|pg||
nt|kirp:  methods vary as to strength, some Qs are GF, others are invit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: "can"  better read as "should"|pg||

pc|c3|nt|007 joosth: they continue doing the impossible:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, neither side SHOULD....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems after the lead  kit had a lot of options -- all bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best switch would have been a @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @d entry, it seems that declarer can just go after @ss now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like that will lead to 2@S 2@H 2@D for -1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  I don't understand this sequence chosed by EW so can't comment on it|pg||
nt|chick: I just checked the summary card and there is nothing there either|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing invite with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like on Bd 1, O'Rourke picked up 5 imps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: maybe a combination of stripsqueeze and endplay to makeslam|pg||
nt|kirp:  Possible if S pitches a H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would at least make another try with East's hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  No @C Q-bid by W should slow him down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: at other table a @c lead helped making 6@s|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs moderate care to make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bidding in OR suggested a @C lead!|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: no, restroom break|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time for prediction   Bates opens  2@D=11-15 HCP  4415 minus 1 card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like it would have been reasonable here too  but Chambers didn't like 4333|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hackenbush: different NT range allowed the open room to diagnose the @s weakness and reach 5@c|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1H - 1S - 1Nt  i think|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: looked like 9 tricks for the taking agree specs|pg||
nt|kirp:  except had Axx in @S, opponents had 8 or likely 9 of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nobody wanted to play a simple 4@h:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they might play a penalty double over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well done :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joost and Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was flip a coin country|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: heart queen lead if cindy passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  their card confirms 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  E guessed the N's major was not @ss|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dull as long they are not in 5 again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 11-13|pg||
nt|kirp:  N here prob. cant redble as that shows honour in @Hs|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: could have been though, S had 4|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of defensive tricks in the 2 suits bid by NS|pg||
nt|kirp:  S also now has more easy non-@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or RDBL is transfer   but don't think anybody plays it as days of old  where RDBL=points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does he lead @D or @C?|pg||
nt|kirp:  pick me for points on rdble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming Bates PASS|pg||
mb|2D|nt|irwinbo: was 3 d really three clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  spade is my pick!|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: come to think of it -- in context of limited 1@D -- would you make neg dbl with west hand??|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: i suspect we see Cohen work diamonds next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i was going to vote for the @C4...  but i think i'll change to the @D6 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the result as we see it operator ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  not worth it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, forgot to cash heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kozlove didn't opposite unlimited opener|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  looks like E can make this easily on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may be playing transfers where 3@D would be stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  really is a poor neg dble|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: an interesting switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  ill-judged maybe is more polite|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: this is makeable from here, but unlikely at the table imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diplomatic   as all bridge players are|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: in the other room, they played 2@s when south chose to raise instead of bidding 1NT: a very plausible alternative|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hackenbush: ah, EW one of few pairs to have submitted a convention card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense needed to shift to spades after second heart ducked|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/docs/2011uswbc/acblcards/PollackBjerkan.bmp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however disa should not have discarded a diamond, if in fact she did|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wonder if east's 2nt would be the winning bid in the bridge world   many would double|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks still hard to beat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about  neg dbl got what it deserved|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: likely finesse |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: but no thought to leading @S?    North figures to have exactly 4 [pull w/5]  and South exactly 2  [pass w/3]|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice start from Chambers|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bigtrain: don't like leading from broken 4-card suits...  to costly in the long run|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: Bates covered in case Cohen only had 10x of spades and Wold had 8xx left|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  NS have no response to final 3 tricks for EW.  In hindsight, S probably wished she'd led a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like leading     period|pg||
nt|kirp:  That does beat it|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: aint that the truth (says the president of the overbidder club)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just ask partners     no good can come from having me on opening lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  N is about to get end played|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kirp:  he can get a @H ruff but then what|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: now a club back but Mark Cohen has nine tricks|pg||
nt|joest: the club pitch suggesting that perhaps Bates wants hearts returned|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on defense it isn't always bad to get endplayed -- if it happens often enough|pg||
nt|kirp:  best here is a club back|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: and one who's a spec  agreed     WAY too quickly|pg||

nt|bagman: If the defense attacks diamonds, the 9th come from there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: endplayed for 9th trick|pg||
nt|007 joosth: declarer has an entry in hearts at both sides.   the long suits should be free before the opps remove the entry|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer likely to go up the @HK on the heart switch to cash the clubs and then set up the spade|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when E would play a heart now  declarer can take the trich in dummy,  cash his clubs after which a hook in spades|pg||
nt|bagman: N can discard a spade and 2 hearts on clubs and still have stopper in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|bagman: It might take some time before Kasle works out that N holds 5-4 in the majors, which is not a typical 1NT opening|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small heart is most promising for defenders.  maybe W has the ace|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: diamonds was ok if W has KJ|pg||
nt|bagman: That @DT might have been the only card to beat 3NT if N had AQJxx Axxx 7x AT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|007 joosth: needs 2 specific cards   but the advantage is that a good guess by declarer is impossible|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|joest: this could be a swing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2NT maybe|pg||
nt|joest: if north-south play puppet stayman, they might land in 4@s|pg||
nt|joest: that should still fetch it looks like but its a bit harder than 3NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: guess the @d lead worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and/or @S switch    and/or   sunspot activity|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting implications for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: E will never be on lead. so Kx of clubs stay protected|pg||
nt|joest: treating his hand as too big for an initial 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Jacobus opened 1N|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  on board 34, 5@c was made in OR, slicing the lead to 13 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: was a very poor effort|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h probably shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can understand it with so many controls|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: quick attack on transportation|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing East bid 2@d instead of North|pg||
nt|sybarra: suport X |pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  good guess Howard:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Bit of a hand hog|pg||
mb|2S|nt|007 joosth: J of diamonds may be the entry for club tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter  do you use coded 10/9 leads in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  a hand where almost all finesses are off|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not sure that was best choice, reasonable but @S also possible|pg||
nt|kirp:  However this looks like it should go down 2 trix at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: so they are playing puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: suspect we missed a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: could be gazilli but nothing much on their system summary form|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=838&pid=607|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm guessing that 2@d was xfer to @hs showing a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that's more likely, if 2@c and 2@h not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Two diamonds was alerted by West but not by East.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: referring to Stewart's @S shift|pg||
nt|007 joosth: might be 1/3 lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  we use something thats referred to as foster returns|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd from garbage?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  when dummy has small cards we lead second highest unless we want partner to do some high banging|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @s suit of N does not look very inviting though|pg||
pc|cK|nt|007 joosth: as in other room no puppet here|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bit undervalued by N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you like 2N over 2@S?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kirp:  NV game so maybe not worth the push|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: actually you can't determine that by a 3@s rebid :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed:)|pg||
nt|joest: so this presents the ninth trick but the contract is always cold just by keeping east off lead, for overtricks even|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems strange  but the possible entry has gone|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be a push around the room |pg||
nt|kirp:  Just that someone needs to push, not both|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is part of why i play big club|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kirp:  I play bigger club|pg||
pc|s5|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades may even make 5   she will probably make 4 hearts here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|007 joosth: not the lead at 4S  :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  True, except it does not give up anything, club lead might|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: could have doubled 3@D, 3@H was a bit much|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 9 tricks for the taking|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kirp:  why would you want S on lead, with N's hand?|pg||
nt|kirp:  @H is actually safe|pg||
nt|kirp:  dummy has only 1 entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Dx real killer|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: this hand does not merit much thought, are we still here|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think she is worried about a 4-1 heart break andbeing tapped in dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck one heart|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kirp:  still 5 trix|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chick: are we stuck or is S thinking?|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N here was pretty easy, though 3@d trix available to defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this may soon turn into NT play |pg||
nt|kirp:  so in theory, 3n can be beat|pg||
nt|kirp:  in OR, played by N, it would have been harder to beat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can defense take 3@D if they play the suit?  looks frozen to me|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  west on lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  meanwhile, 2s is playing well, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if not quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer doesn't know if @CK doubleton or singleton    probably the former|pg||
nt|kirp:  so what, cross to 10@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i'm thinking   but i'm in a loop|pg||
nt|kirp:  cant make more than 4, 3 or 2|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 is virtually assured|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: not necissarily bad however, EW can make 4@H|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Pollack was thinking.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  W still has @c loser so making 2 seems to be the most likely outcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, make that a @h loser now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 trick swing compared to other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: dreww played this one really nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now just have to figure out who did good/bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to this point anyway|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chick: no more club loser, but now a heart loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might never score @HA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  that play doesn't make much sense|pg||
nt|chick: not unreasonable play, since there was a ruff, entirely possible the J will fall now-doubleton|pg||
nt|chick: the club was a sure loser|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought W would finesse for J@h|pg||
pc|hT|nt|joest: so a push|pg||
pc|hK|mc|10|nt|andyv:  the play I was talking about was the Q@d off dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 6D with open cards,  but bad contract|pg||
nt|bagman: Based on the previous hand, N opens 1NT if he has something like the range and something like the shape|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: and now 5@C from Stewart|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must have some spades mixed in with his clubs :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Woolsey has the same thought i think|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=0/1 controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS can make lots of @Ds|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hackenbush: NS play precision|pg||
nt|joest: third seat a good four card major is a possibility|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 5C as expected|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: tons of pressure now.  Rosenberg could just grab it with 3NT but that's a big statement|pg||
nt|joest: but if he makes a 'responsive double' or some such they are probably headed to 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: 5@C|pg||
nt|kirp:  solved a tuff hand with invit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wish USBF could require submission of Convention Cards for their trials -- not sure how many @D promised by Schermer's 1@D :(|pg||
nt|kirp:  3@D bid is intersting, would you play this as weak?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|007 joosth: 3NT seems best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wonder what Casen would bid over  3@C-4@S-5@C-?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Jacobus in action again|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest: takes teh pressure off partner which is always appreciated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: club finesse is needed  after that at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: Wold knows where the spade king is (or thinks he does)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  he may be right:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing Eddie leads a @d|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hackenbush: this lead and auction should help Wheeler pick up trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: both partners seem to have been ticketed for speeding here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 5 down even?|pg||
nt|kirp:  he counts points|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand 4@D bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he get out for 800?|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||
nt|joest: 4 hearts + 4 diamonds + 1 club = 9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when it's about avertricks he can better start clubs immediately|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Kozlove bid the same opposite unlimited 1@D|pg||

mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: dubious 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR 3N was bid quickly, here more science|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: a rather dull board 9 tricks  maybe defenders dont take their 4 tr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D game force checkback  [a guess]|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: I would not preempt with S's hand, too much chance partner has spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  but they will survive this one as there is no game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised Casen didn't either bid 2@S or make Support DBL??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I think he is confident with this 2H  Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, i know  @HAJ9x  screams defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt from N? |pg||
nt|kirp:  yup|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|andyv:  so this should go down 2|pg||
nt|chick: sounds about right|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S may have clarified @H weakness|pg||

mb|p|nt|kirp:  S is still trying, N will check out|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: schermer being forced to re-confirm  minimum balanced hand 3@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: does he just take double finesse in @S or can he combine chances in @D & @S|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: other room 1@S West|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: so maybe @DA @S finesse  and when that works he's set|pg||

nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: i thought I scored it down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  +1|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 9 to score in the USA1 final   Schwartz over Lynch by 35|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kirp:  Best by W|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3H|nt|joest: Rosenberg with a disciplined pass but at matchpoints I can assure you some folks would enter with a lead directing 2@s|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C majors   same as if  1N opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it was down one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice 2C if it is majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand  IF in slam, can you make|pg||
mb|4C|nt|joest: well I guess at IMPS too!|pg||
nt|joest: at favorable I guess anything goes|pg||
nt|joest: but Milt is usually pretty disciplined|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without peeking at all 52 cards|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  6@c or 6N will be disappointing with the 4-1 @c break|pg||
nt|andyv:  the OR managed to stay out of trouble|pg||
nt|joest: this catches Cohen with a big hand though|pg||
nt|joest: here come the police|pg||
nt|joest: Bates has to double what is under his nose it seems to me|pg||
nt|joest: of course his partner is 3rd seat but still..|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only 7 tricks i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and there they are|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but a diamond lead is not nice|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: n0--sorry--|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I dont think  such a bid has to be strong.  so 3S seems some rough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen liked his pure holdings in majors  -- and i'm sure not a high card invite -- that would be 2N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice double fit,  but a doubtful K|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew basing it on the dbl major suit fit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade lead gives it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  and seems impossible to keep N from gaining lead if you don't lead a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat  and  3rd vul  1N=15-17|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chick: it does seem that they should have considered a slam at least|pg||
nt|joest: ok so I have misguessed Rosenberg at every opportunity|pg||
nt|joest: Mark used to be a pretty harsh partner.  I played with him.|pg||
nt|joest: I would NOT have wanted to table this dummy in 3NT doubled!!! :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Hard to find @C lead now|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: right now, pollack is praying for a bad club split :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  as they did here...1N is 8-13 and game forcing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a heart lead seems obvious   the Q or K   according to what agreement you have|pg||
nt|007 joosth: asking unblocking a J|pg||
nt|joest: although that will cost her|pg||
nt|joest: here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure about 3@H  and that also applies to 4N and 5@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Have no idea what 4N was, key-card?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S might fit  keycard  or    5@S 6@D  [but didn't 4@S show that?]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H weak jump shift -- just weird for that hand to ask KeyCards|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice bid by N if thats the case|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's a twist  4@S=keycard for @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  5@D is also a nice contratc|pg||
nt|kirp:  thats also possible!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: 8-11 opposite passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus opened north hand 1@C  so O'Rourke had no trouble leading @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lasts random guess  4N pick-a-game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hackenbush: *as|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade ace lead was a good bet with no raise by partner|pg||
nt|hackenbush: new leader after this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes, goes down every 4-5 minutes.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: should get diamonds right after West shows up with lots of black cards|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well Jack,  maybe he just wanted to visit the toilet?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no unbloch here  thats strange|pg||
nt|joest: Bates proceeding on the assumption that, having not seen the jack from partner, Cohen must have it|pg||
nt|joest: at least I'm guessing so|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 more mistake and its only -100|pg||
nt|joest: but it doesn't matter much what he does since Cohen has only six tricks that I can count|pg||
nt|kirp:  May find @C lead after this auction|pg||

nt|andyv:  so far a good set for Westheimer|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome back|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after this board EW should have the lead again|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d is not the world's best contract but it seems like it deserved a better fate than 1100 minus|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes  sorry    its the other team|pg||
nt|kirp:  its 14-10 after 10 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 800 would have been standard?|pg||
nt|joest: well in top tricks you have 5 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts so I would hope to limit it to 500|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk1: Hopefully to a stable connection|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jon Wittes|pg||
nt|joest: Bates bidding 4@s where Woolsey settled for 3 next door|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed but thats after you know how well the hearts behave|pg||
nt|joest: rosenberg will bid 5@d as well I would imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i cant imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3 sure tricks in defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: interesting bidding in other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  a real 18 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 1N|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably for the majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|jwit: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  i give up|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW need to stay low with this misfit...probably 2@s|pg||
nt|kirp:  hard to figure|pg||
nt|baldfriede: would not be my choice, especially with that @s suit E has|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if really 2@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what year is this?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kirp:  2@C a range/major ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 4S likely contract here|pg||
nt|joest: Well now we'll see if Cohen can hold down the carnage a bit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: playing with a Cohen  I would expect some more law|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: after a club switch, Cohen has major problems getting back to his hand (if he really wants to try for a spade ruff)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I would expect 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may not even bid his @hs and settle for 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well they will be higher i'm afraid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: KnR says South worth 18.95|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jwit: Should be no problem for declarer|pg||

nt|007 joosth: the roof comes down if he tries to play on clubs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: a messy auction :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Levin in deep thought.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and a good spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe he can discard a spade on a heart|pg||
nt|joest: double dummy he could make it now|pg||
nt|joest: flies ace plays one round of diamonds then works clubs|pg||
nt|joest: spade ruff, etc.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: perhaps, but I think can make game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentator from other room confirmed  they really played 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Should go down on spade ruff|pg||
nt|kirp:  Cant tell what range of NTs they are playing, a bit surprised by 2N after opening 1n|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using the stayman sequence to show 5@S invite frees up 1N-2@H//2@S-2N for artificial sequences|pg||
pc|c6|nt|007 joosth: why that silly 9?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok it just dont hurt|pg||
nt|007 joosth: just 1 trick maybe  haha.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: now the 5 is a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surprised by 1N    SHOCKED by 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roman Club players    1N=18-20|pg||
nt|kirp:  15+->18- on their card|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kirp:  any roaman club players left in the world|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  for those who just arrived, the score shown is not accurate...no result for board 37 and board 36 has been misscored.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|chick: have to pick up the diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: needed TWO @S ruffs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jwit: Could have lost as many as 5 tricks in this contract with a different layout, but everything lies well for declarer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: plaing the J would have been ok|pg||
nt|007 joosth: tryiong clubs now i think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: and she might not do that|pg||
nt|joest: he is still going to telescope into a club development line for down 1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Roman was fun to play, but you didn't see it much in north america  ACBL banned much of the system|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: in the other USA2 "Quarter Final" [where only 2 matches]    thru board 41  Kasle leads Milner by 31|pg||
nt|andyv:  I believe 36 turned out to be a push|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: but i'm not sure about the play after @D lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pointed out to me   if 2@S inv, then  pass with min  so 2N=2@S, MAX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so apologies to Chambers  about  my reaction to that call|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|007 joosth: al together Roosenberg will win 900 here i think|pg||
nt|joest: -200 to win 14|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some days are worse|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  so Woolsey would have 6 less imps|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk1: Operator, 3NT+1 on board 1 was made by EW, not NS|pg||
nt|Walddk1: so the board is flat|pg||
nt|Walddk1: you can subtract 13 IMPs from Westheimer's score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Do you know how to correct?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Players taking a break.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 37 may have been a push as both sides made 4@s (but didn't bid the game)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sounds right Andy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chick: oh I agree, bidding the game was a long shot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps  only 34 boards left to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  E had to not cover the 9@C on last hand lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: easier to bid south hand if the @S quacks located elsewhere|pg||
nt|kirp:  forget that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S has a problem trying to describe her hand|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d-2@c is a difficult auction in Standard that requires a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C either 4-card limit raise  or   Game force    shame usbf can't require convention card submission :(|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  2N probably xfer to @d|pg||
nt|chick: 2N probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i do short hand better:)|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|joest: does a 2@d rebid show five?  Does 2 of a major show extras? etc.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes indeed I can recommend the Lawrnce book 2/1 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with the length  the @S honors wasted here  [term is trump poor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was Game Force @S raise  [jacoby]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think this 2@C has 4@H/@S only if 6+@C|pg||
nt|joest: yes he has a well thought out method in his book|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hackenbush: routine 4@s here, Westheimer's opening will have to come on one of the last 4 boards|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  2@D=5+|pg||
nt|joest: and then either 3@h followed by 3Nt or just 3NT directly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so   now we have to guess   was 3@H weaker or better than PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jwit: EW slightly stole this one, though they will have to do some scrambling to make this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some play 2D as balanced   11/12  maybe only 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  this is like rubber bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL was lead-direct|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E might play for a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: only in 2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I was going to say she would need a safety play in diamonds, but doesn't look like she'll get the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: makeable |pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Lead actually helps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then 2NT can be 13/14  gf  or  18/19|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 2@D didn't deny 4@H/@S  but 3@D did|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @h suit will provide one pitch so S should immediately play it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah  at rubber you'd rebid 2N instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Diams are friendly layout|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like only 9 trix|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C look tempting as possible source too|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: but Bates-Wold play precision so |pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead maybe  but N did not double 3H|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|007 joosth: fine lead here|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs lead second highest from four small and so, apparently, does this north-south pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  if someone holds honor doubleton|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  now can get to board with K@c to pitch other @c on @h|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kirp:  we need a probability chart of rthat vs @D play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer also factoring in @S33|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jwit: Trumps and spades both behave and 9 of clubs is a big card, so they should probably make this|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where are Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley when we really need them?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: needs a little care now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: @D hook now |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3NT maybe down i think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: if @D shift  does he duck or fly?   i think choice is just whether to lose a @D or lose a @H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|007 joosth: esp now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: wonder if N considered the possibility of a club ruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: both kings onside for woolsey  --  not expected on this auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: defense appears headed to two spade tricks + 2 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: wold with 3 diamonds + 2 spades + 2 clubs + 1 hearts|pg||
nt|joest: he may well have to decide which hook to take|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  I guess not|pg||
nt|kirp:  I think 33 is in the high 30's, dblton both honors adds about 4%, so we are over 40%. That seems better than dblton honour missing 7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  big swing on this board |pg||

mb|1N|nt|bagman: bad hand, some fit, nonvulnerable; generally right to bid, though|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: pass can't be right when opponents are vul!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what do you think of Jacobus 2@C opening?|pg||

nt|baldfriede: meaning "this will probably be another push board" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're more diplomatic than me :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm a big clubber so very biased|pg||
nt|kirp:  2c-2d-2s-3c=bad hand,  now what|pg||
nt|baldfriede: pass and pray|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree  flexible hands starting 2@C yield very complicated auctions|pg||
nt|kirp:  what's the hold-up?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: boys took break|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am not a fan of 2@d waiting bid after strong 2@c openings|pg||

nt|ahollan1: interesting problem|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jwit: This might be interesting!|pg||
nt|joest: the live and let die 2@s bid.  five card suit, side four card major|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i like that 2S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously Woolsey did NOT preempt with West   his only option was 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 Final  thru 71 of 90    Schwarts leads Lynch by 35|pg||
nt|kirp:  here we go also|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it is a wasted bid; the one who needs information is the opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: curiously?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: i could think of several reasons why one might not preempt :)|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  invite will get W to 3 and down quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Womens USA2 SemiFinal  3 to play  ALL TIED|pg||

nt|007 joosth: sure  but its nice when p knows what to lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  hehe|pg||
nt|kirp:  33 is 35.5% i am informed. dblton with 2 honours out of 6 cards, is 3 possibilities out of 64. Looks like around 40%.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women USA1 Final  5 remaining   Moss over Sprung by 29|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a Roland slam|pg||
nt|chick: much too good for Roland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's how Fantoni-Nunes play their 1-suit openings|pg||
nt|baldfriede: a shot in the dark which does not hit the target but winds up in the blue|pg||
nt|kirp:  Is W thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should have 11 or 12 @Hs, not 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wold needed to DBL to prevent Bates from thinking|pg||
nt|kirp:  Dbl might have encouraged Bates to bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but [rightly] feared they have a better spot|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hackenbush: too many losers to bid game, even vul, assuming 3@h is not a limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i recall Drew claiming his regular partner Jim Krekorian convinced him that 2 aces opposite strong NT = GAME|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: even if clubs behave Rosenberg has only eight tricks|pg||
nt|joest: he will needed to work diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: and will need to assume East has the ace, else he's just down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: true  but the disadvantage of the 2S is that maybe N will guess the clubs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: quickly with a diamond lead .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  ordinarily 8 hcp enough in this type of auction...but hcp are in Aces and E is berift of spot cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Senior USA1   5 to play  Schwartz +52 over Lynch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Lynch will get night off then play 60 board match vs winner here  to determine USA2|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  might be right:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 10 of hearts lead will help declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse hesitations --  the slow 5@H shows confidence|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a likely challenge|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E may simply play @ss back to K and Q and lose an imp here|pg||
nt|joest: once spades are abandoned for sure the ace of diamonds resides in east|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if N guesses the clubs i think there may be an endplay at E|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce happy they aren't vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: may duck this lead in both hands|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: courtesy raise of 3@C from Wold [instead of original pass] would have been interesting|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: I dont see a way to make 9 tricks on this layout |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the fast way:)|pg||
nt|joest: enough of that suit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: now an endplay with clubs:)|pg||

nt|kirp:  Looks like they missed slam in OR on this also|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: Cohen has no good bid    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16    you just need to count using new math|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jwit: This contract doesn't rate to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stewart opened 1N=10-12 and described exact shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: have seen this hand make 4 hts but e/w were only in 2 |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|andyv:  N has too much defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  those who think down 2 are optomists or pessimists|pg||

nt|ahollan1: my favorite online toy  Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator  says East worth 13.65   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
mb|2N|nt|007 joosth: diff lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: S will reason that N is broke|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok almost:)|pg||
nt|joest: i like that reasoning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit  haven't seen 3rd seat opener with 4 AND extra values|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: can't on drugs be an option?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he also knows too many points in reds|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  always is, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been easier for East if Bates could complete his shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i had a feeling the the ten was coming|pg||
nt|baldfriede: undo|pg||
nt|kirp:  E is now trying to backtrack on his 14-16hcp|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: nice lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|007 joosth: spade again|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction seemed to scream    lead trump THEN look at your hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|kirp:  whatever the auction, 6@S looks solid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|007 joosth: trying not to be endplayed|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jwit: This should fail by 2 or 3 tricks, but NS can probably make a part score, so no disaster|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce should try the @h finesse even though his sure it won't work|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems dropping K of H is last chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well credit Wold for upgrading his hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  which means O'Rourke is now in the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry missed a pass--contract is 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Kathy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: robbins didn't bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kirp:  actual score is 27-21|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: wold wasn't listening as hard|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: with 1 to play in the set  Kasle 100  Milner 69   winner of that match plays winner of this match tomorrow in USA2 "Semi-Final"|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: holding @DQ  the shift seems surprising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course  he too may expect Chambers to hold 5@H|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: @H lead in other room was killer|pg||
nt|joest: not a comfortable pitch here for cohen|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jwit: Of course, diamonds would have been a better contract for EW, or even spades.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: @D10 probably makes it tougher for declarer|pg||
nt|joest: Wold playing this great so far|pg||
nt|007 joosth: for the moment S problem is over|pg||
nt|007 joosth: should play 7|pg||
nt|joest: on the heart lead was it down one trivially?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: otherwise he is down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe N should have played the T  easy from here|pg||
nt|joest: if he holds off the queen, cohen will have to give him a red trick |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i don't think anything was trivial about the play at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: cos winning the heart queen and shooting a club up is a strong start for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @CQ was allowed to win|pg||
nt|joest: at teh risk of repetition: Eddie has played this well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when Stewart then attacked @D it was all over|pg||
nt|joest: ic|pg||
nt|joest: and clubs were abandoned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Jack says  Wold playing this well -- honestly this is 2nd time i've seen all 4 hands and still don't now how to declare it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Wold did well indeed,  but I think N missed a chance by not playing the T of diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Joost  then @Dx from Cohen and Wold is on a guess|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|joest: and to Kathy our operator|pg||
nt|joest: classic Michaels call|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our operator |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c so looks like 2@c is natural|pg||

mb|1N|nt|007 joosth: play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably the same opening lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: to see it yourself move your mouse over the open room result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: EW will get to 4H here. Will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our thanks to Jan Martel who organizes everything, and thx to USBF for bringing this to bbo |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the afternoon     restart of USA2 SemiFinal in about 2 hours 20 minutes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  EW may be able to find a cheap save in @hs |pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably 4-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, not 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Women's USA2 Final [96 boards] will start then too|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: 4@S easy, an overtrick on the expected heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|joest: my prediction wasn't so hot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some science in play here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  N might have done better to bid 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  will someone explain this sequence|pg||
mb|3S|nt|007 joosth: a light opener. maybe getting to high now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could come home, but not enough imps |pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: South did well not to double. Knowledge of bad trump break might have given declarer a fighting chance.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good lead for defense|pg||
nt|joest: i can't leave AKxx of hearts unbid.  If they double me, I apologize I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack if it makes you feel any better   i made same prediction 40 minutes ago|pg||
nt|007 joosth: haha|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW open lighter than most|pg||
nt|kirp:  so W is catering to light OB|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  S can afford to lose 2@s and a @c|pg||
nt|chick: will lose only one of each on this lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here is there opportunity|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential pickup for Westheimer here, open room stopping in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: very bad hand for 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|007 joosth: glad I did not say a word:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N goes down on @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're pretty normal for context of big club system|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: the USA2 Senior matches are 60 boards   USA1 Senior Final is 90    Women are playing 96 board matches now  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 bracket = undefeated teams   USA2 = 1 loss  [so lose again, go home]|pg||
nt|pef: sorry Joanne Sprung|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 17-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us....final set of this segment to start in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what a lead...|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a chance now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW haven't played much together  otherwise Ferguson might have just tried 2N|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little too deep for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe thinking Casen could bid this way with 1435 and singleton @SQ/J ??|pg||
nt|andyv:  still a pretty deep position to take.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a lead that isn't??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D fairly passive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is this an auction that calls for passive lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew still stunned by the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem is augmented by the holding of 10x with the K, blowing the whole suit apart for the defense if you are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit   i wouldn't have counted either of the last 2 hands the way Wold did|pg||
nt|kirp:  that may still beat it|pg||
nt|kirp:  but its now closer than you might think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N would have been interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Cohen with a surpised winner |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: in any event it is going to prove to be an expensive pass resulting in a double game swing|pg||
nt|kirp:  Made only 3S in other room, so not clear cut. Looks like N is vulnerable to endplays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Schermer's hand too good to beat 3N|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  and you can be sure that lead will not be duplicated at other table|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer needs to unblock the @s, but aFTER THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES TO DUMMY|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming @S worth 5 tricks -- what's best try for  9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe immediate guess of @C10?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Think he'll play for something good to happen in @Ds and@Ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D7 could have been from 87x|pg||
nt|kirp:  N coul have lead from 3 or 4 small @Ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right  or 87xx|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: no, wrong|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries and W known to be long in 2 other suits, lead the 10 and run it|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the biggest swing of the session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but IF [keyword] you expect a better hand in West   what does partner hold  and which lead works for that holding|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: there goes that option|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|hackenbush: can't really go wrong here, clubs 5-2 and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: O'Rourke will finish with 13 more and take the lead at the half|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  almost:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not same auction either|pg||
pc|sA|nt|007 joosth: as I said N might be advised to read the book of the other Cohen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: why a heart to the Q    KJxx might be in N to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 44  Bates did double 4@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: did he need to either  hook @C  or  reverse dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  gtg...bye all!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i admit unable to ignore seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my plan was for Wold to think longer at trick 1|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|007 joosth: 1 tr back again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke team has playes extremely well this set|pg||
nt|007 joosth: harte now would be fine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: heart|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||

nt|joest: ok thanks Al|pg||
nt|joest: bye all|pg||
nt|007 joosth: bye|pg||
nt|kirp:  Good guess, but no matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it ruled out down 3 :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer deep in thought.  Head on table.|pg||
nt|jwit: Looks like declarer still has to come up a trick short here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: again thx and we will see you all tomorrow|pg||
nt|kirp:  N knows W's shape by now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kirp:  if EW go  down on this, then we are even going into last two sessions|pg||
nt|chorush: that seems surprising; seem like he had a sure beat by rising and giving ruff on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think he can make from here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if play another trump  lose 2@H @D & @S   if play @H  Chambers @SJ promotes 2nd trump|pg||
pc|h3|nt|007 joosth: well  just made after the 2d present|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of different auction    Rosenberg didn't open East hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can imagine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's Milt Rosenberg     Michael isn't old enough  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: final set in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well   here its bedtime  so ty all     and gl  next session|pg||
