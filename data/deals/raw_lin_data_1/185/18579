nt|bobholl: paulissen contemplating and still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: with no poor breaks any reasonable line works|pg||
nt|roswolf: still he has to plan for a rainy day|pg||
nt|bobholl: he has only 9 tricks if everything breaks without a @D ruff so i guess he'll try that|pg||
nt|bobholl: gib says 11 tricks but he sees 52 cards (just like we :))|pg||

nt|azwer46: Ehsan this brd has yet to be played at the other table|pg||
nt|ehsana: AZWER Thanks we ALL know THAT :)|pg||
nt|robdonk: do you know how manny board's they play ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|azwer46: how cd u say no imps?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brotherp: simple 4@s game now; players will be gratefull|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: a hand to "rest" the brain cells |pg||
nt|sybarra: but maybe not|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|mango joe: Indian pair stayed low here|pg||
nt|ehsana: raed the words will happen..I will simplify it|pg||
nt|suketbombi: azwer he has been paul the octopus here:)|pg||
nt|azwer46: :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: funny approach by van Prooyen; not opening a weak 2 then bidding in a much more dangerous situation|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: one more effective strategy in recovery matches is the use of PENALTY X|pg||
nt|azwer46: right|pg||
nt|psridhar: a couple of speculative penalty X can bring more return than just the imps |pg||
nt|azwer46: this brd may give a few to India|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a failed penalty X does not increase their lead 2 much ( assuming no XX of course)|pg||
nt|mango joe: he may go more than 2 off by winning in dummy & playing @h to K, his only chance|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sumit was close to a penlaty X here but (1) auction was too confident (2) no trump trick- but if he had chanced he might hv won 6|pg||
nt|mango joe: @hs 3-2 with A onside & trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|mango joe: but @S pips are no good for that play|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he wasnt sure of   1@S-2@S range,  i  gathered thatmuch from querry he made before final pass.|pg||
nt|ehsana: yes they should grab when a  chance offered|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: I would guess at plenty, as they are keen on bridge in the Netherlands|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|h5|nt|brotherp: still @sA will be played|pg||

nt|sybarra: *one hope|pg||

nt|brotherp: or go easy and take his 50's|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does e/w play nt|pg||
nt|brotherp: after a strong nt by east that seems the likely outcome|pg||
nt|brotherp: if ew play weak nt we might see Louk bidding @H first :>|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: something went wrong here I think.. NW talking to director|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: it's something with the bridgemate and the scores...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mango joe: only @H ruff beats this game, found at other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: some "action" here now|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|robdonk: yep, 3@D looks a good result |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with at least 12 tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ehsana: heart ruff is omenous now after 1H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: u will get a 2nd chance for @h ruff even if not found on lead -if @c king is led rt?|pg||
nt|mango joe: no trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|mango joe: has to be led|pg||
nt|brotherp: modern texas bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|robdonk: and 12 in NT :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brotherp: was never a great fan of that - imo you should always bid a direct 4@H/4@S as natural|pg||
nt|brotherp: so Verhees went easy - and rightly so|pg||
nt|sybarra: but then the wrong hand may be playing it |pg||
pc|d6|nt|robdonk: nice bid by Berend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I find the pass of 3 diamonds x in the OR surprising|pg||
nt|robdonk: agree, but penalty is penalty:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mango joe: no defense now|pg||
nt|psridhar: ok bhabesh will find out soon|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: its a penalty?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mango joe: the play isnt clearcut though is it?|pg||
nt|brotherp: yeah; well u reserve 4@C/4@D as old-fashioned texas so you can place the contract where you want|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S doubles, it "gives the hand away"  they may playa 4 nt |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|robdonk: yes i think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes but maybe west needs spade hook to make this|pg||
nt|brotherp: is there room for a trump-coup or?|pg||
nt|brotherp: lets see|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|brotherp: over take the @H; now C!J i think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is complicated, no question|pg||
nt|brotherp: thats @cJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mango joe: now cant go wrong|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|dJ|nt|wilkinsona: well, the x is surprising then|pg||
nt|brotherp: vd Bos knows south only holds 2@d so|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: though it fails that lead could easily have been right in a diff layout-perhaps if he had known about @c length with his pd -say on fit jump 2@h-he wd hv found the killer lead|pg||
nt|brotherp: playing for the @s finesse to discard a diamond |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|azwer46: friendly fire|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mango joe: that is a good play, the duck|pg||
pc|d9|nt|azwer46: agreed friendly enough|pg||
nt|mango joe: theres always @H to 9 of course|pg||
nt|mango joe: but not needed|pg||
nt|mango joe: he sint claiming in case East leads another @D- not likely|pg||
nt|mango joe: Bhabesh will conclude that the only hope is AQ@H with Sumit|pg||
nt|ehsana: Bhabeshs thinking now is a bit late |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as specs point out a few lines seem to work, so south right not to double, at any rate|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: Im not sure of the strength of the opening 1NT, but perhaps west could have bid more|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: small break till next round|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: hi Rob|pg||
nt|robdonk: Hi Ireen:)|pg||
nt|robdonk: Ireentje|pg||

pc|d7|nt|sybarra: not=now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is not right though|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is if S ruffs this |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a spade exit gives the defence 4 tricks|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|suketbombi: what?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: now this is the sort of luck u need in recovery matches-the system played by NS decided the level of @H partial at both tables and India seems to have gotton lucky|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course only if 2@H makes|pg||
nt|brotherp: on their way to 7 - if East gets the chance to bid 6@C as a sort of suit-help try|pg||
nt|brotherp: strange - no 4@d?|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this looks like a 2/1 auction, when south will be interested, and 4 hearts may be last train|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south atempting to enquire about the club situation...|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2NT=waiting for more info.|pg||
nt|brgpro: N shd realize that since pd didnt ask for KC, he didnt really care, so she shdn't worry about her lack of key cards|pg||

nt|brgpro: she might be worried that S might be say 5-5-2-1, then her @cKQ will be wasted |pg||
nt|brgpro: but then S won't bid 2NT in his 3rd turn|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|azwer46: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: so if pd has 54M, then she could see 12|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that is surely not the case, as there is an easy 5 club bid|pg||
mb|5H|nt|brgpro: dont think S can bid any more...i will call director|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: decides, it seems that club ace may have been required...|pg||
nt|robdonk: Yes, S has a problem with the long thinking of 5 @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: for me, the easiest way to get to slam is via RKC, |pg||
nt|sybarra: and see if e/w run out of pass cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: They didnt ask anything|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: someone said to me that without asking for KC, it is always uncertain to bid a slam.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|psridhar: both the previous session India made poor suit / weak hand Overcalls all day and Pakistan kept gaining.....now surely Masood was watching ?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the "known" club singleton in S |pg||
nt|brotherp: in a natural system this wld be fairly simple also i guess: after 1@s - 2@h south can almost ask for aces|pg||

nt|brotherp: paulissen is a strict believer in 2th/4th ..so the club-finesse was likely on-side|pg||
nt|brotherp: from the out-side i really dont like the 3@H bid; the west-hand not that suit or @H oriented|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry was afraid of 4@S if he bid 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Bob |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it appears that west thought the 4 clubs bid showed more, rather than just cursory support|pg||
nt|brotherp: but then one cant play the ideal system every hand; so maybe Frans didnt have any other options|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi Tony |pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: waiting for the next round|pg||

nt|sybarra: lucky we have Weibe joining us  |pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: the result are at: www.bridge.nl |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we started the set |pg||
nt|brotherp: still - ending up in 6@C - seemed possible after this start; west can see the 2th @s disappearing on the @hsuit|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recalled, I needed to brush up on my dutch for that site|pg||
