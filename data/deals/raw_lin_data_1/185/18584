nt|barnets: welcome to the final for USA 2|pg||
mb|1H|nt|barnets: for the seniors world championship|pg||
mb|2H|nt|barnets: Lynch lost their match yesterday V Schwartz but have another chance today|pg||
nt|barnets: east bid michaels at least 5M +5+minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Both pairs discussing whether P-P-1@H-1@s-2@c should be Drury - Sutherlin finally said "I'm going to open the bidding so it won't apply on this hand"|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|barnets: like that thanks nice:)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Ira Chorush|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sutherlin had put his cards in his pocket while waiting and then had to look for them before bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: Hi Ira roland|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chorush: Hi Barnet|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sutherlin: What kind of signals? Kasle: "standard"|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chorush: Sutherlin likes this lead since it will allow him to make this contract|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like 5 losers here|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry|pg||
nt|barnets: there were 5 losers at start|pg||
nt|chorush: He had 5 losers but the opening lead which seems entirely natural allows him to dispose of a diamond|pg||

nt|Walddk3: uncheck  invisible before you re-enter|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe we can start|pg||
nt|007 joosth: many would open 1H maybe  but I prefer 1C|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like we are almost ready, Wold Bates play Precision Club, Std approach for NS|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Detroit even*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In the other room E/W were a bit too enthusiastic about the hand|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 31  not 46??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi kit -- sorry to see you here as commentator|pg||
nt|ady: 5-0 spade split spoils a reasonable 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: hi Kit|pg||
nt|kit: I think 4@S might survive the 5-0 split -- not sure|pg||
nt|ady: yes possibly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i still think it is strange to play board 31|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that's what's at the other table too|pg||
nt|kit: didn't the play 1-30?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php or http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  this is 3rd set not 4th|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Al is thinking about the civil war I just heard   thats to much at the same time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 teams were decided last set   USA1 Seniors   Schwartz-Finkel Wolff-Morse Hamilton-Fisher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 Women  Moss-Radin Stansby-Campanile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: congrats to both teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner of our match will play 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch to determine Senior USA2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA2 Women Final has already started - it is 96 boards |pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|kit: hi|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: wrong boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait    EW play a form of Precision  NT strength varies 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  "multi" 2@D, Flannery 2@H   transfers over 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ady: thx Al|pg||
nt|ady: hand 31 looks interesting|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes sure|pg||
nt|007 joosth: S should play the diamonds before E can discard 1 of them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in 4S|pg||
nt|ady: yes    but not easy to work that out at the table|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well tr 1 haert  tr 2 spade  then you see it?|pg||
nt|friggi: nothing is easy to work out at the table:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  carding upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well the coffe sometimes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: coffee:)|pg||
nt|friggi: right, mist that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Steve Robinson used to have card that announced upside-down facial expressions  but that was before screens|pg||
nt|ady: but playing diamonds early   losing to the king and cashing 2 more before ruffing a heart high is very difficult|pg||
nt|kit: I think once declarer sees the 5-0 split he is forced to assume East has 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure but I think he can work it out|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: basically lose spade hook, win return, lose diamond hook, win club hook, and crossruff|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: Danger if defense can get East in with jack of clubs for third round of spades|pg||
nt|ady: but cash diamonds beffore ruffing a heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play a form of Precision  1N opener's 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS high tech 2/1   2@D=weak 2@H/@S  2@H=flannery  2@S=constructive|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude     |pg||
nt|kirp:  Here we have Lynch-Passell with precision Club, Boyd-Robinson are 5-card majors with Multi 2 @D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|007 joosth: yes indeed that J may be the winner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final set of the USA2 "SemiFinal"  loser goes home  winner plays 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch who lost in USA1 final to Schwartz|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS also play Flannery 2@H with intermediate 2@S bid|pg||
nt|kit: Over 1@H opening, Passell might bid Michaels if available, or just overcall 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|007 joosth: precision I suppose?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6+@C 10-15 |pg||
nt|ady: would not wager on making|pg||
nt|kit: they will certainly get to 4@S now -- Robinson will show Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i hear other table began to bid,  then the auction disappeared|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H overcall may help a little|pg||
nt|007 joosth: rubensohl or lebensohl maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is showing now as 1N-2@D[one major]|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S i the destination|pg||
nt|friggi: is|pg||
nt|kit: they play transfer Lebensohl -- I forget the exact coding which shows Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice board to start with if you make 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: is this 14-16 no-trump?|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk3: we can't have a broadcast with invisible operators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw last set that side 5-card major isn't a deterent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S max of 15 HCP  [ew play a form of precision]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might start with DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong again al|pg||
nt|kit: this is Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  3@D=4@S, no stop|pg||
nt|kit: will be interesting if Bates overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Now or we shall have to boot you|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hello  all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a side 6-card major isn't a deterent...  clubs just have to be the primary suit|pg||
nt|friggi: sameo:)|pg||
nt|barnets: a bidding misunderstanding in open|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson should have gone for the throat and passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  2@C would have been sort of takout, maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably right Martin   very common to use same convention after 1N overcall as over 1N opener|pg||
nt|kirp:  why not open 3@C to begin with?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less common to have a 3@C bid over 1N overcall when you couldn't open 3@C|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry n/s in 4@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|007 joosth: D  ?  !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you type faster :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Hi    e     missing in Westheimer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo, south opened|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no something else wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The boards in the Vugraph are wrong.  Bear with us a few minutes.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: (bare)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry -- have to restart|pg||
nt|barnets: little better but notmuch !|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H looks like decent spot for N-S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: I used to play this structure, but it has been a while so I forgot the exact coding|pg||
mb|3H|nt|friggi: pass pass|pg||
nt|kit: Here Robinson will bid 3NT I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: once in a while they make this  but not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ady: may  well need to play a club early|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other room 5@CX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you think Peter had a way to offer COG  [i.e. show 4@S AND good @H stops]|pg||
nt|007 joosth: knowing 5 or 6 hearts left makes it easier to play for diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|ady: has been warned the heart position|pg||
nt|kit: I think it will go heart lead, spade hook, spade back, club up, and key will be if Bates ducks|pg||
nt|friggi: club early is auto play|pg||
nt|kit: Although East can pitch a diamond on third heart, and that will defeat contract|pg||
nt|santyclz: The expected response to the balancing x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Dbl was probably negative|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: Fortunately Robinson with 6 hearts pretty much had to bid 3@H, so the balance worked well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe big swing?|pg||
nt|kit: so it looks like down 1|pg||
nt|ady: must wait  before ruffing a heart|pg||
nt|kit: defense can play 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|kit: so must play diamonds before losing lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|007 joosth: with that singl of clubs  a spade may be better but N can have the diamond ace|pg||
nt|friggi: @C 10 now|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 5 possible trix on defense|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: and that is pretty double-dummy|pg||
nt|kit: And a winning opening lead -- club lead would have let the contract make|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|ady: very difficult contract  needs almost to play double dummy  playing a low diamond from hand early|pg||
nt|friggi: but no need to play trump, full control in all suits|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when W is in with ace of clubs will he know that E has a 3d heart?|pg||
nt|friggi: the key is @C Aces on side|pg||
nt|kit: He might not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room same contract and lead from internal sequence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi|pg||
pc|dK|nt|friggi: so play @C as early as possible|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will win and lead a club -- and Bates will have to do something right|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  cool...more commentators than specs:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  This will make, I think, 3@C might have been down 4|pg||
nt|kirp:  doesn't look like N can set up a squeeze position, tho W may not be sure of E' distribution|pg||
nt|kit: squeeze would be possible, but critical entry has to be wasted for the heart play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfe: I've lost the play.  Will just enter results on this board.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: take 10 and run or is there a chance for more?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kirp:  actually 3 down on best defense|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hello all   |pg||
nt|kirp:  no squeeze now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|007 joosth: this is nog good|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he needs 2 high ruffs|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|nt|kit: hi got his diamond play early, but I think he needed to save his high spade spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: I am just pointing out all things eaq...play @C as soon as possible-basta|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: I think once playing a trump early could not make|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: After taking his winners, Passell must return a spade, not a club or diamond, to break up squeeze|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  good afternoon all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|007 joosth: spade and then club i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi Andy   wlc|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi andy|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in my opinion W had a big overbid with only 3 trumps and not much extra|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Walter, Joost and Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bruce Ferguson finding a different route to down 1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|007 joosth: but in this tempo E will not be down  today|pg||
nt|007 joosth: would N be afraid that S does not have the ace?   maybe|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kirp:  club should be auto here|pg||
nt|kit: He will find it, since distribution is known when Lynch shows out on the diamond|pg||
nt|kit: if he leads a club, squeeze will work|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room Kasle led the @c k.|pg||
mc|8|nt|kirp:  @Ds have to be 41|pg||
pg||

nt|chorush: NS have to avoid a slam which is on a finesse. EW, not vul can take quite a few tricks in their red suit fits|pg||
nt|barnets: except for a club loser and the @HA|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|barnets: leading the @HA wont help delcarer|pg||
mb|2S|nt|barnets: as the discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|chorush: EW can take 10 tricks in diamonds and 9 in hearts so they have a cheap save at any level|pg||
nt|barnets: so par is 6@DX|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chorush: yes; lets see if par is achieved|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: good morning Henry|pg||
nt|barnets: dont much like west x|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: he should have bid with a fit in both partners uits|pg||
nt|barnets: at least 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: not making a defensive bid is way too cautious|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|barnets: east had a choice between 1 and 2N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hayden & Kozlove had written some notes, but I couldn't quite read - K may not have been certain about 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|barnets: after passing|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||

nt|andyv:  can NS compete in @cs here|pg||
nt|kirp:  Operator pls enter a result|pg||
nt|kirp:  found the @S play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: heart lead beats 4@S|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 more 4S with cards badly placed|pg||
mb|1C|nt|007 joosth: 1000  again    wished the score would be my fee  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing Puppet  does Robinson bid?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will have to pass, as they play Puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is last set for USA1 Seniors    2 more sets tonight for USA2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal   [3rd vul 1N=15-17]|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|007 joosth: sort of micheals cuebid showing both majors  |pg||
nt|kirp:  EW eschew 2D as a pre-empt|pg||
nt|007 joosth: many play 2C as natural here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice word Martin   eschew|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  King's English|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hoped to learn some english here:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  how many spades by E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some take it a step further  after nebulous 1@D [like precision]  2@D=nat  2@H=weak michaels|pg||
nt|kirp:  after cashing 1@D and 1@H, Passell could have played one black suit and still had time for the 2nd try|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will be thinking about slam when Boyd shows spade support|pg||
nt|santyclz: 10 viewgraph tables running now, to watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
nt|kit: 1@H response shows spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: if Bates makes neg response, will be played by East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Kit   i should have left that to you :)|pg||
nt|kit: However the Gods of Puppet will save him, as 1NT is fine even with the 4-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs please note   there are Gods [plural] of Puppet|pg||
nt|barnets: you can beat thuis double dummy|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps they don't save him this time -- the defenders are 1 step ahead in the race|pg||
nt|barnets: by east shifting to the @DJ|pg||
nt|kirp:  Mike has a nice hand for this auction|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson needs 3 keycards plus queen of clubs to make slam -- too much to hope for with minimum opener|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@H probably inv+ @C|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows minimum opener with 4 spades|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: in other room, bates led trump|pg||
nt|007 joosth: H seems ok 2 me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just reporting the fact  --   i'm positive i'm not sure which is better/best|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but ot here with that singl of clubs may be. |pg||
nt|kit: I have no idea why Passell bid 3@D instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  maybe they treat dble as takeout of 1@S, |pg||
nt|kit: assuming it is takeout of spades, why wouldn't he bid 3@H?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Assuming x shows @hs, perhaps 3@d is a mixed raise.|pg||
nt|kirp:  thinks he is setting up a save possibility?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  Cindy Bernstein and Sally Wheeler sitting EW|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not|pg||
nt|baldfriede: operator, what was the result in board 1?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4 s by north down 2--cant enter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when both of opp suits known [michaels for @H & @S, unusual NT for 2 lowest]  you have 2 cue bids to show the other suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 18-19|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps as a safety play -- if doubled, can run to hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Lynch can seriously consider saving with that hand at favorable|pg||
nt|kit: But Robinson will compete to 5@S then, I think|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: certain to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 2 chances to shift |pg||
nt|kirp:  6 is a good save|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  they play a 12-14 NT |pg||
nt|ady: south may not lead a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  neither side can attack @ds, so 3 rounds of @hs may allow declarer to bring this home|pg||
nt|007 joosth: looks nice but H lead still to expect?|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd willlikely lead club, and Robinson will have to guess which red suit to return|pg||
nt|kit: However, East may duck 2 rounds of spades, and then if declarer shifts to hearts I believe he will make|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will probably double with his square hand, but Robinson should pull I think|pg||
nt|kirp:  Mike was trying to buy this hand at 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=21&task=list|pg||
nt|hackenbush: for players list and system summary forms|pg||
nt|kirp:  Wonder if they will go to slam, dont think it makes without help|pg||
nt|kirp:  And knew he had a dble fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there are 2 ways to play    low for 4th suit or low for lowest suit    [1st better theoretically,  latter more common]|pg||
nt|kirp:  methods vary as to strength, some Qs are GF, others are invit|pg||
nt|kit: Wold did very well to not be ducking|pg||
nt|kit: But the diamond shift will have to come from him, and that may not be so obvious|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D may be a good save, but they won't take it|pg||
nt|kirp:  Excellent for EW|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: "can"  better read as "should"|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|friggi: @H lead is screaming|pg||
nt|kit: and 5@D is a much better save|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  this may not prove to be a success|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: Another value of having strong hand declare|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- that ends the defense|pg||
nt|ady: thats torn it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no double after 2H  so that lead is nor probabble?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|007 joosth: they continue doing the impossible:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, neither side SHOULD....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems after the lead  kit had a lot of options -- all bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best switch would have been a @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @d entry, it seems that declarer can just go after @ss now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like that will lead to 2@S 2@H 2@D for -1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kirp:  no argument from here, just pointing out how dble fits work for a lot of trix|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  I don't understand this sequence chosed by EW so can't comment on it|pg||
nt|chick: I just checked the summary card and there is nothing there either|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing invite with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like on Bd 1, O'Rourke picked up 5 imps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: maybe a combination of stripsqueeze and endplay to makeslam|pg||
nt|kirp:  Possible if S pitches a H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would at least make another try with East's hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  No @C Q-bid by W should slow him down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: at other table a @c lead helped making 6@s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs moderate care to make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bidding in OR suggested a @C lead!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: but now i bet on defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks almost no matter what |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: trying to find 3/3 clubs first|pg||
nt|friggi: ??? W @H was transfer - so the rule is lead the othe M if no other info tells you other wise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: chambers opened 2@C!!      against 4@S  Ferguson led @C but Drew Casen played the @C7|pg||
nt|ady: may be a swing for Orourke|pg||
nt|kit: but he did have info -- no double of 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: hardly likely to double 2@H with QXXX|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think q as game force too small of a target |pg||
nt|kirp:  This is a pick up for EW, as 4@S dbled in CR|pg||
nt|friggi: @H lead was obvious|pg||
nt|kirp:  Actually @ds is 1 trick better than @Hs|pg||
nt|kirp:  N can get a @D ruff|pg||
pc|c7|nt|007 joosth: small H  I think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kirp:  Focus on S, good lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: I cannot agree heart lead obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i had a $ for every point lost after making an obvious lead|pg||
nt|friggi: bad def|pg||
nt|kit: well, I think club lead is obvious -- needs less in partner's hand|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson hoping opponents will have discarding problems|pg||
nt|kit: Bates dumped his worthless hearts -- that should be the clue for Wold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone having some problems   except dummy|pg||

mb|1D|nt|henryb:  After 1@d-1@h-1@s-2@h should South bid 3@d on minimum values but a great suit?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|barnets: Passell bid 3@D in same position|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: I would bid 3@D|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  And then what should Sutherlin bid? We see 3N is successful, but hard not to rebid that spade suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 4@s is down a few|pg||
nt|chorush: I like dbl from Sutherlin's hand|pg||
nt|barnets: North knows his partner has at most 2 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps he should have bid 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: as his suit will not play well|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: 3 spades is an overstaement of his spades and an understaement of his values|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: declarer can save 1 trick by leading the @S 10 from hand|pg||
nt|barnets: and passing it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  could do even better by pulling to the cold 4N|pg||
pc|d6|nt|barnets: north couldhave been a hero and ran to 4N|pg||
nt|chorush: Declarer may choose to pass the spade 8. that wins against stiff 4 and stiff 3 in West while the 10 wins only against stiff 9|pg||
nt|barnets: East can hop @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: and put partner in twice|pg||
nt|barnets: with clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: that means east scores 3 trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

nt|baldfriede: is there some problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no, restroom break|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time for prediction   Bates opens  2@D=11-15 HCP  4415 minus 1 card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like it would have been reasonable here too  but Chambers didn't like 4333|pg||
nt|kit: Make the lead which defeats the contract|pg||
nt|kirp:  Lynch has started out fast|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the Lynch team opens up an early lead.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hackenbush: different NT range allowed the open room to diagnose the @s weakness and reach 5@c|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1H - 1S - 1Nt  i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: is this 1D  today?|pg||
nt|ady: led a club in OR last hand    north played the 7|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can go for 1-level penalty, or just get to 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: looked like 9 tricks for the taking agree specs|pg||
nt|kirp:  except had Axx in @S, opponents had 8 or likely 9 of them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3NT should be in N then pls|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like more action possible|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  nobody wanted to play a simple 4@h:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they might play a penalty double over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well done :)|pg||
nt|kit: And now, does Bates lead his partner's suit?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: however will not be made anyway?|pg||
nt|kit: Even if he does, defense has to get a second chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time too good for 2@D opener??|pg||
nt|kit: They will likely get to 4@S down 1|pg||
nt|kirp:  Yup, 3N is cold|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT is the winner|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joost and Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was flip a coin country|pg||
nt|kit: possible swing here, as fortunate 4@S makes -- I think|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: heart queen lead if cindy passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen 5@C North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like his chances either|pg||
nt|007 joosth: d lead and spade switch  I will give applaus|pg||
nt|kit: on diamond lead, East will not win the trick|pg||
nt|barnets: rather lucky though|pg||
nt|kit: Now Robinson has a difficult problem|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S isn't forcing.  He might double, but that is risky.  Or he might find winning 3NT call.|pg||
nt|kirp:  N knows S has at most 2 @S?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  their card confirms 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  E guessed the N's major was not @ss|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dull as long they are not in 5 again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 11-13|pg||
nt|kirp:  N here prob. cant redble as that shows honour in @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd won't be expecting his partner has a 5-card major and didn't bid|pg||
nt|kit: therefore, he leads his partner's 5-card diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: could have been though, S had 4|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|friggi: duck is manadatory|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so does Boyd try to sneak thru a @S?|pg||
nt|kit: right, and Boyd might have singleton spade, so Robinson not too keen on playing in spades|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson means this as choice of games apparently, but I think Boyd will think it is RKC for diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  Now 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: 10 tricks in nt so it's not too late.|pg||
nt|kit: So I predict Boyd will bid 5@D, 2 with the queen|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of defensive tricks in the 2 suits bid by NS|pg||
nt|kirp:  S also now has more easy non-@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or RDBL is transfer   but don't think anybody plays it as days of old  where RDBL=points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does he lead @D or @C?|pg||
nt|kirp:  pick me for points on rdble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming Bates PASS|pg||
nt|kit: 1 spade thru doesn't do the job|pg||
nt|kit: I think his best bet is to run the clubs -- if he does something else, the hand will be a readout|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: how did E signal?|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D  still not enough|pg||
nt|kit: if he doesn't lead clubs the defense will know the clubs are running and will know what they have to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Zia play a @H?|pg||
nt|kit: they play udca, so East discouraged in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: <heavy sarcasm>|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@D in case 9x|pg||
nt|kirp:  I dont like 4H bid by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|irwinbo: was 3 d really three clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  spade is my pick!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: come to think of it -- in context of limited 1@D -- would you make neg dbl with west hand??|pg||
nt|kit: Or maybe he was just choosing diamonds -- he had both bases covered|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: i suspect we see Cohen work diamonds next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i was going to vote for the @C4...  but i think i'll change to the @D6 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the result as we see it operator ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  not worth it|pg||
nt|kit: no need to play a heart -- could blow contract if ace is onside|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N rated to be better, let them cash 5@C if they can|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, forgot to cash heart|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays Q@D    thats 8 tricks   wont make a 9th   defence obvious|pg||
nt|friggi: low @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention of Smith for EW|pg||
nt|kit: defense can now count declarer's tricks -- so they will play for what is necessary |pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kozlove didn't opposite unlimited opener|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like E can make this easily on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may be playing transfers where 3@D would be stayman|pg||
nt|kit: Spade shift will beat it 2, but I think Passell will shift to heart|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kirp:  really is a poor neg dble|pg||
nt|kit: I still think running clubs is best -- West might not hold enough hearts|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the wholle problem began with a diamond overcall which i dont like|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer has stiff diamond that may be necessary|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: an interesting switch|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kirp:  ill-judged maybe is more polite|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wow|pg||
nt|friggi: low|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is makeable from here, but unlikely at the table imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diplomatic   as all bridge players are|pg||
nt|kit: in addition, down 1 less at worst|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest: in the other room, they played 2@s when south chose to raise instead of bidding 1NT: a very plausible alternative|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hackenbush: ah, EW one of few pairs to have submitted a convention card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense needed to shift to spades after second heart ducked|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/docs/2011uswbc/acblcards/PollackBjerkan.bmp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however disa should not have discarded a diamond, if in fact she did|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wonder if east's 2nt would be the winning bid in the bridge world   many would double|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks still hard to beat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about  neg dbl got what it deserved|pg||
nt|kit: Unfortunately, dummy had partner's 5-card diamond suit|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: likely finesse |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: but no thought to leading @S?    North figures to have exactly 4 [pull w/5]  and South exactly 2  [pass w/3]|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: very nice start from Chambers|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't like leading from broken 4-card suits...  to costly in the long run|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: Bates covered in case Cohen only had 10x of spades and Wold had 8xx left|pg||
nt|kirp:  got the ruff anyway, another strong result|pg||
mc|9|nt|andyv:  NS have no response to final 3 tricks for EW.  In hindsight, S probably wished she'd led a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like leading     period|pg||

nt|barnets: they are in 3N in closed\|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 180 the hard way|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder where other room lost 4th defensive trick|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S doubled at other table, so actually Kasle will pick up IMPs|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|007 joosth: E will never be on lead. so Kx of clubs stay protected|pg||
nt|joest: treating his hand as too big for an initial 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Jacobus opened 1N|pg||
nt|barnets: 28 card suits unusual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: am i counting correctly   TWO 8-card suits|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H opening is Flannery|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  on board 34, 5@c was made in OR, slicing the lead to 13 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   [1st/2nd and not vul 3rd]|pg||
nt|friggi: red cross:)|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd has difficult problem -- how high does he go?|pg||
nt|santyclz: And led the @d so he later got a ruff and his trump promoted for -2.|pg||

nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|fabsayc: was a very poor effort|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h probably shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can understand it with so many controls|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will certainly double|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson will bid 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: quick attack on transportation|pg||
nt|kit: This will be a normal 2@H contract, which is probably down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicating other room auction|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing East bid 2@d instead of North|pg||
nt|sybarra: suport X |pg||
nt|kit: this is an asking bid -- not sure of the coding of the responses they are using|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good guess Howard:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kirp:  Bit of a hand hog|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: J of diamonds may be the entry for club tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter  do you use coded 10/9 leads in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  a hand where almost all finesses are off|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not sure that was best choice, reasonable but @S also possible|pg||
nt|kirp:  However this looks like it should go down 2 trix at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right Kit   1@D-1@H//1@S-2@H//end|pg||
nt|friggi: kit is alws right:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: so they are playing puppet|pg||
nt|kirp:  probably 4513, so best chance is 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: suspect we missed a pass|pg||
nt|kit: Passell has difficult lead -- diamond lead may let declarer make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hackenbush: could be gazilli but nothing much on their system summary form|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=838&pid=607|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm guessing that 2@d was xfer to @hs showing a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that's more likely, if 2@c and 2@h not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Two diamonds was alerted by West but not by East.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: referring to Stewart's @S shift|pg||
nt|007 joosth: might be 1/3 lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  we use something thats referred to as foster returns|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd from garbage?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  when dummy has small cards we lead second highest unless we want partner to do some high banging|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @s suit of N does not look very inviting though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe that's a documented rule|pg||
nt|kit: Bates will probably try to cash ace of clubs, hoping it is his partner with the singleton|pg||
nt|kit: But leading from AJxx when declarer has suit stopped is pretty poor IMO|pg||
nt|kirp:  W knows S had Â¨Ds covered, what else, @S|pg||
nt|kirp:  maybe|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should lead a spade, yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|007 joosth: as in other room no puppet here|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bit undervalued by N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you like 2N over 2@S?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think declarer should take quick pitch here -- I would win (not with ace) and lead a heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which hi level bidder more likely to be short?   |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kirp:  NV game so maybe not worth the push|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|joest: actually you can't determine that by a 3@s rebid :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed:)|pg||
nt|joest: so this presents the ninth trick but the contract is always cold just by keeping east off lead, for overtricks even|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems strange  but the possible entry has gone|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be a push around the room |pg||
nt|kirp:  Just that someone needs to push, not both|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is part of why i play big club|pg||
nt|kirp:  good chance pard has 4@S so why not|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will be going after hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kirp:  I play bigger club|pg||
nt|kit: now he might try a spade -- not clear|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson now has to decide between stiff club lead and 4-0 trump split|pg||
nt|kit: now he has a claim -- 8 diamonds, 1 spade, 1 heart, 1 club|pg||
pc|h8|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades may even make 5   she will probably make 4 hearts here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|007 joosth: not the lead at 4S  :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  True, except it does not give up anything, club lead might|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could have doubled 3@D, 3@H was a bit much|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 9 tricks for the taking|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kirp:  why would you want S on lead, with N's hand?|pg||
nt|kirp:  @H is actually safe|pg||
nt|kirp:  dummy has only 1 entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Dx real killer|pg||
nt|kit: But Lynch will be returning 8 of diamonds -- then 6 of diamonds will save the defense|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: this hand does not merit much thought, are we still here|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think she is worried about a 4-1 heart break andbeing tapped in dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck one heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the club players who automatically false card here with @DA   that's actually a give away   by winning Q  south doesn't know who has @DK|pg||
nt|kit: very difficult for defense to find the club shift, but they will have enough time since North has doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|kirp:  still looks like 1 down, assuming W is careful in @ds|pg||
nt|kit: Passell knows hearts aren't running, so he doesn't need to panic|pg||
nt|kirp:  may even lead @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: not may -- will lead hearts.  He knows that with 3 hearts Boyd wouldn't have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|kirp:  i have learned never to say 'will'|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kirp:  still 5 trix|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: are we stuck or is S thinking?|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N here was pretty easy, though 3@d trix available to defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this may soon turn into NT play |pg||
nt|kirp:  so in theory, 3n can be beat|pg||
nt|kirp:  in OR, played by N, it would have been harder to beat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can defense take 3@D if they play the suit?  looks frozen to me|pg||
nt|kit: you gotta believe|pg||
nt|kirp:  i agree, Mike knew S only had 1 @d stopper, with 3@Hs no question of which game|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|ady: heart play looks against the odds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe S will play a diamond?|pg||
nt|friggi: right but you have to be creative|pg||
nt|kit: 9 of spades shows not much in spades, but Boyd doesn't know for sure where king of diamond is -- he may think Robinson has that and Wold the club strength|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  west on lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  meanwhile, 2s is playing well, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if not quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer doesn't know if @CK doubleton or singleton    probably the former|pg||
nt|kirp:  so what, cross to 10@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i'm thinking   but i'm in a loop|pg||
nt|kirp:  cant make more than 4, 3 or 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so working on not making 1 :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kirp:  2 is virtually assured|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: not necissarily bad however, EW can make 4@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  this is for 4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kirp:  could be down 3 now i think|pg||
pc|h9|nt|007 joosth: no risk  with clubs open|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Also, 9 of spades might have been from K109|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  you loosened them up, Cornelia|pg||
nt|chick: guess so :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfe: Pollack was thinking.|pg||
nt|kit: will Passell cash out, or go for more with spade shift?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: knowing south holds 3 or 4@S a very reasonable choice|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: and now 5@C from Stewart|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must have some spades mixed in with his clubs :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Woolsey has the same thought i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=0/1 controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS can make lots of @Ds|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hackenbush: NS play precision|pg||
nt|joest: third seat a good four card major is a possibility|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 5C as expected|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S liekly to be reached   should be down 1 with diamond wrong|pg||
nt|kit: Wold has normal neg double -- Boyd will raise -- not clear how high|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: tons of pressure now.  Rosenberg could just grab it with 3NT but that's a big statement|pg||
nt|joest: but if he makes a 'responsive double' or some such they are probably headed to 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: 5@C|pg||
nt|kirp:  solved a tuff hand with invit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wish USBF could require submission of Convention Cards for their trials -- not sure how many @D promised by Schermer's 1@D :(|pg||
nt|kirp:  3@D bid is intersting, would you play this as weak?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|007 joosth: 3NT seems best|pg||
nt|friggi: J from nothing else from 2|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd won't introduce his heart suit now|pg||
nt|kirp:  how about sneaky club suit, E pitched a low club, not a high spade on 3rd @h|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C call pretty conservative -- looks more like 3@C call to me|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: wonder what Casen would bid over  3@C-4@S-5@C-?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: an 800 point gift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus in action again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 11-13|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N anyone by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: takes teh pressure off partner which is always appreciated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|kit: And 4@S will be reached, which should go down on decent defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  guess not opposite passed pard|pg||
nt|kit: If Robinson passes Lynch can try 3@D, and then auction will liven up|pg||
mb|3N|nt|007 joosth: club finesse is needed  after that at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: Wold knows where the spade king is (or thinks he does)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  he may be right:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing Eddie leads a @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this lead and auction should help Wheeler pick up trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: both partners seem to have been ticketed for speeding here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 5 down even?|pg||
nt|kirp:  he counts points|pg||
nt|kit: Down 2 on stiff diamond lead, as declarer must finesse to try to make|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit  would you ever consider bidding NT instead of the neg dbl with that awful @H suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand 4@D bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he get out for 800?|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: such as swap @CK and @Sx|pg||
nt|kit: wow!|pg||
nt|kirp:  That may steal the board|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't anticipate that!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||
nt|joest: 4 hearts + 4 diamonds + 1 club = 9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when it's about avertricks he can better start clubs immediately|pg||
nt|007 joosth: overtricks    i think:)|pg||
nt|kit: big swing on opening lead here |pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfe: South and West having lengthy discussion about 4D bid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director has been called.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Bernstein, Westheimer, and director have gone off for a long discussion on other side of room.|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|007 joosth: but it was only a 3d hand opening......|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|friggi: declarer must play for the fin - if he want to make the game:)|pg||
nt|friggi: wants|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  4@S   open room   diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer-Chambers 2@H/@S openers are intermediate  10-13|pg||
nt|kit: Bates "knows" the lead is likely a singleton, but he will still finesse just in case|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: not much here so i'm wondering if 6@D can make after @H @H|pg||
nt|kirp:  client happily raised to 5@Ds using point count methods|pg||
nt|kirp:  only via a backwards finesse in @S|pg||
nt|kit: No kidding -- difference between making and down 3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|baldfriede: no way to reach W's @s, hence it will make|pg||

nt|kit: could be right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: cute since Robinson couldn't win with @C8  Wold knows Robinson's exact shape|pg||
nt|kirp:  N has work to do, not any more|pg||

nt|kit: 8 of diamonds suit-preference for hearts|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Flannery  4@S  5/6@H|pg||
nt|friggi: if it fails... try again|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes I already was looking why they did not make 4....|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will bid game|pg||

mb|2C|nt|007 joosth: thats better:)|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S can be beaten|pg||
nt|barnets: If the defence can lead or switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: auction will look funny|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  a hand that could have had some fireworks put quietly to bed with the 3@d preempt|pg||
nt|kit: Wold has a chance to be a hero with king of diamonds lead -- |pg||
mb|5C|nt|chick: playing in a 6-1 minor instead of a 6-2 major seems like a hole in the system|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of 2 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps @D and a major |pg||
nt|kirp:  almost any system except mine, where I played Texas after 1 D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this week we've seen a plethora of 8/9 card suits  and 11/12 card fits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: texas over 1@D   very cool treatment Martin|pg||
nt|kirp:  it was a strong club system|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: dubious 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR 3N was bid quickly, here more science|pg||
nt|barnets: In the other room a heart was led|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H call shows 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3 shape (raise)|pg||
nt|barnets: the 8|pg||
nt|barnets: west had to win and shift a dianond|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: a rather dull board 9 tricks  maybe defenders dont take their 4 tr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D game force checkback  [a guess]|pg||

nt|friggi: bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: but he duched the first heart|pg||

nt|warrens:  same, but no 2 passes to start|pg||
nt|ritong: just enter the final result, please|pg||
nt|kit: Good save, and E-W must double|pg||
mb|5H|nt|chick: I would not preempt with S's hand, too much chance partner has spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  but they will survive this one as there is no game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised Casen didn't either bid 2@S or make Support DBL??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I think he is confident with this 2H  Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, i know  @HAJ9x  screams defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt from N? |pg||
nt|kirp:  yup|pg||
nt|kit: I think king of diamonds lead is quite reasonable personally -- just need ace or queen in partner's hand, and if he doesn't have it, probably won't cost|pg||
nt|barnets: and then had no chance|pg||
nt|kit: and here, partner didn't double 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: actually pointed out dec can duck the diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This will be down 1, and should just about tie up the match|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 5@C goes 4 down|pg||
nt|kit: the save got a plus score -- that makes it a good save|pg||
nt|kirp:  A great save|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will enter final result when they finish|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C can go down 4 if defense cashes everything and exits with a trump -- otherwise, there will be an endplay|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  so this should go down 2|pg||
nt|chick: sounds about right|pg||
nt|kirp:  Note that 6@D s depends only on finding the Q and double finesse in @Ss|pg||
nt|barnets: that would cut communications|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|chorush: I will bet a coke that IF the bidding is accurate, the result is plus 100 to NS|pg||
nt|barnets: dangerous for kibitzers to speak i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Then Gaylor asks Garey "what was your hand" and Garey tells him and Sutherlin says "you could have played any diamond & made 4"|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|henryb:  this is one of the tricky situations. We can all see that 2@h is much better than 1N|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  But for many pairs if S bids 2@h now it shows extras|pg||

pc|h3|nt|henryb:  2@d is as good (as an imp contract) as 2@h|pg||

nt|barnets: for what its worth|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  which gets you to the 4-3 heart fit when partner has 4-4 in the majors|pg||

nt|barnets: thanks for pinting that out H but|pg||
nt|barnets: it does have other advantages|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 2@h over 1N, because I do not play that it shows extras|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm guessing about the play here, this is what dummy has and it looks to me as if Kozlove is the one thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: and when we have enough for game|pg||
nt|barnets: we back back into spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The operator in the other room assures me that South did play 1@s here and did make 3 and that W did make 5@h on the last board|pg||

nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: i thought I scored it down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  +1|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 9 to score in the USA1 final   Schwartz over Lynch by 35|pg||
nt|friggi: correto kit|pg||
nt|kit: is the North hand too strong for a 1NT opening?  We shall see.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kirp:  if A@D is with N, then need to pitch Q@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Best by W|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|joest: Rosenberg with a disciplined pass but at matchpoints I can assure you some folks would enter with a lead directing 2@s|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C majors   same as if  1N opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it was down one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice 2C if it is majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand  IF in slam, can you make|pg||
nt|kit: note light opener in Precision|pg||
nt|kirp:  to avoid end play, but ???|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: well I guess at IMPS too!|pg||
nt|joest: at favorable I guess anything goes|pg||
nt|joest: but Milt is usually pretty disciplined|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without peeking at all 52 cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: steve cashed club then another ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  6@c or 6N will be disappointing with the 4-1 @c break|pg||
nt|andyv:  the OR managed to stay out of trouble|pg||
nt|joest: this catches Cohen with a big hand though|pg||
nt|joest: here come the police|pg||
nt|joest: Bates has to double what is under his nose it seems to me|pg||
nt|joest: of course his partner is 3rd seat but still..|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only 7 tricks i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: very light opener  that R|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and there they are|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but a diamond lead is not nice|pg||
nt|joest: no way does Rosenberg sit this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: n0--sorry--|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 2@S probably 4-card support|pg||
nt|friggi: must be|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|007 joosth: I dont think  such a bid has to be strong.  so 3S seems some rough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen liked his pure holdings in majors  -- and i'm sure not a high card invite -- that would be 2N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice double fit,  but a doubtful K|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew basing it on the dbl major suit fit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade lead gives it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  and seems impossible to keep N from gaining lead if you don't lead a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat  and  3rd vul  1N=15-17|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have pinched it|pg||
nt|kit: 1@S not the best contract, but it will make|pg||
nt|warrens:  duck this?|pg||
nt|kit: I would win and go right after diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  Did 1@S gtee a weak hand, pass looks timid by N|pg||
nt|kit: no, normal -- North just made a good decision|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: it does seem that they should have considered a slam at least|pg||
nt|joest: ok so I have misguessed Rosenberg at every opportunity|pg||
nt|joest: Mark used to be a pretty harsh partner.  I played with him.|pg||
nt|joest: I would NOT have wanted to table this dummy in 3NT doubled!!! :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Hard to find @C lead now|pg||
nt|007 joosth: with small doubleton H   i can imagine a reasonable 3card spades|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson can definitely consider balancing with xx in spades -- passing risks losing a double-part-score swing|pg||
nt|ady: now see if they can make it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: right now, pollack is praying for a bad club split :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  as they did here...1N is 8-13 and game forcing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a heart lead seems obvious   the Q or K   according to what agreement you have|pg||
nt|007 joosth: asking unblocking a J|pg||
nt|joest: although that will cost her|pg||
nt|joest: here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure about 3@H  and that also applies to 4N and 5@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Have no idea what 4N was, key-card?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S might fit  keycard  or    5@S 6@D  [but didn't 4@S show that?]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H weak jump shift -- just weird for that hand to ask KeyCards|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice bid by N if thats the case|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's a twist  4@S=keycard for @H|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like headed down 1|pg||
nt|friggi: yes but what if they dont ?|pg||
nt|friggi: still suitable |pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe he can do something nice with the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 4th club with east will come into play|pg||
nt|kit: defense may have to get diamonds going in time|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kirp:  5@D is also a nice contratc|pg||
nt|kirp:  thats also possible!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hackenbush: 8-11 opposite passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus opened north hand 1@C  so O'Rourke had no trouble leading @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lasts random guess  4N pick-a-game|pg||
nt|ady: needs 10@D switch early|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hackenbush: *as|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade ace lead was a good bet with no raise by partner|pg||
nt|hackenbush: new leader after this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes, goes down every 4-5 minutes.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: should get diamonds right after West shows up with lots of black cards|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well Jack,  maybe he just wanted to visit the toilet?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no unbloch here  thats strange|pg||
nt|joest: Bates proceeding on the assumption that, having not seen the jack from partner, Cohen must have it|pg||
nt|joest: at least I'm guessing so|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 more mistake and its only -100|pg||
nt|joest: but it doesn't matter much what he does since Cohen has only six tricks that I can count|pg||
nt|kirp:  May find @C lead after this auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: one thing is sure --- this auction hasn't come up before|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, ty:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Limited by the failure to open 1@c.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: assuming that Wold switches to the @Dj when he gets in|pg||
nt|kirp:  Rise with @C K to block the suit|pg||
nt|kit: This hand hasn't made yet -- 3 spades, 3 diamonds, 1 club are all the sure tricks declarer has|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: hi howard|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hackenbush: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and South will win @D with no @C to continue|pg||
nt|kit: they are playing standard, not strong club|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|friggi: that is the kay in def|pg||
nt|kirp:  Are NS a Strong Club pair?|pg||
nt|kit: no -- standard|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh, sorry thought they were playing precision, they're not.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no--they claimed five and was accepted|pg||
pc|d5|nt|friggi: @D 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is yet another hand where backward finesse works -- but won't be taken at the table|pg||
nt|kit: declarer doesn't really gain by going after hearts, but it deflects the defenders from what they need to do|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|kirp:  i dislike too many blackwood versions|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: first they should discard 5 times|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will play continue @S to King @D to 8?|pg||
nt|friggi: Al is right ...sadly:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: or  does he think South is danger hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  in the olde days, i played 4N as the only Black and alwys Black|pg||
nt|ady: south may have been a too passive|pg||
nt|kit: And it worked -- now declarer will get 4 spades, 3 clubs, and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: Diamond shift far from obvious from Boyd's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  went down in OR   so Wold needed to make this|pg||
mc|9|nt|chick: she can set up a spade trick before clearing clubs|pg||

mb|4S|nt|007 joosth: diamod-lead maybe   but still....|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: 2Nt might be the 'value call' but it could be Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|friggi: -1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N game force raise |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C min, not 6@H|pg||
nt|kit: why is 6@D by West better than 6@S by west?|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to get to|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: partnerships differ about whether 2NT is Lebensohl after a 2@d opener|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT gets the nature of the hand across well|pg||
nt|007 joosth: In the Netherlands almost everybody plays multi,  so I don't know|pg||
nt|joest: Bates may be asking himself: "do we play Lebensohl here"?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hope he asked it before|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is possible that they do and that Wold follows up with 3@h over a forced 3@c rebid showing four hearts in a NT hand and offering a choice of games|pg||
nt|joest: his hand is pretty straightforward so the longer he thinks the more my money is on the issue of "what do we play here?" :)|pg||
nt|kit: but it does make -- 4 hearts, 1 club, 4 diamonds, 3 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Wold bids 3@C  that means something completely different :)|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D will ask -- not sure which coding they use from here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after a club lead?....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: oh right -- West can lead a club --|pg||
nt|friggi: yes like joost said - open cards:) no problem, but.............|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW play Precision, so 6@S is unlikely|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: ACBL defense database vs multi  http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/3b.htm|pg||
nt|kirp:  2@S plays rather well here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4|pg||
nt|barnets: because you can pitch a heart on the fifth spade|pg||
nt|barnets: and lead a heart towards the k|pg||
nt|barnets: giving yourself 2 50 percent chances|pg||
nt|kit: oh, I see -- okay|pg||
nt|kit: I think Bates will just blast it into 6@S with RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not   i think Wold is allowed 3@S  so  will go thru 2N to get full distribution|pg||
nt|kirp:  Guessing A, then @C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: it is only fair -- if some open 2@H with 5  someone has to balance by opening 2@H with 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and can't blame him with 222 in other suit    YUK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he is vuln   and has just seen the result of doing it with 5 :)|pg||

nt|barnets: the lead of the @HQ speeds play up|pg||

nt|007 joosth: again.... the strong hand should play the hand...:)|pg||
nt|kit: won't matter -- he would bid slam opposite that also|pg||
pc|c5|nt|friggi: that goes without saying|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or it did at one time|pg||
nt|kit: Now queen ask 5@H|pg||
nt|kit: If he thinks he is losing the match, he might not bother with queen ask -- I'll bet that is what he is trying to estimate.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Boyd shows pretty bad hand with 4@H I believe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: even with that lead, I still don't see how this makes|pg||

pc|s2|nt|joest: something must have gone amiss in the other room|pg||
pc|s5|nt|friggi: yes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: no need for safety play in 4@H|pg||
nt|kit: in 5@H, would take safety play|pg||
nt|kit: And he didn't ask -- either just judged he would guess it, or was looking for swing at about 50% odds|pg||
nt|barnets: same lead would have been interesting on a trump|pg||
nt|barnets: to see what dec did|pg||

nt|kit: declarer would have taken a long time :)|pg||
nt|kit: Passell looking for safest line -- remember, he doesn't know trumps are splitting|pg||

nt|kit: yes, depending on your agreements|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: actually it was suggested to me after drawing trumps to cross to a diamond and lead a heart to the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I like to play pass = a control|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|joest: north-south witha preposterous result in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 11-15, 5+@S|pg||
nt|kit: may see multi here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: loser of that match gets the night off then tomorrow plays 60 boards against winner of our match to become USA2|pg||
nt|friggi: what is the point to show penalty?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force  as you see could be balanced with [i think] 2+@C|pg||
nt|barnets: North if he has the ace may not play one back|pg||
nt|barnets: or less likely may duck |pg||
nt|kit: 2NT overcall, then either 3NT or Stayman which will get to 4-4 heart fit. |pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: i dont understand 2NT|pg||
nt|joest: sanity returns|pg||
nt|kit: not sure what restrictions of 2@C are -- but he has to bid something, and 2@H would show 5|pg||
nt|kit: I imagine Bates has 3@H splinter here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alway FG   either nat or bal|pg||
nt|ady: flat result with little interest|pg||
nt|ady: unless e/w get too high|pg||
nt|kit: a splinter will cause Wold to go low|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a splinter will discourage E completely|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: little interest?     i think interesting to see how top partnerships handle these bidding situation|pg||
nt|barnets: sounds like  a slightly better shot than 50-50|pg||
nt|kirp:  best to play all your methods after 2N opening|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hackenbush: South may think about offering NT with so much secondary values|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is excellent, 4@H is down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: oops  I can stay|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Woolsey was not desparate at this moment with a double:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: I agree.  Almost no such thing as hand with little interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decided NOT to splinter -- that can be dangerous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  easier to remember that way, since you dont know his suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force  2@H=6+|pg||
nt|ady: kib pointed out 4@S might go down on a heart lead   and club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a @s lead may make this 3NT contract very awkward|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this will promise a stopper  so 3NT comes closer   again an ugly game|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see a lot of of hts will make for e/w |pg||
nt|kirp:  OK who can find a @H lead after that auction|pg||
nt|kit: Wold will bid 3@S, of course, and then we will see what Bates does|pg||
nt|friggi: lack of Aces should trigger 3NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: well it might make|pg||
nt|joest: both north-souths have hit a rough patch these last two boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 3@D denies 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BJ Becker referred to "shirley doubles" a character he had who often doubled with trump void|pg||
nt|barnets: would you bid 3@H or pass ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass seems like large position to take|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but N won't find that|pg||
nt|kirp:  Made 5 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hands like this make me wonder how game would change if we counted honors|pg||
nt|kirp:  Would u overcall with E's hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 to play in Women's USA1 final   Moss leads Sprung by 37    Women's USA2 "SemiFinal"  Joel now leading Westheimer  by 6  with 7 boards to play|pg||
nt|kit: This is non-serious slam try I believe|pg||
nt|kit: Spades are definitely set as trumps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this was not exactly how i thought it would work|pg||
nt|joest: ok now this is REALLY ridiculous!|pg||
nt|joest: I mean there is no other word for it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sorry i think i'm commentator of a different game.   i dont understand 2NT nor 3H if thats natural|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Lawrence advises that 2H maybe only 5card   clearly a different school|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only by 1 card|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it's easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Howard...good to see you surviving this roller coaster:)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: pretty tame set so far|pg||
nt|hackenbush: after bd 34|pg||
nt|007 joosth: thats better|pg||
nt|kirp:  this should be fast|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT would have been in jeopardy on diamond lead -- declarer would have to guess which ace to knock out first.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|007 joosth: although....2Nt is crazy in my opinion|pg||
nt|joest: AKQ may all go on trick 1!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: believe it or not    4@D did not say anything about serious/non-serious slam interest -- just a cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quick claim???|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 3N was still a possible contract|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i think my grandma can make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like @C ruff holds it to 4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: lead right for defence to have a chance|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, on heart lead and club shift, could easily go down -- and that is the logical defense|pg||
nt|friggi: after 3@S slam was not the case|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: a kib suggested ducking the 10 of hearts!|pg||
nt|ady: played the other way up in OR   diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe too obvious, but worth thinking about|pg||
nt|friggi: good point|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|kit: Here it comes -- but which club will Boyd shift to?|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer ducks 10@H  cannot south still play the ace and switch to a club?|pg||
nt|friggi: still 11|pg||
nt|kit: And will Bates believe it?|pg||
nt|friggi: no|pg||
nt|puncher99: lo  club lead best|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but defender doesn't know that third heart trick might be needed|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: but south may well smell a reat if declarer ducked the 10@H|pg||
nt|friggi: def has to be creative Kit|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hackenbush: not sure desperation was called for on lead when they're getting a bad trump break|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|007 joosth: why does N not lead a suit that will be possed by S?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Sutherlin: "leads and carding standard?" Kasle: "everything standard"|pg||
nt|chorush: I would have bid 1NT with the South hand. If i bid one spade over 1H, I am NOT 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|henryb:  I did not understand the auction at the other table. either|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I would have opened 1NT :)|pg||
nt|barnets: that is also european with 4423 bid 1@C 1@D 1NT|pg||
nt|chorush: Neither do I, looking at it|pg||
nt|henryb:  how did S become declarer? Robinson Boyd did not, the last time I looked, play fancy methods|pg||
nt|barnets: when I first came to USA I was told that was sacriledge|pg||
nt|henryb:  It changed with the widespread acceptance of Walsh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Transfer responses to 1@c maybe?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: I think many players here still play the methods of 40 years ago|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|barnets: when they always bid majors|pg||
nt|barnets: that is the older players|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is, 1@c - 1@d denies a 4 card major unless game forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: not the younger ones|pg||
nt|henryb:  these are Seniors, Barnet|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: If you look at the Robinson-Boyd System Summary Form, you'll see that they do in fact play transfer responses over 1@c, so 1@c-1@d showed 4+ hearts, then the auction makes sense|pg||
nt|barnets: seniors can change with the times --too you know|pg||

nt|007 joosth: though thefence will not win prizes  this must be a big swing for NS|pg||
nt|joest: I am shocked at the open room result I must admit|pg||
nt|joest: 33 highs and they don't get past 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: and with both kings offside that was the winning move|pg||
nt|joest: not to mention spades 4-2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I would expect some more discipline at this age|pg||
nt|joest: perhaps the players are taking a break|pg||
nt|joest: anyway I am betting that Wold and Bates bid a slam her|pg||
nt|joest: here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably|pg||
nt|kirp:  Many would|pg||
nt|barnets: south had to follow to 2 spades allowing dec 2 pitches and his ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  pretty lucky to make 4@s on this hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: time to play in the worse trump suit?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, in round 1|pg||
nt|kit: So that boring hand wasn't so boring after all -- many interesting features, both in bidding and play|pg||
nt|friggi: p|pg||
mb|1C|nt|007 joosth: 6Nt looks great  but very unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: like to hear 2 @S, constructive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 2@C opener = 6+@C|pg||
nt|kirp:  that seems to be the Precision fashion these days, 2@C maust have 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike original Precision and current Polish Club players who can have 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are transfers on after 1@H overcall?|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 2 loosing finesses,  spades 42  and no squeeze|pg||
nt|007 joosth: with open cards even 4S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Asian Zone & New Zealand Precision players still include 5@C 4M|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  the other room got the @C ruff|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd better pass -- if he bids, they will get too high|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: yes you might survive in hearts|pg||
nt|hackenbush: open room led trump vs 4@s|pg||
nt|kirp:  Puts too much pressure on 1@D opening, in my opinion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but makes 2@C opener a much more powerful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|kit: 1@D response will show hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: maybe with open cards an endply?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  he may be getting ready to bid 3 sp,  3 card limit raise |pg||
nt|friggi: he took you advice|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will bid 1NT, and Wold might or might not bid 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: And I think Boyd bid 1@H showing 3|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kirp:  thats exciting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice BAM result|pg||
nt|friggi: forcig now|pg||
nt|kit: guess 4-card spade suit has priority|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  made only 4|pg||
nt|friggi: negative|pg||
nt|barnets: a heart was led v 3N in the open|pg||
nt|kit: although I don't understand why|pg||
nt|warrens:  neither do I|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this will still be an excellent result for Sprung|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 4NT looks pretty automatic|pg||
nt|kit: very lucky 3NT make in other room -- 3-3 in both red suits and king of diamonds onside -- all needed to get 3 diamonds, 4 hearts, 2 spades|pg||
nt|ady: how can they get too high if Boyd responds   3NT unbeatable   and bid in OR|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT by Boyd takeout|pg||
nt|warrens:  since if partner were 4-4 in the majors, couldn't he bid 1@S over 1@H?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hackenbush: yes when partner showed values|pg||
nt|sybarra: chose to be conservative |pg||
nt|sybarra: on the lay out that works |pg||
nt|kirp:  Wrong sided this one|pg||
nt|kirp:  Still has 9 trix, as @Hs are 4 4|pg||
nt|friggi: poker bid|pg||
nt|ady: I agree lucky|pg||
nt|kit: well, too high in theory :)|pg||
nt|barnets: when dec finessed diamonds east won and cleared hearts|pg||
nt|kit: it would seem that way Warren|pg||
nt|kirp:  In my style I would rebid 1N with S hand, 1@S with more unbal shape or weal dbleton |pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this was beatable on an unlikely @c or @dA lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Declared gets the lead she needed to make this|pg||
nt|hackenbush: bye for now, hope the internet connection gets better!|pg||
nt|andyv:  a club lead would have set this|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye Howard|pg||
nt|007 joosth: even that I dont believe|pg||
nt|kirp:  Thoughtful lead, hoped to find 5-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier on their auction|pg||
nt|barnets: thats not best for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: on this hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: down 5?|pg||
nt|kirp:  weak dbleton in 4th suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this may have been a mixup here -- not sure|pg||
nt|kit: So now Boyd has bid 3 suits, perfect way to describe 4-3-3-3 :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@c was precision|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3S seems right    even with the good clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: comes from spending time with Kit Woolsey  --  essentially  if you can't lead your 5 card suit -- try to find partner's|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Robinson would have chosen 3@C on xx if 2NT offered a choice.|pg||
nt|barnets: still not home though |pg||
nt|barnets: yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@h was probably artificial|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only an agressive diamond lead will bring the slam?|pg||
nt|joest: when I firrst started bridge the auction would have gone 2NT-6NT|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 23 was also then to much for 2NT?|pg||
nt|joest: 22-24|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: old old days|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|007 joosth: at least you made it|pg||
nt|kirp:  intersting theory, always attack with 5-card suit|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR, the splinter sort of gave it away|pg||
nt|friggi: 2NT was out of touch|pg||
nt|santyclz: The presumed @d shortage makes n's hand look like gold.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: They did well enough to stay out of game, but even 3@H looks like it will fail|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, he convinced Passell that he only had 1 @D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: This lead gives them a chance -- transfers do help sometimes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: However, it does look like 3@C will power home-- still a 7 IMP loss|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|joest: the slow boat but they got there|pg||
nt|joest: one of the black tens|pg||
nt|007 joosth: club is best i think|pg||
nt|kirp:  Cant trust these guys|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: not if dummy has AJ8x and declarer has Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: spade is safer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not when you change the 7 and 8?|pg||
nt|joest: i guess a straightforward line is jump, hook the heart, test the spades and fall back on the diamond hook|pg||
nt|barnets: he may make 4@D 2@H a club and 2 spades now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|007 joosth: 3C with Jxxxx  and now 2S on this very strong hand     how can partner guess it all the time?|pg||
nt|friggi: regardless Kit|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT call looks fine to me -- choice of minors|pg||
nt|friggi: after this action?|pg||
nt|friggi: still @Dðs|pg||
nt|friggi: no way|pg||
nt|friggi: as you call it in USA - a blind shoot|pg||
nt|ady: did 1@D opening promise this sort of strengh?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 10 trix for declarer, unless we now strip and endplay N|pg||
nt|kit: Now club to ace, pass 10 of clubs, and no second diamond loser|pg||
nt|kirp:  See, no problem, its an easy game|pg||
nt|kit: I am informed that if Boyd had bid 1@H it would have denied 4 spades|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|kit: no -- but Boyd isn't selling to 2@S with a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: slow down guys  i'm still trying to decide if Wold should shift to @C at trick 3|pg||
nt|barnets: so this board was a triumphfor 4th from your longest and strongest|pg||
nt|eamongall: 0.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kirp:  Other possibility is to go for some sort of endplay on 3rd trump|pg||
nt|kit: wrong idea here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: Now defense gets the diamond trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|007 joosth: 1S is ok i think.   no need to prempt here when you have both majors|pg||
pc|c3|nt|007 joosth: show up squeeze i think for -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  ignorance is bliss    in our auction  Bates KNEW  Boyd had @H stoppers|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|barnets: big swing at this point in match|pg||
nt|warrens:  that works, but he might play for @S to come in and just play on trumps.  he doesn't know if Passell had Ax or not|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kirp:  Neither N or S knew E had 5@Cs|pg||
nt|ady: how can 2NT be a good bid  there is a good lay out to make a 3 level contract  and 18 hcp opposite  which he did not know?|pg||
nt|kit: he does know about the 18 HCP from the way the bidding went -- and if he can't make something, opponents can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: It is almost always wrong to sell out at 2-level with shortness in their suit|pg||
nt|ady: yes   1NT from north more like it   then Boyd can compet   I think as it went  a risky enterprise|pg||
nt|kit: particularly with none vul, when down 1 is only 50|pg||
nt|kit: passing 2@S riskier than bidding 2NT IMO|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: That is betting that 2@S and 3 of a minor are both down -- I don't like that bet|pg||
nt|ady: any chance of a stakc for a penalty of 300 or 500 when partner is weaker and cards not so well placed?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: yes. Bates will know he is down seconds before the hand is over|pg||
nt|kit: do you really think opponents will be able to double on this auction?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kirp:  now endplay coming up|pg||
nt|kit: But still chances on and end-play|pg||
nt|kit: He will try jack of hearts now, hoping for K10 doubleton in East hand|pg||
nt|kit: When that doesn't work, queen of spades, spade ruff, exit in hearts, and West is end-played|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|007 joosth: then the match is very close again|pg||
nt|joest: Woolsey will take the lead here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|007 joosth: well  really unlucky for EW|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as long as east knew|pg||

nt|ady: where I come from yes|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|nt|kit: an overtrick appears, cutting loss to 6 IMPs|pg||

mb|4H|nt|barnets: the strongest possible 4 trump raise |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: srry, got the auction wrong. I apologize. thought in my mind the bid had been 1H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  we all have our senior moments|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chorush: More and more as time goes on|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|barnets: had it been 1@H modern style to play 2N as limit or better with 4 trumps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb:  players, commenters, perhaps even kibitzers :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, and that is where my eyes and mind had a disconnect:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kasle asks about leads: "we play A from AK, but if the suit's been bid and raised that doesn't apply"|pg||

nt|andyv:  so far a good set for Westheimer|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome back|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after this board EW should have the lead again|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d is not the world's best contract but it seems like it deserved a better fate than 1100 minus|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes  sorry    its the other team|pg||
nt|kirp:  its 14-10 after 10 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but movie says 7|pg||
nt|kit: Effective 4@S save in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and finally some breathing room for Kasle  with 5 boards left to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 800 would have been standard?|pg||
nt|joest: well in top tricks you have 5 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts so I would hope to limit it to 500|pg||
nt|santyclz: We've seen some quality bridge to this point.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Hopefully to a stable connection|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jon Wittes|pg||
nt|joest: Bates bidding 4@s where Woolsey settled for 3 next door|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed but thats after you know how well the hearts behave|pg||
nt|joest: rosenberg will bid 5@d as well I would imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i cant imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3 sure tricks in defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: interesting bidding in other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  a real 18 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 1N|pg||
nt|ady: nice save in OR    4@SX     e/w can make 11 tricks   may have been difficult to gauge|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- 270 -- still 7 IMPs|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably for the majors|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  " sure"  :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute EW ended up in @S after South opened 1@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jwit: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  i give up|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW need to stay low with this misfit...probably 2@s|pg||
nt|kirp:  hard to figure|pg||
nt|baldfriede: would not be my choice, especially with that @s suit E has|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if really 2@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what year is this?|pg||
nt|kit: I'm stunned that Robinson didn't open multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@Hs  is possible by EW, hard to bid maybe|pg||
mb|d|nt|kirp:  2@C a range/major ask|pg||
nt|kit: first seat, favorable -- what more can he want?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i said that about you earlier in the weak Kit  when 1st seat  favorable  you passed with  @SKQJ9x  @HTxxx (22)|pg||
nt|ady: do they play the multi as 5 major  and a minor?|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd trying to figure out what sort of a hand Robinson could have and not open multi|pg||
nt|kit: no -- a weak 2|pg||
nt|kit: doesn't show a minor|pg||
nt|ady: usually 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|kit: but who cares about minors when you have spades?|pg||
nt|kit: at this vul, 5 more often than 6|pg||
nt|ady: but usually a 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use opening 2@S as more constructive than 2@D|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S is 10-13 6-card suit|pg||
nt|kit: full opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: and 2@D?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jwit: 4S likely contract here|pg||
nt|joest: Well now we'll see if Cohen can hold down the carnage a bit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: playing with a Cohen  I would expect some more law|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished|pg||
nt|kit: Not exactly sure what 2NTis|pg||
nt|kit: But great decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|kit: if Lynch bids 3@H, Passell might shoot out game|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: after a club switch, Cohen has major problems getting back to his hand (if he really wants to try for a spade ruff)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I would expect 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may not even bid his @hs and settle for 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well they will be higher i'm afraid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: KnR says South worth 18.95|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think boyd had a bid specifically with game force, 4@H and no @S stop|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kirp:  Easy to bid???|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Should be no problem for declarer|pg||
nt|irwinbo: cards sit nicely|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the roof comes down if he tries to play on clubs|pg||
nt|kit: and even greater by Bates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about 2N   :(    you stole my bid AND i have max?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: a messy auction :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Levin in deep thought.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wd|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have guessed well to go to 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and a good spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe he can discard a spade on a heart|pg||
nt|joest: double dummy he could make it now|pg||
nt|joest: flies ace plays one round of diamonds then works clubs|pg||
nt|joest: spade ruff, etc.|pg||
nt|kit: It normally would not be right to go to 5-level with each having xx in spades, but it sure was this time.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women's USA2 Final  set 1 of 6   thru 12 boards  dead even|pg||
nt|kit: and with the very lucky heart lie it looks like it will make|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: perhaps, but I think can make game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentator from other room confirmed  they really played 2@S|pg||
nt|warrens:  also helps that all the high spades are onside|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kirp:  Should go down on spade ruff|pg||
nt|kirp:  Cant tell what range of NTs they are playing, a bit surprised by 2N after opening 1n|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using the stayman sequence to show 5@S invite frees up 1N-2@H//2@S-2N for artificial sequences|pg||
nt|kit: Note in other room -- North opened 2@S, East bid 3@H, and South psyched a 4@C call -- hard for opponents to get to 5@H after that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|007 joosth: why that silly 9?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok it just dont hurt|pg||
nt|007 joosth: just 1 trick maybe  haha.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: now the 5 is a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surprised by 1N    SHOCKED by 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roman Club players    1N=18-20|pg||
nt|kirp:  15+->18- on their card|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like time to benefit from 22 trump and 33@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead helped too|pg||
nt|kirp:  this hand is alll about 2 trump losers at most|pg||
nt|kit: one heart play from dummy and won't be 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|kit: and ace of hearts known to be onside after queen of spades opening lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  continuing spades may hold him to 4|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, won't be more than 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|santyclz: If they force dummy twice, the 2nd @h loser reappears.|pg||
nt|kirp:  notice i said 'may' not 'will'|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|kirp:  any roaman club players left in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "multi" may not have had as large an impact|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but you never know unless you try|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who just arrived, the score shown is not accurate...no result for board 37 and board 36 has been misscored.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: total tricksters will translate all of that good stuff into 3@S going down a bunch|pg||
nt|kit: now cross to the diamond, lead a heart, and hand falls into place|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|chick: have to pick up the diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: needed TWO @S ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jwit: Could have lost as many as 5 tricks in this contract with a different layout, but everything lies well for declarer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: plaing the J would have been ok|pg||
nt|007 joosth: tryiong clubs now i think|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chick: and she might not do that|pg||
nt|joest: he is still going to telescope into a club development line for down 1|pg||
nt|kirp:  that looks better than spade play|pg||
nt|kit: if she tries for discards first, could get into trouble|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|007 joosth: but alas for him   4-1|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kirp:  now there are defensive possibilties|pg||
nt|kirp:  didn't S show AKQ of @S on lead, A@H has to be right|pg||
pc|h6|nt|007 joosth: but finesseble|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Roman was fun to play, but you didn't see it much in north america  ACBL banned much of the system|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: in the other USA2 "Quarter Final" [where only 2 matches]    thru board 41  Kasle leads Milner by 31|pg||
nt|andyv:  I believe 36 turned out to be a push|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  during auction  Boyd could easily have 1@S|pg||
nt|kit: Now should be safe as the cards lie|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: but i'm not sure about the play after @D lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: pointed out to me   if 2@S inv, then  pass with min  so 2N=2@S, MAX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so apologies to Chambers  about  my reaction to that call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the snowball effect of that one change really supports 4@C|pg||
pc|h9|nt|007 joosth: al together Roosenberg will win 900 here i think|pg||
nt|joest: -200 to win 14|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some days are worse|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  so Woolsey would have 6 less imps|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk1: Operator, 3NT+1 on board 1 was made by EW, not NS|pg||
nt|Walddk1: so the board is flat|pg||
nt|Walddk1: you can subtract 13 IMPs from Westheimer's score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Do you know how to correct?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Knocked off Internet.  She finessed JD, and made 5.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfb: Hayden was writing scores from previous boards on his scorecard, then looked at his hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|chorush: Think they will get to 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: clubs best|pg||

nt|barnets: try 3 rounds|pg||
nt|chorush: yes 3 rounds loooks good but declarer will then have 5 hearts, 4 diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kasle asks for a review and Sutherlin gives it verbally and Kozlove says "they're being too loud over there" so Sutherlin writes the auction out for Kasle :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chorush: If they had a way to play 3 rounds without establishing dummy's club they could beat it|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Players taking a break.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 37 may have been a push as both sides made 4@s (but didn't bid the game)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sounds right Andy|pg||
nt|ady: bu North went to 4@S eith the same 5 card suit after the 4@C  so there must have been some understanding  last hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good pressure bidding from both pairs there|pg||
nt|barnets: south led @S 10 v 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: oh I agree, bidding the game was a long shot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps  only 34 boards left to play|pg||
nt|kit: Two nice results by O'Rourke, and match suddenly tight|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  E had to not cover the 9@C on last hand lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: easier to bid south hand if the @S quacks located elsewhere|pg||
nt|kirp:  forget that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great lead Bruce!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kit: enterprising 2@S call by Boyd, but at favorable opposite a passed partner I like his odds.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at the open room auction  --   not sure what else he could lead   [thanks mike]|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  S has a problem trying to describe her hand|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d-2@c is a difficult auction in Standard that requires a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C either 4-card limit raise  or   Game force    shame usbf can't require convention card submission :(|pg||
nt|kit: Another game in a 4-4 heart fit here|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  2N probably xfer to @d|pg||
nt|chick: 2N probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i do short hand better:)|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|joest: does a 2@d rebid show five?  Does 2 of a major show extras? etc.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes indeed I can recommend the Lawrnce book 2/1 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with the length  the @S honors wasted here  [term is trump poor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was Game Force @S raise  [jacoby]|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: i think this 2@C has 4@H/@S only if 6+@C|pg||
nt|joest: yes he has a well thought out method in his book|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@H call is like a normal Q-bid|pg||
nt|kirp:  is dble here better than 3@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hackenbush: routine 4@s here, Westheimer's opening will have to come on one of the last 4 boards|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  2@D=5+|pg||
nt|joest: and then either 3@h followed by 3Nt or just 3NT directly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so   now we have to guess   was 3@H weaker or better than PASS|pg||
nt|kit: This is just asking for stopper I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is East to an upgrade for 1@C opener?    [and should Lynch bid 4@H instead of 3]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: EW slightly stole this one, though they will have to do some scrambling to make this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some play 2D as balanced   11/12  maybe only 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  this is like rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be  1@D isn't a real suit to support|pg||
nt|kit: No reason for Boyd not to lead a spade, and then it appears declarer will have no play.|pg||
nt|barnets: three different spades will beat it S109 or 5|pg||
nt|barnets: not the @SQ or @SA|pg||
nt|kit: Lynch too conservative here -- I think she should shoot out 4@H|pg||
nt|warrens:  a real underbid by East here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL was lead-direct|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E might play for a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: only in 2 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D works too|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|kit: A kib points out that if declarer wins and leads a spade back, North is in trouble on run of spades|pg||
nt|kit: But with declarer expecting 6 spades in South hand, that isn't going to happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how likely is that if Boyd can have 6@S|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec says win and play a spade back|pg||
nt|barnets: north is squeezed in minors if south cashes|pg||
nt|barnets: but dec expects 6 in south hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  especially playing precision|pg||
nt|kit: Partner could have Kxxx of hearts and out, and game would have real play|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H cant be worse than a finesse|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: I was going to say she would need a safety play in diamonds, but doesn't look like she'll get the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: makeable |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jwit: Lead actually helps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then 2NT can be 13/14  gf  or  18/19|pg||
nt|kit: Need to cover jack of hearts to block suit|pg||
nt|kit: Now fourth round of hearts can potentially promote a trump trick|pg||
nt|ady: what difference   got 2 hearts and a ruff and A@D  |pg||
nt|kit: on 4th round of hearts, what does East ruff with?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 2@D didn't deny 4@H/@S  but 3@D did|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @h suit will provide one pitch so S should immediately play it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah  at rubber you'd rebid 2N instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Diams are friendly layout|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like only 9 trix|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C look tempting as possible source too|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: but Bates-Wold play precision so |pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead maybe  but N did not double 3H|pg||
nt|ady: well not the king or queen|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|007 joosth: fine lead here|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs lead second highest from four small and so, apparently, does this north-south pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  if someone holds honor doubleton|pg||
nt|kit: I would be very surprised if Wold doesn't just assume spades are 6-1, so sets up long club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  now can get to board with K@c to pitch other @c on @h|pg||
nt|barnets: agree|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kirp:  we need a probability chart of rthat vs @D play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer also factoring in @S33|pg||
nt|kit: has to be 9 to make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jwit: Trumps and spades both behave and 9 of clubs is a big card, so they should probably make this|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: where are Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley when we really need them?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: needs a little care now|pg||
nt|kit: In other room only 1@S overcall, but declarer didn't find the suicide squeeze|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D hook now |pg||
nt|barnets: see you all tomorrow for the final bye|pg||
nt|kit: no reason for her not to claim her 10 winners and go on to the next hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|007 joosth: 3NT maybe down i think|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd had right idea, but wrong execution|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: if @D shift  does he duck or fly?   i think choice is just whether to lose a @D or lose a @H|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has no choice but to ruff with 9|pg||
nt|kit: Too late for suicide squeeze now, as a diamond shift after the run of the spades breaks it up.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|007 joosth: esp now|pg||
nt|kirp:  All in all, this is the first positive swing we've seen for NS here, EW have had most of it till now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|warrens:  even with 3 rounds of clubs, still makes 4.  |pg||
nt|kit: and now she can make 5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: wonder if N considered the possibility of a club ruff|pg||
nt|kit: better to win king of hearts, cash king of spades, heart to 10|pg||
nt|warrens:  has she lost track of one of the @H honors?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: both kings onside for woolsey  --  not expected on this auction|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|joest: defense appears headed to two spade tricks + 2 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h8|nt|warrens:  no, ok now|pg||
nt|kirp:  still ok with @Ds available|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: wold with 3 diamonds + 2 spades + 2 clubs + 1 hearts|pg||
nt|joest: he may well have to decide which hook to take|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess not|pg||
nt|kirp:  I think 33 is in the high 30's, dblton both honors adds about 4%, so we are over 40%. That seems better than dblton honour missing 7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|c7|nt|santyclz: Perhaps she lost track of the @dq.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: thnk the Woolsey team is running our of boards|pg||
nt|kirp:  More excitement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of Jacobus 2@C opening?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not a fan of 2@C on this hand, hard to describe later|pg||
nt|baldfriede: meaning "this will probably be another push board" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're more diplomatic than me :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm a big clubber so very biased|pg||
nt|kirp:  2c-2d-2s-3c=bad hand,  now what|pg||
nt|baldfriede: pass and pray|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree  flexible hands starting 2@C yield very complicated auctions|pg||
nt|kirp:  what's the hold-up?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: boys took break|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am not a fan of 2@d waiting bid after strong 2@c openings|pg||
nt|kirp:  33 split is about 37%?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 24 imps   3 boards|pg||
nt|kirp:  so board 10 and 12 are game swings for Kasle|pg||
nt|kirp:  actually 10 was a p/s swing|pg||
nt|santyclz: On 10, the @h partial after s bid his 4333 as a 3 suiter, the other table played nt without success.|pg||
nt|kirp:  chalk up a system triumph|pg||
nt|kit: This next hand should be easy 4@S, with king of clubs on no problems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: bath break|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jwit: This might be interesting!|pg||
nt|joest: the live and let die 2@s bid.  five card suit, side four card major|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i like that 2S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously Woolsey did NOT preempt with West   his only option was 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 Final  thru 71 of 90    Schwarts leads Lynch by 35|pg||
nt|kirp:  here we go also|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it is a wasted bid; the one who needs information is the opener|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 4@S down 1, probably|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|1D|nt|joest: curiously?|pg||
nt|kit: Here is their 2@S opening -- and maybe it will help them stay out of game|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a bit high   need good lay of  heart ace and king of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=a) 8-11 HCP, 7@S  b) 9-12 HCP, 6@S & 4 other  c) 10-13 HCP,  6@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: i could think of several reasons why one might not preempt :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  better to play 1 level as forcing 1 rd|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  stop here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: never|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Women's USA1 Final  thru 74 of 96   Moss leads Sprung by 23|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what North has available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same team playing 1N   there's a Mollo story in there somewhere|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  invite will get W to 3 and down quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Womens USA2 SemiFinal  3 to play  ALL TIED|pg||
nt|kit: But he made an unsuccessful game try, assuming no imaginative king of clubs lead|pg||
nt|kit: Wold will have to make this just to break even|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows 4, so Boyd will just bid 4@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest: but it is in Kit's character to do so I would say|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure  but its nice when p knows what to lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  hehe|pg||
nt|kirp:  33 is 35.5% i am informed. dblton with 2 honours out of 6 cards, is 3 possibilities out of 64. Looks like around 40%.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women USA1 Final  5 remaining   Moss over Sprung by 29|pg||
nt|ady: north flatish with some jacks that might be useless|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  a Roland slam|pg||
nt|chick: much too good for Roland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's how Fantoni-Nunes play their 1-suit openings|pg||
nt|baldfriede: a shot in the dark which does not hit the target but winds up in the blue|pg||
nt|kirp:  Is W thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should have 11 or 12 @Hs, not 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wold needed to DBL to prevent Bates from thinking|pg||
nt|kirp:  Dbl might have encouraged Bates to bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but [rightly] feared they have a better spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: too many losers to bid game, even vul, assuming 3@h is not a limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i recall Drew claiming his regular partner Jim Krekorian convinced him that 2 aces opposite strong NT = GAME|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: even if clubs behave Rosenberg has only eight tricks|pg||
nt|joest: he will needed to work diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: and will need to assume East has the ace, else he's just down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: true  but the disadvantage of the 2S is that maybe N will guess the clubs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: quickly with a diamond lead .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  ordinarily 8 hcp enough in this type of auction...but hcp are in Aces and E is berift of spot cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Senior USA1   5 to play  Schwartz +52 over Lynch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Lynch will get night off then play 60 board match vs winner here  to determine USA2|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  might be right:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson could have relayed with 2N to learn 6(322) and not 2 of top 3 honors  min/max|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Wold is 6-5 and might well have bid -- he was right passing, but could have been wrong.|pg||
nt|ady: can Boyd be any better for 2@S?|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- how about a singleton?|pg||
nt|ady: but not much better than 12 hcp?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hcp max  just one more jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-13 with 6@S and no side 4|pg||
nt|ady: and shows 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|kit: you can count HCP all you want, but it is distribution that makes the games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less hcp with more shape|pg||
nt|ady: with 6 card suit and outside singleton say 6-3-3-1   would not consider open 1 spade with 12 or 13?|pg||
nt|kit: Wold not sure what to play for here|pg||
nt|kit: His partner might have a stiff heart, but might be ruffing with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|kit: And this may be last time to put club through|pg||
nt|kit: so I think he will shift to a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well this helps   but still doesn't look like enough -- even if he'd unblocked @S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bad spade break wont hurt enuff on this hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jwit: 10 of hearts lead will help declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse hesitations --  the slow 5@H shows confidence|pg||
nt|kirp:  as Mike has only 3@Ds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: a likely challenge|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  E may simply play @ss back to K and Q and lose an imp here|pg||
nt|joest: once spades are abandoned for sure the ace of diamonds resides in east|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if N guesses the clubs i think there may be an endplay at E|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce happy they aren't vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: may duck this lead in both hands|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: courtesy raise of 3@C from Wold [instead of original pass] would have been interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D2 attitude, not count  so he really likes @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you let dummy win now or later?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson did well with the diamond shift -- now declarer will have to discard a potential winner on the third round of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: or not at all!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Bates better not duck this!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: I dont see a way to make 9 tricks on this layout |pg||
nt|kit: And he might -- his partner could have stiff queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   win @D exit @S and declarer endplayed?|pg||
nt|kit: right -- I think that is the best idea|pg||
pc|c2|nt|007 joosth: the fast way:)|pg||
nt|joest: enough of that suit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: now an endplay with clubs:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: happier that 2N wasn't making|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope|pg||
nt|007 joosth: reat will be automatic?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jwit: trump lead would be great, but almost impossible to find|pg||
pc|s2|nt|007 joosth: rest|pg||
nt|kit: Good suit-pref 9 of spades discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bridge progression    read Clyde Love  and then there was a squeeze in every hand   read Kit's Partnership Defense and then there was suit preference in every card|pg||
pc|sK|nt|007 joosth: ok he doen not knao how many hearts E has|pg||
nt|007 joosth: does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just not sure if they play 1N forcing or semi-force|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|007 joosth: know:):)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  so now have to guess @d to push board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: messing around|pg||
nt|joest: nor spades for that matter|pg||
nt|kit: King of clubs shift quite sensible -- if partner has Axx of clubs, only way to beat the contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: maybe needed to pound pards suit |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: at least not yet|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but looks like Woolsey can be endplayed |pg||
pc|s8|nt|007 joosth: well AQ  diamonds are known|pg||
nt|007 joosth: endplay with a diamond?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  lots of work for  down 2 :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: usually it is the declarer who has the advantage, but this time it will be the defense -- 1NT down 1 at both tables|pg||
pc|s9|nt|007 joosth: should be automatic indeed|pg||
nt|joest: i think a slight inference that bates has 4 hearts b/c not likely to switch to a low one from xxx|pg||
nt|joest: not cast iron|pg||
nt|ahollan1: players have worked very hard for such a low scoring set|pg||
nt|kit: Key at other table was could unblock the spades|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will take 1 shot at ruffing out queen of hearts, and will then take club finesse.|pg||

nt|barnets: 60 im told|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ends today|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That's correct - the USA1 final is 90 boards because the way the USA2 bracket works, they needed 2 days opposite the USA1 finals, so it doesn't make anyone stay an extra day to ...|pg||

mb|3N|nt|007 joosth: Cohen has no good bid    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16    you just need to count using new math|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why i mentioned that   they were on defense this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: This contract doesn't rate to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stewart opened 1N=10-12 and described exact shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: have seen this hand make 4 hts but e/w were only in 2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Leading club to king is tiny bit better since doesn't lose to stiff queen -- to play North for queen, must run jack first round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N might be start of short suit game try|pg||
nt|kit: Bates taking a scientific approach -- I would expect him to just bid game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=17-18   [i think 19 opens 2N]|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N has too much defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 10's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit is this   DBL = 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|santyclz: As expected the open room got to 4@h on 12, things have tightened up.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|007 joosth: sure almost a double|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1 quickly|pg||
nt|ady: lead obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not|pg||
nt|ady: as said all boils down to club guess|pg||
nt|kit: I guess so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might talk Bates out of super accept|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1N opener  that DBL can also be 1-suit @C or @D|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N plays reasonably well, spade lead would have been best |pg||
nt|kit: this contract could be close, but will probably make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kirp:  Cant see them missing slam here|pg||
nt|kirp:  but still 9 trix, assuming you get clubs right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  those who think down 2 are optomists or pessimists|pg||
nt|kirp:  E knows Kx in @Cs is great|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my favorite online toy  Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator  says East worth 13.65   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: diff lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade i guess|pg||
pc|c9|nt|007 joosth: S will reason that N is broke|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok almost:)|pg||
nt|joest: i like that reasoning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit  haven't seen 3rd seat opener with 4 AND extra values|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: can't on drugs be an option?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he also knows too many points in reds|pg||
nt|kit: North doesn't figure to have a small singleton club, as with that he might shift to a club|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  always is, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been easier for East if Bates could complete his shape|pg||
nt|ady: will be almost impossible to get decent count|pg||
nt|kit: So on that basis, I think declarer should get it wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room auction very similar except here we didn't know North's minor until the opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and not a good lead for the defense|pg||
nt|kit: No, looks like it allows a make|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|joest: i had a feeling the the ten was coming|pg||
nt|baldfriede: undo|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: final set supposed to start in about 10 minutes    color me skeptical|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: nice lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought he'd try Jack   just to confirm|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade again|pg||
nt|kit: should be able to take 2 spades, 1 heart, 4 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: auction seemed to scream    lead trump THEN look at your hand|pg||
nt|kit: He figures to guess hearts, so will take 6 hearts and 3 diamonds to make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|kirp:  whatever the auction, 6@S looks solid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: trying not to be endplayed|pg||
nt|kit: Also North has 2 spades, South 3 -- another argument for playing North for longer clubs, hence queen.|pg||
nt|kit: Now 2 hearts, making it easier|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jwit: This should fail by 2 or 3 tricks, but NS can probably make a part score, so no disaster|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce should try the @h finesse even though his sure it won't work|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems dropping K of H is last chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well credit Wold for upgrading his hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  which means O'Rourke is now in the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry missed a pass--contract is 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Kathy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: robbins didn't bid|pg||
nt|kirp:  think you can take 4 @C trix|pg||
nt|kit: Many would not have made a takeout double on Boyd's hand, but passing can be just as dangerous -- would not have gotten to game if he had passed.|pg||
nt|kirp:  Boyd's action i think won this board|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kirp:  actual score is 27-21|pg||

nt|barnets: I am told east was thrown in with a heart and dec did not take the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chorush: I think declarer will take the diamond finesse here after this lead|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems starnge not to lad @HK or ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  This is automatic, but heartfelt none-the-less: Thanks to BBO - Fred, Uday - for making this possible. To Jan who works tirelessly to make arrangements, to train operators and to make sure there are a sufficiant number|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Sutherlin: "you are playing Smith Echo, right?" Kasle: "yes we are"|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chorush: Now if Kasle discards 2 diamonds (preferably including the 10) declarer might go wrong (if he believes Kasle didnt lead a high heart holding the AK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|nt|chorush: And if believes that Kasle would have led a spade from Kx holding the diamond king as well|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d5|nt|barnets: in closed had west pitched a spade in the end game dec would have to guess ishe started with 2 or 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry tha t was east who had KX spade|pg||
nt|barnets: pitches a spade \|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec would go down by exiting|pg||
nt|barnets: follow it on movie|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chorush: I think that the discarding has made it impossible to declarer to play for throw in|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|barnets: kasle did not need to blank his @SK as he led it !!|pg||

nt|andyv:  feels like a football game...a huddle after every play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: We are in a hotel room that has a convenient bathroom.|pg||
nt|joest: final hand of the 2nd quarter|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok ty all for kibitzing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Jack and and All thanks 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 2 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand of this set now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of Q1   3 more sets today for the USA2 "Semi Final"    USA1 final only has one more set today |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|joest: and to Kathy our operator|pg||
nt|joest: classic Michaels call|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our operator |pg||
nt|kirp:  think the @S duck was unnecessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c so looks like 2@c is natural|pg||
nt|joest: I would expect to see the closed room auction duplicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow will be  60 boards for Senior USA2 Final  Lynch vs Kasle  and final 64 boards for Women USA2  Sprung vs Joel|pg||
nt|kirp:  he had the rest|pg||
mb|1C|nt|007 joosth: play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably the same opening lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: to see it yourself move your mouse over the open room result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jwit: EW will get to 4H here. Will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our thanks to Jan Martel who organizes everything, and thx to USBF for bringing this to bbo |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the afternoon     restart of USA2 SemiFinal in about 2 hours 20 minutes|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the last board of this segment.  The next seqment is due to start in about 20 min.|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  EW may be able to find a cheap save in @hs |pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably 4-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, not 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checl local start times  using http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Women's USA2 Final [96 boards] will start then too|pg||
nt|kit: Wold hoping opponents stay in notrump, but he will be disappointed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chick: 4@S easy, an overtrick on the expected heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|joest: my prediction wasn't so hot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some science in play here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always feels wrong bidding AFTER opp have exchanged info|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  N might have done better to bid 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  will someone explain this sequence|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson likely will compete to 3@S, which appears to make on favorable heart suit despite 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it had to be pointed out to me     another hand where same team played 1N in both rooms   |pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: a light opener. maybe getting to high now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could come home, but not enough imps |pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: South did well not to double. Knowledge of bad trump break might have given declarer a fighting chance.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good lead for defense|pg||
nt|joest: i can't leave AKxx of hearts unbid.  If they double me, I apologize I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack if it makes you feel any better   i made same prediction 40 minutes ago|pg||
nt|007 joosth: haha|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW open lighter than most|pg||
nt|kirp:  so W is catering to light OB|pg||
nt|ady: club start  amd diamond return should beat 3@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  S can afford to lose 2@s and a @c|pg||
nt|chick: will lose only one of each on this lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here is there opportunity|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential pickup for Westheimer here, open room stopping in 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: I agree -- I think Wold should get right out there with 3@C-- and if he had, he might have stolen the pot|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N makes easily here, clubs 33 and k@D onside|pg||
nt|kirp:  E is endplayed at trick 1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: very bad hand for 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|007 joosth: glad I did not say a word:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N goes down on @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're pretty normal for context of big club system|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: the USA2 Senior matches are 60 boards   USA1 Senior Final is 90    Women are playing 96 board matches now  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 bracket = undefeated teams   USA2 = 1 loss  [so lose again, go home]|pg||
nt|pef: sorry Joanne Sprung|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 17-19|pg||
nt|friggi: sry router problem|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us....final set of this segment to start in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what a lead...|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a chance now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW haven't played much together  otherwise Ferguson might have just tried 2N|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little too deep for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe thinking Casen could bid this way with 1435 and singleton @SQ/J ??|pg||
nt|andyv:  still a pretty deep position to take.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a lead that isn't??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D fairly passive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is this an auction that calls for passive lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew still stunned by the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem is augmented by the holding of 10x with the K, blowing the whole suit apart for the defense if you are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit   i wouldn't have counted either of the last 2 hands the way Wold did|pg||
nt|kirp:  that may still beat it|pg||
nt|kirp:  but its now closer than you might think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N would have been interesting|pg||
nt|kit: spade king on doesn't hurt either|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: Cohen with a surpised winner |pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: in any event it is going to prove to be an expensive pass resulting in a double game swing|pg||
nt|kirp:  Made only 3S in other room, so not clear cut. Looks like N is vulnerable to endplays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Schermer's hand too good to beat 3N|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  and you can be sure that lead will not be duplicated at other table|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer needs to unblock the @s, but aFTER THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES TO DUMMY|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming @S worth 5 tricks -- what's best try for  9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe immediate guess of @C10?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Think he'll play for something good to happen in @Ds and@Ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D7 could have been from 87x|pg||
nt|kirp:  N coul have lead from 3 or 4 small @Ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right  or 87xx|pg||
nt|warrens:  this really is a friendly layout|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chick: no, wrong|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries and W known to be long in 2 other suits, lead the 10 and run it|pg||
nt|kit: We can see it is cold with diamond finesse, but remember declarer can't see that|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|007 joosth: the biggest swing of the session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but IF [keyword] you expect a better hand in West   what does partner hold  and which lead works for that holding|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: there goes that option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15 boards remain in this match to see who plays 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: Once again this hand shows the value of the strong hand being declarer -- defense doesn't know where the high cards are|pg||
nt|kirp:  2@H may look like a @D entry|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hackenbush: can't really go wrong here, clubs 5-2 and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: O'Rourke will finish with 13 more and take the lead at the half|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  almost:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: probably not same auction either|pg||
pc|cA|nt|007 joosth: as I said N might be advised to read the book of the other Cohen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: why a heart to the Q    KJxx might be in N to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 44  Bates did double 4@H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did he need to either  hook @C  or  reverse dummy|pg||
nt|kit: If Wold knew the hand he could have attacked diamonds in time|pg||
nt|kit: no way declarer did that|pg||
nt|kit: He will be thinking that East may have king of diamonds and be looking for endplay|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  gtg...bye all!|pg||
nt|kit: or is there?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: but i admit unable to ignore seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my plan was for Wold to think longer at trick 1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|007 joosth: 1 tr back again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke team has playes extremely well this set|pg||
nt|007 joosth: harte now would be fine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: heart|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d7|nt|joest: thanks all|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to the kibitzers|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure what the restart is.  Sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about 2 hours|pg||
nt|joest: ok thanks Al|pg||
nt|joest: bye all|pg||
nt|007 joosth: bye|pg||
nt|kirp:  Good guess, but no matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it ruled out down 3 :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer deep in thought.  Head on table.|pg||
nt|jwit: Looks like declarer still has to come up a trick short here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: again thx and we will see you all tomorrow|pg||
nt|kirp:  N knows W's shape by now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|kirp:  if EW go  down on this, then we are even going into last two sessions|pg||
nt|chorush: that seems surprising; seem like he had a sure beat by rising and giving ruff on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think he can make from here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if play another trump  lose 2@H @D & @S   if play @H  Chambers @SJ promotes 2nd trump|pg||
pc|d3|nt|007 joosth: well  just made after the 2d present|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of different auction    Rosenberg didn't open East hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can imagine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's Milt Rosenberg     Michael isn't old enough  |pg||
nt|ady: last hand of session|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson needed 2 discards, so thought heart finesse right -- he didn't know spades 4-1.  But I still don't see the play.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Women's USA2 Final   after 1 of 6 sets  Sprung leads Joel by 7|pg||
nt|friggi: thx all for the odd comments, but they have to be there - o r what?|pg||
nt|kit: So he will cash last club and exit with heart|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final set in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well   here its bedtime  so ty all     and gl  next session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't dream about THIS hand Joost|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Seniors = 60+ this year|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know it used to be younger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 means safe to knock out @D without hoping for @C33   i think|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: cashing ace of diamonds first good idea|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: did Boyd's @C play matter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boom|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did i miscount tricks?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kirp:  actually Kasle is due to go up by 10 imps, all due to last 2 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart 2 hours 10 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 30 boards remain in this match|pg||
nt|kirp:  thx all, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to play in USA1 Final  Schwartz  leads Lynch by 52    we can probably call that one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women USA1 Final  1 to play  Moss 210 Sprung 175   congratulations Team Moss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women USA2 SemiFinal  2 to score  Joel over Westheimer by 7    wow|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kirp:  if S had flown on the @C and shifted to @Hs, more undertrix|pg||
nt|kirp:  still down 1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   i had feeling just couldn't work out the details|pg||
nt|baldfriede: thank you all; an interesting match|pg||
nt|kirp:  thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart pretty soon  don't run too far|pg||
nt|kit: Now the end-play -- if Lynch had blanked king of spades, Robinson would have had a problem|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|warrens:  yes, but isn't it better to play the last club before cashing the Ace|pg||
mc|9|nt|warrens:  if she had pitched a @H instead of a @D on the last @C, he was down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|kirp:  thx ll|pg||
nt|kirp:  all|pg||
pg||
