nt|Vugraphzfk: the director's ruling was +620 for Sprung|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this doesn't look too bright for South|pg||

nt|psyck: i was expecting a simple 3@h raise on 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the contaxt of his previous bids, West's hand is pretty good over partner's 4@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd expect 5@h|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  it is true that slam would be excellent if East's values were not in spades|pg||

mb|p|pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: maybe they do things differently across the pond, but in England a match of this stature would NEVER restart under such circumstances|pg||

nt|paulg:  pass is available?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they don't play support XX, then i'm pretty much assure of that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: that 1@s is automatic with any 4 cards @s, that is|pg||
nt|psyck: yes could be say Aqxx kx xx Aqxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: also more possible hands with no supp xx as Yuval says|pg||
mb|3D|an|natural, invitational|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|yuval10: nice gadget to play here - 3@d invitational|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|psyck: that is what i play too :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  these invitational bids becoming more popular|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: looks like W needs to play 4th @h here in order to defeat|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c9|nt|psyck: 4th @h promotes trump|pg||
nt|yuval10: it may cost though if E has KX @d and KXXXX @c|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: if @c9 was encouraging, that possible layout may make W shift to @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: if E had the JXX @d the situation is more obvious and he could've discourage @c ( or enoucrage @s which is "unreasonable" ) to ask Partner to play 4th @h|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|Vugraphzfk: on the appeal hand, the comm ruled 4@H -1, so Moss has 12 more IMPs than the score shows|pg||
pg||
qx|c83|st||md|1SAQ874H654DQCQJ73,SKJT6HKQJ7DT74C86,SHT983DAK86532CK5,S9532HA2DJ9CAT942|sv|e|nt|mikam1: Interesting to see what Moss will do over the 1@C opening|pg||
nt|mikam1: Either pass or 1@S is possible|pg||
nt|mikam1: Or 2@C if played as natural of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps 2@c would be natural if 1@C can be short |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: She went (reasonably) for the 4 card overcall|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@s - Mike Lawrence would approve|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's what we are here for, Peter - to prove that errare humanum est  |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Looks like this will end it|pg||
nt|tez: 2 nt 3@h all pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 2@c would be 5/4 majors, even ove short @c|pg||
nt|pef: north seems far too good to open 3d in first of second seat, but I think many would have in third seat.  you risk losing a heart fit, but make it easier for them to compete in ...|pg||
nt|pef: spades.  interesting tradeoff|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|pef: Mike will be doing the Latin commentary, by the way|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: 2@h presumably nf....but South might think F if rebidding 2NT|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@s 3@h..we play this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Tough play here for West I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always a thorny question, whether 1@C-(1@s)-2@h should be forcing or not |pg||
nt|mikam1: She doesn't even know if partner has 2 or 3 spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pef: I predict that 3nt will not be a successful contract on this board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the kind of thing that not knowing the score can do - in a match that was tighter (the ruling goes to Sprung) West might have doubled 3NT for a spade lead|pg||
nt|pef: would you have bid 3d or 1d on the north hand in third seat, mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which might have led to 4@D instead, but the principle is still the same |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well this will be a winner :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mikam1: Good play by Radin...this will set up a defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|tez: cash @s ace..look to your partners card..if she give 7 of @s..shift @c|pg||
nt|mikam1: Excellent defense all around...but agreed on that point Tezcan|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mikam1: There is a "slight" chance the second spade wouldn't cash though...if they lead 3rd from 4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 3@D, but obviously it's close  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mikam1: Although granted partner might have raised with 4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|mikam1: well done in any case|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East would surely raise spades with four trumps though|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|mikam1: agreed|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: and might have raised with her actual hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, well defended|pg||
nt|tez: i can say perfect bidding|pg||
nt|mikam1: Are we still here?|pg||
nt|tez: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as aif NS play 2@h as forcing after the 1@s overcall (else South could have passed) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 2N is presumabky minimum and 3@h to play|pg||
nt|mikam1: Most play it's forcing for one round|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pef: she is doing well to hold this to down two|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|yuval10: so it's 43 imps for Moss now, a big mountain for Sprung to claim|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  In much of the rest of the world they would have given a weighted ruling (30% making, 70% down one) but I believe the USBF uses 'most probable' result|pg||

pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: this may be tricky - the cards aren't lying overly kindly|pg||
nt|pef: the lead is a little helpful.  close between a spade and a club lead, but I thik a spade is a little more normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although as it happens a spade lead would have been worse |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pef: why?  or do you mean worse for declarer?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think it's worse for declarer |pg||
nt|pef: yes, that's what I meant, also|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good view there though|pg||

nt|pef: now ace and another heart and a successfull guess in spades ..|pg||
nt|pef: on the previous board, south opened the bidding in first seat, north was able to make an invitational jump to 3d which got passed out.  the defense did not find the trump promotion ...|pg||
nt|pef: so 5 imps to moss to extend their lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - three rounds of hearts and a trump switch|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: how's the Committee doing? Has it woken up yet? |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|pef: exiting, that is :)|pg||
mc|7|nt|mdgraham: that may be a couple more imps to Moss|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: The committee ruled likely 4H contract, above 50% that defense would get it right, so 4H would be down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Looks like 12 IMPS to Moss|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Gary - that presumably makes a bit of difference to the score - and can there be an appeal, or is that it?   |pg||
nt|pef: wow, I didn't expect that|pg||
nt|pef: hard to predict the solomonic wisdom of committees|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must disagree - the Committee would cut the baby in half. According to the story, Solomon didn't|pg||
nt|pef: on the last board, JoAnna Stansby in the south seat did lead a spade which led to down 2, so 9 imps on the opening lead against 1nt|pg||
nt|pef: ah, true, solomon only threatened to do that|pg||
pg||

mb|2C|nt|psyck: it was a little easier for declarer as the defense went other table i guess|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|paulg:  it was a club lead in the other room and it was natural for declarer to get the hearts right|pg||
mb|4C|nt|psyck: everyone has suits & values & want to show them here|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|nt|yuval10: or is it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Bernstein looking for swings perhaps|pg||
nt|psyck: doubleton @h not tempting for W to bid one, generally single or 3 carders better sech cases|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|pef: I didn't even realize that the moss team had an appeal, I thought it was the sprung team appealing the removal of three spades doubled to 4 hearts by the director|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|mikam1: In fact, I'm not sure that declarer can't time this just right in any case|pg||

nt|mdgraham: seems a bit of a downer to finish with a 1NT contract |pg||

pc|d9|nt|mikam1: Well on this lie of the cards 1N was going to do ok anyway, so not a big deal |pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mikam1: but I like that play|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: the OR seems a bit behind -the hands must be more difficult in there|pg||

pc|h5|nt|pef: not the best time for a four card suit overcall in the open room.  a surprising 500 for the moss team to increase their margin|pg||
