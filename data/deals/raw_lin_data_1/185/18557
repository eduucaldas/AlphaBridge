nt|Vugraphzfk: sorry, we all went down -- i'll be away for a minute getting other tables back iup|pg||
nt|othered1: High leads in partner's suit against suit contracts can be tough to read|pg||
nt|athene: lead @S8 from @S874 is fine if you raised spades|pg||
nt|athene: then pd knows it's probably three small|pg||
nt|othered1: But east didn't.  I agree about leading top from ugly holdings if you've supported voluntarily|pg||

nt|athene: or the defence slipped up|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfk: really was 8 tricks. sorry.  caught up now I hope -- all tables went down|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: ah, okie|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D "third suit forcing" - even people with no agreements often will bid that on a fragment but many pairs just go the whole hog and treat it completely artificially|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I hope the operators will have time to enter the scores manually|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what 2@S would have been over 2@C, though?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Joe is getting there, the CR operator not I'm afraid|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm, i am not sure you really want to do that, do you, south?|pg||
nt|athene: are you quite sure you can beat 3@S?|pg||
nt|athene: or, to pick a contract out of the air, 12@S?|pg||
nt|athene: [3@SXX]|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: she obviously feels there is no way opps can have a spade fit by this late stage :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course east might be a bit worried about leaving this in|pg||
nt|athene: east does seem to have done a lot of bidding - hasn't she basically forced this to game?|pg||
nt|athene: that's ok with shapely hands IF you catch a fit|pg||
nt|athene: can go wrong if you don't, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had passed she might have ended up defending against 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The connection from Romania, a hi tech country, is excellent|pg||
nt|athene: east knows her partner has SOMETHING in spades from the 2nt bid|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't know she has three|pg||
nt|athene: but i think the way the auction has gone, pass has to be right|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she is thinking "Ok, if this is going to make, i should redouble, and if not, i should not pass"|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the trouble is you don't know if it's going to make :) a good example of the best action possible not being the same as the best possible action|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: can make four now in various ways|pg||
nt|athene: she certainly won't want to rely on a 3-3 heart break|pg||
nt|athene: she would like to throw the diamonds and ruff a heart, but if she has to keep ruffing clubs to get back to hand she might lose trump control|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't think spades are 3-2 either!|pg||
nt|athene: the basic decision she has to make is|pg||
nt|athene: "am i going to try and just crossruff, or am i going to try and draw trumps and keep trump control and actually use the hearts as winners"|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think she is putting south with five decent spades|pg||
nt|athene: south would bid 1@S over 1@H with five decent spades|pg||
nt|athene: but she might have @SAKJx or five not so good (@SKJxxx)|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry, of course south can't have five without the tops :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok so she is assuming AKJx then surely|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that leading the @DQ was a much better idea|pg||
nt|othered1: nice guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: the point is, if they capture it, you have an entry to hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|athene: and if they don't, you stole a trick and you can throw your other diamond on the @CK|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|s9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: has some squeeze chances if @H don'tsplit|pg||
nt|athene: well she can claim now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: director called re info about the 3@S call|pg||
nt|athene: with 3 club tricks, 3 hearts, diamond and trump|pg||
nt|athene: that's 8 of the last 6, so squeeze not needed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Stansby was told 3@S was not natural, probably was shortness  On the other side of the table, of course, 3@S was described as natrual|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i thought we might get a director call - south would never double with that holding if she suspected 3@S could be a 5-card suit at that point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's a problem|pg||
nt|othered1: intereesting director call, especially after the double on KJx, not everyone's cup of tea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Different explanations that is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: was described as "shortness or doubt about NT"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that's for the TD to sort out, and he will in due course|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: she is doing so now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She, sry|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably not a discussed sequence -- at least not that it could be bid on this pattern  . . . . |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: they are going to cancel the X but it is unclear what contract they will allow|pg||
nt|athene: they tend to lean in favour of the side that received mis-explanation, which i think is fair enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: I'll leave it for now, but it will change|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: unless the people calling for the adjustment obviously took a two-way shot|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Regardless of ruling, one side may appeal |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In this case E-W of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After the double was cancelled|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|athene: some might get to 4@H on these cards, mainly by opening the north hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe change the score to 3@S with no double, Joe?|pg||
nt|athene: but it's asking quite a lot even vul|pg||
nt|athene: they certainly can't (famous last words) change it to 3@S undoubled can they?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: it is clear the W would bid over 3@S, so I don't think it will be 3@S as the final contract|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: ok i don't know the methods that well but it looked for sure as though east had forced to game|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not saying about fairness, merely that 930 makes no sense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: seems to me that E should have bid 2@S over 2@D -- no need for the prepared 2@D when you bid @H and then  want to bid @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that 3@S would not be the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most likely 4@H|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|casenjo:  so, the queston is: Why did Stansby double? for a spade lead against 3NT....not clear that is the lead she wants|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: No one is defending the double I think|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|casenjo:  So, why should the double be removed?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Because of misinformation|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are in trouble if you try to guess when asked by the TD. "No agreement" is the way forward|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|h2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: There are exceptions based on the action of south in this case (irrational, wild, gambling, or the like).  Misguided (putting it as nicely as I can) isn't one of them.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  2@D was clearly just a forcing bid, to hear more about partner's hand, I think te double should stand|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The only person misguided was West, this dirctor call seems like a two way shot|pg||
nt|athene: well, south is entitled to try to work out the likely east hand based on what she has been told|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's leave it to the competent TD, and perhaps to the AC later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not our job to give rulings anyway|pg||

nt|mikam1: This is interesting...if 2N-3N, perhaps North should double |pg||

nt|mikam1: I'd lead a diamond here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tez: Maj or @d?|pg||
nt|mikam1: But if partner had doubled, it would call for my short major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a bad shot, either, with the @DA as an entry|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|mikam1: You might even cause West to run, fearing 5 or 6 tricks in either major for the defense|pg||
