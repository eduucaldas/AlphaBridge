mb|2D!|nt|psyck: Do you Michaels or bid 2@h on 1@s here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: multi 2@d. showing weak in either Maj. but that suit maybe not to everyone's standard|pg||
mb|2N|mb|d|nt|ntmon: i like 2@D bid - always brings difficulties to opps|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  I would michaels it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: ok, we get to see how either approach works :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. if playing it strong|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this should end the auction|pg||
nt|blewah: i guess 3@h now shows minimum, fast arrival|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT a maker because no entry to @H|pg||
nt|ntmon: but NS can find a save|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5D|nt|psyck: Agree Andy|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andyv:  hi CK:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Is what I shouldnt have said|pg||
nt|ntmon: forcing pass by E ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: Hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Commentator's curse strikes again|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|oosmanb: this is ambitious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only safe prediction is not to predict|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oosmanb: with 5@S and just 2@D I dont think W should be interested in advancing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: minimal values, very likely misfit hands|pg||
nt|josj: and no adequate stops in either black suit...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: As south I would be most upset that partner didnt start with A@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South only bid the suit and then dbled|pg||
nt|ntmon: i would vote for a forcing pass! E has @HA to marked singleton and unexpeced support for partner|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  S came here to bid!|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, slam is a make and ns almost pushed by opps to the unbeatable @d slam|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwi_joker: this will be interesting|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oosmanb: now he'll switch to K@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  S will have to set up @ds...I don't see how he makes this|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: a couple of @d's to lose & once he ruffs some @c, has to lose trump|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: will ruff a @c & run @dT now i suppose|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and be most upset|pg||
pc|d7|nt|blewah: EW i meant|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oosmanb: lucky they have another suit on the side to cash out|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  choices pretty limited|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|psyck: J now, but saving beer card won't help|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: looks like -1, coz he cant to everything (cross ruff the whole hand AND make a long diamond trick)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  now back to board and @d back hoping to crash honors?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: haha, i like the way you think, andy  :)|pg||
nt|psyck: actually he is playing for xruff now|pg||
nt|psyck: hoping for 1@d, 1@c & 9 trumps|pg||
nt|psyck: the problem with that is that when he ruffs @h, E can discard @c|pg||
nt|blewah: but can be beaten by @s ruff. right|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: I'm being asked with the dbl actually told pd NOT to lead @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Some people do play those dbls|pg||
nt|ntmon: @D played by W|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Rainbow :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|oosmanb: But I think its safe to assume here that this South DID want a @S lead|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|psyck: which was why i expected him to finess @d|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: he chose Andy's line :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: actually xruff may have worked, needs another look|pg||
nt|andyv:  so looks like a 13 imp loss to Minahasa|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|andyv:  now @s|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, i see no reason whe he could not have made 11 trick after @dK won on cross  ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes but Manoppo would not do that with the spades he had|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And hence we can deduce they play regular lead asking dbls|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  22 vs 0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: They got -4 though, so North survives to tell the tale|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything seems to be reversed nowadays|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|psyck: too bad, he declarer did start the play well until then to justify his bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Like the American woman last night who played a hand very well and went 4 down|pg||
nt|ntmon: the thing is to find right time to leave when using shaded openings|pg||
nt|blewah: ah, NS plays weak NT|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Contradiction? Perhaps, but she did play it well|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: -4 is good bridge then!|pg||
nt|blewah: so, 1@c in the previous board was not an upgrade but systemic|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Can be|pg||
nt|ntmon: or it is a standard :) upgrade|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|josj: depends on the contract, maybe|pg||

mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: The trend seems to be that you open 1NT on all kinds of shapes|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should go down 2|pg||
nt|blewah: i guess 2@c by N is a transfer overcall. anybody knows?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong club (Precision) is the popular system in Indonesia|pg||
nt|ntmon: now the bidding rides into 4@S|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, Roland but natural system increasingly popular too nowadays|pg||
nt|blewah: i blame BBO for this phenomenon :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: east thinking about slam investigation?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosmanb: interesting bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good effort if they can reach 6@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes indeed and 4@s is a step in that direction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A contract with problems when clubs and hearts split badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But a great contract when looking at the N-S cards only|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Manoppo could have bid 5NT instead, choice of slams|pg||

pc|s2|nt|andyv:  (unless N tries to float the 10@s)|pg||

nt|oosmanb: let him choose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: looks like an easy dummy-reversal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: easy? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ruffing 2 spades in hand with diamonds as entries looks like a plan|pg||
