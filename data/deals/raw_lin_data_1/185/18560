mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|chorush: Yes, it takes a diamond lead to defeat it and E is more likely to lead one than West|pg||
mb|4N|nt|henryb:  1@c 16+, 1@d 0-7, 2@h apparently forcing, 2@s and 3@s natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@H was 23 bal or strong hearts or @H + another suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: N "what in the world happened here"|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  But a successful one in a sense: North was about to go down in 6@s and has 10 top tricks in NT|pg||
mc|10|nt|chorush: All depends on how the auction goes in the other room. If south treats his hand as Kokish, they will play from North. If he treats it as balanced, they will play from South in a ...|pg||

nt|barnets: A diamond lead wil defeat 6@S here|pg||
nt|barnets: but declarer may make it on the @HK lead|pg||
nt|barnets: as he can establise a heart for diamond pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: he has to guess that west has the @H 10 and not east|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: a coffee 4@s this one|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S!|an|Weak|nt|kit: 4@S should be easy to get to, but play might not be clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: no cancel that|pg||

nt|barnets: and his fifth heart is good for one pitch|pg||

nt|brgpro: even if declarer ducks the first @d lead he is home|pg||
nt|kit: On stiff jack of diamonds lead, how should declarer play it.  Remember, he can't see all 4 hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: had dummy 3 diamonds then he would have a guess|pg||
nt|barnets: the contract in the open room appears to be 4N|pg||
nt|barnets: If 4N was RKC it was not unexpected that north had 0|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The reason that you don't see the Women's Final match is that there was an appeal from a ruling in the 5th segment and the committee is meeting before the final segment so the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: teams know the state of the match. As soon as they have ruled, the final segment will start|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Robb Gordon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That is also why we've lost Kit as a commentator - he is on the committee - |pg||
nt|barnets: now west may x for lead|pg||
nt|barnets: against spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|robbg:  Good morning|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: he has x for a heart lead|pg||
nt|robbg:  Presumable 6@h asked for 2nd round @h control.|pg||
nt|barnets: a heart lead and it will make|pg||
nt|barnets: down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: the only lead to set it is a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: hi robb|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair asked Hamilton what he meant by 2@s - we've now summoned the director to find out what the bids meant on both sides of the screen. South thought 2@s was a fit showing jump, ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hamilton thought it was weak. Now everyone knows what the explanations were. Hamilton is confident that he is correct about their agreement|pg||
nt|robbg:  hi - I wonder what the difference is between doubling 6@h and doubling 6@s|pg||
nt|robbg:  Ahh that explains the RKC and the 6@h|pg||
nt|barnets: then he doubled for the lead|pg||
nt|robbg:  Probably so, now that we know that west thought the jump was fit showing.|pg||
nt|barnets: whose side of the screen is Lair on please?|pg||
nt|robbg:  s anw w|pg||
nt|robbg:  Fisher/Lair|pg||
nt|barnets: so lair got an explanation that north had hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: an was misled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I Just found out that he did in fact DBL 6@h - sorry. Weichsel is unhappy about the fact that Hamiton first told him "weak" verbally then wrote it and also wanted to clarify that ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 6@h or the DBL of 6@h was after a substantial huddle|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|kit: this is strange play -- didn't he draw the last trump?|pg||

nt|henryb:  I guess Morse and Wolff play more constructive preempts than I do. But it is the bits and pieces outside that will make 3N a success|pg||
nt|chorush: Their preempts are frozen in 1965|pg||
nt|henryb:  In 1965 East would need a seventh club :)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|henryb:  The reason I say they are more constructive is that it would not occur to me to bid 3N|pg||

nt|brgpro: well, actually, after a claim, if defenders dont agree, they cant ask dec. to continue play|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 imps to schwarz when 4@H went down 3 in open|pg||
nt|kit: they can NOT ask declarer to continue to play|pg||
nt|brgpro: they have to call director...|pg||
nt|brgpro: that's what i meant, cant|pg||
nt|kit: if they don't agree, they call the director and he resolves it|pg||
nt|brgpro: can't|pg||
nt|barnets: had he not x 6@H then X of 6@S is for a heart|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: and if they had done so, the resolution would have been down 1|pg||
nt|brgpro: happened in the 2000 olympiad teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: anway Lynch fighting back|pg||
nt|barnets: bid game n/s here in open|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: W asks about carding: "3rd & 5th, UDCA, odd/even first discard"|pg||
nt|robbg:  They might lose a small swing back here.|pg||
nt|robbg:  Wolff took a more sanguine view of the West hand in the open room.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|brgpro: England against Belgium|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: the strong 1@C opener will make it easy for E-W to stop low in clubs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|brgpro: seems both rooms play constructive weak twos...that's why both rooms reached 4@h on the first|pg||

pc|c9|nt|brgpro: i thought W might reopen a X, but seems he didnt dare to risk it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Passell tells Fisher that Lynch should not have a 4 card Major for this auction|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brgpro: aha|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lynch asks about spot card leads - "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|brgpro: so they start with 1M had she had one?|pg||
nt|barnets: on the layout 4@s e/w makes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, that's what he explained|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|barnets: and to beat 5@C the defense must lead or switch to a heart|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
mc|11|nt|Vugraphzfb: very short break - Lair went to get something while he was dummy and isn't back yet (a monitor went with him)|pg||
nt|barnets: that was 6 imps for Schwarz|pg||
nt|barnets: I had some questions about lead directing xs|pg||
nt|barnets: according to the classic book by Bob Ewen|pg||

nt|danilo1: strange only 2@H by North ... hand is valid at least 17 Distributives|pg||
nt|robbg:  So this should be 10 IMPS to Lynch.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "that's a flaw in your system"  ... Weichsel: "one of many flaws"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: anyone bid 2@D over 2@C ?|pg||
nt|kit: These hands often not easy to defend optimally -- you just don't expect opponents to be in 6-card fit|pg||
nt|brgpro: once u X, u stay with it...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: 2D might get you to a 4-2 fit also|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|barnets: I agree with 3@H|pg||
nt|barnets: should be 11imps |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair asks about leads and carding - A from AK, upside down attitude and count|pg||
nt|danilo1: me too .. but skipping 2@H first :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: think might go 3 down|pg||

nt|robbg:  Freddy Hamilton is one of a group of brilliant players to come out of Michigan in the 1960's, mostly adhering to Roth-Stone methods. Freddy had a great track record at the national and world level mostly in the '70s|pg||
nt|robbg:  He was able to tame the Beast (Ira Rubin) and they had much success.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Neither of them said (or wrote rather) whetehr 3@d showed extra values, or just that he had shortness somewhere|pg||

nt|barnets: short clubs means nrth needs  both re suits controlled|pg||

nt|kit: probaly this is last train sort of call -- I think South will go|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brgpro: usually 3@c shows all min. and 3@d=non-min with shortness somewhere...i dont know how they play it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm told by a spec that 3@d did indeed show extras|pg||
nt|kit: South figures to have both red suits controlled -- it is third round where the potential problems are|pg||
