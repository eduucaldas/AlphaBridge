nt|bagman: Sprung-Robertson Balderson-Miner Bernstein-Wheeler for Sprung|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|bagman: S has made a very aggressive raise to 4 spades; I wonder what would E need to X |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: i checked, no X|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bagman: maybe @S9 instead of @S5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|jcwla: Admittedly the S hand is the sort of hand where who knows what will make but still this does seem anorexic.|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lots of handling problems even if spades were 2-3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d8|nt|bagman: Now this falls to pieces as E cashes two trumps and puts partner in with a heart to cash the diamonds and give a diaomond ruff|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|bagman: They still have 48 to go; maybe take this set easyish and see if they can recover and then for the last 32 try to do some shooting if required|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcwla: True, -3 does make the pass of 4@S seem somewhat timorous.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|roswolf: ns in the other room on 49 got way too high 4@S-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3rd @c promotes a trump as 5th trick for defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: Some partnerships like to use a redouble here (by South) as a raise with one of the top honors.  Then the immediate raise won't get partner off to a bad lead.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a muilderberg 2@S showing a weak 2 suiter would be interesting |pg||
nt|swanson: You're right - playing the opponents to have made a great play is a losing proposition.  Better to be tricked and congratulate them after the hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: if n/s are in aggressive mode may well bid 3nt/4@H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the normal opening may fare much worse|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: that seemed to stop abruptly|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: lot of work to do but may get home here|pg||
nt|roswolf: fancy defence will prevail|pg||
nt|psyck: trumps unfav, but everything else works fine|pg||
nt|psyck: can even get away with losing just the trump tricks & nothing else|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond loser?|pg||
nt|psyck: on @s|pg||
nt|psyck: with the points balanced 20-20, NS were going to win the auction at this vul, quite lieky other table will also play in same spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: CONSERVATIVE MODE|pg||
nt|roswolf: solidity personified|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|swanson: The pass my South is clear.  North might have found an excuse to promote here flat 14 to a 1NT opening, but I don't see one.|pg||

nt|jcwla: W a max on HCP.|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|bagman: A hert lead would have been more challenging and would have probably beaten the contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: duh|pg||
nt|bagman: Even a heart after the high diamond would have been tough for the declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: As to game invites, I like the invites to be solid and the acceptances liberal.  Play 2NT/3M as infrequently as necessary and be relatively safe when we have to.|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can make 4 spades, 2 diamonds, a heart and needs two club tricks; when in with the @CK, S can push a heart thru|pg||

nt|roswolf: hi bob|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: No chance for even 2NT here after the normal heart lead because the @CK is offside.|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart lead should scupper this with the club K wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: has to guess either rounded suit|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be very good news for sprung|pg||
nt|puncher99: big swing here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: K apparently asked attitude|pg||
nt|swanson: No time to shift now.  It is tough to see how the diamond continuation was tempting with the J8xx in dummy.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|swanson: The three hearts with two honors was difficult to envision though. |pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|psyck: 4 card majors & non forcing NT, don't see them often|pg||
nt|roswolf: does that specifically show @H+@C or any major + clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1st blood to joel - on 35 4@H went -2|pg||
nt|psyck: the opening could just be due to 3rd seat ofc|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: 2 Lower|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch |pg||
nt|swanson: West doubles here to show good defense for the 2NT overcall, obviously having little to do with her spade holding.|pg||

pc|c5|nt|swanson: The @CK instead of a low one cost a trick.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfk: better colors maybe|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@D makeable also because the defense cannot attack the hearts and one can be discarded on the @SQ|pg||

pc|c6|nt|bagman: N has a typical 3NT bid in this sequence; S has a bit atypical hand for her 3@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: Still, for the S who bid 4@S on the first board of the set, passing 4@H carries a whiff of pusillanimity.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SCHEDULED restart in 30 mins approx|pg||
nt|roswolf: is that a vul opening -not in my book|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a firm 3nt is required|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: spade now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Seems like the 5 of diamonds called for a spade?|pg||
nt|swanson: Balderson has run out of green cards evidently.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: another contract is let through on the lead|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|nt|swanson: This is four diamonds, four spades and two clubs for declarer.  But North coudn't get on play to lead a heart in any event.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfd: It's a thoughtful play to help partner|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|roswolf: more imps to sprung likely|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||
nt|swanson: The defense can cut declarer's communitcation with a second spade, but that is still 9 tricks (and a very unlikely play).|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start is in 2hrs approx|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|swanson: It is best to duck another spade here - insures the contract.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphzfd: Merci :) These women are a joy to watch|pg||
nt|roswolf: cash out winners -seems easy|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|nt|swanson: If declarer had gone up and found North with four spades she could have been in trouble.  Nice play.|pg||
