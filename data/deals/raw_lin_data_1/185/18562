mb|1H|nt|mikam1: Best not to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Tough rebid problem for West after 1@H-2@D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mikam1: Tempting to bid 4@C splinter, especially playing Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: if that's what 4@C would mean|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mikam1: or the simple route|pg||
nt|drg: on one hand, 6@D is missing 2 keycards if you can find that out given the club void, but on the other, 6@D is pretty much on a finesse, so it's not that bad a spot|pg||
nt|mikam1: likely 4@C here|pg||
nt|mikam1: I don't see what else Pollack can bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: east thinking|pg||
nt|drg: she might just try 3NT, it's an awkward position|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, Rozanne Pollack is an excellent player and "careful" too....by that I mean speedwise|pg||
nt|mikam1: 3N just feels "wrong"...although it could be right on some hands|pg||
nt|mikam1: hard to defend the action when partner has no spade stop and you lose the first 5|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|drg: partner didn't splinter in spades though, so a singleton isn't that likely|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well you were right David|pg||
nt|drg: the spade splinter is safer than the club splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drg: west can't really pull given how long it took her to bid 3NT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mikam1: This is a tough declarer play problem|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe the heart finesse is correct|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|drg: indeed a hard problem. The heart finesse seems like the only way to make it on this layout|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|drg: declarer finished now, will lose the clubs when taking the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|mikam1: This won't work|pg||
nt|mikam1: right David|pg||
pc|cA|nt|drg: but the play seems reasonable|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mikam1: I'm still not sure what was right...it does seem reasonable|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|drg: The winning line was a heart finesse or diamonds from hand, followed by ducking 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mikam1: Problem with the spade play is that South would quickly rise when they have the diamond king|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drg: 2@S probably a game try inquiry, and 3N likely showed a balanced max with 3|pg||

nt|mikam1: Tough lead here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mikam1: Not that that matters really|pg||
nt|drg: the lead doesn't seem to matter on this layout|pg||
nt|drg: declarer may have to run this to the J|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think as long as West is careful....this will not make|pg||
nt|drg: if west had held the T@S there may be a winning line, but as east has it and the J is doubleton, I don't think declarer can make|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
nt|drg: 6@C making at the other table, well done there|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder who should have bid clubs|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps even at the end South could have bid 5N if that was "pick a slam"|pg||
nt|drg: The auction from the other room doesn't look all that helpful, it was not recorded correctly|pg||

nt|mikam1: I'm a bit surprised South didn't try for game|pg||
pc|d7|nt|drg: only 22 HCP between them.  it's worse than the spade finesse, sometimes the club ruff isn't with the bare ace of trumps and sometimes you can't avoid the 3rd club loser|pg||

pc|s6|nt|drg: I suppose you could run the Q and see what happens given south's opening|pg||
