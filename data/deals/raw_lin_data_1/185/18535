pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|joest: in the other room, they played 2@s when south chose to raise instead of bidding 1NT: a very plausible alternative|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hackenbush: ah, EW one of few pairs to have submitted a convention card|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/docs/2011uswbc/acblcards/PollackBjerkan.bmp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however disa should not have discarded a diamond, if in fact she did|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wonder if east's 2nt would be the winning bid in the bridge world   many would double|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no thought to leading @S?    North figures to have exactly 4 [pull w/5]  and South exactly 2  [pass w/3]|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|nt|bigtrain: don't like leading from broken 4-card suits...  to costly in the long run|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: Bates covered in case Cohen only had 10x of spades and Wold had 8xx left|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS have no response to final 3 tricks for EW.  In hindsight, S probably wished she'd led a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like leading     period|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: aint that the truth (says the president of the overbidder club)|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: was a very poor effort|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h probably shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can understand it with so many controls|pg||

pc|s9|nt|007 joosth: J of diamonds may be the entry for club tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter  do you use coded 10/9 leads in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  a hand where almost all finesses are off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: so they are playing puppet|pg||

nt|hackenbush: that's more likely, if 2@c and 2@h not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Two diamonds was alerted by West but not by East.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: referring to Stewart's @S shift|pg||
nt|007 joosth: might be 1/3 lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  we use something thats referred to as foster returns|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd from garbage?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  when dummy has small cards we lead second highest unless we want partner to do some high banging|pg||
pc|d8|nt|007 joosth: as in other room no puppet here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|joest: actually you can't determine that by a 3@s rebid :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed:)|pg||
nt|joest: so this presents the ninth trick but the contract is always cold just by keeping east off lead, for overtricks even|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems strange  but the possible entry has gone|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades may even make 5   she will probably make 4 hearts here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|007 joosth: not the lead at 4S  :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: could have doubled 3@D, 3@H was a bit much|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: this hand does not merit much thought, are we still here|pg||

pc|sA|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||
nt|joest: 4 hearts + 4 diamonds + 1 club = 9|pg||

nt|007 joosth: though thefence will not win prizes  this must be a big swing for NS|pg||
nt|joest: I am shocked at the open room result I must admit|pg||
nt|joest: 33 highs and they don't get past 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: and with both kings offside that was the winning move|pg||
nt|joest: not to mention spades 4-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  pretty lucky to make 4@s on this hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: time to play in the worse trump suit?|pg||

nt|007 joosth: with open cards even 4S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: yes you might survive in hearts|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 3S seems right    even with the good clubs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: 1@h was probably artificial|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only an agressive diamond lead will bring the slam?|pg||

pc|dK|nt|joest: not if dummy has AJ8x and declarer has Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: spade is safer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not when you change the 7 and 8?|pg||
nt|joest: i guess a straightforward line is jump, hook the heart, test the spades and fall back on the diamond hook|pg||

nt|007 joosth: yes  sorry    its the other team|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 800 would have been standard?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Hopefully to a stable connection|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jon Wittes|pg||

nt|007 joosth: playing with a Cohen  I would expect some more law|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished|pg||

nt|joest: 1@d-2@c is a difficult auction in Standard that requires a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C either 4-card limit raise  or   Game force    shame usbf can't require convention card submission :(|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  2N probably xfer to @d|pg||

nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|joest: does a 2@d rebid show five?  Does 2 of a major show extras? etc.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes indeed I can recommend the Lawrnce book 2/1 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like limit raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: i think this 2@C has 4@H/@S only if 6+@C|pg||
nt|joest: yes he has a well thought out method in his book|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: routine 4@s here, Westheimer's opening will have to come on one of the last 4 boards|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  2@D=5+|pg||
nt|joest: and then either 3@h followed by 3Nt or just 3NT directly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so   now we have to guess   was 3@H weaker or better than PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: EW slightly stole this one, though they will have to do some scrambling to make this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some play 2D as balanced   11/12  maybe only 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: DBL was lead-direct|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E might play for a ruff|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: I was going to say she would need a safety play in diamonds, but doesn't look like she'll get the chance|pg||

nt|007 joosth: then 2NT can be 13/14  gf  or  18/19|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D didn't deny 4@H/@S  but 3@D did|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @h suit will provide one pitch so S should immediately play it |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: but Bates-Wold play precision so |pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead maybe  but N did not double 3H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|007 joosth: fine lead here|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs lead second highest from four small and so, apparently, does this north-south pair|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  now can get to board with K@c to pitch other @c on @h|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|jwit: Trumps and spades both behave and 9 of clubs is a big card, so they should probably make this|pg||

mb|3N|nt|hackenbush: too many losers to bid game, even vul, assuming 3@h is not a limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i recall Drew claiming his regular partner Jim Krekorian convinced him that 2 aces opposite strong NT = GAME|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: even if clubs behave Rosenberg has only eight tricks|pg||
nt|joest: he will needed to work diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: and will need to assume East has the ace, else he's just down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: true  but the disadvantage of the 2S is that maybe N will guess the clubs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: quickly with a diamond lead .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  ordinarily 8 hcp enough in this type of auction...but hcp are in Aces and E is berift of spot cards|pg||

nt|kirp:  Think this lead is tougher on EW|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, best is probably to use the @S K to lead a @D up..looks do-able |pg||
nt|kirp:  Thats down 1 i think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after the Double, no fantasies about making, so harm minimisation the best plan|pg||

nt|007 joosth: ok ty all for kibitzing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Jack and and All thanks 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 2 hours|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|joest: and to Kathy our operator|pg||
nt|joest: classic Michaels call|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c so looks like 2@c is natural|pg||
nt|joest: I would expect to see the closed room auction duplicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably the same opening lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: to see it yourself move your mouse over the open room result|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jwit: EW will get to 4H here. Will be very difficult to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW may be able to find a cheap save in @hs |pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably 4-7 hcp|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@S easy, an overtrick on the expected heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|joest: my prediction wasn't so hot|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N might have done better to bid 3@h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: a light opener. maybe getting to high now?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jwit: South did well not to double. Knowledge of bad trump break might have given declarer a fighting chance.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good lead for defense|pg||
nt|joest: i can't leave AKxx of hearts unbid.  If they double me, I apologize I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack if it makes you feel any better   i made same prediction 40 minutes ago|pg||
nt|007 joosth: haha|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S can afford to lose 2@s and a @c|pg||
nt|chick: will lose only one of each on this lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here is there opportunity|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential pickup for Westheimer here, open room stopping in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: very bad hand for 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|007 joosth: glad I did not say a word:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the USA2 Senior matches are 60 boards   USA1 Senior Final is 90    Women are playing 96 board matches now  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 bracket = undefeated teams   USA2 = 1 loss  [so lose again, go home]|pg||
nt|pef: sorry Joanne Sprung|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us....final set of this segment to start in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what a lead...|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a chance now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW haven't played much together  otherwise Ferguson might have just tried 2N|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little too deep for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe thinking Casen could bid this way with 1435 and singleton @SQ/J ??|pg||
nt|andyv:  still a pretty deep position to take.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a lead that isn't??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D fairly passive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is this an auction that calls for passive lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew still stunned by the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem is augmented by the holding of 10x with the K, blowing the whole suit apart for the defense if you are wrong|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|joest: in any event it is going to prove to be an expensive pass resulting in a double game swing|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you can be sure that lead will not be duplicated at other table|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: no, wrong|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries and W known to be long in 2 other suits, lead the 10 and run it|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|007 joosth: the biggest swing of the session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but IF [keyword] you expect a better hand in West   what does partner hold  and which lead works for that holding|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|hackenbush: can't really go wrong here, clubs 5-2 and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: O'Rourke will finish with 13 more and take the lead at the half|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  almost:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: probably not same auction either|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: as I said N might be advised to read the book of the other Cohen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: why a heart to the Q    KJxx might be in N to|pg||

nt|ahollan1: speaking of different auction    Rosenberg didn't open East hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can imagine|pg||
