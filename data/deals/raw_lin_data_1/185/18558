nt|007 joosth: but ot here with that singl of clubs may be. |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Cindy Bernstein and Sally Wheeler sitting EW|pg||

nt|baldfriede: operator, what was the result in board 1?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4 s by north down 2--cant enter|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  they play a 12-14 NT |pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  neither side can attack @ds, so 3 rounds of @hs may allow declarer to bring this home|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=21&task=list|pg||
nt|hackenbush: for players list and system summary forms|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok, neither side SHOULD....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems after the lead  kit had a lot of options -- all bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best switch would have been a @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @d entry, it seems that declarer can just go after @ss now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like that will lead to 2@S 2@H 2@D for -1|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  I don't understand this sequence chosed by EW so can't comment on it|pg||
nt|chick: I just checked the summary card and there is nothing there either|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing invite with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like on Bd 1, O'Rourke picked up 5 imps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: maybe a combination of stripsqueeze and endplay to makeslam|pg||
nt|kirp:  Possible if S pitches a H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would at least make another try with East's hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  No @C Q-bid by W should slow him down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: at other table a @c lead helped making 6@s|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fabsayc: needs moderate care to make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bidding in OR suggested a @C lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but now i bet on defense|pg||

nt|baldfriede: yes|pg||
nt|baldfriede: is there some problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no, restroom break|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time for prediction   Bates opens  2@D=11-15 HCP  4415 minus 1 card|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hackenbush: different NT range allowed the open room to diagnose the @s weakness and reach 5@c|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1H - 1S - 1Nt  i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looked like 9 tricks for the taking agree specs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  nobody wanted to play a simple 4@h:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they might play a penalty double over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well done :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joost and Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: heart queen lead if cindy passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  their card confirms 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  E guessed the N's major was not @ss|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dull as long they are not in 5 again|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: could have been though, S had 4|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|007 joosth: difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of defensive tricks in the 2 suits bid by NS|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|irwinbo: was 3 d really three clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead other room|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|joest: i suspect we see Cohen work diamonds next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i was going to vote for the @C4...  but i think i'll change to the @D6 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the result as we see it operator ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, forgot to cash heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  looks like E can make this easily on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may be playing transfers where 3@D would be stayman|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|joest: an interesting switch|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: this is makeable from here, but unlikely at the table imo|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: in the other room, they played 2@s when south chose to raise instead of bidding 1NT: a very plausible alternative|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hackenbush: ah, EW one of few pairs to have submitted a convention card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense needed to shift to spades after second heart ducked|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/docs/2011uswbc/acblcards/PollackBjerkan.bmp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however disa should not have discarded a diamond, if in fact she did|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wonder if east's 2nt would be the winning bid in the bridge world   many would double|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks still hard to beat|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: likely finesse |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: but no thought to leading @S?    North figures to have exactly 4 [pull w/5]  and South exactly 2  [pass w/3]|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: don't like leading from broken 4-card suits...  to costly in the long run|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: Bates covered in case Cohen only had 10x of spades and Wold had 8xx left|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  NS have no response to final 3 tricks for EW.  In hindsight, S probably wished she'd led a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like leading     period|pg||
nt|kirp:  That does beat it|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: aint that the truth (says the president of the overbidder club)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just ask partners     no good can come from having me on opening lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|joest: now a club back but Mark Cohen has nine tricks|pg||
nt|joest: the club pitch suggesting that perhaps Bates wants hearts returned|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|mc|7|nt|ahollan1: and one who's a spec  agreed     WAY too quickly|pg||

nt|joest: this could be a swing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2NT maybe|pg||
nt|joest: if north-south play puppet stayman, they might land in 4@s|pg||
nt|joest: that should still fetch it looks like but its a bit harder than 3NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: guess the @d lead worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and/or @S switch    and/or   sunspot activity|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting implications for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: E will never be on lead. so Kx of clubs stay protected|pg||
nt|joest: treating his hand as too big for an initial 2NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  on board 34, 5@c was made in OR, slicing the lead to 13 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: was a very poor effort|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h probably shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can understand it with so many controls|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: quick attack on transportation|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing East bid 2@d instead of North|pg||
nt|sybarra: suport X |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good guess Howard:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|007 joosth: J of diamonds may be the entry for club tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter  do you use coded 10/9 leads in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  a hand where almost all finesses are off|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not sure that was best choice, reasonable but @S also possible|pg||
nt|kirp:  However this looks like it should go down 2 trix at least|pg||
pc|c9|nt|joest: so they are playing puppet|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: suspect we missed a pass|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hackenbush: could be gazilli but nothing much on their system summary form|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=838&pid=607|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm guessing that 2@d was xfer to @hs showing a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that's more likely, if 2@c and 2@h not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Two diamonds was alerted by West but not by East.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: referring to Stewart's @S shift|pg||
nt|007 joosth: might be 1/3 lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  we use something thats referred to as foster returns|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd from garbage?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  when dummy has small cards we lead second highest unless we want partner to do some high banging|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @s suit of N does not look very inviting though|pg||
pc|h9|nt|007 joosth: as in other room no puppet here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|joest: actually you can't determine that by a 3@s rebid :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed:)|pg||
nt|joest: so this presents the ninth trick but the contract is always cold just by keeping east off lead, for overtricks even|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems strange  but the possible entry has gone|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be a push around the room |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades may even make 5   she will probably make 4 hearts here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|007 joosth: not the lead at 4S  :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  True, except it does not give up anything, club lead might|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: could have doubled 3@D, 3@H was a bit much|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 9 tricks for the taking|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kirp:  why would you want S on lead, with N's hand?|pg||
nt|kirp:  @H is actually safe|pg||
nt|kirp:  dummy has only 1 entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Dx real killer|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: this hand does not merit much thought, are we still here|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think she is worried about a 4-1 heart break andbeing tapped in dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck one heart|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kirp:  still 5 trix|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chick: are we stuck or is S thinking?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: not necissarily bad however, EW can make 4@H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no risk  with clubs open|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  you loosened them up, Cornelia|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Pollack was thinking.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  W still has @c loser so making 2 seems to be the most likely outcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, make that a @h loser now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 trick swing compared to other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: dreww played this one really nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now just have to figure out who did good/bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to this point anyway|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|chick: no more club loser, but now a heart loser|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  that play doesn't make much sense|pg||
nt|chick: not unreasonable play, since there was a ruff, entirely possible the J will fall now-doubleton|pg||
nt|chick: the club was a sure loser|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought W would finesse for J@h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: so a push|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  the play I was talking about was the Q@d off dummy|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Jacobus led @S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: knowing south holds 3 or 4@S a very reasonable choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and now 5@C from Stewart|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must have some spades mixed in with his clubs :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Woolsey has the same thought i think|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=0/1 controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: NS play precision|pg||
nt|joest: third seat a good four card major is a possibility|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 5C as expected|pg||
mb|2N|nt|joest: tons of pressure now.  Rosenberg could just grab it with 3NT but that's a big statement|pg||
nt|joest: but if he makes a 'responsive double' or some such they are probably headed to 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 3NT seems best|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: wonder what Casen would bid over  3@C-4@S-5@C-?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: an 800 point gift|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: takes teh pressure off partner which is always appreciated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|3H|nt|007 joosth: club finesse is needed  after that at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: Wold knows where the spade king is (or thinks he does)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  he may be right:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing Eddie leads a @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this lead and auction should help Wheeler pick up trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: both partners seem to have been ticketed for speeding here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 5 down even?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand 4@D bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he get out for 800?|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||
nt|joest: 4 hearts + 4 diamonds + 1 club = 9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when it's about avertricks he can better start clubs immediately|pg||
nt|007 joosth: overtricks    i think:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: South and West having lengthy discussion about 4D bid.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|joest: Rosenberg with a disciplined pass but at matchpoints I can assure you some folks would enter with a lead directing 2@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: and there they are|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I dont think  such a bid has to be strong.  so 3S seems some rough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen liked his pure holdings in majors  -- and i'm sure not a high card invite -- that would be 2N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice double fit,  but a doubtful K|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew basing it on the dbl major suit fit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade lead gives it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  and seems impossible to keep N from gaining lead if you don't lead a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat  and  3rd vul  1N=15-17|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chick: it does seem that they should have considered a slam at least|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: right now, pollack is praying for a bad club split :)|pg||

nt|007 joosth: a heart lead seems obvious   the Q or K   according to what agreement you have|pg||
nt|007 joosth: asking unblocking a J|pg||

nt|007 joosth: well Jack,  maybe he just wanted to visit the toilet?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no unbloch here  thats strange|pg||
nt|joest: Bates proceeding on the assumption that, having not seen the jack from partner, Cohen must have it|pg||

nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 more mistake and its only -100|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: partnerships differ about whether 2NT is Lebensohl after a 2@d opener|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT gets the nature of the hand across well|pg||
nt|007 joosth: In the Netherlands almost everybody plays multi,  so I don't know|pg||
nt|joest: Bates may be asking himself: "do we play Lebensohl here"?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hope he asked it before|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is possible that they do and that Wold follows up with 3@h over a forced 3@c rebid showing four hearts in a NT hand and offering a choice of games|pg||

pc|s8|nt|hackenbush: this was beatable on an unlikely @c or @dA lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Declared gets the lead she needed to make this|pg||
nt|hackenbush: bye for now, hope the internet connection gets better!|pg||
nt|andyv:  a club lead would have set this|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye Howard|pg||
nt|007 joosth: even that I dont believe|pg||
nt|kirp:  Thoughtful lead, hoped to find 5-card suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: down 5?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: 1@c was precision|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3S seems right    even with the good clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: comes from spending time with Kit Woolsey  --  essentially  if you can't lead your 5 card suit -- try to find partner's|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: 1@h was probably artificial|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only an agressive diamond lead will bring the slam?|pg||
nt|joest: when I firrst started bridge the auction would have gone 2NT-6NT|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 23 was also then to much for 2NT?|pg||
nt|joest: 22-24|pg||

nt|joest: one of the black tens|pg||
nt|007 joosth: club is best i think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: not if dummy has AJ8x and declarer has Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: spade is safer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not when you change the 7 and 8?|pg||
nt|joest: i guess a straightforward line is jump, hook the heart, test the spades and fall back on the diamond hook|pg||
pc|dA|nt|007 joosth: 3C with Jxxxx  and now 2S on this very strong hand     how can partner guess it all the time?|pg||

nt|andyv:  so far a good set for Westheimer|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome back|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after this board EW should have the lead again|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d is not the world's best contract but it seems like it deserved a better fate than 1100 minus|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes  sorry    its the other team|pg||
nt|kirp:  its 14-10 after 10 boards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: 800 would have been standard?|pg||
nt|joest: well in top tricks you have 5 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts so I would hope to limit it to 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Hopefully to a stable connection|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jon Wittes|pg||
nt|joest: Bates bidding 4@s where Woolsey settled for 3 next door|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed but thats after you know how well the hearts behave|pg||
nt|joest: rosenberg will bid 5@d as well I would imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i cant imagine|pg||

mb|p|nt|jwit: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  i give up|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW need to stay low with this misfit...probably 2@s|pg||

nt|kirp:  nope|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kirp:  2@C a range/major ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 4S likely contract here|pg||
nt|joest: Well now we'll see if Cohen can hold down the carnage a bit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: playing with a Cohen  I would expect some more law|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: after a club switch, Cohen has major problems getting back to his hand (if he really wants to try for a spade ruff)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I would expect 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may not even bid his @hs and settle for 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well they will be higher i'm afraid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jwit: Should be no problem for declarer|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Levin in deep thought.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and a good spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe he can discard a spade on a heart|pg||
nt|joest: double dummy he could make it now|pg||
nt|joest: flies ace plays one round of diamonds then works clubs|pg||
nt|joest: spade ruff, etc.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: perhaps, but I think can make game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentator from other room confirmed  they really played 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Should go down on spade ruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|007 joosth: why that silly 9?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok it just dont hurt|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|chick: have to pick up the diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: needed TWO @S ruffs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jwit: Could have lost as many as 5 tricks in this contract with a different layout, but everything lies well for declarer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: plaing the J would have been ok|pg||
nt|007 joosth: tryiong clubs now i think|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: and she might not do that|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Players taking a break.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 37 may have been a push as both sides made 4@s (but didn't bid the game)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sounds right Andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: oh I agree, bidding the game was a long shot|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: easier to bid south hand if the @S quacks located elsewhere|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  S has a problem trying to describe her hand|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d-2@c is a difficult auction in Standard that requires a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C either 4-card limit raise  or   Game force    shame usbf can't require convention card submission :(|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  2N probably xfer to @d|pg||
nt|chick: 2N probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i do short hand better:)|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|joest: does a 2@d rebid show five?  Does 2 of a major show extras? etc.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes indeed I can recommend the Lawrnce book 2/1 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with the length  the @S honors wasted here  [term is trump poor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was Game Force @S raise  [jacoby]|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i think this 2@C has 4@H/@S only if 6+@C|pg||
nt|joest: yes he has a well thought out method in his book|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: routine 4@s here, Westheimer's opening will have to come on one of the last 4 boards|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  2@D=5+|pg||
nt|joest: and then either 3@h followed by 3Nt or just 3NT directly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so   now we have to guess   was 3@H weaker or better than PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: EW slightly stole this one, though they will have to do some scrambling to make this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some play 2D as balanced   11/12  maybe only 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: DBL was lead-direct|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E might play for a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: only in 2 |pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: I was going to say she would need a safety play in diamonds, but doesn't look like she'll get the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: makeable |pg||
pc|cA|nt|jwit: Lead actually helps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then 2NT can be 13/14  gf  or  18/19|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D didn't deny 4@H/@S  but 3@D did|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @h suit will provide one pitch so S should immediately play it |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: but Bates-Wold play precision so |pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead maybe  but N did not double 3H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|007 joosth: fine lead here|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs lead second highest from four small and so, apparently, does this north-south pair|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  now can get to board with K@c to pitch other @c on @h|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|jwit: Trumps and spades both behave and 9 of clubs is a big card, so they should probably make this|pg||

mb|4H|nt|joest: curiously?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i could think of several reasons why one might not preempt :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  better to play 1 level as forcing 1 rd|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  stop here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: never|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Women's USA1 Final  thru 74 of 96   Moss leads Sprung by 23|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: but it is in Kit's character to do so I would say|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure  but its nice when p knows what to lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a Roland slam|pg||
nt|chick: much too good for Roland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's how Fantoni-Nunes play their 1-suit openings|pg||
nt|baldfriede: a shot in the dark which does not hit the target but winds up in the blue|pg||
nt|kirp:  Is W thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should have 11 or 12 @Hs, not 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wold needed to DBL to prevent Bates from thinking|pg||
nt|kirp:  Dbl might have encouraged Bates to bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but [rightly] feared they have a better spot|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hackenbush: too many losers to bid game, even vul, assuming 3@h is not a limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i recall Drew claiming his regular partner Jim Krekorian convinced him that 2 aces opposite strong NT = GAME|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: even if clubs behave Rosenberg has only eight tricks|pg||
nt|joest: he will needed to work diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: and will need to assume East has the ace, else he's just down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: true  but the disadvantage of the 2S is that maybe N will guess the clubs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: quickly with a diamond lead .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  ordinarily 8 hcp enough in this type of auction...but hcp are in Aces and E is berift of spot cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  might be right:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 10 of hearts lead will help declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse hesitations --  the slow 5@H shows confidence|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a likely challenge|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  E may simply play @ss back to K and Q and lose an imp here|pg||
nt|joest: once spades are abandoned for sure the ace of diamonds resides in east|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if N guesses the clubs i think there may be an endplay at E|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce happy they aren't vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: may duck this lead in both hands|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|andyv:  N has too much defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 10's|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: sure almost a double|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1 quickly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kirp:  Cant see them missing slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  those who think down 2 are optomists or pessimists|pg||
nt|kirp:  E knows Kx in @Cs is great|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my favorite online toy  Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator  says East worth 13.65   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
mb|4C|nt|007 joosth: diff lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: S will reason that N is broke|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok almost:)|pg||
nt|joest: i like that reasoning|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: can't on drugs be an option?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he also knows too many points in reds|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  always is, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been easier for East if Bates could complete his shape|pg||
mb|4N|nt|joest: i had a feeling the the ten was coming|pg||
nt|baldfriede: undo|pg||
nt|kirp:  E is now trying to backtrack on his 14-16hcp|pg||
mb|5H|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: spade again|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|kirp:  whatever the auction, 6@S looks solid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|007 joosth: trying not to be endplayed|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jwit: This should fail by 2 or 3 tricks, but NS can probably make a part score, so no disaster|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce should try the @h finesse even though his sure it won't work|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems dropping K of H is last chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well credit Wold for upgrading his hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  which means O'Rourke is now in the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry missed a pass--contract is 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Kathy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: robbins didn't bid|pg||
mc|12|nt|kirp:  actual score is 27-21|pg||

nt|andyv:  feels like a football game...a huddle after every play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: We are in a hotel room that has a convenient bathroom.|pg||
nt|joest: final hand of the 2nd quarter|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok ty all for kibitzing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Jack and and All thanks 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 2 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand of this set now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of Q1   3 more sets today for the USA2 "Semi Final"    USA1 final only has one more set today |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|joest: and to Kathy our operator|pg||
nt|joest: classic Michaels call|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our operator |pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c so looks like 2@c is natural|pg||
nt|joest: I would expect to see the closed room auction duplicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably the same opening lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: to see it yourself move your mouse over the open room result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jwit: EW will get to 4H here. Will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our thanks to Jan Martel who organizes everything, and thx to USBF for bringing this to bbo |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW may be able to find a cheap save in @hs |pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably 4-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, not 5+@S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@S easy, an overtrick on the expected heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|joest: my prediction wasn't so hot|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N might have done better to bid 3@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: a light opener. maybe getting to high now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could come home, but not enough imps |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jwit: South did well not to double. Knowledge of bad trump break might have given declarer a fighting chance.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good lead for defense|pg||
nt|joest: i can't leave AKxx of hearts unbid.  If they double me, I apologize I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack if it makes you feel any better   i made same prediction 40 minutes ago|pg||
nt|007 joosth: haha|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S can afford to lose 2@s and a @c|pg||
nt|chick: will lose only one of each on this lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here is there opportunity|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential pickup for Westheimer here, open room stopping in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: very bad hand for 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|007 joosth: glad I did not say a word:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N goes down on @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the USA2 Senior matches are 60 boards   USA1 Senior Final is 90    Women are playing 96 board matches now  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 bracket = undefeated teams   USA2 = 1 loss  [so lose again, go home]|pg||
nt|pef: sorry Joanne Sprung|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 17-19|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us....final set of this segment to start in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what a lead...|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a chance now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW haven't played much together  otherwise Ferguson might have just tried 2N|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little too deep for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe thinking Casen could bid this way with 1435 and singleton @SQ/J ??|pg||
nt|andyv:  still a pretty deep position to take.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a lead that isn't??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D fairly passive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is this an auction that calls for passive lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew still stunned by the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem is augmented by the holding of 10x with the K, blowing the whole suit apart for the defense if you are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit   i wouldn't have counted either of the last 2 hands the way Wold did|pg||
nt|kirp:  that may still beat it|pg||
nt|kirp:  but its now closer than you might think|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: Cohen with a surpised winner |pg||
pc|dT|nt|joest: in any event it is going to prove to be an expensive pass resulting in a double game swing|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you can be sure that lead will not be duplicated at other table|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer needs to unblock the @s, but aFTER THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES TO DUMMY|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming @S worth 5 tricks -- what's best try for  9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe immediate guess of @C10?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Think he'll play for something good to happen in @Ds and@Ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D7 could have been from 87x|pg||
nt|kirp:  N coul have lead from 3 or 4 small @Ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right  or 87xx|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: no, wrong|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries and W known to be long in 2 other suits, lead the 10 and run it|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|007 joosth: the biggest swing of the session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but IF [keyword] you expect a better hand in West   what does partner hold  and which lead works for that holding|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there goes that option|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|hackenbush: can't really go wrong here, clubs 5-2 and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: O'Rourke will finish with 13 more and take the lead at the half|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  almost:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: probably not same auction either|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: as I said N might be advised to read the book of the other Cohen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: why a heart to the Q    KJxx might be in N to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 44  Bates did double 4@H|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  gtg...bye all!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 tr back again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke team has playes extremely well this set|pg||
nt|007 joosth: harte now would be fine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: heart|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|joest: thanks all|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to the kibitzers|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure what the restart is.  Sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about 2 hours|pg||
nt|joest: ok thanks Al|pg||
nt|joest: bye all|pg||
nt|007 joosth: bye|pg||
nt|kirp:  Good guess, but no matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it ruled out down 3 :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer deep in thought.  Head on table.|pg||
nt|jwit: Looks like declarer still has to come up a trick short here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: again thx and we will see you all tomorrow|pg||
nt|kirp:  N knows W's shape by now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  just made after the 2d present|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of different auction    Rosenberg didn't open East hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can imagine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's Milt Rosenberg     Michael isn't old enough  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: final set in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well   here its bedtime  so ty all     and gl  next session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't dream about THIS hand Joost|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Seniors = 60+ this year|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know it used to be younger|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: did Boyd's @C play matter?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|kirp:  if S had flown on the @C and shifted to @Hs, more undertrix|pg||
nt|kirp:  still down 1|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   i had feeling just couldn't work out the details|pg||
nt|baldfriede: thank you all; an interesting match|pg||
nt|kirp:  thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart pretty soon  don't run too far|pg||
