mb|1D|nt|swanson: Hi Roland, everyone.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfk: 1d shows 4, just learned|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have a suit each and we will now hear about clubs|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: The suit that died in the 50's|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The value bid is 3@C here, but that might be a fit bid (showing heart support)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: rusinow leads for ns|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: If you think about it, you don't see many natural club bids nowadays|pg||
nt|swanson: Seems a shame to have a KQJxxxx suit and not take any tricks with it on offense.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is one of the few|pg||
pc|s5|nt|swanson: The defense should get the idea that a trump lead is good very quickly.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When I was young a club was a club and a spade a spade. A spade is still a spade, but a club is now only used in golf|pg||

nt|swanson: HI Richie|pg||
nt|reisig: Not my kinda hand for that :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Richie makes this on a good day|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: The real Polish 2 is the Wilkosz 2@D, 5-5 in 2 suits, one of which is a major|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: I assume that is disallowed in USA|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: it may well die down here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@c looks fine with 2 card difference & useful card in pd's suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is an ugly stultifying bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: is north worth 4@C?|pg||
nt|psyck: those who open 1@c with 44 in minors may have had it easier|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed west had soft values and only 2 hearts|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c forcing for me|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck: I don't think N has a further bid here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: ns in the other room on 49 got way too high 4@S-3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: 3rd @c promotes a trump as 5th trick for defense|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP WISHFUL YTHINKING ON MY PART PERHAPS|pg||
pc|s3|nt|swanson: Some partnerships like to use a redouble here (by South) as a raise with one of the top honors.  Then the immediate raise won't get partner off to a bad lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Hello again John|pg||
pc|sT|nt|swanson: Hi Gary|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: nice lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: S could have a lot more wastage in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: an ultra weak muiderberg made it as difficult for NS other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: a similar auction in the other room after a 2@H weak opening|pg||
nt|psyck: it is normally 8-10 hcp, but at this vul...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|swanson: The 3@D removal of 3@C is not a very trusting bid here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible trump promotion|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck: that was hardly clear to find though|pg||

mb|p|nt|reisig: Prob 4@s here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|reisig: oops|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That is a very sound 2@S|pg||
nt|reisig: For me ..4@s is better than 2@s here|pg||
nt|swanson: It might not be clear to bit game after a 4-card limit raise by North,  but the South had looks a lot better opposite four trumps.|pg||
nt|swanson: bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Maybe it shows 8-11 for them. Many play that, but those who do only use it with 3-card support|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|reisig: I always bid game ...when partner has to play it :)|pg||

nt|psyck: very likely :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a muilderberg 2@S showing a weak 2 suiter would be interesting |pg||
nt|swanson: You're right - playing the opponents to have made a great play is a losing proposition.  Better to be tricked and congratulate them after the hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: if n/s are in aggressive mode may well bid 3nt/4@H|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the normal opening may fare much worse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: that seemed to stop abruptly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3S=Limit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: lot of work to do but may get home here|pg||
nt|roswolf: fancy defence will prevail|pg||
nt|psyck: trumps unfav, but everything else works fine|pg||
nt|psyck: can even get away with losing just the trump tricks & nothing else|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond loser?|pg||
nt|psyck: on @s|pg||
nt|psyck: with the points balanced 20-20, NS were going to win the auction at this vul, quite lieky other table will also play in same spot|pg||
nt|psyck: with having to ruff the @d, will likely lose 2@s & 2@c|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s 1@c|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: CONSERVATIVE MODE|pg||
nt|roswolf: solidity personified|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|swanson: The pass my South is clear.  North might have found an excuse to promote here flat 14 to a 1NT opening, but I don't see one.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c7|pc|s3|nt|psyck: had chances if W had another @c maybe|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|swanson: When holding touching honors (the @S10,9 in this case) one leads the lower one if she doesn't want a cover, the higher one if you do.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|nt|psyck: NV, maybe N should not have stretched to 3@s|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer could have used a cover of the first honor here, but didn't know it.|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 3@s and i would play same line:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: it was certainly close :)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfk: there goes the 8-11 theory :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|swanson: West would likely balance against 2@S - didn't expect here to enter a live auction.|pg||
nt|swanson: her|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rosenberg in the other room followed John's advice and bid an invitational 3S (board 67)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And was raised|pg||
nt|reisig: 1@s  P  2@s seems a WIDE range :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|swanson: Why not redouble with the North hand - sometimes the opponents have no 8-card fit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: ok experts if 3d is a help suit gt, do you accept...looking only at d in isolation?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's difficult to see a pattern in their raises to the 2 level|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|reisig: Roland says it so well|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|swanson: Where did the acceptance come from?  The value of the @HK is in question and the shape is no shape.|pg||
nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3 = extras ...I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: some look at the suit in isolation, as here :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, 4@S is going down on 67, so the conservative approach in this room pays off|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|h8|pc|s3|pg||

nt|psyck: E had too many @s to balance|pg||

pc|d2|nt|roswolf: this could be very good news for sprung|pg||
nt|puncher99: big swing here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: K apparently asked attitude|pg||
nt|swanson: No time to shift now.  It is tough to see how the diamond continuation was tempting with the J8xx in dummy.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north obviously didnt fancy making the obvious heart lead fearing declarer was well prepared for it|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|psyck: the opening could just be due to 3rd seat ofc|pg||

nt|roswolf: they need some more this set|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: board 42 is a pick-up for Sprung as expected...their one ray of light this segment |pg||
nt|swanson: Agressive bidders will almost always reach game with 12 opposite 12 and two five cards suit.  Some days there are enough good spot cards to see the contract through.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tez: 1nt dbl|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: yes but a surfeit of hcp here|pg||
nt|swanson: With 11 opposite 12 you need even better spot cards.|pg||

mb|r!|nt|swanson: Inverted minors - but the raise usually shows 5-card support.|pg||

nt|henryb:  I'm sure you did. Kerri is reacting to the bridge, not the vugraph|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: oh, ty|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|kerri: one major by levin - 2S= pass or correct|pg||
nt|swanson: After a play like that a pool of acid forms in you stomach (for South) and doesn't go away for months.  It's best if one can forgive oneself.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Meanwhile Lynch has picked up 20 imps after about 8 or 9 boards|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|kerri: hamman taught me that many years ago|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kerri: maybe 2S was INV in whichever Major|pg||

nt|roswolf: yuck not a contract of beauty|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: 2nt with only 19hcp seems to me suspect |pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: If my partner gave me a choice of clubs or hearts at the vulnerability I would choose spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: the majors are flawed too|pg||
nt|bobh1: cant blame her with the good @C suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: i understand that but why not open 1@C if pard passes there was no game on anyway and you may play in  a much better contract|pg||
