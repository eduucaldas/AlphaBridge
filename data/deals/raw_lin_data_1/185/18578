nt|rv: nearly perfume hand with North?|pg||
nt|andyv:  an international consortium|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a stinker of a hand for his partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yotam, is it correct that the Indy is scored as matchpoints?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/total.php   for overall standings|pg||
nt|granguru:  a fight between @H and @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS may get pushed to 5@h chich can make|pg||
nt|andyv:  which|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: Yes, The scorring here is matchpoints|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so every trick counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  if it weren't mp, then 5@c is the safer contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: We will play 9 rounds or 3 board now, and later in the afternoon another 10 rounds|pg||
nt|rv: MPs is real man's bridge:)|pg||
nt|rv: much more competitive than IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is bridge, and there is matchpoints|pg||
nt|andyv:  or as the M*A*S*H theme song goes:  Suicide is painless...|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW have a double fit so @D can also be considered..|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|andyv:  1@h, 1@s or pass with S hand?|pg||
nt|granguru:  @S distribution can be costly for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume there is standard system everyone must play|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: 5-card majors, strong NT|pg||

nt|andyv:  doesn't know how @d high cards are divided|pg||

nt|ntmon: +450 close to top|pg||
nt|andyv:  most pairs should get to 4@h then it will depend on lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s lead, you can make 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: yes, 10 tables, but divided into to sections - higher and lower ones according to the earlier stages of the competition|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  4@S is abetter contract|pg||
nt|granguru:  plenty of control cards |pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at all 4 hands it would seem so|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: 1@s was natural and 2N was a short suit trail bid - 3@h showing the shortage|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ntmon: nice to know the system well|pg||
nt|granguru:  E pass is a teams strategy. In  pairs it pays to be more agressive|pg||

nt|granguru:  1NT by W will wnd in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3C|an|puppet|mb|p|nt|andyv:  and as several specs pointed out, W could have made 5 by not trumping at the end|pg||
mb|3D!|an|4 card M|mb|p|mb|3S|an|4!H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgy: 3@c puppet stayman after 1N opening is considered "standard" in Israel so included in the Individual CC|pg||
nt|andyv:  although I play puppet here also, I'm not so sure of the advantages esp. since sharp defenders can often guide the defense|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok, John, they've gone past your mark:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@H can be made|pg||

nt|granguru:  one might think 12|pg||
nt|yuval10: the overall leader before this day ( and the previous event's winner ) is playing West here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  one thing for sure.  The defense better start with trumps|pg||
nt|granguru:  but 3 rounds of trumps are ned|pg||

nt|granguru:  also with some risks|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  W has a lot for this auction...will he make a move|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  a lucky slam but EW will take it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  not lucky...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  well, let's see....E has only 1@s and the A@d is on side|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|granguru:  it is very probable that S holds @Da for the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would think that is lucky|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru:  and that E has singleton @S for the same reason|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if E had 2 @s he still would've made it|pg||
mc|12|nt|andyv:  in today's world of preempts, the @d A can be anywhere|pg||
nt|yuval10: with A@d onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, yes, I think it's lucky|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  since not vul, would anyone be surprised if E bid 4@h with only 7 of them?|pg||
mb|3D|an|10-11 4 card fit|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv: 3@d seems to be ubiquitous bergen raise, could be too high here|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think his hand is quite a minimum for his bid. he could also have much more for 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  not at all...but he could also have @CQ or @DQ or even @SK|pg||

nt|ntmon: everyone will get to 3@S if following the system :) |pg||
mc|8|nt|rv: some kibs are predicting a few desperate partnerships even bidding game|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, it doesn't pay to be too aggressive to bid games unlike in IMPs where premium of vul game is lot more|pg||
nt|ntmon: there are only disciplined partnerships :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  N hand so hard to evaluate...great 2nd suit, so so trump, and wasted values in the doubletons...a conservative bidder might only show it as a mixed raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some may bid 1NT to find out if they had a secondary @h fit but looks like almost all roads lead to 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: my gut feeling is 3@s going 1 down will still be slightly below 50%|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: players were quick in this table, so we have few minutes of waiting for the next round now...|pg||
nt|rv: Yotam, all players playing with pre-defined CC, bergen raise part of it?|pg||
nt|ntmon: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: yes, you can all see the CC in the website:|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/cc/cc_standard.pdf|pg||
nt|rv: inspite of CC, North could still downgrade his hand and bid only 2@s though it could be slightly contrived, incidentally I am not big fan of bergen raises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but Marty is|pg||
nt|rv: he was, is he still a fan of?:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: downgrading of N hand is perhaps right, but against the field|pg||
nt|andyv:  he is but he does experiment....esp. with mini splinters|pg||
nt|rv: many will bid to 3 level as 2 shot, even it doesn't make opps might make 3 level minor partial|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree with panel and specs, getting to 3 level is odds on action|pg||
nt|ntmon: i would consider 2@S in a weaker field, perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  this portion of vugraph could be titled "commentators gone wild"|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  I would have gotten all the imps on that one because I'd never bid 3@c...you don't open 2@c with that hand to bid 3@c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rv: super slam here, will N-S bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nice jacoby hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  NN will give his @H singleton and the slam will be bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h seems normal here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ntmon: i am giving good chance to bidding it|pg||
nt|rv: 2n is jacoby and after 3@h stiff by North, South should smell slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  maybe they play 3@d shows some stilff|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and 3@c is all minimums|pg||
nt|andyv:  thus reserving a jump to 4 of major for a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: N's bidding in not according to the syustem - new suit is a singleton following the CC..|pg||
nt|rv: even on @c lead, declarer is likely to cash @SA and play 4 rounds of @ds|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ntmon: opener new suit id short, CC says :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  in Jacoby 2NT it is normal to give the singleton or void..but here N bid his second suit|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|granguru:  S cue bid @H|pg||
nt|granguru:  N cue bids @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: simple form of jacoby, North should bid stiff, I presume in Individual event that is lieky to CC, there are better versions of Jacoby as suggestd by Andy (3@c all non-stiff hands ...|pg||
nt|rv: etc)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if you can call director on this one|pg||
nt|granguru:  no|pg||
nt|granguru:  no damage done to the opponents|pg||
nt|rv: I can't see what director can do even if N-S do get to slam, North can forget CC and they are allowed get lucky as well|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ntmon: opps of course have no right for redress, they know the opps system by def|pg||

pc|c6|nt|rv: with lesser values (16-17) and stiff, some expert partnerships play 1@d-1@s-3@h as variety of art raises incl 16-17 with any stiff|pg||

mc|12|nt|rv: in my view Individual event works well only in an uniform field, otherwise good players do get frustrated|pg||
nt|andyv:  since E could see dummy and he had 10@h, it cost nothing to lead a @h...if declarer needed to finesse for the Q of @h, he had only one way to go.|pg||
nt|rv: World Individual champs is one such event, played every 4 years|pg||
nt|rv: normally Individual events are rarely played since bridge is essentially a partnership game and an Individual event doesn't test partnership agreement in bidding and defense|pg||
nt|rv: it is good for diversion maybe once a year in a top class field|pg||
nt|ntmon: i would give the field in israeli individual good marks |pg||
nt|rv: yes Vladimir, it will work well in countries like Poland, Israel, Dutch, US etc where we have plenty of above average players|pg||
nt|rv: it is also good to see many of the top Israeli players participating, I have seen many top players in other countries (esp India) not playing in an Individual event|pg||
nt|rv: primary reason of non-participation because of uneven field|pg||

pc|c7|nt|rv: some might stretch to 4@h, a few won't crack 3@s, this shoud an excellent board for E-W|pg||
