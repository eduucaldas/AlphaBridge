nt|yorkbeach:  EW should reach game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT by East looks to be making|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s lead from North would be more of a problem|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting East to open 1@h, West to respond 2@c and East to rebid 2@d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is well worth a 2/1 game force|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: classic!|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  more losers in 5@h if North scores a @c ruff or two|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is trying to work out whether 5@c is to play or just a lead-directing bid in case NS bid 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  plus wondering whether her partner could be void in @s, when a slam could be on|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  given the vulnerability, NS could easily have 10 @s between them|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps South is more confidet that her partner has only 6@s than that she has fewer than 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: that's my thought|pg||
