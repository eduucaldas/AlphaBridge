mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psyck: ok, so 1@h was natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe exit and re-enter, CK, it often helps|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/cc/cc_noga_dana.pdf|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3494  Dana Tal, regarded as one of the best woman players in Israel|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it was a decent enuf hand, and other table will likely be a few down too even if they stop in a partial with this unfortunate lie of cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3495  Noga Tal|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I would prefer 3@S rather than double |pg||
nt|psyck: hmm, would not have expected W to find 1 bid, leave alone two :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second was forced, as pass would show spades|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Much easier if Dana had bid 3@S. Then Noga had an easy raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: 3@c likely showing weak @h's|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: will still end in 4@s anyway i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to PS|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all  thx Roland|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi PS :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi Krishna|pg||
mb|5D|nt|psridhar: is this a stronger seq than a dirct 3@s ? i wd think so|pg||
nt|psridhar: N can perhaps nurse slam feelings|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is?|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 2@sx was taken as t/o of @h or something|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be natural and slam try in @s |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not understand it I must confess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can she bypas 4@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: bypass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If she wants to make a slam try with spade support she can bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: the 3@c bid was explained as "not sure" to N... and it seems that she didn't take the 3@s as Natural...|pg||
nt|psridhar: it means ( i guess) - If I had tried a cue and u signed off 4@s, i wd hv made another move|pg||
nt|psyck: as PS suggests, souths ambiguous bids may have tempted N to try for some slam, if S's @hK was @dK...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The confusion regarding the double of 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid 3@S and make life easy on partner|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: 5@s is ment as Natural (to play) as i can see from here...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: 5@d ofcourse...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|hedyg: here comes 6@s..|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: passing 3@c was a mystery |pg||

mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a disaster with this format, IMPs Across the Field|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: You are losing 11 IMPs against every other table|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: Did E really expect this go > 1 off OR was it out of a feeling of indignity , the X?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: New players arriving I suppose|pg||
nt|psridhar: skipping a Bd at a table can seriously affect the across-the-field scoring|pg||
nt|psridhar: or will they assign an avg score ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, with only 10 tables in play|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS are the leading pair i think|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: if they wish to play 4@s , EW better declare it from W side|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzgy: were leading after 1st round - now 4th...|pg||
nt|psyck: well, leading @c would be a little double dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: thanks Yotam|pg||
nt|psridhar: N can find a 'lightner' X as it were and ruff out the @c king|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: lightner vs a 4 level contract?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: thats why in quotes i guess :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: they will hv to shift to @d on ruffing however...not easy defense|pg||

nt|vugraphzgy: that is the real lead :)|pg||
nt|psyck: nice :)  lets see if they get the @d shift too|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: but N can refuse to ruff a loser ,even with worthless trumps|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck: also more likely dec has @sK rather than @cA...so maybe could consider pd made unusual lead|pg||
mc|11|nt|psyck: very little with S for vul opening otherwise|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way can consider etc! pd leads Q@C vs a suit contract, he has not led from Ace!|pg||
nt|psridhar: S knew where the king of @c was...and that lead will work 100% of the time , as no declarer wd climb with king in dummy|pg||
pg||

nt|Walddk2: Who is totally confused|pg||
nt|psridhar: can we bar pd from leading deceptively when the king is known to be in dummy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you know that, then lead the ace|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: why make it so difficult?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no we cannot since basically the lead was brilliant|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The lead is only brilliant if you play with yourself|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would be the only one who understands|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland we all know abt the @C ruff ; Hasin didnt ; she just may hv led in the hope of deceiving declarer , why not?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but on A@C lead you cannot beat 4@s?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: why not?|pg||
nt|psyck: it is down on @cA lead if @d shift after ruff as PS said|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psridhar: declarer can duck 2nd @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly|pg||
nt|psridhar: no @d shift wd help then|pg||
nt|hedyg: and disc @d loser on last @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: so @c queen was indeed the only lead to beat |pg||
nt|psridhar: or @c ace and small @c to ruff|pg||

nt|psridhar: mind you, IF north had Xed lead-indicatively, then Queen lead is misleading and perhaps irresponsible even|pg||

nt|petka: but for some it means "kill!" :)|pg||
nt|granguru: it is a good politic to use doubles at low levels of bidding and hi level of competition as non penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: We will have 30 boards in this round (10 rounds of 3) now, and 1 more session of 30 afterwards today...|pg||
nt|granguru: losing bridge to structure a system with those competitive bidding doubles as penalty|pg||
