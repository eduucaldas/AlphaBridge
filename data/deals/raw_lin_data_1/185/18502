mb|p|nt|henryb:  Interesting that Peter chose not to open 2@s in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|swanson: That was unexpected.  Shows how little they can rely on opening bid values for an opening bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: he is at adverse vul|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|swanson: I except E-W to reach 4@S here, but it has no real chance of coming home.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: A takeout double is possible here by Levin.  That gives E-W as chance for a plus by defending.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: on 50   Meyers opened 2N so playing 3N west|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: NS still should be able to find 3N, but 5@D will work also, as cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joel planning a 2-step to show good hand with 6@S & 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably with weaker hand she would rebid 2@S immediately|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|barnets: his is down a couple|pg||
pc|hK|nt|swanson: Defending is for children - bid those games.|pg||

nt|barnets: e/w limit is 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: weichsel relatively lucky|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  good afternoon all|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: this is nice -- i forgot to think about options if Sokolow bidding 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: North can only lead one round of trumps, so the simple defense of winning two diamonds and shifting to a spade seems best.|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe E hopes supp 4th , the only reason to bid 3@H over X|pg||
nt|swanson: East might have redoubled 2@S to indicate a good hand and then listen to what partner has to say.|pg||
nt|ybob: agree|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: 11 tricks likely here, too, as @SQ comes down while cashing out|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hackenbush: natural to finesse trump now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- retain ability to ruff @H if finesse loses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  Rusinow vs NT  [so Q promised K]    upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|swanson: North shouldn't be concerned about solving a spade guess for declarer; the double has already given away the spade situation.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: in that sense that 3@s is down, so the board was lost already  but yes, probably 4@d makes|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good shift, knockout late entry to spades|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: play was too fast -- i was contemplating @S @S ruff then @DJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|swanson: South doesn't mind this cross ruff - her spades are looking better and better.|pg||
nt|tez: down 1|pg||
nt|tez: whats your choise with west hand..2@s or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff and @D ... ?|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s showed 4+ right?|pg||
nt|swanson: I expect that the 1@S bid showed five cards, so the raise is routine.|pg||
nt|tez: in europe 1@c 1@d 1 major 4+|pg||
nt|ybob: Both tables raise with 3 cards|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@h 1@s 5+|pg||
nt|ybob: I play 1@S as 4 + over 1@D , X = 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: mark me down for 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|swanson: Doesn't have to show five, but I would raise unless I knew for certain that partner held only four spades.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@d dbl shows both majors|pg||
nt|swanson: Some play that the negative double of 1@D is exactly four spades and four or more hearts (using the theory that you can bid spades, then hearts with five spades).|pg||
nt|tez: migry's connection bad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I think she will never play|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|gracelin: so Joel has a chance to win big if they bid and make 4H here.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D!|nt|gracelin: but that's a tough task when both E and W passed originally.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: unless East can show short D and a 4-card invitation.  |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: south wants to compete to 4D, but can't be sure she can defeat 4H.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: EW  1N=14-16 throughout   wonder if that means 2N = 19- something|pg||
nt|hackenbush: perhaps an upgrade|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: some number of @H likely but 4 could be tricky.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and here i was checking to see what Radid would respond to 1@H :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: but West is 2N opener regardless of  how Walter the Walrus counts points|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but this will be an unhappy contract|pg||

mb|3H|mb|d!|mb|4C|nt|swanson: North will balance with 2@S, having denies real values by passing over 2@H.|pg||

nt|swanson: I would have guessed from the timing of the bids that East and South are on the same side of the screen.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|othered1: north's 3@H is unnderstandable and catches south with  the perfect flat minimum|pg||

nt|ahollan1: defending 2@S when 6@D actually has a [single dummy] play    conclusion: sometimes preempts work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be fun to watch if they find all their defensive tricks   well Moss won't enjoy it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: 3N would have better play as cards lie|pg||
nt|andyv:  both rooms should get to 4@h..only question is whether EW will take the 5@d push|pg||
nt|othered1: more like will west solo to 5@D, since east doesn't have much positive  to say with those tricks in defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  and spec points out that 4@s is another possible EW contract|pg||

nt|barnets: but can make a ninth in hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: big bob would not open 3@h a six bagger first seat at equal vul, would he?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if you can trust partner to pass when it's right, then you can double 4@h more often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or close for Moss to re-open|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  E should raise here|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the recommended defense against that 2@H opener  --  wouldn't be surprised if DBL did show bal hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: it probably does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sokolow over 2@S  --  tough  give credit to the EW system|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 6 more for Joel on Board 7|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but from South's perspective, needs partner to have a max to have a shot at 3nt, and might not even make 14 vs 11 with no source of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true  partner was passed hand|pg||
nt|ybob: yes here :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: @s to the A, back to dummy and another @s, right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: with four spade tricks declarer just wants to get the trumps drawn, but it's slightly awkward to get to dummy fast|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to take advantage of the free finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no @s losers, he may just play A@h and @h|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA yes|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|barnets: in other room he played a club now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: first books read were Acol so instinct says 2@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tez: play @h..safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in 2/1 that establishes game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm still not sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, say you lose a @d ruff now, you do not lose the @h anymore|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on this auction probably easier to get to NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp   but  not surely NOT 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: 3H is correct|pg||
pc|d8|nt|swanson: Declarer will grind it out looking for an overtrick, but by that time she will have nine in the bank.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hackenbush: 9 or 10 tricks here after ruffing a diamond|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: not sure you can afford to give up on the trump finesse quite that happily - if trumps are 3-1, and the defender with @HKxx plays a third round, you only have nine tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|swanson: Guarding against 5-1 spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well now i am sure that 2@C better than 1@S   [at least for this hand]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: people who know me will be shocked by even the slightest hint of seeing a silver lining|pg||
mb|1C|nt|othered1: will north open 1N or 1@D?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D 1@S 2@D double, seems a possible start|pg||

mb|1S|nt|hackenbush: Will Moss open in 3rd?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised he opened 1nt - not because of the 5422 but just because it's a bit good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reliable source tells me  "dbl was 13-15 or 19-plus bal but not essential with that hand opposite a ph"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S or something slower?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|ritong: hamman sticks to his convictions|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H far from obligatory|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d looks like a good raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|ybob: now 3@H or 3@S ?|pg||
nt|ybob: i like 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter is nice choice|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ritong: passing 12 decent|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: end of auction, I presume|pg||
nt|ritong: quacks, etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D transfer   [better raise than 2@H]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and North should double again|pg||
nt|swanson: Too much playing strength for 3@S.  3@H invites game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I don't know if 2@H is controls or not|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: and NS earns 50, rather than the 130 that *might* have been attainable|pg||
nt|barnets: X could get 500  now if they pass it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S-P-P-4N?     gulp   didn't anticipate 5@S |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ybob: O.R. bids 3@S over 2@S|pg||
nt|swanson: A club lead would hold the contract to nine tricks, but East has no reason to lead anything but a heart.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: xx was 3 card support|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then again, defending is right if they're only in a 7-card fit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: 3@C was Puppet|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  or 120|pg||
nt|athene: having given up control in trumps, north has to be a bit worried about declarer running the spades|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect him to try to cash out in the minors - he would have to find his partner with one king and get him in to lead to the other AQ|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|barnets: and 3@Sx showed extra values|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry 3@Dx |pg||
nt|barnets: showed extras|pg||
nt|barnets: looking at all the hands you can make 10 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder why @CK instead of @CA  then @H9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: 3@H showed no major|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: but i guess he just didn't want to commit to one or other suit|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer is not a lock for 9 tricks should spades be 3-1 and the @DA in the West hand.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: but at least they didn't bid themself to six of a minor to lose more imps :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: A good result for NS in the closed room here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mikam1: For sure...I thought Meyers might|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: She had a good hand opposite 6-5 in the minors|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: yes, 4S making is optimum for NS here.  In 5C you need to guess spades.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dburn: in 4@s also, I suppose|pg||
nt|mikam1: You may be forced to guess spades in 4@S if the opponents lead clubs|pg||
mb|2H!|an|weak with spades or invite w/ clubs|nt|mikam1: After one ruff, you can't afford to lose to West again|pg||
nt|gracelin: acording to earlier bidding, we saw the 2H showed either weak raise of spades or strong raise of clubs.  Wonder which is intended here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe both|pg||
nt|mikam1: Not sure if Stansby will move on now|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi David, wonder she can do that :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, I haven't seen this method before - most interesting|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mikam1: I'm told that 3@C is invitational opposite a weak preference|pg||
nt|gracelin: good sequence, south must pass now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: So JoAnna was surely right to move on|pg||
nt|mikam1: Good auction, yes|pg||
nt|mikam1: After a club lead I think declarer will cash the heart ace and lead a spade to the king (assuming East ducks)|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the idea is that 2@d shows hearts (if you have a bad hand with diamonds, then the Lord help you)|pg||
nt|mikam1: But we haven't gotten the club lead yet|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am afraid there would not be much chances left for Joel to catch up.  With this low scoring, I would say both teams  played excellent bridge as we witnessed here.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, a well played match...some missed chances, but not many|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: with trump control, I would lead the singleton club as East.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and declarer might also use that (trump control) as a inference to cash HA, then spade to K.|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, I'd bet on that line|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|dburn: still, at least on this bidding Levin will know that her only shot is to duck a medium spade if North plays one|pg||
nt|mikam1: Stansby-zur Campanile have played very well in this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the closed room just finished|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|gracelin: c2 is of curse a suit preference for D|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|dburn: good shot|pg||
nt|mikam1: didn't cash the heart ace|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: when Migry didn't cash HA, and lead S9, she is probably not thinking along our line.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well this will keep Joel in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i could tell you about other potential swings -- but  it just wouldn't be right|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will be down only 12 after these 10 imps|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Moss is a 4-hand team and the two pairs played thru since the beginning.|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Migry thought that East would have led a club faster if she had the ace of spades|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, but this was only right if Levin had specifically Qx of trumps (I think)|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed, that's maybe her thot.  It's legal, but at your own risk, trying to guess opponents' mind.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|sA|pc|c8|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: Peter has his coffee|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force   jump to 3N should show 1N strength [but some flaw for 1N open]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and we have our answer|pg||

nt|ybob: 130 here i hope|pg||
mb|2S|nt|barnets: same bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: next board is promising as well|pg||
nt|barnets: now it went all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was probably a close call for Joel|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe Passell was playing his partner for the @SK rather than a minor-suit king|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N says they never bypass 4-card majors in responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: and so it goes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|barnets: personally i think if north shows a club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: south should support him|pg||
nt|barnets: but that my view  who knows|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: rather weird, yes  a ten cards fit buried in both rooms|pg||
nt|othered1: @DQ doesn't look very positive and @S were bid on his left, but still A9x is above expectations|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N shows clubs to all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: north has bid his suit with 1N|pg||

nt|barnets: in the other room 1N was clearly alerted to show clubs?|pg||
nt|barnets: can you say if it was clearly alerted here ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause = negotiating claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decision to bid 2@S instead of something else worked well|pg||
mc|10|nt|hackenbush: if East had played back a low heart, inserting @h9 is indicated from restricted choice, besides the fact that East might've tried @hK or spade from @hKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please let that be the case|pg||
nt|swanson: It seems a bit out of charater that Jill Meyers didn't open 1NT.  The hand does offer significant potential should partner have a big pointed suit fit.|pg||

nt|swanson: West might have bid 4@C over 3NT, being unwilling to allow the opponents a shot at a vulnerable 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: every imp is vital now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to distinguish  serious vs non-serious slam tries|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should be over quickly...S will take the @s hook into W hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so weichsel showed a rockcrushing 6/5 and lair declined|pg||
nt|barnets: a 1 imp swing could be very important for deutsch |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so that decision only affects which hand declares 4@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ybob: after the 3@C bid, could win 5@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: and as the cards lie -- it just doesn't matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57  the one where we talked about Rosenberg decision to respond 1@S or 2@C then they ended in 3@H [gulp]   Stansby did start with 2@C and is playing 3N South|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ybob: need guess @D only ...|pg||
nt|swanson: In 3NT with a spade lead declarer leads the @DQ.  If East covers (the reflex play) declarer ducks and has nine winners.|pg||
nt|ybob: scary if E play small :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  claim time |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: on 57  3N South after Stansby responded 2@C vs Rosenberg 1@S  [then the glitch that ended in 3@H]|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ybob: or bid 4@D over 3@S ...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|swanson: The downside is that if diamonds don't come it 3NT will be set multiple tricks.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: minimum number of tricks again|pg||

nt|ahollan1: interesting decision from Seamon-Molson|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: whatever he leads helps declarer to an extent|pg||
nt|barnets: north will place the final contract\|pg||
nt|ritong: one of weichsel's problems currently is: if i raise @ds, what will be the agreed suit|pg||
nt|daman: a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok   and from Rosenberg with 1N |pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer might throw a club on a spade and play for a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively try and get the diamonds going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has Sokolow had ANY easy bids this set?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||

pc|dA|pg||

nt|barnets: where to play|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D could be right|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|barnets: now south is worried  he has shown more diamonds than he has|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ybob: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: saving 2 imps|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hackenbush: this double partner almost certainly has 4 spades, looking for the big payoff when both 2@h and 2@s makes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|barnets: souths decision could have been a match winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Dummy showed max, stiff heart|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks sure to be flat|pg||
nt|ritong: lair took a huge view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 & 6 imp swings also add up quickly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: definitely|pg||
nt|ybob: she needs run the first @S to 12|pg||
nt|swanson: And guess diamonds.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: looks innocuous, but is enormous|pg||
nt|barnets: of course north had not guaranteed 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: so the whole situation is wooly to say the least|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: seems she should have gotten that right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just don't ask me why|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: declarer is going to go for a club ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time to claim|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: now needs exact @S layout  and that will mean Radin holds @CQ  else she would have opened 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is just for down 1|pg||
nt|hackenbush: unfortunately can't get to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right  needed @HK as entry|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the key facets in defense is to try not to break new suits for declarer hence Bob's return of a @s|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: finally getting some real help from opp|pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: Still has to guess diamonds for 11. |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  the tough part is now|pg||
nt|andyv:  best seems AK @h and ruff @c|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only worry now is holding the trump losers to one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you ruff a diamond now|pg||
nt|athene: you know west has the king still so that isn't getting overruffed|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @d ruff, E pitches @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but you might still be able to combine chances in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: with some trump coup possibilities|pg||
nt|andyv:  so basically the same thing but ruff 1@d first then AK@h?  that works too|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: she will take the money and run    no finesses|pg||
nt|ybob: now 11 surely|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ritong: soooo....|pg||
nt|ritong: is that one mundane?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: the idea of ruffing some diamonds was that you might then be able to cash the @HAK and even if west showed out you would not necessarily be dead|pg||
nt|athene: as you might have a trump coup against east|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hand|pg||
nt|daman: NS will end up in another lazy 4@H contract|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well Valerie Westheimer in the BBO Junior club calls that the flying ace syndrome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C by many would be artificial  [example: same bid as if RHO opened 1N]  so PASS/DBL/3@C were her options|pg||
nt|hackenbush: most play double as negative here over 3@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but might be scary if partner passes|pg||

nt|hackenbush: good lead, holding values in both unbid suits|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
nt|swanson: I would think that North would take an essentially certain profit against 4@H.  Wrong again.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
nt|ybob: true moment :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ybob: can win too|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Profits are good|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@D rounds pitch @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
nt|hackenbush: still making, as NS can't get in to lead trumps again|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting that is:)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Seniors   Milner leads Lynch by 23     Schwartz over O'Rourke by 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd even wager that most would sit 3N|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|athene: he will see south has five diamonds and one heart|pg||
nt|daman: has to get busy and knock out the @H Ace|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|barnets: so we have a 6 board play off and hope to bring it to you|pg||
nt|daman: that's the end of the defense|pg||
nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|daman: claim|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: and just the type of opportunity Joel needs|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: first needs confirmation of the tie|pg||
nt|barnets: if the scores we have are accurate|pg||
nt|ritong: in any case, this room will be closed|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to load the playoff boards|pg||
nt|ritong: if any|pg||
nt|barnets: while we are waiting all those interested in extraordinary bridge stories from the past and hands from the present|pg||
nt|barnets: visit www.shenkinbridge.com|pg||
nt|ritong: do we have an operator again?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|othered1: Incidentally, on board 42, east in OR did bid 5@C over north's 4@C cue-bid, south made the expected forcing pass then raised north's 5@D to slam.  |pg||
pc|hK|mc|9|pg||
qx|o64|st||md|2SA9863H5DQJ97543C,S754HT8742D2CJ973,SQHAKQJDAT8CAKT65,SKJT2H963DK6CQ842|sv|e|nt|mikam1: With the spade ten, she could have set up 9 tricks safely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still swing potential here|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well this is exciting...up in the air here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: But last board could be a swing also.  Moss needs to bid to 6D to maintain their lead.|pg||
nt|mikam1: NS did well to play exactly 6@D|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, not five and not seven|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mikam1: A good shift on the last hand by Stansby in any case...she gave her side a chance|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|gracelin: their only protection is that one key card is missing for Diamonds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not be so easy now - that 1@c opening may turn out to waste space, not save it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Seamon-Molson started with 2@C   i thought that made it very tough for Rosenberg but she came thru in the end|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mikam1: This shows diamonds generally|pg||
nt|gracelin: presume NS use transfer response to 1C opening, 1S shows D.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Which makes the North hand extremely strong|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is a true reverse, but with lot extras.|pg||
nt|mikam1: If South shows long diamonds, North will eventually Blackwood|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: and find out 1 key-card is missing|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: from their system summary form  1@S=is either a) bal 0-8 hcp, b) bal gf, c) 4+D, 0+hcp: no 4-card Major unless gf |pg||
nt|mikam1: The question is...will South get in North's way?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Stansby has a difficult bid here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|gracelin: she showed her 6-5 pattern for the moment.|pg||
nt|mikam1: This is fine I think...North should RKC for diamonds|pg||
nt|mikam1: If possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: but it's certainly an uncommon auction|pg||
nt|mikam1: Not the kind of thing that's often discussed|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean 1@s rather than 1@h|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's not so uncommon if you just treat the 1S bid as a 1D bid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: last hand here in an exciting match -- thanks to our fine commentators -- next matches start in 12 hrs & 10 min|pg||
nt|mikam1: and they are a fairly new partnership|pg||
nt|mikam1: and the match hangs in the balance.............|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mikam1: If North were to eventually blast 6N, that would survive (probably) too|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mikam1: torture for South|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now RKC!!|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north now cue 4H, south can bid 5NT as grand slam force.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mikam1: The question is...are they on the same wavelength?|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think 4@H was Keycard|pg||
nt|mikam1: and 4N showed 1....but I can't be sure|pg||
nt|dburn: looks OK so far - nothing to suggest this is off the rails|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|mikam1: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: but this...|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but they sure tortured the audience|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: migry thinking|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe 5@D showed 3 keycards?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   not over|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe there is something to worry about|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: This could end the auction....no!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and there are your winners|pg||
nt|dburn: ...nah - nothing to worry about|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: They knew what they were doing!!|pg||
nt|gracelin: so 4NT is the RKC.|pg||
nt|dburn: but no one should ever bid seven in any murky auction|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe it was all cuebidding...we'll find out in the post-game interview.  Tune in to Channel 5 at 11PM|pg||
nt|gracelin: Would love to congratulate to both teams for an excellent match.  The loser still has chance for USA II|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: losers tonight play off tomorrow during the finals; then losers of the finals play the winner of tonight's losers -- all matches 96 bds over 1.5 days from now on|pg||
nt|mikam1: Actually, the winner is not even in yet - I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: winners play for USA1|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: right, they cannot suffer two cntinuous losses.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mikam1: Congrats to both teams - a great match :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|mikam1: thanks all|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks all, especially to Joe for an excellent work.  Bye.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: thanks Patrick|pg||

nt|daman: thanks to our operator Gary Hann    super job|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the set   restart in about 2.5 hours|pg||
nt|ybob: OR lead was J@C and declarer win the first trick and go down|pg||
nt|ybob: if she duck 1 @C cold too |pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board for us -- other rooms still in play  and lots of bridge tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C anyone?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 50% grand    do NS think they need it?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hackenbush: too bad they're favorable|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ybob: no trf response after X|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: next session begins in roughly 40 minutes|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C must show @Cs obviously|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many pairs like to play that 3-level preempts have tighter range, depending on colors|pg||
nt|tez: last here.ty all.enjoyed .ty Roberto. TY SPECS|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|hackenbush: so favorable 3@c = bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable = random hand  but 2nd seat ??|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes 2nd seat should usually be stronger|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 3@c certainly works better for this hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: an inspired lead|pg||
nt|ybob: Ty Tezcan|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: even 6@D may be challenge after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: no reason to get too fancy|pg||
nt|daman: over to a @S    @C finesse    @C Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might sound heretical, but i never liked 2@C with hand this flexible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- i'm a big clubber so very biased|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tez: Ty gary:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the more i watch, the more convinced i am that transfers over the DBL work much better than standard  [i.e. a forcing 1@H feels wrong]|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 6@D a reasonable shot now|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: Sokolow DBL = 3@H  [support dbl]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: NS did avoid going for 800 in 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminds me of my grandfather     i saved $100,000 dollars today   saw a house i loved and didn't buy it     [it was a long time ago]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: certainly pairs that play transfers over 1@c opening, play it over the double, e.g. Garner-Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if not playing them over 1@C-P   many play them over 1@C-X and 1@D-X|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many more play them over 1M-Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of agony here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those have been around longer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: from the players or the specs following our ramblings?>|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Debbie|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzff: It was a bit of an ordeal lol :)|pg||
nt|swanson: There is another set of 16 boards to decided this match - will start in 15-20 minutes.|pg||

nt|ybob: Thx all|pg||
