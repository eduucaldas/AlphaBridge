mb|p|nt|psyck: Do you Michaels or bid 2@h on 1@s here?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  I would michaels it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: ok, we get to see how either approach works :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. if playing it strong|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|psyck: Agree Andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hi CK:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Is what I shouldnt have said|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: Hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Commentator's curse strikes again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: this is ambitious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only safe prediction is not to predict|pg||
pc|c9|nt|oosmanb: with 5@S and just 2@D I dont think W should be interested in advancing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: minimal values, very likely misfit hands|pg||
nt|josj: and no adequate stops in either black suit...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: As south I would be most upset that partner didnt start with A@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South only bid the suit and then dbled|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kiwi_joker: hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  S came here to bid!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwi_joker: this will be interesting|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: now he'll switch to K@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  S will have to set up @ds...I don't see how he makes this|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: a couple of @d's to lose & once he ruffs some @c, has to lose trump|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: will ruff a @c & run @dT now i suppose|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and be most upset|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|oosmanb: lucky they have another suit on the side to cash out|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  choices pretty limited|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: J now, but saving beer card won't help|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: looks like -1, coz he cant to everything (cross ruff the whole hand AND make a long diamond trick)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  now back to board and @d back hoping to crash honors?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: haha, i like the way you think, andy  :)|pg||
nt|psyck: actually he is playing for xruff now|pg||
nt|psyck: hoping for 1@d, 1@c & 9 trumps|pg||
nt|psyck: the problem with that is that when he ruffs @h, E can discard @c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|oosmanb: I'm being asked with the dbl actually told pd NOT to lead @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Some people do play those dbls|pg||
mc|5|nt|oosmanb: But I think its safe to assume here that this South DID want a @S lead|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, i see no reason whe he could not have made 11 trick after @dK won on cross  ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes but Manoppo would not do that with the spades he had|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And hence we can deduce they play regular lead asking dbls|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  22 vs 0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: They got -4 though, so North survives to tell the tale|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything seems to be reversed nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: too bad, he declarer did start the play well until then to justify his bidding|pg||
