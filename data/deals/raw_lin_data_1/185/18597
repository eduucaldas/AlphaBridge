pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|patricck: With no opposition bidding to help you a 7NT contract on these cards is in the high 60's. maybe even 70%, but that is still a borderline for whether you want to bid a grand slam|pg||
nt|patricck: as it happens West has bid the NT first and 7NT is not as good from his side, because a club lead puts you to an immediate guess|pg||

nt|granguru: over 2@d it means (normally) possibilty to play in  both majors...strong hands have to be doubled or cuebidded|pg||
pc|dK|nt|patricck: lets hope declarer doesn't lead the 9@H, that is an extra trick away|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer would like an extra entry to the North hand, but thinking about it for longer won't suddenly create one....|pg||
