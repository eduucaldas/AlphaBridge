nt|suketbombi: azwer he has been paul the octopus here:)|pg||
nt|azwer46: :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: one more effective strategy in recovery matches is the use of PENALTY X|pg||
nt|azwer46: right|pg||
nt|psridhar: a couple of speculative penalty X can bring more return than just the imps |pg||
nt|azwer46: this brd may give a few to India|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a failed penalty X does not increase their lead 2 much ( assuming no XX of course)|pg||
nt|mango joe: he may go more than 2 off by winning in dummy & playing @h to K, his only chance|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sumit was close to a penlaty X here but (1) auction was too confident (2) no trump trick- but if he had chanced he might hv won 6|pg||
nt|mango joe: @hs 3-2 with A onside & trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|mango joe: but @S pips are no good for that play|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he wasnt sure of   1@S-2@S range,  i  gathered thatmuch from querry he made before final pass.|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: close i think but a slam seems far away|pg||
nt|stc: yes, S has 3 trumps but also 4@ss|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming 2@C was gf - 3@C would give them a chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: anyway grand os bad and reaching slam would be very well played|pg||
nt|roswolf: good grief that cant be right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: well should be -2 but a very bold decision|pg||
nt|stc: if the find the @h ruff they take 500|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: some "action" here now|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|robdonk: yep, 3@D looks a good result |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with at least 12 tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ehsana: heart ruff is omenous now after 1H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|psridhar: u will get a 2nd chance for @h ruff even if not found on lead -if @c king is led rt?|pg||
nt|mango joe: no trumps 2-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|robdonk: and 12 in NT :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|robdonk: nice bid by Berend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I find the pass of 3 diamonds x in the OR surprising|pg||
nt|robdonk: agree, but penalty is penalty:)|pg||

nt|psridhar: ok bhabesh will find out soon|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: its a penalty?|pg||

pc|c8|nt|psridhar: though it fails that lead could easily have been right in a diff layout-perhaps if he had known about @c length with his pd -say on fit jump 2@h-he wd hv found the killer lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|azwer46: friendly fire|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mango joe: that is a good play, the duck|pg||
pc|cT|nt|azwer46: agreed friendly enough|pg||
nt|mango joe: theres always @H to 9 of course|pg||
nt|mango joe: but not needed|pg||
nt|mango joe: he sint claiming in case East leads another @D- not likely|pg||
nt|mango joe: Bhabesh will conclude that the only hope is AQ@H with Sumit|pg||
nt|ehsana: Bhabeshs thinking now is a bit late |pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|mc|12|nt|wilkinsona: Im not sure of the strength of the opening 1NT, but perhaps west could have bid more|pg||
