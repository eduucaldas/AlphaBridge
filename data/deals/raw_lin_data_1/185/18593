nt|Walddk2: Mary is our operator|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jim Tritt|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to Gavin Wolpert|pg||
nt|gavin:  Hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfk: Hi all, back finally...live from DEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetroit.|pg||
nt|gavin:  levins first order of business is going to be to take a diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wygbe1: should have 9 tricks now - 3 sp, 3 diam, 1h, 2c|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gavin:  if you have unlimited entries|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|gavin:  the best way to play the suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  is to lead low to the queen|pg||
nt|gavin:  its better than playing the Jack in case south has singleton king|pg||
nt|gavin:  so she will be evaluating if she can afford to do so|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  things are getting a little hairy with that losing finesse|pg||
nt|gavin:  in order to come to 9 tricks she needs 3@S 1@H 3@D and 2@C|pg||
nt|gavin:  she still doesnt know how many @H tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: club is good shift, may need to lead h after winning second club and before leading spade|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wygbe1: needs to take out norths heart entry, in order to later get the third spade trick|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|gavin:  now north played very quickly|pg||
nt|gavin:  may have been worried their partner had KJTx of clubs|pg||
nt|gavin:  establishing clubs isnt serving a purpose with no more entries|pg||
nt|wygbe1: winning the h and playing back the nine, as spec points out, may have beaten this|pg||
nt|gavin:  now levin pretty much knows she is making|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ace and a spade now, results in 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gavin:  since the location of the KS is known|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wygbe1: large pick up for ew|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|gavin:  careful lay by levin here|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sJ|nt|gavin:  just in case north had the spades|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|gavin:  leaving herself a chance to throw north in with a spade to collect 2 heart tricks|pg||

nt|psyck: very likely :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra2: sort of weakish nt |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: a muilderberg 2@S showing a weak 2 suiter would be interesting |pg||
nt|swanson: You're right - playing the opponents to have made a great play is a losing proposition.  Better to be tricked and congratulate them after the hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: if n/s are in aggressive mode may well bid 3nt/4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the normal opening may fare much worse|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: that seemed to stop abruptly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3S=Limit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: looks std contract no matter what nt range you play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Gene, HI!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: lot of work to do but may get home here|pg||
nt|roswolf: fancy defence will prevail|pg||
nt|psyck: trumps unfav, but everything else works fine|pg||
nt|psyck: can even get away with losing just the trump tricks & nothing else|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond loser?|pg||
nt|psyck: on @s|pg||
nt|psyck: with the points balanced 20-20, NS were going to win the auction at this vul, quite lieky other table will also play in same spot|pg||
nt|psyck: with having to ruff the @d, will likely lose 2@s & 2@c|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s 1@c|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, right|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: CONSERVATIVE MODE|pg||
nt|roswolf: solidity personified|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|swanson: The pass my South is clear.  North might have found an excuse to promote here flat 14 to a 1NT opening, but I don't see one.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: ah with the finesse right i see|pg||
nt|tez: hard to gues|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|psyck: may lose 3@s though after xruff|pg||

nt|pbundy: hi shirley|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tez: she played normal i think|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|psyck: had chances if W had another @c maybe|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would be curious to hear the auction on the first board in this set.  down this much - the sprung team might have shot it out in 6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|swanson: When holding touching honors (the @S10,9 in this case) one leads the lower one if she doesn't want a cover, the higher one if you do.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|psyck: NV, maybe N should not have stretched to 3@s|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|swanson: Declarer could have used a cover of the first honor here, but didn't know it.|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 3@s and i would play same line:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: it was certainly close :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: the luck of the weak NT.  at the other table, declarer was treated to a spade lead as south was on lead|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|tez: need ruff now |pg||
nt|sybarra2: we picked it up mid stream |pg||
nt|sybarra2: so dont knmow|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *know|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: too bad N's side suit was not worth much to pd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: A smother play?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|tez: no|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: just making small trumps by ruffing @s now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hJ|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: on 50 6 imps back to sprung when 3@D went 2 off in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: I'm told 3@s was mixed raise & not limit raise|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: if which case N may have underbid & S overbid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|sK|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|gavin:  its definitely not a good idea to be opening balanced hands like this|pg||
nt|gavin:  in a normal 2/1 style|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gavin:  west giving leeway to easts 3rd seat opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  a lot of pairs play 2NT as a limit raise in @H here|pg||
nt|gavin:  since there is no cuebid available without forcing to game|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|gavin:  east is considering throwing away a diamond here to avoid being shortened|pg||
nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||
nt|gavin:  and figure out if she can handle a 5-0 split|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gavin:  there will be no diamond finesse on this hand, |pg||
nt|gavin:  since it will take all of her trumps to draw norths hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|s2|pg||

nt|roswolf: moreimps to sprung the match tightens|pg||
nt|psyck: rather than other way around|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|psyck: mixed raise is about 6-9 hcp, but N's controls & shape were worth more|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|pbundy: i thought that the west hand might qualify for another weak nt - bu t- perhaps a little under par at these colors.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: not certain of their range vulnerable|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: north passes and east doesnt protect -hmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: E-W play Weak 1NT all positions, all vulnerabilities|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: all very normal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bob Heitzman|pg||
nt|psyck: may have been better to use the red suit aces to ruff out @c, then E would have been enplayed a bit|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bob|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi|pg||
nt|psyck: E had too many @s to balance|pg||
pc|s9|nt|swanson: No chance for even 2NT here after the normal heart lead because the @CK is offside.|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart lead should scupper this with the club K wrong|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: has to guess either rounded suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: time to switch|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobh1: can set up an elimination|pg||
nt|psyck: & W did not have enough to prebalance|pg||
nt|pbundy: 12 to 14?  some might consider this hand in the range - thnx gary|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|tez: ace king @d and @d nice play|pg||
nt|roswolf: not convinced|pg||
pc|sT|nt|swanson: Surprise lead, but there is time to shift.|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play udca?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I gather not 11 :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: not so easy in trumps but may be forced into the right club view|pg||
nt|psyck: will just play @hA & elim @s as Bob says|pg||
nt|swanson: Yes.  UDCA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: this could be very good news for sprung|pg||
nt|puncher99: big swing here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: K apparently asked attitude|pg||
nt|swanson: No time to shift now.  It is tough to see how the diamond continuation was tempting with the J8xx in dummy.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north obviously didnt fancy making the obvious heart lead fearing declarer was well prepared for it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Trick 1 standard signals|pg||
nt|tez: lose 1@s 2@h 1@c 1@d maximum|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: OK, they may actually have been playing 3@d as mixed & 3@s as limit , so we were right 1st time around|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|bobh1: ie ruff out @Ss and then play A @H and a @H|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: N plays 3@s as mixed with Michael Rosenberg, but maybe not here.|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|gavin:  when agreeing to play texas transfers its important to discuss whether you play them in competition|pg||
nt|gavin:  and when the bids cease to be texas|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|gavin:  I'm a fan of using texas over 1NT (3D)|pg||
nt|gavin:  or even 3H|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||
nt|gavin:  when both bids are jumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|gavin:  4S can go down|pg||
nt|gavin:  by leading a diamond and using the ace of hearts entry to get a ruff|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: down in other oom in 4s|pg||
nt|gavin:  the other hand was dummy in the other room and north holding two aces lead their singleton Q|pg||
nt|gavin:  more difficult when west is dummy|pg||
nt|gavin:  as T, J, Q, A doesnt really expose norths singleton|pg||
nt|gavin:  so it may not be an obvious diamond return|pg||

nt|roswolf: might be played in 1/2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a swing board if ever i saw one|pg||
nt|roswolf: horrible overbidding in the other room lucky to escape a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: South 'could' have held the Q107 of diamonds, but that is not consistent with the auction.  |pg||
mb|1D|nt|pbundy: a great number of hands this match, so it seems, where weak nt led to swings|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: agree john|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Irwin Boris|pg||
nt|sybarra2: how many hts?|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi irwin :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|swanson: The three hearts with two honors was difficult to envision though. |pg||
nt|pbundy: this seems like the right   of hearts to me - a cue bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: not all that horrible actually :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: 4 card majors & non forcing NT, don't see them often|pg||
nt|roswolf: does that specifically show @H+@C or any major + clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1st blood to joel - on 35 4@H went -2|pg||
nt|psyck: the opening could just be due to 3rd seat ofc|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: 2 Lower|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch |pg||
nt|swanson: West doubles here to show good defense for the 2NT overcall, obviously having little to do with her spade holding.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: this looks a good slam|pg||
nt|tez: she is looking for grand|pg||
nt|psyck: N had a game try with max & shape & decent suits, & S had @dA in the trial suit...|pg||
nt|pbundy: and another hand going down on a ruff - so it would seem.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will need the right signals here |pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: rdbl or 5@D under consideration by south but she takes the money|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck: & 4@s had a chance with red suit cards well placed...|pg||
nt|roswolf: not over west's double imo|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: @cQ to knock out @d entry? :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|swanson: She hasn't made this contract yet.  |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: @H forces may be horrible|pg||
nt|pbundy: debbie can get her signal now|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course declarer has the petite problem of doing something with those clubs, too|pg||
nt|irwinbo: most roads lead to down 1|pg||
nt|sybarra2: probably can not swallow them |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|psyck: yes, i'm just saying it may have been aggresive , not horrible :)|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be a push with an easy to reach slam|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|swanson: I think the best she can do is a spade to the queen, then diamonds discarding the heart - defense gets three clubs and a heart.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 looks about right in which case e/w will be laughing all the way to the bank|pg||
nt|swanson: and a spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: @s best as dec doen't know which minor working yet|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: GOOD POINT|pg||
nt|psyck: on a bad day, the hand with single @s would not have @hA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck: so NT probably better|pg||
nt|roswolf: but if the ace of hearts had been in the other hand 6@H would have gone off on a spade lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|swanson: It would be great for declarer if West could ruff this - then spades 3-2.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: now can go for 8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mc|9|nt|swanson: The @CK instead of a low one cost a trick.|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer 'knows' spades are 4-1 because West followed to two diamonds.  She will eventually discard a diamond.|pg||

nt|roswolf: prefer to bid 1@H rather than double|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like the idea of overcalling opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s & 2 in other suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: shouldnt matter though|pg||
nt|bobh1: now she may know enuf to avoid a @D lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: a light vul opening may cause some problems|pg||
nt|pbundy: with that beautiful shape, i think i'd pass.  though not clear decision; debbie could have a better hand nad more spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|swanson: It might have looked speculative to sit in 4@S doubled with only four, but partner will only assume a four card holding so should be removing with fewer than four cards.|pg||
nt|irwinbo: conservative to pass but the winning call|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: well, on @c lead, tough, but defense not easy here either|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s enough i belive|pg||

pc|s6|nt|gavin:  right will surely lose 1@S and 2@D, need to avoid 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  and the two ways to play the suit to avoid 2 losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  are if you think the layout is as it lies with east having honor doubeton|pg||
nt|gavin:  you lead the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ladies talking, bridge stuff|pg||
nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east does cover then you win the ace and lead towards the ten|pg||
nt|gavin:  however that would not work if east has Q9x and west has Kx|pg||
nt|gavin:  as east would not cover with Q9x and have a sure trick later|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|gavin:  so if you think the hearts are reversed|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|gavin:  you must begin the suit by leading low from Axx|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|gavin:  then if west has Honor doubleton they can fly up|pg||
nt|gavin:  but now you can finesse east|pg||
nt|gavin:  and if they dont fly their honor will drop under the ace|pg||
nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gavin:  leading the jack has the added bonus of being able to pick up KQx in east and 9x with west|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ????????????????????????|pg||

mb|1N|nt|swanson: Some Multi players differentiate between good and bad weak 2's with 2@D(weak) or 2 of a major (better).|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|swanson: THe Jills use their major 2's as Polish (5-5) so only have one range of weak 2's.|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks inevitable|pg||

mb|4S|nt|bobh1: has to guess @Ds|pg||

nt|psyck: has to use up only entry to dummy to play @d & hope for 2@s, 1@h, 5@d, 1@c|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, west has shown a strong nt and sally does not want to give up on slam quite yet|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra2: and close to making slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|irwinbo: perverse psychology says she shouldn't bid it beacause they will bid it in the other room to protect their position'|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: 1 diamond, 1 club and 4 spades is the best that declarer can do - and might not do that well.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|puncher99: ty all|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SCHEDULED restart in 30 mins approx|pg||
nt|roswolf: is that a vul opening -not in my book|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a firm 3nt is required|pg||
nt|sybarra: anyone a 4 @C  bidder?|pg||
nt|pbundy: not i - unless they play specific suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder |pg||
pc|cK|nt|pbundy: i am betting that they do  not :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|roswolf: spade now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Seems like the 5 of diamonds called for a spade?|pg||
nt|swanson: Balderson has run out of green cards evidently.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet you are right |pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: another contract is let through on the lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|swanson: This is four diamonds, four spades and two clubs for declarer.  But North coudn't get on play to lead a heart in any event.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfd: It's a thoughtful play to help partner|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pbundy: i wonder if e/w plays any michaels vs michaels|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pbundy: would seem not because you'd think east would then pass 3@H|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: more imps to sprung likely|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|swanson: The defense can cut declarer's communitcation with a second spade, but that is still 9 tricks (and a very unlikely play).|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start is in 2hrs approx|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|swanson: It is best to duck another spade here - insures the contract.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: Merci :) These women are a joy to watch|pg||
nt|roswolf: cash out winners -seems easy|pg||
nt|psyck: bye|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|swanson: If declarer had gone up and found North with four spades she could have been in trouble.  Nice play.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: dont understand|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bid boldly play safe was always a good principle|pg||
