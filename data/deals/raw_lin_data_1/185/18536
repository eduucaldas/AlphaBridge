mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=2+|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision 2@C|pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT won't do well|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: 2@S non-forcing but constructive for most precision-club-style pairs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout    big surprise, right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok  BOTH   DBL were takeout|pg||
nt|peachy: 2@S forcing 1 round|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i wonder what difference would be for Wold   2@D vs RDBL|pg||
nt|athene: ah right ok|pg||

nt|peachy: aah, maybe not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: 4@S now|pg||
nt|peachy: well, card says it is F|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead, diamond back, trump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW keep bidding @D    scary stuff|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: easy for us :)|pg||
nt|athene: so often you feel you probably ought to lead a trump but you decide to lay down just ONE top honour first to see dummy|pg||
nt|athene: and what you see is, yes, ya shouldda led that trump|pg||
nt|peachy: Garozzo's rule: Freely paraphrased:  You must have a good reason not to lead trump|pg||
nt|athene: the auction does suggest north might be ruffing diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so i think a trump lead is not impossible to find|pg||
nt|athene: west might be a bit scared that if she leads trumps declarer might get the clubs going, but partner's job is to hold a nice big club card|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, N could be 5-4 though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Long discussion with Rosenburg and N-S as to the meaning of N bids.|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure 2@C promises six|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no-one plays it as 5+ any more|pg||
nt|athene: well, ok, some do, but not many|pg||
nt|peachy: I dont know their styule exactly but 5-4 is possible in addition to 6-3 and 6-4|pg||
nt|peachy: the way many play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: It was described as 6-4 or cue.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: 660 other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit's 3@D ruled out that contract|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|peachy: ok, I am behind the times then, no surprise there|pg||
nt|peachy: Thx Kathy|pg||
nt|athene: most strong club pairs these days give up a bit of definition on the 1@D opener in order to have 2@C promise six cards|pg||
nt|athene: so with e.g. 4M225@C they are opening 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: (or 1nt of course, hahaha)|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps some judgment allowed with a very sparkly club suit of 5 cards, I would assume|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @CAKQJ10 might decide that isn't a 1@D opener :)|pg||
nt|athene: not sure clubs can be sparkly though, can they?|pg||

nt|athene: Molson will not be too hopeful - if declarer's trumps were susceptible to a trump promotion she would probably not ruff the diamond with the king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Short break.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|3H|nt|athene: would prefer to ruff low, lead king, and if that is allowed to hold, come to hand with heart ruff|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@h here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Yes|pg||
nt|reisig: Hard to avoid 4@c|pg||
nt|jpes: a player with sporting blood|pg||
mb|d|an|!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = non-force  denies 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you sorta want to show both majors with that south hand|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@h -- not best|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: normally if you are going to compete with a modest 44 majors you bid 1@S intending 2@H next|pg||
nt|athene: but south didn't really want to do that because she wants the heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: so if she started with 1@S and opps went into a fast 3nt or something, she would not feel so good|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, this hand exception, also a consideration if partner reads you for 5S 4H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tez: i wold bid 4@h.you?|pg||
nt|dinos1: i'dt bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: the problem is now she has to bid 2@S|pg||
nt|tez: would|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how auction will go in other room    1@C[nat]-1@H//??   1N??|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: was not here at that time|pg||
nt|athene: but she feels ok, if partner didn't raise my hearts she should have four spades|pg||
nt|tez: if parner has !q of @d enuf:)|pg||
nt|reisig: 5-5 .w 4+ fit ...yes|pg||
nt|jpes: absolutely and the dummy would annoy me|pg||
nt|tez: dummy has very bad for me|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|athene: it all comes down to how much the doubler needs just to make a "courtesy" raise|pg||
nt|athene: in the old days you needed a really big hand but the requirements are dropping steadily|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: people prefer to just raise on anything if they have 4-card support|pg||
nt|athene: quite right too :) gotta get in there|pg||
nt|peachy: In competition (over the Dbl) even sttricter pdships allow raise with less if pure sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a 17 count with 4 hearts she can surely redouble first or cue or something|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 2@H over the double of 1@H should show the world|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dinos1: even then only -1|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|athene: but anyway....the end result is that south has had to go a level higher than necessary|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h5|nt|athene: hearts often get pushed to the 3-level by troublesome spade competition - but it's a little embarrassing when it's you who supplied the competition|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: 3 boards missing from the movie - so dont believe this running total|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good start for declarer but it doesn't seem to be enough.|pg||

nt|peachy: 2S changed the picture|pg||
