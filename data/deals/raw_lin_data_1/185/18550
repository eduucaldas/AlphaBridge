mb|p|mb|2N|an|diamonds|nt|athene: hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: i think many people would simply bid 3nt with the south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Excellent 6@D because of the intermediates in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks there might be slam |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: There is|pg||
nt|athene: slam would be a lot worse without the @C9|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is 14-16; i assume 3@C shows a diamond fit|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|an|key card for diamonds|nt|athene: one problem with these methods is that usually opener just shows a fit with something like Kx, because mostly you are looking for 3nt and you want to know if the suit runs|pg||
nt|athene: so it can be hard for responder ever to find out if partner actually has length as well in the minor|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D might well be RKCB in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: of course if partner has @SKxx you want her to play it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: OK|pg||
nt|athene: but south takes a sensible enough stance|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D was Minorwood   5@C  2 KCs + trump queen|pg||
nt|athene: now south knows she is facing @DAQ @SA and might think about a grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: well bid|pg||
nt|athene: it would be hard to find 7 even if there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But as Bill said, without @C9 the slam is not so good|pg||
nt|athene: you would need pd to have a trick source in clubs or something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here it is better than 75%|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: well, subtract some for diamonds 4-0|pg||
nt|athene: it's huge played by south because if both clubs are offside, west is likely to lead one|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|athene: you would like to fiddle around hoping to bring down @HQJx or so but you can't get cute like that|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry i did miss the double of 3@C haha|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|s9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stansby is happy about it|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so slam is pretty much a certainty after the double|pg||

nt|tez: Hi|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: very good 6 @d|pg||
nt|mikam1: NS are on for 6D, but very hard to reach|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mikam1: Perfect controls and the 109 of clubs|pg||
nt|tez: need 2 @c trick and split @d|pg||
nt|mikam1: Must be somewhere in the neighborhood of 65% I suspect|pg||
nt|mikam1: Although I'm not great at bridge math :)|pg||
nt|tez: they have zero bad point|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Some would open the North hand with 1N even playing 15-17, with 5 controls and 3 tens|pg||

nt|athene: the way it went|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but much harder certainly|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: it helps to be minimum for your bid rather than maximum|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because partner is going to be pushing on a lot more often|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A coffee 3NT, just what I need|pg||
nt|athene: so if you do have a 14 count, you really want to have opened a 14-16 notrump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Undo please, Joe|pg||
nt|athene: rather than rebid an 11-14 notrump|pg||
nt|athene: then you know you are not missing anything ever|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bernstein may not make 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a yawner, perhaps for an overtrick depending on lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Migry puts out the 4 tens first|pg||
nt|athene: a feisty 3nt overcall, even at this vulnerability, certainly|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: run five diamonds and watch the defenders wriggle a bit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: gives you much more chance of finding that @SQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||

nt|athene: ok lots of people want to know if she made her 7nt - it was just a joke, she had a balanced 7 count or something|pg||
nt|athene: she changed it to a pass|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: helps to have opps who are not sticklers for the letter of the law, perhaps :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it was 9 or 10, no big deal|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mikam1: Looks like 2N-3N|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mikam1: Declarer won't have much to go on in terms of guessing the spade queen correctly|pg||

nt|mikam1: On the first board, North did open 1N in the other room...(not sure the range) and arrived at 6@D|pg||
nt|mikam1: So there will be a new leader|pg||

nt|mikam1: Either pass or 1@S is possible|pg||
nt|mikam1: Or 2@C if played as natural of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps 2@c would be natural if 1@C can be short |pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|mikam1: She went (reasonably) for the 4 card overcall|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@s - Mike Lawrence would approve|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Looks like this will end it|pg||
nt|tez: 2 nt 3@h all pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 2@c would be 5/4 majors, even ove short @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: 2@h presumably nf....but South might think F if rebidding 2NT|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@s 3@h..we play this hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mikam1: Tough play here for West I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always a thorny question, whether 1@C-(1@s)-2@h should be forcing or not |pg||
nt|mikam1: She doesn't even know if partner has 2 or 3 spades|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|h3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well this will be a winner :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mikam1: Good play by Radin...this will set up a defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|tez: cash @s ace..look to your partners card..if she give 7 of @s..shift @c|pg||
nt|mikam1: Excellent defense all around...but agreed on that point Tezcan|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mikam1: There is a "slight" chance the second spade wouldn't cash though...if they lead 3rd from 4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mikam1: Although granted partner might have raised with 4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|mikam1: well done in any case|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East would surely raise spades with four trumps though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|mikam1: agreed|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c8|pg||
mc|7|nt|mdgraham: and might have raised with her actual hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, well defended|pg||
nt|tez: i can say perfect bidding|pg||
nt|mikam1: Are we still here?|pg||
nt|tez: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as aif NS play 2@h as forcing after the 1@s overcall (else South could have passed) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 2N is presumabky minimum and 3@h to play|pg||
nt|mikam1: Most play it's forcing for one round|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
