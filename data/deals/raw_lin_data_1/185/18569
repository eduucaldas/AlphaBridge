mb|p|nt|psyck: Do you Michaels or bid 2@h on 1@s here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: multi 2@d. showing weak in either Maj. but that suit maybe not to everyone's standard|pg||
mb|2D|nt|don_kapu: what is 2@D ?|pg||
nt|alunand7: EW use standart sytem?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ntmon: i like 2@D bid - always brings difficulties to opps|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  I would michaels it|pg||
mb|r|nt|psyck: ok, we get to see how either approach works :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. if playing it strong|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this should end the auction|pg||
nt|blewah: i guess 3@h now shows minimum, fast arrival|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT a maker because no entry to @H|pg||
nt|ntmon: but NS can find a save|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|psyck: Agree Andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hi CK:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Is what I shouldnt have said|pg||
nt|ntmon: forcing pass by E ?|pg||
nt|alunand7: 2@D = weak M, now @H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: Hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|Walddk2: Commentator's curse strikes again|pg||
mb|5S|nt|don_kapu: just @C lead will defeated the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: this is ambitious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only safe prediction is not to predict|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: with 5@S and just 2@D I dont think W should be interested in advancing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: minimal values, very likely misfit hands|pg||
nt|josj: and no adequate stops in either black suit...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: As south I would be most upset that partner didnt start with A@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South only bid the suit and then dbled|pg||
nt|ntmon: i would vote for a forcing pass! E has @HA to marked singleton and unexpeced support for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  S came here to bid!|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, slam is a make and ns almost pushed by opps to the unbeatable @d slam|pg||

pc|c9|nt|kiwi_joker: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|motivasi: hii harry ..bos Don :)|pg||
nt|alunand7: hi andre :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: now he'll switch to K@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  S will have to set up @ds...I don't see how he makes this|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Hi Motivasi|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: a couple of @d's to lose & once he ruffs some @c, has to lose trump|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: will ruff a @c & run @dT now i suppose|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and be most upset|pg||
pc|d4|nt|blewah: EW i meant|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oosmanb: lucky they have another suit on the side to cash out|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  choices pretty limited|pg||
pc|c4|nt|don_kapu: double score for Manado = 11 imp's|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: J now, but saving beer card won't help|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: looks like -1, coz he cant to everything (cross ruff the whole hand AND make a long diamond trick)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  now back to board and @d back hoping to crash honors?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: haha, i like the way you think, andy  :)|pg||
nt|psyck: actually he is playing for xruff now|pg||
nt|psyck: hoping for 1@d, 1@c & 9 trumps|pg||
nt|psyck: the problem with that is that when he ruffs @h, E can discard @c|pg||
nt|blewah: but can be beaten by @s ruff. right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oosmanb: I'm being asked with the dbl actually told pd NOT to lead @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Some people do play those dbls|pg||
nt|ntmon: @D played by W|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Rainbow :)|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, i see no reason whe he could not have made 11 trick after @dK won on cross  ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes but Manoppo would not do that with the spades he had|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And hence we can deduce they play regular lead asking dbls|pg||
nt|alunand7: at OR @C lead too|pg||
nt|motivasi: anybody had the running score site?|pg||
nt|alunand7: sorry i mean CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  22 vs 0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: They got -4 though, so North survives to tell the tale|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything seems to be reversed nowadays|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C|nt|psyck: too bad, he declarer did start the play well until then to justify his bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Like the American woman last night who played a hand very well and went 4 down|pg||
nt|ntmon: the thing is to find right time to leave when using shaded openings|pg||
nt|blewah: ah, NS plays weak NT|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|don_kapu: but why 5@S + 0 in CR|pg||
nt|alunand7: i didnot understand too boss don :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Contradiction? Perhaps, but she did play it well|pg||
mb|4N|nt|oosmanb: -4 is good bridge then!|pg||
nt|blewah: so, 1@c in the previous board was not an upgrade but systemic|pg||
nt|alunand7: i think we need explanation from ope :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes i see from the movie they get 3 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Can be|pg||
nt|ntmon: or it is a standard :) upgrade|pg||
mb|5S|nt|josj: depends on the contract, maybe|pg||
nt|blewah: i think NS play natural system with weak NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Seriously, a lesser declarer would have made 10 easy tricks, an expert declarer would go 4 down|pg||

nt|oosmanb: or exactly 4 and dbl is 5|pg||

nt|ntmon: it is called a 'momentum' - sometimes you are ready for a couple of good results in a row|pg||
nt|blewah: otherwise it doesn't make much sense to lead a singleton when you have only 1 trump|pg||
nt|ntmon: personally i would not lead a @C, @H or @S lead likely|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, more tricks in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: perhaps negative free bids?|pg||

nt|ahalim: Hi Roland and Oosman|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should go down 2|pg||
nt|blewah: i guess 2@c by N is a transfer overcall. anybody knows?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong club (Precision) is the popular system in Indonesia|pg||
nt|ntmon: now the bidding rides into 4@S|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, Roland but natural system increasingly popular too nowadays|pg||
nt|blewah: i blame BBO for this phenomenon :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: east thinking about slam investigation?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosmanb: interesting bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good effort if they can reach 6@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes indeed and 4@s is a step in that direction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A contract with problems when clubs and hearts split badly|pg||
nt|motivasi: this the last board now for this round.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oosmanb: Unlucky|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: But a great contract when looking at the N-S cards only|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Manoppo could have bid 5NT instead, choice of slams|pg||
nt|oosmanb: hadnt shown his 5@h|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@h now i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, but 5@H seems unileteral|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|blewah: hard if W already showed 0-7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  (unless N tries to float the 10@s)|pg||

nt|oosmanb: let him choose|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: looks like an easy dummy-reversal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: easy? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ruffing 2 spades in hand with diamonds as entries looks like a plan|pg||
