nt|yorkbeach:  not know|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: This is a really good argument for the idea of playing 4 minor always forcing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  playing the 6 or 7 would have worked better|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  with no time to ser up the @d, declarer will need to hope for @c3-3 with the Q onside|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: OK, 1 down in 5 is irritating, but playing 6 in a partscore is considerably more galling|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: stopping on a dime in 4@C after the 3@S cue is just too small of a target|pg||
