nt|othered1: Their "system summary" says they do not play forcing 1N response to majors, which implies that 2/1 is not GF|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't believe there's a reasonable single-dummy way to make this as cards lie.|pg||

nt|brgpro: i mean take an anti-percentage line...|pg||

nt|othered1: I don't see it.  |pg||
nt|brgpro: he can wait for an defensive error|pg||
nt|brgpro: anything can happen|pg||
nt|othered1: Wolff has a history of going right in complicated situations, but he may not know he'll need a defensive error and may try a straightforward line|pg||
nt|brgpro: say he can win in hand and play a @s to the K...if they dont return a @c...then he can draw trumps and finesse @cJ to make this|pg||
