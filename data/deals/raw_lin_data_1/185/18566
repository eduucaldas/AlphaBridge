nt|Walddk3: uncheck  invisible before you re-enter|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe we can start|pg||
nt|007 joosth: many would open 1H maybe  but I prefer 1C|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like we are almost ready, Wold Bates play Precision Club, Std approach for NS|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Detroit even*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In the other room E/W were a bit too enthusiastic about the hand|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 31  not 46??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi kit -- sorry to see you here as commentator|pg||
nt|ady: 5-0 spade split spoils a reasonable 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: hi Kit|pg||
nt|kit: I think 4@S might survive the 5-0 split -- not sure|pg||
nt|ady: yes possibly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i still think it is strange to play board 31|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that's what's at the other table too|pg||
nt|kit: didn't the play 1-30?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php or http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  this is 3rd set not 4th|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Al is thinking about the civil war I just heard   thats to much at the same time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 teams were decided last set   USA1 Seniors   Schwartz-Finkel Wolff-Morse Hamilton-Fisher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 Women  Moss-Radin Stansby-Campanile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: congrats to both teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner of our match will play 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch to determine Senior USA2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA2 Women Final has already started - it is 96 boards |pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|kit: hi|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: wrong boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait    EW play a form of Precision  NT strength varies 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  "multi" 2@D, Flannery 2@H   transfers over 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ady: thx Al|pg||
nt|ady: hand 31 looks interesting|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes sure|pg||
nt|007 joosth: S should play the diamonds before E can discard 1 of them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in 4S|pg||
nt|ady: yes    but not easy to work that out at the table|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well tr 1 haert  tr 2 spade  then you see it?|pg||
nt|friggi: nothing is easy to work out at the table:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  carding upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well the coffe sometimes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: coffee:)|pg||
nt|friggi: right, mist that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Steve Robinson used to have card that announced upside-down facial expressions  but that was before screens|pg||
nt|ady: but playing diamonds early   losing to the king and cashing 2 more before ruffing a heart high is very difficult|pg||
nt|kit: I think once declarer sees the 5-0 split he is forced to assume East has 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure but I think he can work it out|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: basically lose spade hook, win return, lose diamond hook, win club hook, and crossruff|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: Danger if defense can get East in with jack of clubs for third round of spades|pg||
nt|ady: but cash diamonds beffore ruffing a heart|pg||
mb|1N|nt|007 joosth: yes indeed that J may be the winner|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|007 joosth: precision I suppose?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6+@C 10-15 |pg||
nt|ady: would not wager on making|pg||
nt|kit: they will certainly get to 4@S now -- Robinson will show Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i hear other table began to bid,  then the auction disappeared|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H overcall may help a little|pg||
nt|007 joosth: rubensohl or lebensohl maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is showing now as 1N-2@D[one major]|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S i the destination|pg||
nt|friggi: is|pg||
nt|kit: they play transfer Lebensohl -- I forget the exact coding which shows Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice board to start with if you make 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: is this 14-16 no-trump?|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Walddk3: we can't have a broadcast with invisible operators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw last set that side 5-card major isn't a deterent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S max of 15 HCP  [ew play a form of precision]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might start with DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong again al|pg||
nt|kit: this is Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  3@D=4@S, no stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Now or we shall have to boot you|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hello  all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a side 6-card major isn't a deterent...  clubs just have to be the primary suit|pg||
nt|friggi: sameo:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kirp:  2@C would have been sort of takout, maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably right Martin   very common to use same convention after 1N overcall as over 1N opener|pg||
nt|kirp:  why not open 3@C to begin with?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less common to have a 3@C bid over 1N overcall when you couldn't open 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: D  ?  !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you type faster :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk1: Hi    e     missing in Westheimer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo, south opened|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no something else wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The boards in the Vugraph are wrong.  Bear with us a few minutes.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: (bare)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry -- have to restart|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I used to play this structure, but it has been a while so I forgot the exact coding|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: once in a while they make this  but not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ady: may  well need to play a club early|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: other room 5@CX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you think Peter had a way to offer COG  [i.e. show 4@S AND good @H stops]|pg||
nt|007 joosth: knowing 5 or 6 hearts left makes it easier to play for diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|ady: has been warned the heart position|pg||
nt|kit: I think it will go heart lead, spade hook, spade back, club up, and key will be if Bates ducks|pg||
nt|friggi: club early is auto play|pg||
nt|kit: Although East can pitch a diamond on third heart, and that will defeat contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kirp:  Dbl was probably negative|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe big swing?|pg||
nt|kit: so it looks like down 1|pg||
nt|ady: must wait  before ruffing a heart|pg||
nt|kit: defense can play 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|kit: so must play diamonds before losing lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|007 joosth: with that singl of clubs  a spade may be better but N can have the diamond ace|pg||
nt|friggi: @C 10 now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: and that is pretty double-dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|ady: very difficult contract  needs almost to play double dummy  playing a low diamond from hand early|pg||
nt|friggi: but no need to play trump, full control in all suits|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when W is in with ace of clubs will he know that E has a 3d heart?|pg||
nt|friggi: the key is @C Aces on side|pg||
nt|kit: He might not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room same contract and lead from internal sequence|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chick: hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi|pg||
pc|s6|nt|friggi: so play @C as early as possible|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will win and lead a club -- and Bates will have to do something right|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  cool...more commentators than specs:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  This will make, I think, 3@C might have been down 4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfe: I've lost the play.  Will just enter results on this board.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|kirp:  actually 3 down on best defense|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hello all   |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this is nog good|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he needs 2 high ruffs|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: hi got his diamond play early, but I think he needed to save his high spade spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: I am just pointing out all things eaq...play @C as soon as possible-basta|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: I think once playing a trump early could not make|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|andyv:  good afternoon all|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade and then club i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi Andy   wlc|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi andy|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in my opinion W had a big overbid with only 3 trumps and not much extra|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Walter, Joost and Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bruce Ferguson finding a different route to down 1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but in this tempo E will not be down  today|pg||
nt|007 joosth: would N be afraid that S does not have the ace?   maybe|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|kirp:  @Ds have to be 41|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kirp:  Q@S 4 a pitch|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|007 joosth: well this is ok  2|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: Wold didn't go up jack of clubs, but he didn't need to due to spade spot situation|pg||
nt|kit: Bates still not sure where missing heart is I don't think|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: But even if he plays ace of clubs, defense is okay|pg||

mb|p|nt|007 joosth: sort of micheals cuebid showing both majors  |pg||
nt|kirp:  EW eschew 2D as a pre-empt|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice word Martin   eschew|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  King's English|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hoped to learn some english here:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  how many spades by E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some take it a step further  after nebulous 1@D [like precision]  2@D=nat  2@H=weak michaels|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: if Bates makes neg response, will be played by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H probably inv+ @C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: in other room, bates led trump|pg||
nt|007 joosth: H seems ok 2 me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just reporting the fact  --   i'm positive i'm not sure which is better/best|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but ot here with that singl of clubs may be. |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Cindy Bernstein and Sally Wheeler sitting EW|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not|pg||
nt|baldfriede: operator, what was the result in board 1?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4 s by north down 2--cant enter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when both of opp suits known [michaels for @H & @S, unusual NT for 2 lowest]  you have 2 cue bids to show the other suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 18-19|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: certain to get to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  they play a 12-14 NT |pg||
nt|ady: south may not lead a heart|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  neither side can attack @ds, so 3 rounds of @hs may allow declarer to bring this home|pg||
nt|007 joosth: looks nice but H lead still to expect?|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd willlikely lead club, and Robinson will have to guess which red suit to return|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=21&task=list|pg||
nt|hackenbush: for players list and system summary forms|pg||
nt|kirp:  Wonder if they will go to slam, dont think it makes without help|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there are 2 ways to play    low for 4th suit or low for lowest suit    [1st better theoretically,  latter more common]|pg||
nt|kirp:  methods vary as to strength, some Qs are GF, others are invit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "can"  better read as "should"|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|friggi: @H lead is screaming|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this may not prove to be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Another value of having strong hand declare|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: oops -- that ends the defense|pg||
nt|ady: thats torn it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no double after 2H  so that lead is nor probabble?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|007 joosth: they continue doing the impossible:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, neither side SHOULD....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems after the lead  kit had a lot of options -- all bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best switch would have been a @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @d entry, it seems that declarer can just go after @ss now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like that will lead to 2@S 2@H 2@D for -1|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't understand this sequence chosed by EW so can't comment on it|pg||
nt|chick: I just checked the summary card and there is nothing there either|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing invite with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like on Bd 1, O'Rourke picked up 5 imps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: maybe a combination of stripsqueeze and endplay to makeslam|pg||
nt|kirp:  Possible if S pitches a H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would at least make another try with East's hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  No @C Q-bid by W should slow him down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: at other table a @c lead helped making 6@s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: needs moderate care to make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bidding in OR suggested a @C lead!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: but now i bet on defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks almost no matter what |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to find 3/3 clubs first|pg||
nt|friggi: ??? W @H was transfer - so the rule is lead the othe M if no other info tells you other wise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: chambers opened 2@C!!      against 4@S  Ferguson led @C but Drew Casen played the @C7|pg||
nt|ady: may be a swing for Orourke|pg||
nt|kit: but he did have info -- no double of 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: hardly likely to double 2@H with QXXX|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: i think q as game force too small of a target |pg||
nt|kirp:  This is a pick up for EW, as 4@S dbled in CR|pg||
nt|friggi: @H lead was obvious|pg||
pc|d3|nt|007 joosth: small H  I think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kirp:  Focus on S, good lead|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: I cannot agree heart lead obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i had a $ for every point lost after making an obvious lead|pg||
nt|friggi: bad def|pg||
nt|kit: well, I think club lead is obvious -- needs less in partner's hand|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d7|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|kirp:  Dont think he can make it after this start|pg||

nt|ady: there is no obvious lead |pg||
pc|c2|nt|friggi: ask Kanter:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: just kidding -- of course no lead is obvious|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|007 joosth: slow seniors today|pg||

pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke gets credit for her 4@C bid|pg||

nt|kit: I'll remember that when playing you -- will know when to stretch to a marginal game :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: excdept when it doesn't|pg||

nt|007 joosth: is this 1D  today?|pg||
nt|ady: led a club in OR last hand    north played the 7|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can go for 1-level penalty, or just get to 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: looked like 9 tricks for the taking agree specs|pg||
nt|kirp:  except had Axx in @S, opponents had 8 or likely 9 of them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3NT should be in N then pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nobody wanted to play a simple 4@h:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they might play a penalty double over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well done :)|pg||
nt|kit: And now, does Bates lead his partner's suit?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: however will not be made anyway?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joost and Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was flip a coin country|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: heart queen lead if cindy passes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i don't like his chances either|pg||
nt|007 joosth: d lead and spade switch  I will give applaus|pg||
nt|kit: on diamond lead, East will not win the trick|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  their card confirms 4 card major and longer minor|pg||

pc|d7|nt|chick: could have been though, S had 4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so does Boyd try to sneak thru a @S?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of defensive tricks in the 2 suits bid by NS|pg||
nt|kirp:  S also now has more easy non-@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or RDBL is transfer   but don't think anybody plays it as days of old  where RDBL=points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does he lead @D or @C?|pg||
nt|kirp:  pick me for points on rdble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming Bates PASS|pg||
nt|kit: 1 spade thru doesn't do the job|pg||
nt|kit: I think his best bet is to run the clubs -- if he does something else, the hand will be a readout|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: how did E signal?|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D  still not enough|pg||
nt|kit: if he doesn't lead clubs the defense will know the clubs are running and will know what they have to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Zia play a @H?|pg||
nt|kit: they play udca, so East discouraged in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: <heavy sarcasm>|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@D in case 9x|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|irwinbo: was 3 d really three clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  spade is my pick!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: come to think of it -- in context of limited 1@D -- would you make neg dbl with west hand??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: i suspect we see Cohen work diamonds next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i was going to vote for the @C4...  but i think i'll change to the @D6 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the result as we see it operator ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  not worth it|pg||
nt|kit: no need to play a heart -- could blow contract if ace is onside|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, forgot to cash heart|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays Q@D    thats 8 tricks   wont make a 9th   defence obvious|pg||
nt|friggi: low @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention of Smith for EW|pg||
nt|kit: defense can now count declarer's tricks -- so they will play for what is necessary |pg||
pc|s8|nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kozlove didn't opposite unlimited opener|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  looks like E can make this easily on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may be playing transfers where 3@D would be stayman|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kirp:  really is a poor neg dble|pg||
nt|kit: I still think running clubs is best -- West might not hold enough hearts|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the wholle problem began with a diamond overcall which i dont like|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: an interesting switch|pg||

mc|6|nt|sybarra: this is makeable from here, but unlikely at the table imo|pg||

nt|bagman: If the defense attacks diamonds, the 9th come from there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: endplayed for 9th trick|pg||
nt|007 joosth: declarer has an entry in hearts at both sides.   the long suits should be free before the opps remove the entry|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer likely to go up the @HK on the heart switch to cash the clubs and then set up the spade|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when E would play a heart now  declarer can take the trich in dummy,  cash his clubs after which a hook in spades|pg||
nt|bagman: N can discard a spade and 2 hearts on clubs and still have stopper in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|bagman: It might take some time before Kasle works out that N holds 5-4 in the majors, which is not a typical 1NT opening|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small heart is most promising for defenders.  maybe W has the ace|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 2NT maybe|pg||
nt|joest: if north-south play puppet stayman, they might land in 4@s|pg||
nt|joest: that should still fetch it looks like but its a bit harder than 3NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: guess the @d lead worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and/or @S switch    and/or   sunspot activity|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting implications for declarer|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: i wonder where other room lost 4th defensive trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: E will never be on lead. so Kx of clubs stay protected|pg||
nt|joest: treating his hand as too big for an initial 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Jacobus opened 1N|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  on board 34, 5@c was made in OR, slicing the lead to 13 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   [1st/2nd and not vul 3rd]|pg||
nt|friggi: red cross:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: was a very poor effort|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h probably shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can understand it with so many controls|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: quick attack on transportation|pg||
nt|kit: This will be a normal 2@H contract, which is probably down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing East bid 2@d instead of North|pg||
nt|sybarra: suport X |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good guess Howard:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Bit of a hand hog|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|007 joosth: J of diamonds may be the entry for club tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter  do you use coded 10/9 leads in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  a hand where almost all finesses are off|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not sure that was best choice, reasonable but @S also possible|pg||
nt|kirp:  However this looks like it should go down 2 trix at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right Kit   1@D-1@H//1@S-2@H//end|pg||
nt|friggi: kit is alws right:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: so they are playing puppet|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: suspect we missed a pass|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hackenbush: could be gazilli but nothing much on their system summary form|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=838&pid=607|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm guessing that 2@d was xfer to @hs showing a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that's more likely, if 2@c and 2@h not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Two diamonds was alerted by West but not by East.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: referring to Stewart's @S shift|pg||
nt|007 joosth: might be 1/3 lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  we use something thats referred to as foster returns|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd from garbage?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  when dummy has small cards we lead second highest unless we want partner to do some high banging|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @s suit of N does not look very inviting though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe that's a documented rule|pg||
pc|h6|nt|007 joosth: as in other room no puppet here|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bit undervalued by N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you like 2N over 2@S?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think declarer should take quick pitch here -- I would win (not with ace) and lead a heart|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kirp:  NV game so maybe not worth the push|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: actually you can't determine that by a 3@s rebid :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed:)|pg||
nt|joest: so this presents the ninth trick but the contract is always cold just by keeping east off lead, for overtricks even|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems strange  but the possible entry has gone|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be a push around the room |pg||
nt|kirp:  Just that someone needs to push, not both|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is part of why i play big club|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kirp:  I play bigger club|pg||
nt|kit: now he might try a spade -- not clear|pg||
pc|d9|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades may even make 5   she will probably make 4 hearts here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|007 joosth: not the lead at 4S  :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  True, except it does not give up anything, club lead might|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: could have doubled 3@D, 3@H was a bit much|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 9 tricks for the taking|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kirp:  why would you want S on lead, with N's hand?|pg||
nt|kirp:  @H is actually safe|pg||
nt|kirp:  dummy has only 1 entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Dx real killer|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: this hand does not merit much thought, are we still here|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think she is worried about a 4-1 heart break andbeing tapped in dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck one heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the club players who automatically false card here with @DA   that's actually a give away   by winning Q  south doesn't know who has @DK|pg||
nt|kit: very difficult for defense to find the club shift, but they will have enough time since North has doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kirp:  still 5 trix|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|chick: are we stuck or is S thinking?|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N here was pretty easy, though 3@d trix available to defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this may soon turn into NT play |pg||
nt|kirp:  so in theory, 3n can be beat|pg||
nt|kirp:  in OR, played by N, it would have been harder to beat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can defense take 3@D if they play the suit?  looks frozen to me|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|ady: heart play looks against the odds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe S will play a diamond?|pg||
nt|friggi: right but you have to be creative|pg||
nt|kit: 9 of spades shows not much in spades, but Boyd doesn't know for sure where king of diamond is -- he may think Robinson has that and Wold the club strength|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  west on lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  meanwhile, 2s is playing well, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if not quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer doesn't know if @CK doubleton or singleton    probably the former|pg||
nt|kirp:  so what, cross to 10@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i'm thinking   but i'm in a loop|pg||
nt|kirp:  cant make more than 4, 3 or 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so working on not making 1 :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 is virtually assured|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: not necissarily bad however, EW can make 4@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  this is for 4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no risk  with clubs open|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Also, 9 of spades might have been from K109|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok, make that a @h loser now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 trick swing compared to other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: dreww played this one really nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now just have to figure out who did good/bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to this point anyway|pg||
nt|kit: declarer disappointed not to make having gotten this far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you play 9 or 10 from that holding 2nd hand?|pg||
mc|7|nt|chick: no more club loser, but now a heart loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might never score @HA|pg||

nt|joest: 5@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|007 joosth: club finesse is needed  after that at least 9 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand 4@D bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he get out for 800?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||
nt|joest: 4 hearts + 4 diamonds + 1 club = 9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: to expected 1@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Schermer to bid 1st|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we know  Jacobus would open 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: weak 2 maybe|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||

nt|kirp:  opposite limited opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  he's the dealer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's not fair|pg||
nt|kit: very possible swing here, as N-S could easily get to game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: Kozlove bid the same opposite unlimited 1@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, 4@s would be almost automatic for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Flannery  4@S  5/6@H|pg||
nt|friggi: if it fails... try again|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes I already was looking why they did not make 4....|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will bid game|pg||
nt|kit: probably played ace and a heart for safety in other room|pg||
mb|4H|nt|007 joosth: thats better:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a hand that could have had some fireworks put quietly to bed with the 3@d preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: playing in a 6-1 minor instead of a 6-2 major seems like a hole in the system|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of 2 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps @D and a major |pg||
nt|kirp:  almost any system except mine, where I played Texas after 1 D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this week we've seen a plethora of 8/9 card suits  and 11/12 card fits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: texas over 1@D   very cool treatment Martin|pg||
nt|kirp:  it was a strong club system|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: dubious 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR 3N was bid quickly, here more science|pg||
pc|dK|nt|007 joosth: a rather dull board 9 tricks  maybe defenders dont take their 4 tr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D game force checkback  [a guess]|pg||
nt|kit: So this will be 10 IMPs for Kasle|pg||
nt|friggi: sur eit will|pg||
nt|friggi: good biddng|pg||
nt|friggi: bidding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: I would not preempt with S's hand, too much chance partner has spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  but they will survive this one as there is no game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised Casen didn't either bid 2@S or make Support DBL??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I think he is confident with this 2H  Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, i know  @HAJ9x  screams defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt from N? |pg||
nt|kirp:  yup|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|andyv:  so this should go down 2|pg||
nt|chick: sounds about right|pg||
nt|kirp:  Note that 6@D s depends only on finding the Q and double finesse in @Ss|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 3@S may have clarified @H weakness|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I understand you should not always pass,  but do we get a serie of kamikaze-bids from here now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok will play the 4/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: a real challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: in fact not sure it can be made|pg||
nt|kirp:  I am guessing, also no 5th @D or shape |pg||
nt|friggi: Q@H is the card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for all of the grief that the convention gets  there are times when it is very easy for responder|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kirp:  S is still trying, N will check out|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: schermer being forced to re-confirm  minimum balanced hand 3@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kirp:  Its possible that S could have only 4@S with @D fit|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure likely to fly K  |pg||
nt|kirp:  Nice safety play against 40 spli|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: she'll take 6 diamonds and the @SK, not much chance of anything else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make all the rest|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not greatest auction but well judged in the end to pass 4N|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfe: Pollack has called the director.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry that the connection keeps dropping.  It has been happening all day.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry.  Don't have that info.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: other table misdefended against 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director is here.  East exposed a card.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so possibly 5 more imps to NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, maybe not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be interesting if Bates ducks the 10|pg||
nt|kirp:  dont know how they made only 3 in CR|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kit: right to start with low heart -- if East has stiff king, may need to conserve spots|pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: so now down 2 for sure and maybe 3  |pg||

nt|friggi: correto kit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kirp:  Best by W|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|joest: Rosenberg with a disciplined pass but at matchpoints I can assure you some folks would enter with a lead directing 2@s|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C majors   same as if  1N opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it was down one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice 2C if it is majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand  IF in slam, can you make|pg||
nt|kit: note light opener in Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: well I guess at IMPS too!|pg||
nt|joest: at favorable I guess anything goes|pg||
nt|joest: but Milt is usually pretty disciplined|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without peeking at all 52 cards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  6@c or 6N will be disappointing with the 4-1 @c break|pg||
nt|andyv:  the OR managed to stay out of trouble|pg||
nt|joest: this catches Cohen with a big hand though|pg||
nt|joest: here come the police|pg||
nt|joest: Bates has to double what is under his nose it seems to me|pg||
nt|joest: of course his partner is 3rd seat but still..|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only 7 tricks i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: very light opener  that R|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and there they are|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but a diamond lead is not nice|pg||
nt|joest: no way does Rosenberg sit this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: n0--sorry--|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 2@S probably 4-card support|pg||
nt|friggi: must be|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I dont think  such a bid has to be strong.  so 3S seems some rough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen liked his pure holdings in majors  -- and i'm sure not a high card invite -- that would be 2N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice double fit,  but a doubtful K|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew basing it on the dbl major suit fit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade lead gives it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  and seems impossible to keep N from gaining lead if you don't lead a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat  and  3rd vul  1N=15-17|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have pinched it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: it does seem that they should have considered a slam at least|pg||
nt|joest: ok so I have misguessed Rosenberg at every opportunity|pg||
nt|joest: Mark used to be a pretty harsh partner.  I played with him.|pg||
nt|joest: I would NOT have wanted to table this dummy in 3NT doubled!!! :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Hard to find @C lead now|pg||
nt|007 joosth: with small doubleton H   i can imagine a reasonable 3card spades|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson can definitely consider balancing with xx in spades -- passing risks losing a double-part-score swing|pg||
nt|ady: now see if they can make it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: right now, pollack is praying for a bad club split :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  as they did here...1N is 8-13 and game forcing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a heart lead seems obvious   the Q or K   according to what agreement you have|pg||
nt|007 joosth: asking unblocking a J|pg||
nt|joest: although that will cost her|pg||
nt|joest: here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure about 3@H  and that also applies to 4N and 5@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Have no idea what 4N was, key-card?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S might fit  keycard  or    5@S 6@D  [but didn't 4@S show that?]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H weak jump shift -- just weird for that hand to ask KeyCards|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice bid by N if thats the case|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's a twist  4@S=keycard for @H|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like headed down 1|pg||
nt|friggi: yes but what if they dont ?|pg||
nt|friggi: still suitable |pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe he can do something nice with the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 4th club with east will come into play|pg||
nt|kit: defense may have to get diamonds going in time|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kirp:  5@D is also a nice contratc|pg||
nt|kirp:  thats also possible!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 8-11 opposite passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus opened north hand 1@C  so O'Rourke had no trouble leading @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lasts random guess  4N pick-a-game|pg||
nt|ady: needs 10@D switch early|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hackenbush: *as|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade ace lead was a good bet with no raise by partner|pg||
nt|hackenbush: new leader after this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes, goes down every 4-5 minutes.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: should get diamonds right after West shows up with lots of black cards|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well Jack,  maybe he just wanted to visit the toilet?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no unbloch here  thats strange|pg||
nt|joest: Bates proceeding on the assumption that, having not seen the jack from partner, Cohen must have it|pg||
nt|joest: at least I'm guessing so|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 more mistake and its only -100|pg||
nt|joest: but it doesn't matter much what he does since Cohen has only six tricks that I can count|pg||
nt|kirp:  May find @C lead after this auction|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: one thing is sure --- this auction hasn't come up before|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  true, ty:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|joest: assuming that Wold switches to the @Dj when he gets in|pg||
nt|kirp:  Rise with @C K to block the suit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: hi howard|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hackenbush: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and South will win @D with no @C to continue|pg||
pc|sA|nt|friggi: that is the kay in def|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|friggi: @D 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is yet another hand where backward finesse works -- but won't be taken at the table|pg||
nt|kit: declarer doesn't really gain by going after hearts, but it deflects the defenders from what they need to do|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|kirp:  i dislike too many blackwood versions|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i dislike not knowing   What's Trump?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  time to claim|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you need to allow one ruff, well done|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|007 joosth: first they should discard 5 times|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will play continue @S to King @D to 8?|pg||
nt|friggi: Al is right ...sadly:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  does he think South is danger hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  in the olde days, i played 4N as the only Black and alwys Black|pg||
nt|ady: south may have been a too passive|pg||
nt|kit: And it worked -- now declarer will get 4 spades, 3 clubs, and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Diamond shift far from obvious from Boyd's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  went down in OR   so Wold needed to make this|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: she can set up a spade trick before clearing clubs|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I think NS should have a little talk about intervening and bidding after that|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like it|pg||
nt|kit: Good club play by Robinson -- gives declarer a losing option of 9 of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which was tough for Wold as dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: it is makeble|pg||
mc|8|nt|joest: queen of spades is very thoughtful, showing Qj|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we used to call that  Lublin's Law|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C min, not 6@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|joest: partnerships differ about whether 2NT is Lebensohl after a 2@d opener|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT gets the nature of the hand across well|pg||
nt|007 joosth: In the Netherlands almost everybody plays multi,  so I don't know|pg||
nt|joest: Bates may be asking himself: "do we play Lebensohl here"?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hope he asked it before|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is possible that they do and that Wold follows up with 3@h over a forced 3@c rebid showing four hearts in a NT hand and offering a choice of games|pg||
nt|joest: his hand is pretty straightforward so the longer he thinks the more my money is on the issue of "what do we play here?" :)|pg||
nt|kit: but it does make -- 4 hearts, 1 club, 4 diamonds, 3 spades|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and can't blame him with 222 in other suit    YUK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he is vuln   and has just seen the result of doing it with 5 :)|pg||

nt|joest: sanity returns|pg||

nt|ahollan1: alway FG   either nat or bal|pg||

nt|007 joosth: Woolsey was not desparate at this moment with a double:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: I agree.  Almost no such thing as hand with little interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decided NOT to splinter -- that can be dangerous|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force  2@H=6+|pg||
nt|ady: kib pointed out 4@S might go down on a heart lead   and club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a @s lead may make this 3NT contract very awkward|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this will promise a stopper  so 3NT comes closer   again an ugly game|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see a lot of of hts will make for e/w |pg||
nt|kirp:  OK who can find a @H lead after that auction|pg||
nt|kit: Wold will bid 3@S, of course, and then we will see what Bates does|pg||
nt|friggi: lack of Aces should trigger 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: well it might make|pg||
nt|joest: both north-souths have hit a rough patch these last two boards|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  but N won't find that|pg||

mb|p|nt|007 joosth: although....2Nt is crazy in my opinion|pg||
nt|joest: AKQ may all go on trick 1!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: believe it or not    4@D did not say anything about serious/non-serious slam interest -- just a cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quick claim???|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N was still a possible contract|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i think my grandma can make this|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: lead right for defence to have a chance|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, on heart lead and club shift, could easily go down -- and that is the logical defense|pg||
nt|friggi: after 3@S slam was not the case|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: a kib suggested ducking the 10 of hearts!|pg||
nt|ady: played the other way up in OR   diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe too obvious, but worth thinking about|pg||
nt|friggi: good point|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: Here it comes -- but which club will Boyd shift to?|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer ducks 10@H  cannot south still play the ace and switch to a club?|pg||
nt|friggi: still 11|pg||
nt|kit: And will Bates believe it?|pg||
nt|friggi: no|pg||
nt|puncher99: lo  club lead best|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but defender doesn't know that third heart trick might be needed|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: but south may well smell a reat if declarer ducked the 10@H|pg||
nt|friggi: def has to be creative Kit|pg||

nt|007 joosth: though thefence will not win prizes  this must be a big swing for NS|pg||

nt|joest: 33 highs and they don't get past 3NT|pg||

nt|007 joosth: I would expect some more discipline at this age|pg||

nt|ahollan1: probably|pg||
nt|kirp:  Many would|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  pretty lucky to make 4@s on this hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: time to play in the worse trump suit?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, in round 1|pg||
nt|kit: So that boring hand wasn't so boring after all -- many interesting features, both in bidding and play|pg||
nt|friggi: p|pg||
mb|1D|nt|007 joosth: 6Nt looks great  but very unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: like to hear 2 @S, constructive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 2@C opener = 6+@C|pg||
nt|kirp:  that seems to be the Precision fashion these days, 2@C maust have 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike original Precision and current Polish Club players who can have 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 2 loosing finesses,  spades 42  and no squeeze|pg||
nt|007 joosth: with open cards even 4S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Asian Zone & New Zealand Precision players still include 5@C 4M|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  the other room got the @C ruff|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd better pass -- if he bids, they will get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes you might survive in hearts|pg||
nt|hackenbush: open room led trump vs 4@s|pg||
nt|kirp:  Puts too much pressure on 1@D opening, in my opinion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but makes 2@C opener a much more powerful tool|pg||
mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: maybe with open cards an endply?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  he may be getting ready to bid 3 sp,  3 card limit raise |pg||
nt|friggi: he took you advice|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will bid 1NT, and Wold might or might not bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  thats exciting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice BAM result|pg||
nt|friggi: forcig now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kirp:  made only 4|pg||
nt|friggi: negative|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this will still be an excellent result for Sprung|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 4NT looks pretty automatic|pg||
nt|kit: very lucky 3NT make in other room -- 3-3 in both red suits and king of diamonds onside -- all needed to get 3 diamonds, 4 hearts, 2 spades|pg||
nt|ady: how can they get too high if Boyd responds   3NT unbeatable   and bid in OR|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT by Boyd takeout|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hackenbush: yes when partner showed values|pg||
nt|sybarra: chose to be conservative |pg||
nt|sybarra: on the lay out that works |pg||
nt|kirp:  Wrong sided this one|pg||

nt|friggi: poker bid|pg||
nt|ady: I agree lucky|pg||
nt|kit: well, too high in theory :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this was beatable on an unlikely @c or @dA lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Declared gets the lead she needed to make this|pg||
nt|hackenbush: bye for now, hope the internet connection gets better!|pg||
nt|andyv:  a club lead would have set this|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye Howard|pg||
nt|007 joosth: even that I dont believe|pg||
nt|kirp:  Thoughtful lead, hoped to find 5-card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: down 5?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this may have been a mixup here -- not sure|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: 1@c was precision|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3S seems right    even with the good clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: comes from spending time with Kit Woolsey  --  essentially  if you can't lead your 5 card suit -- try to find partner's|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Robinson would have chosen 3@C on xx if 2NT offered a choice.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: 1@h was probably artificial|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only an agressive diamond lead will bring the slam?|pg||
nt|joest: when I firrst started bridge the auction would have gone 2NT-6NT|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 23 was also then to much for 2NT?|pg||
nt|joest: 22-24|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: old old days|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|007 joosth: at least you made it|pg||
nt|kirp:  intersting theory, always attack with 5-card suit|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR, the splinter sort of gave it away|pg||
nt|friggi: 2NT was out of touch|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: However, it does look like 3@C will power home-- still a 7 IMP loss|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: the slow boat but they got there|pg||
nt|joest: one of the black tens|pg||
nt|007 joosth: club is best i think|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: not if dummy has AJ8x and declarer has Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: spade is safer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not when you change the 7 and 8?|pg||
nt|joest: i guess a straightforward line is jump, hook the heart, test the spades and fall back on the diamond hook|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3C with Jxxxx  and now 2S on this very strong hand     how can partner guess it all the time?|pg||
nt|friggi: regardless Kit|pg||

nt|friggi: after this action?|pg||
nt|friggi: still @Dðs|pg||
nt|friggi: no way|pg||
nt|friggi: as you call it in USA - a blind shoot|pg||
nt|ady: did 1@D opening promise this sort of strengh?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|kirp:  Looks like 10 trix for declarer, unless we now strip and endplay N|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 1S is ok i think.   no need to prempt here when you have both majors|pg||
pc|c8|nt|007 joosth: show up squeeze i think for -1|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|nt|kirp:  Neither N or S knew E had 5@Cs|pg||
nt|ady: how can 2NT be a good bid  there is a good lay out to make a 3 level contract  and 18 hcp opposite  which he did not know?|pg||
nt|kit: he does know about the 18 HCP from the way the bidding went -- and if he can't make something, opponents can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: It is almost always wrong to sell out at 2-level with shortness in their suit|pg||
nt|ady: yes   1NT from north more like it   then Boyd can compet   I think as it went  a risky enterprise|pg||
nt|kit: particularly with none vul, when down 1 is only 50|pg||
nt|kit: passing 2@S riskier than bidding 2NT IMO|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: That is betting that 2@S and 3 of a minor are both down -- I don't like that bet|pg||
nt|ady: any chance of a stakc for a penalty of 300 or 500 when partner is weaker and cards not so well placed?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: yes. Bates will know he is down seconds before the hand is over|pg||
nt|kit: do you really think opponents will be able to double on this auction?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|007 joosth: then the match is very close again|pg||

nt|007 joosth: after this board EW should have the lead again|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d is not the world's best contract but it seems like it deserved a better fate than 1100 minus|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes  sorry    its the other team|pg||
nt|kirp:  its 14-10 after 10 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but movie says 7|pg||
nt|kit: Effective 4@S save in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 800 would have been standard?|pg||
nt|joest: well in top tricks you have 5 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts so I would hope to limit it to 500|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk1: Hopefully to a stable connection|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jon Wittes|pg||
nt|joest: Bates bidding 4@s where Woolsey settled for 3 next door|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed but thats after you know how well the hearts behave|pg||
nt|joest: rosenberg will bid 5@d as well I would imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i cant imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3 sure tricks in defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: interesting bidding in other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  a real 18 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 1N|pg||
nt|ady: nice save in OR    4@SX     e/w can make 11 tricks   may have been difficult to gauge|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- 270 -- still 7 IMPs|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably for the majors|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  " sure"  :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute EW ended up in @S after South opened 1@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jwit: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  i give up|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW need to stay low with this misfit...probably 2@s|pg||
nt|kirp:  hard to figure|pg||
nt|baldfriede: would not be my choice, especially with that @s suit E has|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if really 2@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what year is this?|pg||
nt|kit: I'm stunned that Robinson didn't open multi|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kirp:  2@C a range/major ask|pg||
nt|kit: first seat, favorable -- what more can he want?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i said that about you earlier in the weak Kit  when 1st seat  favorable  you passed with  @SKQJ9x  @HTxxx (22)|pg||
nt|ady: do they play the multi as 5 major  and a minor?|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd trying to figure out what sort of a hand Robinson could have and not open multi|pg||
nt|kit: no -- a weak 2|pg||
nt|kit: doesn't show a minor|pg||
nt|ady: usually 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|kit: but who cares about minors when you have spades?|pg||
nt|kit: at this vul, 5 more often than 6|pg||
nt|ady: but usually a 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use opening 2@S as more constructive than 2@D|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S is 10-13 6-card suit|pg||
nt|kit: full opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: and 2@D?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jwit: 4S likely contract here|pg||
nt|joest: Well now we'll see if Cohen can hold down the carnage a bit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: playing with a Cohen  I would expect some more law|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished|pg||
nt|kit: Not exactly sure what 2NTis|pg||
nt|kit: But great decision by Boyd|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: after a club switch, Cohen has major problems getting back to his hand (if he really wants to try for a spade ruff)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I would expect 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may not even bid his @hs and settle for 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well they will be higher i'm afraid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: KnR says South worth 18.95|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: Should be no problem for declarer|pg||
nt|irwinbo: cards sit nicely|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the roof comes down if he tries to play on clubs|pg||
nt|kit: and even greater by Bates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about 2N   :(    you stole my bid AND i have max?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: a messy auction :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Levin in deep thought.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wd|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have guessed well to go to 5 level|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  and a good spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe he can discard a spade on a heart|pg||
nt|joest: double dummy he could make it now|pg||
nt|joest: flies ace plays one round of diamonds then works clubs|pg||
nt|joest: spade ruff, etc.|pg||
nt|kit: It normally would not be right to go to 5-level with each having xx in spades, but it sure was this time.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women's USA2 Final  set 1 of 6   thru 12 boards  dead even|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: perhaps, but I think can make game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentator from other room confirmed  they really played 2@S|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should go down on spade ruff|pg||
nt|kirp:  Cant tell what range of NTs they are playing, a bit surprised by 2N after opening 1n|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using the stayman sequence to show 5@S invite frees up 1N-2@H//2@S-2N for artificial sequences|pg||
nt|kit: Note in other room -- North opened 2@S, East bid 3@H, and South psyched a 4@C call -- hard for opponents to get to 5@H after that|pg||
pc|s2|nt|007 joosth: why that silly 9?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok it just dont hurt|pg||
nt|007 joosth: just 1 trick maybe  haha.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: now the 5 is a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surprised by 1N    SHOCKED by 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roman Club players    1N=18-20|pg||
nt|kirp:  15+->18- on their card|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kirp:  any roaman club players left in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "multi" may not have had as large an impact|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but you never know unless you try|pg||
pc|h2|mc|11|nt|andyv:  for those who just arrived, the score shown is not accurate...no result for board 37 and board 36 has been misscored.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Players taking a break.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 37 may have been a push as both sides made 4@s (but didn't bid the game)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sounds right Andy|pg||
nt|ady: bu North went to 4@S eith the same 5 card suit after the 4@C  so there must have been some understanding  last hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chick: oh I agree, bidding the game was a long shot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps  only 34 boards left to play|pg||
nt|kit: Two nice results by O'Rourke, and match suddenly tight|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  E had to not cover the 9@C on last hand lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: easier to bid south hand if the @S quacks located elsewhere|pg||
nt|kirp:  forget that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S has a problem trying to describe her hand|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d-2@c is a difficult auction in Standard that requires a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C either 4-card limit raise  or   Game force    shame usbf can't require convention card submission :(|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  2N probably xfer to @d|pg||
nt|chick: 2N probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i do short hand better:)|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|joest: does a 2@d rebid show five?  Does 2 of a major show extras? etc.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes indeed I can recommend the Lawrnce book 2/1 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with the length  the @S honors wasted here  [term is trump poor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was Game Force @S raise  [jacoby]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think this 2@C has 4@H/@S only if 6+@C|pg||
nt|joest: yes he has a well thought out method in his book|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: routine 4@s here, Westheimer's opening will have to come on one of the last 4 boards|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  2@D=5+|pg||
nt|joest: and then either 3@h followed by 3Nt or just 3NT directly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so   now we have to guess   was 3@H weaker or better than PASS|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|jwit: EW slightly stole this one, though they will have to do some scrambling to make this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some play 2D as balanced   11/12  maybe only 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  this is like rubber bridge|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: DBL was lead-direct|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E might play for a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: only in 2 |pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: I was going to say she would need a safety play in diamonds, but doesn't look like she'll get the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: makeable |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jwit: Lead actually helps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then 2NT can be 13/14  gf  or  18/19|pg||
nt|kit: Need to cover jack of hearts to block suit|pg||
nt|kit: Now fourth round of hearts can potentially promote a trump trick|pg||
nt|ady: what difference   got 2 hearts and a ruff and A@D  |pg||
nt|kit: on 4th round of hearts, what does East ruff with?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 2@D didn't deny 4@H/@S  but 3@D did|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @h suit will provide one pitch so S should immediately play it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah  at rubber you'd rebid 2N instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Diams are friendly layout|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like only 9 trix|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C look tempting as possible source too|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: but Bates-Wold play precision so |pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead maybe  but N did not double 3H|pg||
nt|ady: well not the king or queen|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: fine lead here|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs lead second highest from four small and so, apparently, does this north-south pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  if someone holds honor doubleton|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  now can get to board with K@c to pitch other @c on @h|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kirp:  we need a probability chart of rthat vs @D play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer also factoring in @S33|pg||
nt|kit: has to be 9 to make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jwit: Trumps and spades both behave and 9 of clubs is a big card, so they should probably make this|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where are Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley when we really need them?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: needs a little care now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: @D hook now |pg||
pc|c4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3NT maybe down i think|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd had right idea, but wrong execution|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: if @D shift  does he duck or fly?   i think choice is just whether to lose a @D or lose a @H|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has no choice but to ruff with 9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|007 joosth: esp now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: wonder if N considered the possibility of a club ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: both kings onside for woolsey  --  not expected on this auction|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 1S opening and 1NT in E maybe?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bagman: 1NT or pass?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bagman: bad hand, some fit, nonvulnerable; generally right to bid, though|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if W is strong with hearts  E has big hand, so I like 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pass can't be right when opponents are vul!|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bagman: Yes, and if you get 3@D in response, you just hope for the best|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: N tells his strong hand with spades I suppose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this ahnd is agreat example of that very fact|pg||

nt|bagman: E tempted to bid but does not want to see the opps bid to game|pg||

pc|c6|nt|007 joosth: maybe N i think|pg||
nt|bagman: probably, but they are in 3@D now and declarer is likely to make 11 tricks|pg||

nt|kirp:  More excitement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of Jacobus 2@C opening?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not a fan of 2@C on this hand, hard to describe later|pg||
nt|baldfriede: meaning "this will probably be another push board" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're more diplomatic than me :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm a big clubber so very biased|pg||
nt|kirp:  2c-2d-2s-3c=bad hand,  now what|pg||
nt|baldfriede: pass and pray|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree  flexible hands starting 2@C yield very complicated auctions|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|jwit: This might be interesting!|pg||

nt|007 joosth: i like that 2S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously Woolsey did NOT preempt with West   his only option was 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 Final  thru 71 of 90    Schwarts leads Lynch by 35|pg||
nt|kirp:  here we go also|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it is a wasted bid; the one who needs information is the opener|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 4@S down 1, probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: curiously?|pg||
nt|kit: Here is their 2@S opening -- and maybe it will help them stay out of game|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a bit high   need good lay of  heart ace and king of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=a) 8-11 HCP, 7@S  b) 9-12 HCP, 6@S & 4 other  c) 10-13 HCP,  6@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest: i could think of several reasons why one might not preempt :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  better to play 1 level as forcing 1 rd|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  stop here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: never|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Women's USA1 Final  thru 74 of 96   Moss leads Sprung by 23|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what North has available|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  invite will get W to 3 and down quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Womens USA2 SemiFinal  3 to play  ALL TIED|pg||
nt|kit: But he made an unsuccessful game try, assuming no imaginative king of clubs lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but it is in Kit's character to do so I would say|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure  but its nice when p knows what to lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  hehe|pg||
nt|kirp:  33 is 35.5% i am informed. dblton with 2 honours out of 6 cards, is 3 possibilities out of 64. Looks like around 40%.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women USA1 Final  5 remaining   Moss over Sprung by 29|pg||
nt|ady: north flatish with some jacks that might be useless|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  a Roland slam|pg||
nt|chick: much too good for Roland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's how Fantoni-Nunes play their 1-suit openings|pg||
nt|baldfriede: a shot in the dark which does not hit the target but winds up in the blue|pg||
nt|kirp:  Is W thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should have 11 or 12 @Hs, not 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wold needed to DBL to prevent Bates from thinking|pg||
nt|kirp:  Dbl might have encouraged Bates to bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but [rightly] feared they have a better spot|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hackenbush: too many losers to bid game, even vul, assuming 3@h is not a limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i recall Drew claiming his regular partner Jim Krekorian convinced him that 2 aces opposite strong NT = GAME|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: even if clubs behave Rosenberg has only eight tricks|pg||
nt|joest: he will needed to work diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: and will need to assume East has the ace, else he's just down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: true  but the disadvantage of the 2S is that maybe N will guess the clubs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: quickly with a diamond lead .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  ordinarily 8 hcp enough in this type of auction...but hcp are in Aces and E is berift of spot cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Senior USA1   5 to play  Schwartz +52 over Lynch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Lynch will get night off then play 60 board match vs winner here  to determine USA2|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  might be right:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson could have relayed with 2N to learn 6(322) and not 2 of top 3 honors  min/max|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Wold is 6-5 and might well have bid -- he was right passing, but could have been wrong.|pg||
nt|ady: can Boyd be any better for 2@S?|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- how about a singleton?|pg||
nt|ady: but not much better than 12 hcp?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hcp max  just one more jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-13 with 6@S and no side 4|pg||
nt|ady: and shows 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|kit: you can count HCP all you want, but it is distribution that makes the games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less hcp with more shape|pg||
nt|ady: with 6 card suit and outside singleton say 6-3-3-1   would not consider open 1 spade with 12 or 13?|pg||
nt|kit: Wold not sure what to play for here|pg||
nt|kit: His partner might have a stiff heart, but might be ruffing with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|kit: And this may be last time to put club through|pg||
nt|kit: so I think he will shift to a club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jwit: 10 of hearts lead will help declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse hesitations --  the slow 5@H shows confidence|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: a likely challenge|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  E may simply play @ss back to K and Q and lose an imp here|pg||
nt|joest: once spades are abandoned for sure the ace of diamonds resides in east|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if N guesses the clubs i think there may be an endplay at E|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce happy they aren't vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: may duck this lead in both hands|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: courtesy raise of 3@C from Wold [instead of original pass] would have been interesting|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: Bates better not duck this!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: I dont see a way to make 9 tricks on this layout |pg||
nt|kit: And he might -- his partner could have stiff queen|pg||
pc|s3|nt|007 joosth: the fast way:)|pg||
nt|joest: enough of that suit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: now an endplay with clubs:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: happier that 2N wasn't making|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope|pg||
nt|007 joosth: reat will be automatic?|pg||

nt|joest: nor spades for that matter|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: maybe needed to pound pards suit |pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: at least not yet|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but looks like Woolsey can be endplayed |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|007 joosth: well AQ  diamonds are known|pg||
nt|007 joosth: endplay with a diamond?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  lots of work for  down 2 :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s8|nt|007 joosth: should be automatic indeed|pg||
nt|joest: i think a slight inference that bates has 4 hearts b/c not likely to switch to a low one from xxx|pg||
nt|joest: not cast iron|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will take 1 shot at ruffing out queen of hearts, and will then take club finesse.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this is ok  and safer|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 down, this was a big swing , not sure how much 4@S would have gone down, but not a lot|pg||
nt|kirp:  but a lot|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: pre-alert   i'm eventually going to take a losing @C finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c2|nt|joest: your endplay is waiting in the wings|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|joest: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul should damper NS's hopes here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: finally a slam?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfe: Short break.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: responsive dbl first??|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like they missed slam in OR on this also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen-Ferguson have been posting some pretty good sets for a new partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: Cohen has no good bid    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16    you just need to count using new math|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why i mentioned that   they were on defense this hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jwit: This contract doesn't rate to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stewart opened 1N=10-12 and described exact shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: have seen this hand make 4 hts but e/w were only in 2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Leading club to king is tiny bit better since doesn't lose to stiff queen -- to play North for queen, must run jack first round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N might be start of short suit game try|pg||
nt|kit: Bates taking a scientific approach -- I would expect him to just bid game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  N has too much defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 10's|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: sure almost a double|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1 quickly|pg||
nt|ady: lead obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not|pg||
nt|ady: as said all boils down to club guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Cant see them missing slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  those who think down 2 are optomists or pessimists|pg||
nt|kirp:  E knows Kx in @Cs is great|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my favorite online toy  Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator  says East worth 13.65   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
pc|hK|nt|007 joosth: diff lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade i guess|pg||
pc|h8|nt|007 joosth: S will reason that N is broke|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok almost:)|pg||
nt|joest: i like that reasoning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit  haven't seen 3rd seat opener with 4 AND extra values|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: can't on drugs be an option?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he also knows too many points in reds|pg||
nt|kit: North doesn't figure to have a small singleton club, as with that he might shift to a club|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  always is, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been easier for East if Bates could complete his shape|pg||
nt|ady: will be almost impossible to get decent count|pg||
nt|kit: So on that basis, I think declarer should get it wrong|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: i had a feeling the the ten was coming|pg||
nt|baldfriede: undo|pg||
nt|kirp:  E is now trying to backtrack on his 14-16hcp|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: final set supposed to start in about 10 minutes    color me skeptical|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: nice lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|007 joosth: spade again|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: auction seemed to scream    lead trump THEN look at your hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kirp:  whatever the auction, 6@S looks solid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|007 joosth: trying not to be endplayed|pg||
nt|kit: Also North has 2 spades, South 3 -- another argument for playing North for longer clubs, hence queen.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jwit: This should fail by 2 or 3 tricks, but NS can probably make a part score, so no disaster|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce should try the @h finesse even though his sure it won't work|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems dropping K of H is last chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well credit Wold for upgrading his hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  which means O'Rourke is now in the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry missed a pass--contract is 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Kathy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: robbins didn't bid|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kirp:  actual score is 27-21|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wold wasn't listening as hard|pg||
nt|ady: hardly conclusive|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: with 1 to play in the set  Kasle 100  Milner 69   winner of that match plays winner of this match tomorrow in USA2 "Semi-Final"|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: holding @DQ  the shift seems surprising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course  he too may expect Chambers to hold 5@H|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead in other room was killer|pg||
nt|joest: not a comfortable pitch here for cohen|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jwit: Of course, diamonds would have been a better contract for EW, or even spades.|pg||
nt|kit: not conclusive, but makes it more likely North has queen of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one hint   Robinson had 2@S but did not make takeout dbl     [i'm really reaching]|pg||
nt|kit: Really little else to go on -- possession of queen of clubs wouldn't be enough to give either North or South a callon this auction|pg||
pc|sA|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: @D10 probably makes it tougher for declarer|pg||
nt|joest: Wold playing this great so far|pg||
nt|007 joosth: for the moment S problem is over|pg||
nt|007 joosth: should play 7|pg||
nt|joest: on the heart lead was it down one trivially?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: otherwise he is down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe N should have played the T  easy from here|pg||
nt|joest: if he holds off the queen, cohen will have to give him a red trick |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: i don't think anything was trivial about the play at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: cos winning the heart queen and shooting a club up is a strong start for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @CQ was allowed to win|pg||
nt|joest: at teh risk of repetition: Eddie has played this well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when Stewart then attacked @D it was all over|pg||
nt|joest: ic|pg||
nt|joest: and clubs were abandoned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Jack says  Wold playing this well -- honestly this is 2nd time i've seen all 4 hands and still don't now how to declare it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Wold did well indeed,  but I think N missed a chance by not playing the T of diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Joost  then @Dx from Cohen and Wold is on a guess|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh -- he is getting itwrong|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx to our operator |pg||

nt|ahollan1: and probably the same opening lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: to see it yourself move your mouse over the open room result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: EW will get to 4H here. Will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our thanks to Jan Martel who organizes everything, and thx to USBF for bringing this to bbo |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the afternoon     restart of USA2 SemiFinal in about 2 hours 20 minutes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  EW may be able to find a cheap save in @hs |pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably 4-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, not 5+@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: Women's USA2 Final [96 boards] will start then too|pg||
nt|kit: Wold hoping opponents stay in notrump, but he will be disappointed|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 4@S easy, an overtrick on the expected heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|joest: my prediction wasn't so hot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some science in play here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always feels wrong bidding AFTER opp have exchanged info|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  N might have done better to bid 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  will someone explain this sequence|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson likely will compete to 3@S, which appears to make on favorable heart suit despite 4-1 trump split|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: a light opener. maybe getting to high now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could come home, but not enough imps |pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: South did well not to double. Knowledge of bad trump break might have given declarer a fighting chance.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good lead for defense|pg||
nt|joest: i can't leave AKxx of hearts unbid.  If they double me, I apologize I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack if it makes you feel any better   i made same prediction 40 minutes ago|pg||
nt|007 joosth: haha|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW open lighter than most|pg||
nt|kirp:  so W is catering to light OB|pg||
nt|ady: club start  amd diamond return should beat 3@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  S can afford to lose 2@s and a @c|pg||
nt|chick: will lose only one of each on this lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here is there opportunity|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential pickup for Westheimer here, open room stopping in 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: I agree -- I think Wold should get right out there with 3@C-- and if he had, he might have stolen the pot|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: very bad hand for 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|007 joosth: glad I did not say a word:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N goes down on @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're pretty normal for context of big club system|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: the USA2 Senior matches are 60 boards   USA1 Senior Final is 90    Women are playing 96 board matches now  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 bracket = undefeated teams   USA2 = 1 loss  [so lose again, go home]|pg||
nt|pef: sorry Joanne Sprung|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 17-19|pg||
nt|friggi: sry router problem|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us....final set of this segment to start in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what a lead...|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a chance now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW haven't played much together  otherwise Ferguson might have just tried 2N|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little too deep for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe thinking Casen could bid this way with 1435 and singleton @SQ/J ??|pg||
nt|andyv:  still a pretty deep position to take.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a lead that isn't??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D fairly passive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is this an auction that calls for passive lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew still stunned by the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem is augmented by the holding of 10x with the K, blowing the whole suit apart for the defense if you are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit   i wouldn't have counted either of the last 2 hands the way Wold did|pg||
nt|kirp:  that may still beat it|pg||
nt|kirp:  but its now closer than you might think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N would have been interesting|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: Cohen with a surpised winner |pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: in any event it is going to prove to be an expensive pass resulting in a double game swing|pg||
nt|kirp:  Made only 3S in other room, so not clear cut. Looks like N is vulnerable to endplays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Schermer's hand too good to beat 3N|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  and you can be sure that lead will not be duplicated at other table|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer needs to unblock the @s, but aFTER THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES TO DUMMY|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming @S worth 5 tricks -- what's best try for  9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe immediate guess of @C10?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Think he'll play for something good to happen in @Ds and@Ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D7 could have been from 87x|pg||
nt|kirp:  N coul have lead from 3 or 4 small @Ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right  or 87xx|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chick: no, wrong|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries and W known to be long in 2 other suits, lead the 10 and run it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|007 joosth: the biggest swing of the session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but IF [keyword] you expect a better hand in West   what does partner hold  and which lead works for that holding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: there goes that option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15 boards remain in this match to see who plays 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: Once again this hand shows the value of the strong hand being declarer -- defense doesn't know where the high cards are|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hackenbush: can't really go wrong here, clubs 5-2 and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: O'Rourke will finish with 13 more and take the lead at the half|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  almost:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: probably not same auction either|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|007 joosth: as I said N might be advised to read the book of the other Cohen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: why a heart to the Q    KJxx might be in N to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 44  Bates did double 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did he need to either  hook @C  or  reverse dummy|pg||
nt|kit: If Wold knew the hand he could have attacked diamonds in time|pg||
nt|kit: no way declarer did that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  gtg...bye all!|pg||
nt|kit: or is there?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: but i admit unable to ignore seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my plan was for Wold to think longer at trick 1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|007 joosth: 1 tr back again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke team has playes extremely well this set|pg||
nt|007 joosth: harte now would be fine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: heart|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|joest: ok thanks Al|pg||
nt|joest: bye all|pg||
nt|007 joosth: bye|pg||
nt|kirp:  Good guess, but no matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it ruled out down 3 :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer deep in thought.  Head on table.|pg||
nt|jwit: Looks like declarer still has to come up a trick short here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: again thx and we will see you all tomorrow|pg||
nt|kirp:  N knows W's shape by now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c7|nt|kirp:  if EW go  down on this, then we are even going into last two sessions|pg||
nt|chorush: that seems surprising; seem like he had a sure beat by rising and giving ruff on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think he can make from here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if play another trump  lose 2@H @D & @S   if play @H  Chambers @SJ promotes 2nd trump|pg||
mc|8|nt|007 joosth: well  just made after the 2d present|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of different auction    Rosenberg didn't open East hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can imagine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's Milt Rosenberg     Michael isn't old enough  |pg||
nt|ady: last hand of session|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson needed 2 discards, so thought heart finesse right -- he didn't know spades 4-1.  But I still don't see the play.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Women's USA2 Final   after 1 of 6 sets  Sprung leads Joel by 7|pg||
nt|friggi: thx all for the odd comments, but they have to be there - o r what?|pg||
