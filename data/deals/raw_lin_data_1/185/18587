nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk3: Jan Martel operating|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: Hi again|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Barnet and CK commentating|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|barnets: Lynch field yet another partnership line up|pg||
nt|Walddk3: also welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|barnets: kasle has 2 very solid longterm partnerships in their team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, as I was entering the names, I laughed about that - and that Schermer and Chamberes have been steadily together forever|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|barnets: Lynch team are fielding multiple partnerships|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer asks about leads and signals.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Chambers looking for a magic fit with the 4@D splinter -- could be, but a bit optimistic|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: looks lik leading a club back is safest play for contract|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: well 6 was there kit|pg||
nt|barnets: just take a finesse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: if he were in 6, he would not have made it -- would have played North for king of spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|kit: Now will go up ace of spades, cash club, lead diamond, and take what there is|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Must go up king for overtrick -- no real reason not to|pg||
nt|barnets: why play north for @SK in 6?|pg||
nt|kit: because North made a takeout double|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|barnets: ok seems reasinable|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|h3|pc|s4|pg||

nt|Walddk3: uncheck  invisible before you re-enter|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe we can start|pg||
nt|007 joosth: many would open 1H maybe  but I prefer 1C|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like we are almost ready, Wold Bates play Precision Club, Std approach for NS|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Detroit even*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In the other room E/W were a bit too enthusiastic about the hand|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 31  not 46??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi kit -- sorry to see you here as commentator|pg||
nt|ady: 5-0 spade split spoils a reasonable 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: hi Kit|pg||
nt|kit: I think 4@S might survive the 5-0 split -- not sure|pg||
nt|ady: yes possibly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i still think it is strange to play board 31|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that's what's at the other table too|pg||
nt|kit: didn't the play 1-30?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php or http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  this is 3rd set not 4th|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Al is thinking about the civil war I just heard   thats to much at the same time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 teams were decided last set   USA1 Seniors   Schwartz-Finkel Wolff-Morse Hamilton-Fisher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 Women  Moss-Radin Stansby-Campanile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: congrats to both teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner of our match will play 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch to determine Senior USA2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA2 Women Final has already started - it is 96 boards |pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|kit: hi|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: wrong boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait    EW play a form of Precision  NT strength varies 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  "multi" 2@D, Flannery 2@H   transfers over 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ady: thx Al|pg||
nt|ady: hand 31 looks interesting|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes sure|pg||
nt|007 joosth: S should play the diamonds before E can discard 1 of them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in 4S|pg||
nt|ady: yes    but not easy to work that out at the table|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well tr 1 haert  tr 2 spade  then you see it?|pg||
nt|friggi: nothing is easy to work out at the table:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  carding upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well the coffe sometimes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: coffee:)|pg||
nt|friggi: right, mist that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Steve Robinson used to have card that announced upside-down facial expressions  but that was before screens|pg||
nt|ady: but playing diamonds early   losing to the king and cashing 2 more before ruffing a heart high is very difficult|pg||
nt|kit: I think once declarer sees the 5-0 split he is forced to assume East has 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure but I think he can work it out|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: basically lose spade hook, win return, lose diamond hook, win club hook, and crossruff|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: Danger if defense can get East in with jack of clubs for third round of spades|pg||
nt|ady: but cash diamonds beffore ruffing a heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play a form of Precision  1N opener's 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS high tech 2/1   2@D=weak 2@H/@S  2@H=flannery  2@S=constructive|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude     |pg||
nt|kirp:  Here we have Lynch-Passell with precision Club, Boyd-Robinson are 5-card majors with Multi 2 @D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|007 joosth: yes indeed that J may be the winner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final set of the USA2 "SemiFinal"  loser goes home  winner plays 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch who lost in USA1 final to Schwartz|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS also play Flannery 2@H with intermediate 2@S bid|pg||
nt|kit: Over 1@H opening, Passell might bid Michaels if available, or just overcall 1@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|007 joosth: precision I suppose?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6+@C 10-15 |pg||
nt|ady: would not wager on making|pg||
nt|kit: they will certainly get to 4@S now -- Robinson will show Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i hear other table began to bid,  then the auction disappeared|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H overcall may help a little|pg||
nt|007 joosth: rubensohl or lebensohl maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is showing now as 1N-2@D[one major]|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S i the destination|pg||
nt|friggi: is|pg||
nt|kit: they play transfer Lebensohl -- I forget the exact coding which shows Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice board to start with if you make 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: is this 14-16 no-trump?|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk3: we can't have a broadcast with invisible operators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw last set that side 5-card major isn't a deterent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S max of 15 HCP  [ew play a form of precision]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might start with DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong again al|pg||
nt|kit: this is Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  3@D=4@S, no stop|pg||
nt|kit: will be interesting if Bates overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 45 boards remain in this battle to determine who will be USA2 at the 2011 Senior Bowl in October|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Now or we shall have to boot you|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hello  all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a side 6-card major isn't a deterent...  clubs just have to be the primary suit|pg||
nt|friggi: sameo:)|pg||
nt|barnets: a bidding misunderstanding in open|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson should have gone for the throat and passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  2@C would have been sort of takout, maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably right Martin   very common to use same convention after 1N overcall as over 1N opener|pg||
nt|kirp:  why not open 3@C to begin with?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less common to have a 3@C bid over 1N overcall when you couldn't open 3@C|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry n/s in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: D  ?  !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you type faster :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Commentators are Al Hollander and Martin Kirr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Precision so the 4@H is much wider range than for standard players|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator Kathy Newman|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk1: Hi    e     missing in Westheimer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo, south opened|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no something else wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The boards in the Vugraph are wrong.  Bear with us a few minutes.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: (bare)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry -- have to restart|pg||
nt|barnets: little better but notmuch !|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H looks like decent spot for N-S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: I used to play this structure, but it has been a while so I forgot the exact coding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|friggi: pass pass|pg||
nt|kit: Here Robinson will bid 3NT I think|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|007 joosth: once in a while they make this  but not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ady: may  well need to play a club early|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: other room 5@CX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you think Peter had a way to offer COG  [i.e. show 4@S AND good @H stops]|pg||
nt|007 joosth: knowing 5 or 6 hearts left makes it easier to play for diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|ady: has been warned the heart position|pg||
nt|kit: I think it will go heart lead, spade hook, spade back, club up, and key will be if Bates ducks|pg||
nt|friggi: club early is auto play|pg||
nt|kit: Although East can pitch a diamond on third heart, and that will defeat contract|pg||
nt|santyclz: The expected response to the balancing x.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kirp:  Dbl was probably negative|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: Fortunately Robinson with 6 hearts pretty much had to bid 3@H, so the balance worked well|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe big swing?|pg||
nt|kit: so it looks like down 1|pg||
nt|ady: must wait  before ruffing a heart|pg||
nt|kit: defense can play 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|kit: so must play diamonds before losing lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Chip Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS standard carding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|007 joosth: with that singl of clubs  a spade may be better but N can have the diamond ace|pg||
nt|friggi: @C 10 now|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 5 possible trix on defense|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: and that is pretty double-dummy|pg||
nt|kit: And a winning opening lead -- club lead would have let the contract make|pg||
nt|chip: Hi All. Certainly a close match. (unlike the women's right now)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|ady: very difficult contract  needs almost to play double dummy  playing a low diamond from hand early|pg||
nt|friggi: but no need to play trump, full control in all suits|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when W is in with ace of clubs will he know that E has a 3d heart?|pg||
nt|friggi: the key is @C Aces on side|pg||
nt|kit: He might not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room same contract and lead from internal sequence|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|chick: hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi|pg||
pc|dA|nt|friggi: so play @C as early as possible|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will win and lead a club -- and Bates will have to do something right|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  cool...more commentators than specs:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  This will make, I think, 3@C might have been down 4|pg||
nt|kirp:  doesn't look like N can set up a squeeze position, tho W may not be sure of E' distribution|pg||
nt|kit: squeeze would be possible, but critical entry has to be wasted for the heart play|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfe: I've lost the play.  Will just enter results on this board.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the halfway point  [48 of 96]   Womens USA2 Final    Joel leads Sprung by 39|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: take 10 and run or is there a chance for more?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started typing that BEFORE Chip's comment|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dT|nt|kirp:  actually 3 down on best defense|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hello all   |pg||
nt|kirp:  no squeeze now|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this is nog good|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he needs 2 high ruffs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: hi got his diamond play early, but I think he needed to save his high spade spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: I am just pointing out all things eaq...play @C as soon as possible-basta|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: I think once playing a trump early could not make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: After taking his winners, Passell must return a spade, not a club or diamond, to break up squeeze|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  good afternoon all|pg||
mc|10|nt|007 joosth: spade and then club i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi Andy   wlc|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi andy|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in my opinion W had a big overbid with only 3 trumps and not much extra|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Walter, Joost and Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bruce Ferguson finding a different route to down 1|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: for Standard methods, not much else North could do -- though it seems a shame to get to 3NT in the blind when South might have xxx in clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: not much play here|pg||
nt|kit: There may be some interest -- remember, West can't see declarer's hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer asks Lair: "what's your range?" "14+-17|pg||
nt|barnets: reese says run your long suit |pg||
nt|barnets: when you have not much hope|pg||
nt|barnets: or said|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: But if it goes heart to king and heart to 9, even if West shifts to club there won't be a ninth trick|pg||
nt|barnets: @HK and diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: Schermer wondering if stealing ninth trick|pg||
nt|barnets: west must make 3 discards what are they ?|pg||
nt|kit: Either way Schermer will beat the hand, since if he thinks it is a steal he will go up and put down king of spades|pg||
nt|barnets: if the heart King scores dec should play 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: If west throws one spade dec is now home if hea has also thrown 2 clubs|pg||
nt|kit: not clear to me he should -- seems like that just makes it easy for defense to clarify position|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the @s position should be clear once @d's run|pg||
nt|kit: West will never pitch a spade regardless of what else he holds|pg||

nt|ahollan1: playing Puppet  does Robinson bid?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will have to pass, as they play Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N by NS and likely fail|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: this is last set for USA1 Seniors    2 more sets tonight for USA2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal   [3rd vul 1N=15-17]|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: sort of micheals cuebid showing both majors  |pg||
nt|kirp:  EW eschew 2D as a pre-empt|pg||
nt|007 joosth: many play 2C as natural here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice word Martin   eschew|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  King's English|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hoped to learn some english here:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  how many spades by E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some take it a step further  after nebulous 1@D [like precision]  2@D=nat  2@H=weak michaels|pg||
nt|kirp:  after cashing 1@D and 1@H, Passell could have played one black suit and still had time for the 2nd try|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will be thinking about slam when Boyd shows spade support|pg||
nt|santyclz: 10 viewgraph tables running now, to watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
nt|kit: 1@H response shows spades|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kit: if Bates makes neg response, will be played by East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Kit   i should have left that to you :)|pg||
nt|kit: However the Gods of Puppet will save him, as 1NT is fine even with the 4-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs please note   there are Gods [plural] of Puppet|pg||
nt|barnets: you can beat thuis double dummy|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps they don't save him this time -- the defenders are 1 step ahead in the race|pg||
nt|barnets: by east shifting to the @DJ|pg||
nt|kirp:  Mike has a nice hand for this auction|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson needs 3 keycards plus queen of clubs to make slam -- too much to hope for with minimum opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H probably inv+ @C|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows minimum opener with 4 spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: in other room, bates led trump|pg||
nt|007 joosth: H seems ok 2 me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just reporting the fact  --   i'm positive i'm not sure which is better/best|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but ot here with that singl of clubs may be. |pg||
nt|kit: I have no idea why Passell bid 3@D instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  maybe they treat dble as takeout of 1@S, |pg||
nt|kit: assuming it is takeout of spades, why wouldn't he bid 3@H?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Assuming x shows @hs, perhaps 3@d is a mixed raise.|pg||
nt|kirp:  thinks he is setting up a save possibility?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Cindy Bernstein and Sally Wheeler sitting EW|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not|pg||
nt|baldfriede: operator, what was the result in board 1?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4 s by north down 2--cant enter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when both of opp suits known [michaels for @H & @S, unusual NT for 2 lowest]  you have 2 cue bids to show the other suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 18-19|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps as a safety play -- if doubled, can run to hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Lynch can seriously consider saving with that hand at favorable|pg||
nt|kit: But Robinson will compete to 5@S then, I think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: certain to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 2 chances to shift |pg||
nt|kirp:  6 is a good save|pg||
nt|chip: yes, even if N invites only, S likely to accept.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  they play a 12-14 NT |pg||
nt|ady: south may not lead a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  neither side can attack @ds, so 3 rounds of @hs may allow declarer to bring this home|pg||
nt|007 joosth: looks nice but H lead still to expect?|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd willlikely lead club, and Robinson will have to guess which red suit to return|pg||
nt|kit: However, East may duck 2 rounds of spades, and then if declarer shifts to hearts I believe he will make|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will probably double with his square hand, but Robinson should pull I think|pg||
nt|kirp:  Mike was trying to buy this hand at 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=21&task=list|pg||
nt|hackenbush: for players list and system summary forms|pg||
nt|kirp:  Wonder if they will go to slam, dont think it makes without help|pg||
nt|kirp:  And knew he had a dble fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW don't play Smith     wonder if that will be a factor|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there are 2 ways to play    low for 4th suit or low for lowest suit    [1st better theoretically,  latter more common]|pg||
nt|kirp:  methods vary as to strength, some Qs are GF, others are invit|pg||
nt|kit: Wold did very well to not be ducking|pg||
nt|kit: But the diamond shift will have to come from him, and that may not be so obvious|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D may be a good save, but they won't take it|pg||
nt|kirp:  Excellent for EW|pg||
nt|kirp:  ame thought i had|pg||
nt|chip: If N had Txx of spades that would improve things considerably|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: "can"  better read as "should"|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|friggi: @H lead is screaming|pg||
nt|kit: and 5@D is a much better save|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  this may not prove to be a success|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: Another value of having strong hand declare|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: oops -- that ends the defense|pg||
nt|ady: thats torn it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no double after 2H  so that lead is nor probabble?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|007 joosth: they continue doing the impossible:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, neither side SHOULD....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems after the lead  kit had a lot of options -- all bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best switch would have been a @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @d entry, it seems that declarer can just go after @ss now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like that will lead to 2@S 2@H 2@D for -1|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kirp:  no argument from here, just pointing out how dble fits work for a lot of trix|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't understand this sequence chosed by EW so can't comment on it|pg||
nt|chick: I just checked the summary card and there is nothing there either|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing invite with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like on Bd 1, O'Rourke picked up 5 imps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: maybe a combination of stripsqueeze and endplay to makeslam|pg||
nt|kirp:  Possible if S pitches a H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would at least make another try with East's hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  No @C Q-bid by W should slow him down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: at other table a @c lead helped making 6@s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: needs moderate care to make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bidding in OR suggested a @C lead!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: but now i bet on defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks almost no matter what |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to find 3/3 clubs first|pg||
nt|friggi: ??? W @H was transfer - so the rule is lead the othe M if no other info tells you other wise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: chambers opened 2@C!!      against 4@S  Ferguson led @C but Drew Casen played the @C7|pg||
nt|ady: may be a swing for Orourke|pg||
nt|kit: but he did have info -- no double of 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: hardly likely to double 2@H with QXXX|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i think q as game force too small of a target |pg||
nt|kirp:  This is a pick up for EW, as 4@S dbled in CR|pg||
nt|friggi: @H lead was obvious|pg||
nt|kirp:  Actually @ds is 1 trick better than @Hs|pg||
nt|kirp:  N can get a @D ruff|pg||
pc|c3|nt|007 joosth: small H  I think|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kirp:  Focus on S, good lead|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: I cannot agree heart lead obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i had a $ for every point lost after making an obvious lead|pg||
nt|friggi: bad def|pg||
nt|kit: well, I think club lead is obvious -- needs less in partner's hand|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson hoping opponents will have discarding problems|pg||
nt|kit: Bates dumped his worthless hearts -- that should be the clue for Wold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone having some problems   except dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|nt|kit: right -- really huge result for Lynch|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: but he must shift while his partner has club entry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kirp:  Dont think he can make it after this start|pg||
nt|kit: declare will now take a double club finesse and make|pg||
nt|ady: there is no obvious lead |pg||
pc|c2|nt|friggi: ask Kanter:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Lynch dumps one of her @S   Passell will have no trouble pinning the @SJ|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: And Bates better continue diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: He should, since he knows declarer has queen of hearts when Wold won the king|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: just kidding -- of course no lead is obvious|pg||
nt|kit: so only hope is Wold has jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: Well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope specs paid attention as kit described the inferences|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|friggi: the rule is if not sure lead major|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|007 joosth: slow seniors today|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke gets credit for her 4@C bid|pg||
nt|friggi: works well|pg||
nt|kit: I'll remember that when playing you -- will know when to stretch to a marginal game :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: excdept when it doesn't|pg||
nt|007 joosth: is that the rule of Ice-Save ?  :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: I have a totally different rule .....|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kirp:  the spade pitch by E made it easy for Mike|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h7|mc|8|nt|chip: yes, since if partner had only 2, wouldn't help to put her in, since couldn't lead anyway.|pg||

nt|psyck: as suggested, W was catering to declarer holding something like Ax xxx KQx AKxxx|pg||
nt|barnets: Intersting if west was always holding his spades declarer was always making when he had @SAJX|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer asks Lair "what were your clubs" and on being told says "no play" - his worry was that if he ducked the heart and Lair had AQ of clubs he'd have 9 tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: time for prediction   Bates opens  2@D=11-15 HCP  4415 minus 1 card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like it would have been reasonable here too  but Chambers didn't like 4333|pg||
nt|kit: Make the lead which defeats the contract|pg||
nt|kirp:  Lynch has started out fast|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the Lynch team opens up an early lead.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: different NT range allowed the open room to diagnose the @s weakness and reach 5@c|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1H - 1S - 1Nt  i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: is this 1D  today?|pg||
nt|ady: led a club in OR last hand    north played the 7|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can go for 1-level penalty, or just get to 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: looked like 9 tricks for the taking agree specs|pg||
nt|kirp:  except had Axx in @S, opponents had 8 or likely 9 of them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3NT should be in N then pls|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like more action possible|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  nobody wanted to play a simple 4@h:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they might play a penalty double over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well done :)|pg||
nt|kit: And now, does Bates lead his partner's suit?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: however will not be made anyway?|pg||
nt|kit: Even if he does, defense has to get a second chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time too good for 2@D opener??|pg||
nt|kit: They will likely get to 4@S down 1|pg||
nt|kirp:  Yup, 3N is cold|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT is the winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joost and Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was flip a coin country|pg||
nt|kit: possible swing here, as fortunate 4@S makes -- I think|pg||
nt|kirp:  2@C works better than double|pg||
nt|chip: I like to play that DBL by N here is 3-suit t/O since 1D didn't show D's.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pass = 0-2@S  [else support dbl]|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: heart queen lead if cindy passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen 5@C North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like his chances either|pg||
nt|007 joosth: d lead and spade switch  I will give applaus|pg||
nt|kit: on diamond lead, East will not win the trick|pg||
nt|barnets: rather lucky though|pg||
nt|kit: Now Robinson has a difficult problem|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S isn't forcing.  He might double, but that is risky.  Or he might find winning 3NT call.|pg||
nt|kirp:  N knows S has at most 2 @S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  their card confirms 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  E guessed the N's major was not @ss|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dull as long they are not in 5 again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 11-13|pg||
nt|kirp:  N here prob. cant redble as that shows honour in @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd won't be expecting his partner has a 5-card major and didn't bid|pg||
nt|kit: therefore, he leads his partner's 5-card diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: could have been though, S had 4|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|friggi: duck is manadatory|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so does Boyd try to sneak thru a @S?|pg||
nt|kit: right, and Boyd might have singleton spade, so Robinson not too keen on playing in spades|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson means this as choice of games apparently, but I think Boyd will think it is RKC for diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  Now 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: 10 tricks in nt so it's not too late.|pg||
nt|kit: So I predict Boyd will bid 5@D, 2 with the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: yes, 2C will work better, though always a bit scary to do when clubs may be E's real suit.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|007 joosth: difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of defensive tricks in the 2 suits bid by NS|pg||
nt|kirp:  S also now has more easy non-@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or RDBL is transfer   but don't think anybody plays it as days of old  where RDBL=points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does he lead @D or @C?|pg||
nt|kirp:  pick me for points on rdble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming Bates PASS|pg||
nt|kit: 1 spade thru doesn't do the job|pg||
nt|kit: I think his best bet is to run the clubs -- if he does something else, the hand will be a readout|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: how did E signal?|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D  still not enough|pg||
nt|kit: if he doesn't lead clubs the defense will know the clubs are running and will know what they have to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Zia play a @H?|pg||
nt|kit: they play udca, so East discouraged in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: <heavy sarcasm>|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@D in case 9x|pg||
nt|kirp:  I dont like 4H bid by N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs standard carding|pg||
nt|kirp:  dont think there is much to the play here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|irwinbo: was 3 d really three clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  spade is my pick!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: come to think of it -- in context of limited 1@D -- would you make neg dbl with west hand??|pg||
nt|kit: Or maybe he was just choosing diamonds -- he had both bases covered|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: i suspect we see Cohen work diamonds next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i was going to vote for the @C4...  but i think i'll change to the @D6 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the result as we see it operator ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  not worth it|pg||
nt|kit: no need to play a heart -- could blow contract if ace is onside|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N rated to be better, let them cash 5@C if they can|pg||
nt|kirp:  3@Hs and a @S loser|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, forgot to cash heart|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays Q@D    thats 8 tricks   wont make a 9th   defence obvious|pg||
nt|friggi: low @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention of Smith for EW|pg||
nt|kit: defense can now count declarer's tricks -- so they will play for what is necessary |pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kozlove didn't opposite unlimited opener|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  looks like E can make this easily on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may be playing transfers where 3@D would be stayman|pg||
nt|kit: Spade shift will beat it 2, but I think Passell will shift to heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but should start with @S shift before more @H  [i think]|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|kirp:  really is a poor neg dble|pg||
nt|kit: I still think running clubs is best -- West might not hold enough hearts|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the wholle problem began with a diamond overcall which i dont like|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer has stiff diamond that may be necessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imagine Passell 5@S 2@H  then @H @H @H endplays|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: an interesting switch|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kirp:  ill-judged maybe is more polite|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wow|pg||
nt|friggi: low|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: this is makeable from here, but unlikely at the table imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diplomatic   as all bridge players are|pg||
nt|kit: in addition, down 1 less at worst|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room, they played 2@s when south chose to raise instead of bidding 1NT: a very plausible alternative|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hackenbush: ah, EW one of few pairs to have submitted a convention card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense needed to shift to spades after second heart ducked|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/docs/2011uswbc/acblcards/PollackBjerkan.bmp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however disa should not have discarded a diamond, if in fact she did|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wonder if east's 2nt would be the winning bid in the bridge world   many would double|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks still hard to beat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about  neg dbl got what it deserved|pg||
nt|kit: Unfortunately, dummy had partner's 5-card diamond suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely finesse |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: but no thought to leading @S?    North figures to have exactly 4 [pull w/5]  and South exactly 2  [pass w/3]|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: very nice start from Chambers|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: don't like leading from broken 4-card suits...  to costly in the long run|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest: Bates covered in case Cohen only had 10x of spades and Wold had 8xx left|pg||
nt|kirp:  got the ruff anyway, another strong result|pg||
nt|chip: or play 4 rounds of hearts.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  NS have no response to final 3 tricks for EW.  In hindsight, S probably wished she'd led a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like leading     period|pg||
nt|kirp:  That does beat it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bigtrain: aint that the truth (says the president of the overbidder club)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just ask partners     no good can come from having me on opening lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  N is about to get end played|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kirp:  he can get a @H ruff but then what|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|joest: now a club back but Mark Cohen has nine tricks|pg||
nt|joest: the club pitch suggesting that perhaps Bates wants hearts returned|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: In the other room e/w were in 3N and west removed to 4@D wisely|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: on defense it isn't always bad to get endplayed -- if it happens often enough|pg||
nt|kirp:  best here is a club back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on previous board, instead of running @D  Lair is trying @H toward dummy at trick 2|pg||
mc|9|nt|chip: But even if he steals that, only 8 tricks.|pg||
pg||

mb|2D!|nt|barnets: there is no play record |pg||

nt|kit: no play record unfortunately, so we can't see what happened|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer wrote that 2@d was non-forcing, and on the other side of the screen, Hayden has asked Chambers whether 2@c promised another bid and Chambers also wrote that 2@d is NF|pg||
nt|kit: Only thing I can think of is heart lead, win king, jack of diamonds, and entries then fouled up|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: there are suggestions on how it could also have gone down if dec tried to enter dummy in @h 1st to take @d finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: well north could lead the @S10 |pg||
nt|psyck: losing 3@s 1@h 1@d that way|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: won by dec the win @HA and palt @S9|pg||
nt|barnets: that gives dec 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|barnets: and he cant afford the safety play in diaonds|pg||
nt|barnets: as south still has one spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer asks "A is what?" Lair is answering verbally, very quietly, but I think A asks for attitude|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: I am hearing it went high spade lead, heart shift won in dummy, jack of diamonds to king, hearts continued, and declarer now couldn't untangle the minors|pg||
nt|barnets: so it was the @DJ that cost the contract|pg||
nt|kit: apparently|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: if catering to Kxx with S, could unblock @dT on @dJ|pg||
nt|barnets: and if it looks like nort has the @HA dec could play a diamond for the 10 planning to cash the @CK and play a second heart|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|barnets: South would win the @H Ace if he had it to play a scond spade|pg||
nt|kit: declarer has problems here -- what does he do?|pg||
nt|kit: If he plays heart, North wins and establishes spades|pg||
nt|kit: If he overtakes club for finesse, North wins and plays club through|pg||
nt|kit: So this hand isn't nearly as easy as it looks|pg||
nt|barnets: then he safety plays spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and makes his contract|pg||
nt|barnets: safety plays diamonds i mean|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @DA|pg||
nt|kit: you mean if he plays heart first|pg||
nt|barnets: yes and north rises|pg||
nt|kit: but is that the right play?  If North has Kx of diamonds, I think he can be squeeze-endplayed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Let's see what North does here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: North will now set up the spades for sure|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 losers then |pg||
nt|kit: he knowsNorth is 5-4, but might be 5-4-2-2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|d4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|barnets: if south has @DK|pg||
nt|kit: now safety play in diamonds no longer safe|pg||
nt|barnets: he had t leave that club winner in dummy- not clear at all|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|kit: But I agree, instead of cashing queen of clubs should have played diamond to ace -- if North has Kx of diamonds, he could never make at this point|pg||
nt|psyck: he has full count now, but that does not help much|pg||
nt|kit: In other words, if jack of clubs was coming down third North had a stiff diamond, so ace of diamonds would still work|pg||
nt|kit: Thus, diamond to ace would always make if the hand could be made|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: Unless he gets some kind of read I don't why he should get this right|pg||
nt|barnets: well guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hayden played a heart on the diamond A, and Schermer was unhappy, then Garey showed him he really had the @d K :)|pg||

nt|kit: that one didn't matter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Then Schermer said: "you couldn't have that" and Hayden said : "I could have 4 clubs" and Lair: "if you had that, he makes" |pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - I was so amused by Hayden's antics I forgot to claim - I've now put the score in the movie and if I get a chance I'll go back and reenter the bidding and play since it was ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: interesting|pg||

nt|ahollan1: specs who get bored when contract is 1N --  keep that hand in mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus led @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: +100 honors|pg||
nt|kit: impossible declarer could have 9 tricks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: knowing south holds 3 or 4@S a very reasonable choice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can i retract that last raving?|pg||
nt|friggi: I like 9 from nothing or 9 from 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and now 5@C from Stewart|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must have some spades mixed in with his clubs :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Woolsey has the same thought i think|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=0/1 controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS can make lots of @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: NS play precision|pg||
nt|joest: third seat a good four card major is a possibility|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 5C as expected|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S liekly to be reached   should be down 1 with diamond wrong|pg||
nt|kit: Wold has normal neg double -- Boyd will raise -- not clear how high|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: tons of pressure now.  Rosenberg could just grab it with 3NT but that's a big statement|pg||
nt|joest: but if he makes a 'responsive double' or some such they are probably headed to 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: 5@C|pg||
nt|kirp:  solved a tuff hand with invit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wish USBF could require submission of Convention Cards for their trials -- not sure how many @D promised by Schermer's 1@D :(|pg||
nt|kirp:  3@D bid is intersting, would you play this as weak?|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@D gets a workout in this system|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 3NT seems best|pg||
nt|friggi: J from nothing else from 2|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd won't introduce his heart suit now|pg||
nt|kirp:  how about sneaky club suit, E pitched a low club, not a high spade on 3rd @h|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C call pretty conservative -- looks more like 3@C call to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but burns no calories|pg||
nt|chip: 6D is excellent, and makes easily.|pg||
nt|kirp:  its on constructive hands like this where it causes problems. Better to rebid 1N with W and take it frm there|pg||
nt|kirp:  in my opinionÂ¨|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: wonder what Casen would bid over  3@C-4@S-5@C-?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: an 800 point gift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus in action again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 11-13|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N anyone by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: takes teh pressure off partner which is always appreciated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|kit: And 4@S will be reached, which should go down on decent defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  guess not opposite passed pard|pg||
nt|kit: If Robinson passes Lynch can try 3@D, and then auction will liven up|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: club finesse is needed  after that at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: Wold knows where the spade king is (or thinks he does)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  he may be right:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing Eddie leads a @d|pg||
nt|chip: I like that style better also, though there was a hand earlier today in the women's where it was a big loser when EW lost their spade Fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this lead and auction should help Wheeler pick up trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: both partners seem to have been ticketed for speeding here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 5 down even?|pg||
nt|kirp:  he counts points|pg||
nt|kit: Down 2 on stiff diamond lead, as declarer must finesse to try to make|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit  would you ever consider bidding NT instead of the neg dbl with that awful @H suit?|pg||
nt|kirp:  guess they need more machinery|pg||
nt|chip: or be willing to use it.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand 4@D bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he get out for 800?|pg||
nt|kirp:  maybe 2@D inverted but can have  major, gets he suit across|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think using inverted that way is worst of all permutations|pg||
pc|dK|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: such as swap @CK and @Sx|pg||
nt|kit: wow!|pg||
nt|kirp:  That may steal the board|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't anticipate that!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||
nt|joest: 4 hearts + 4 diamonds + 1 club = 9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when it's about avertricks he can better start clubs immediately|pg||
nt|007 joosth: overtricks    i think:)|pg||
nt|kit: big swing on opening lead here |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: South and West having lengthy discussion about 4D bid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director has been called.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Bernstein, Westheimer, and director have gone off for a long discussion on other side of room.|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with nebulous @D  you can NEVER unscramble @D length that way|pg||
nt|kirp:  you can, if responder can say this is my suit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|007 joosth: but it was only a 3d hand opening......|pg||
pc|h2|nt|friggi: declarer must play for the fin - if he want to make the game:)|pg||
nt|friggi: wants|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  4@S   open room   diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer-Chambers 2@H/@S openers are intermediate  10-13|pg||
nt|kit: Bates "knows" the lead is likely a singleton, but he will still finesse just in case|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: not much here so i'm wondering if 6@D can make after @H @H|pg||
nt|kirp:  client happily raised to 5@Ds using point count methods|pg||
nt|kirp:  only via a backwards finesse in @S|pg||
nt|kit: No kidding -- difference between making and down 3|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|baldfriede: no way to reach W's @s, hence it will make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|friggi: and he should|pg||
nt|friggi: just in case|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: could be right|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: cute since Robinson couldn't win with @C8  Wold knows Robinson's exact shape|pg||
nt|kirp:  N has work to do, not any more|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson isn't 100% sure -- he may lay down king of hearts and get a signal|pg||
nt|kirp:  Meanwhile 5@Ds is cold|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kirp:  had work to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that comes up so often when we're watching -- but only implemented in print, never at table|pg||
nt|friggi: negative|pg||
pc|h3|nt|007 joosth: 4 hearts now resuilt in an endplay|pg||
pc|h4|nt|007 joosth: can Rosenberg have bid 3NT without spade K?  that seems to be the problem to E|pg||
nt|kit: 8 of diamonds suit-preference for hearts|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Steve would rebid 2N with 2542|pg||
nt|kirp:  what would you bid, same hand but clubs instead of diamonds|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|007 joosth: spade 2 will be lavinthal|pg||

nt|kit: I agree Barnet -- I don't like rebidding 1@S unless unbalanced.  Auctions work out much better that way.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Chambers: "how many HCPs did you have?" Schermer "I had 17" ... "no, I had 13, but it was an excellent fitter"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Then he asked me "did they get their in the other room?"|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|kit: Worst case is I miss a 4-4 spade fit on a part-score hand, and that isn't the end of the world.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I laughed, Schermer said "I should be able to tell from that laugh" Chambers, correctly, said "she was laughing at the question"|pg||
nt|barnets: we had this discussion on set 1 with henry B|pg||
mb|d!|nt|Vugraphzfb: Schermer is writing a bunch, but I can't see it|pg||
nt|psyck: they will get to 2@s here too now|pg||
nt|kit: Chambers clearly thinks he is making a takeout double of diamonds.  I think most experts would play this shows diamonds and is penalty oriented.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: he must have been a doctor in another life, even when Lair turned it over and moved it a little, I couldn't read the note :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|barnets: penalty is the way it used to be but these days many players never make a penalty x|pg||
nt|barnets: it does not exist in their system|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: This is a somewhat ugly 4-3 fit, but I think they will survive.  Interesting that Schermer bid his 3-card club suit instead of his 4-card spade suit|pg||
nt|psyck: only the 5 losers & the long trump hand aint ruffing anything|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he worked out his partner had 4 hearts, so if also had 4 spades would have made immediate takeout double?|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec says maybe play x two way either penalty or take out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think the note might have said that DBL was 2-way, either takeout or diamonds, but I'm not at all sure|pg||
nt|barnets: work it out from your hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|barnets: see above jan|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and zinfandel in my room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what Schermer will respond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to expected 1@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Schermer to bid 1st|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we know  Jacobus would open 1N|pg||
nt|warrens:  would anyone have bid 3@S over 3@C with West?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not been dull so far|pg||
nt|kit: I wouldn't have -- 8-card fit, compete 3 over 3?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: board is turned|pg||
nt|kit: However, I would have tried 3@D instead|pg||
nt|warrens:  right, the other option|pg||
mb|1D|nt|007 joosth: weak 2 maybe|pg||
nt|barnets: some chance here e/w as 4@H can be beaten|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should be quick auction|pg||
nt|kirp:  opposite limited opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  he's the dealer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's not fair|pg||
nt|kit: very possible swing here, as N-S could easily get to game|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: Kozlove bid the same opposite unlimited 1@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, 4@s would be almost automatic for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Flannery  4@S  5/6@H|pg||
nt|friggi: if it fails... try again|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes I already was looking why they did not make 4....|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will bid game|pg||
nt|kit: probably played ace and a heart for safety in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: thats better:)|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S can be beaten|pg||
nt|barnets: If the defence can lead or switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: auction will look funny|pg||
nt|chip: well, we seem to be stuck on 1D openings.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the hand where Passell went down in 3N  Hayden continued @S10 at trick 2  that really slowed down Schermer|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a hand that could have had some fireworks put quietly to bed with the 3@d preempt|pg||
nt|kit: Wold has a chance to be a hero with king of diamonds lead -- |pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: playing in a 6-1 minor instead of a 6-2 major seems like a hole in the system|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of 2 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps @D and a major |pg||
nt|kirp:  almost any system except mine, where I played Texas after 1 D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this week we've seen a plethora of 8/9 card suits  and 11/12 card fits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: texas over 1@D   very cool treatment Martin|pg||
nt|kirp:  it was a strong club system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow haven't seen that in long time   old fashioned raise of minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: dubious 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR 3N was bid quickly, here more science|pg||
nt|barnets: In the other room a heart was led|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H call shows 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3 shape (raise)|pg||
nt|barnets: the 8|pg||
nt|barnets: west had to win and shift a dianond|pg||
mb|2S|nt|007 joosth: a rather dull board 9 tricks  maybe defenders dont take their 4 tr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D game force checkback  [a guess]|pg||
nt|kit: So this will be 10 IMPs for Kasle|pg||
nt|friggi: sur eit will|pg||
nt|friggi: good biddng|pg||
nt|friggi: bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: but he duched the first heart|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like N has S's hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  same, but no 2 passes to start|pg||
nt|ritong: just enter the final result, please|pg||
nt|kit: Good save, and E-W must double|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I would not preempt with S's hand, too much chance partner has spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  but they will survive this one as there is no game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised Casen didn't either bid 2@S or make Support DBL??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I think he is confident with this 2H  Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, i know  @HAJ9x  screams defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt from N? |pg||
nt|kirp:  yup|pg||
nt|kit: I think king of diamonds lead is quite reasonable personally -- just need ace or queen in partner's hand, and if he doesn't have it, probably won't cost|pg||
nt|barnets: and then had no chance|pg||
nt|kit: and here, partner didn't double 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: actually pointed out dec can duck the diamond switch|pg||
nt|kirp:  S says thank you|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: This will be down 1, and should just about tie up the match|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 5@C goes 4 down|pg||
nt|kit: the save got a plus score -- that makes it a good save|pg||
nt|kirp:  A great save|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will enter final result when they finish|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C can go down 4 if defense cashes everything and exits with a trump -- otherwise, there will be an endplay|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  so this should go down 2|pg||
nt|chick: sounds about right|pg||
nt|kirp:  Note that 6@D s depends only on finding the Q and double finesse in @Ss|pg||
nt|barnets: that would cut communications|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 3@S may have clarified @H weakness|pg||
nt|ritong: surprise|pg||
nt|kit: did this really make???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  how?|pg||
nt|kit: can you describe what happened?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I understand you should not always pass,  but do we get a serie of kamikaze-bids from here now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok will play the 4/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: a real challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: in fact not sure it can be made|pg||
nt|kirp:  I am guessing, also no 5th @D or shape |pg||
nt|friggi: Q@H is the card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for all of the grief that the convention gets  there are times when it is very easy for responder|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like he may make this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kirp:  S is still trying, N will check out|pg||
nt|kit: king-doubleton leads are very underrated -- people lead away from kings all the time, so why not lead from king doubleton when you have additional upside of a ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: schermer being forced to re-confirm  minimum balanced hand 3@S|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kirp:  Its possible that S could have only 4@S with @D fit|pg||
nt|barnets: so it had to be a diamond lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure likely to fly K  |pg||
nt|kirp:  Nice safety play against 40 spli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't get kasle in for  @C underlead, misguess AND @C for trump promotion|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: she'll take 6 diamonds and the @SK, not much chance of anything else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make all the rest|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not greatest auction but well judged in the end to pass 4N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfe: Pollack has called the director.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry that the connection keeps dropping.  It has been happening all day.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry.  Don't have that info.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: other table misdefended against 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director is here.  East exposed a card.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so possibly 5 more imps to NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, maybe not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be interesting if Bates ducks the 10|pg||
nt|kirp:  dont know how they made only 3 in CR|pg||
nt|kirp:  continuing @Ds would have been best|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: right to start with low heart -- if East has stiff king, may need to conserve spots|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: so now down 2 for sure and maybe 3  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but "only 50's" |pg||
nt|kirp:  11 trix looks easy|pg||
nt|kirp:  think Passell would get @Cs right on the auction and lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: but needed to start with diamond ruff i think|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Declarer is cross-ruffing the hand.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes but had she ruffed a diamond immediately would have scored all 6 trumps in hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe drawing trumps was a better chance to make more tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: does he just take double finesse in @S or can he combine chances in @D & @S|pg||
nt|kirp:  even diamond to A works well|pg||
nt|kirp:  Q@D dropping is extra chance in favour of @S finesses|pg||

pc|c4|nt|sybarra: but we have seen this hand make 3 nt in other rooms|pg||

nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: i thought I scored it down one|pg||

nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 9 to score in the USA1 final   Schwartz over Lynch by 35|pg||
nt|friggi: correto kit|pg||
nt|kit: is the North hand too strong for a 1NT opening?  We shall see.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|kirp:  if A@D is with N, then need to pitch Q@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|kirp:  Best by W|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not good enuff for 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D opening  that's the theme of this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kirp:  exactly!|pg||
nt|chip: Perhaps E has a different range.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: Rosenberg with a disciplined pass but at matchpoints I can assure you some folks would enter with a lead directing 2@s|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C majors   same as if  1N opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it was down one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice 2C if it is majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand  IF in slam, can you make|pg||
nt|kit: note light opener in Precision|pg||
nt|kirp:  to avoid end play, but ???|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest: well I guess at IMPS too!|pg||
nt|joest: at favorable I guess anything goes|pg||
nt|joest: but Milt is usually pretty disciplined|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without peeking at all 52 cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: steve cashed club then another ace|pg||
nt|kirp:  Okidoki|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  6@c or 6N will be disappointing with the 4-1 @c break|pg||
nt|andyv:  the OR managed to stay out of trouble|pg||
nt|joest: this catches Cohen with a big hand though|pg||
nt|joest: here come the police|pg||
nt|joest: Bates has to double what is under his nose it seems to me|pg||
nt|joest: of course his partner is 3rd seat but still..|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only 7 tricks i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: very light opener  that R|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and there they are|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but a diamond lead is not nice|pg||
nt|joest: no way does Rosenberg sit this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: n0--sorry--|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 2@S probably 4-card support|pg||
nt|friggi: must be|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I dont think  such a bid has to be strong.  so 3S seems some rough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen liked his pure holdings in majors  -- and i'm sure not a high card invite -- that would be 2N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice double fit,  but a doubtful K|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew basing it on the dbl major suit fit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade lead gives it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  and seems impossible to keep N from gaining lead if you don't lead a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat  and  3rd vul  1N=15-17|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have pinched it|pg||
nt|kit: 1@S not the best contract, but it will make|pg||
nt|warrens:  duck this?|pg||
nt|kit: I would win and go right after diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  Did 1@S gtee a weak hand, pass looks timid by N|pg||
nt|kit: no, normal -- North just made a good decision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N did eventually make 3N on 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ach  Schermer|pg||
nt|kirp:  Even if E opens 1N, S may enter the auction with 'Majors'|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: it does seem that they should have considered a slam at least|pg||
nt|joest: ok so I have misguessed Rosenberg at every opportunity|pg||
nt|joest: Mark used to be a pretty harsh partner.  I played with him.|pg||
nt|joest: I would NOT have wanted to table this dummy in 3NT doubled!!! :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Hard to find @C lead now|pg||
nt|007 joosth: with small doubleton H   i can imagine a reasonable 3card spades|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson can definitely consider balancing with xx in spades -- passing risks losing a double-part-score swing|pg||
nt|ady: now see if they can make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may -- but would he?|pg||
nt|chip: consider 1C-1H-1S-2m-2H  |pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: right now, pollack is praying for a bad club split :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  as they did here...1N is 8-13 and game forcing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a heart lead seems obvious   the Q or K   according to what agreement you have|pg||
nt|007 joosth: asking unblocking a J|pg||
nt|joest: although that will cost her|pg||
nt|joest: here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure about 3@H  and that also applies to 4N and 5@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Have no idea what 4N was, key-card?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S might fit  keycard  or    5@S 6@D  [but didn't 4@S show that?]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H weak jump shift -- just weird for that hand to ask KeyCards|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice bid by N if thats the case|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's a twist  4@S=keycard for @H|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like headed down 1|pg||
nt|friggi: yes but what if they dont ?|pg||
nt|friggi: still suitable |pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe he can do something nice with the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 4th club with east will come into play|pg||
nt|kit: defense may have to get diamonds going in time|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kirp:  5@D is also a nice contratc|pg||
nt|kirp:  thats also possible!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 8-11 opposite passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus opened north hand 1@C  so O'Rourke had no trouble leading @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lasts random guess  4N pick-a-game|pg||
nt|ady: needs 10@D switch early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chip  please tell me that is referring to a different hand/conversation|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hackenbush: *as|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade ace lead was a good bet with no raise by partner|pg||
nt|hackenbush: new leader after this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes, goes down every 4-5 minutes.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: should get diamonds right after West shows up with lots of black cards|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well Jack,  maybe he just wanted to visit the toilet?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no unbloch here  thats strange|pg||
nt|joest: Bates proceeding on the assumption that, having not seen the jack from partner, Cohen must have it|pg||
nt|joest: at least I'm guessing so|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 more mistake and its only -100|pg||
nt|joest: but it doesn't matter much what he does since Cohen has only six tricks that I can count|pg||
nt|kirp:  May find @C lead after this auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: one thing is sure --- this auction hasn't come up before|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  true, ty:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Limited by the failure to open 1@c.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|joest: assuming that Wold switches to the @Dj when he gets in|pg||
nt|kirp:  Rise with @C K to block the suit|pg||
nt|kit: This hand hasn't made yet -- 3 spades, 3 diamonds, 1 club are all the sure tricks declarer has|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: hi howard|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hackenbush: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and South will win @D with no @C to continue|pg||
nt|kit: they are playing standard, not strong club|pg||
pc|cA|nt|friggi: that is the kay in def|pg||
nt|kirp:  Are NS a Strong Club pair?|pg||
nt|kit: no -- standard|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh, sorry thought they were playing precision, they're not.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no--they claimed five and was accepted|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|friggi: @D 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is yet another hand where backward finesse works -- but won't be taken at the table|pg||
nt|kit: declarer doesn't really gain by going after hearts, but it deflects the defenders from what they need to do|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|kirp:  i dislike too many blackwood versions|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i dislike not knowing   What's Trump?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice|pg||
nt|chip: sorry, that was refering to whether to rebid 1S with 4 or 1N on a balanced hand (and not distinguishing 4-3-3-3 from 4-3-1-5)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  time to claim|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you need to allow one ruff, well done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|007 joosth: first they should discard 5 times|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will play continue @S to King @D to 8?|pg||
nt|friggi: Al is right ...sadly:)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  does he think South is danger hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  in the olde days, i played 4N as the only Black and alwys Black|pg||
nt|ady: south may have been a too passive|pg||
nt|kit: And it worked -- now declarer will get 4 spades, 3 clubs, and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: Diamond shift far from obvious from Boyd's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  went down in OR   so Wold needed to make this|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: she can set up a spade trick before clearing clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Upon getting bad news, will lead diamond to dummy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I think NS should have a little talk about intervening and bidding after that|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like it|pg||
nt|kit: Good club play by Robinson -- gives declarer a losing option of 9 of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which was tough for Wold as dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: it is makeble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing 3 suiter instead of 4 suiter|pg||
mc|8|nt|joest: queen of spades is very thoughtful, showing Qj|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we used to call that  Lublin's Law|pg||
nt|kirp:  Glenn Lublin?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i see that Glenn has been doing some commentary lately|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if there was glaring statistical difference we wouldn't still have both approaches|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: diamod-lead maybe   but still....|pg||
nt|joest: Wold might bid 3@h|pg||

nt|baldfriede: and he was bornin Stratford.on-Avon|pg||
nt|kirp:  spelling bee?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like Lynch will just get to 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Enuff|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest: 2Nt might be the 'value call' but it could be Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|friggi: -1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N game force raise |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C min, not 6@H|pg||
nt|kit: why is 6@D by West better than 6@S by west?|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to get to|pg||
nt|kirp:  @Ds|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: partnerships differ about whether 2NT is Lebensohl after a 2@d opener|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT gets the nature of the hand across well|pg||
nt|007 joosth: In the Netherlands almost everybody plays multi,  so I don't know|pg||
nt|joest: Bates may be asking himself: "do we play Lebensohl here"?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hope he asked it before|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is possible that they do and that Wold follows up with 3@h over a forced 3@c rebid showing four hearts in a NT hand and offering a choice of games|pg||
nt|joest: his hand is pretty straightforward so the longer he thinks the more my money is on the issue of "what do we play here?" :)|pg||
nt|kit: but it does make -- 4 hearts, 1 club, 4 diamonds, 3 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Wold bids 3@C  that means something completely different :)|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D will ask -- not sure which coding they use from here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after a club lead?....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: oh right -- West can lead a club --|pg||
nt|friggi: yes like joost said - open cards:) no problem, but.............|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW play Precision, so 6@S is unlikely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kasle the only one not to have opened 1@D at least once|pg||
nt|chip: I would add that almost 100% of those playing weak NT do rebid 1N on all the 15-17 hands balanced hands (so 1S promises a balanced hand)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Passell pass = 0-2@H   [support dbl situation]|pg||
nt|chip: sorry, 1S rebid promises an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ACBL defense database vs multi  http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/3b.htm|pg||
nt|kirp:  2@S plays rather well here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4|pg||
nt|barnets: because you can pitch a heart on the fifth spade|pg||
nt|barnets: and lead a heart towards the k|pg||
nt|barnets: giving yourself 2 50 percent chances|pg||
nt|kit: oh, I see -- okay|pg||
nt|kit: I think Bates will just blast it into 6@S with RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not   i think Wold is allowed 3@S  so  will go thru 2N to get full distribution|pg||
nt|kirp:  Guessing A, then @C|pg||
nt|kirp:  dble now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that's where i first picked up the habit Chip   and  invention of checkback schemes just made it easier|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: it is only fair -- if some open 2@H with 5  someone has to balance by opening 2@H with 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and can't blame him with 222 in other suit    YUK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he is vuln   and has just seen the result of doing it with 5 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 5 card suit at 3 level is a different disease|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what about a diamond now|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@c = "I think we play Lebensohl" :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  9 trix methinks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a standard treatment of DBL after interference of Jacoby raise?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C to show 4252|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S in open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF they use same responses as other Wold partnerships|pg||
nt|barnets: the lead of the @HQ speeds play up|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room north was on lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|barnets: and led @HQ|pg||

nt|kit: won't matter -- he would bid slam opposite that also|pg||
pc|cA|nt|friggi: that goes without saying|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or it did at one time|pg||
nt|kit: Now queen ask 5@H|pg||
nt|kit: If he thinks he is losing the match, he might not bother with queen ask -- I'll bet that is what he is trying to estimate.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|kit: declarer would have taken a long time :)|pg||

nt|007 joosth: but the next H would have caused same problem|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S 11-15, 5+@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it is consistent with Lynch not opening 1N earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: loser of that match gets the night off then tomorrow plays 60 boards against winner of our match to become USA2|pg||
nt|friggi: what is the point to show penalty?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force  as you see could be balanced with [i think] 2+@C|pg||
nt|barnets: North if he has the ace may not play one back|pg||
nt|barnets: or less likely may duck |pg||
nt|kit: 2NT overcall, then either 3NT or Stayman which will get to 4-4 heart fit. |pg||
nt|kirp:  Gerbers??|pg||
mb|4D|nt|007 joosth: i dont understand 2NT|pg||
nt|joest: sanity returns|pg||
nt|kit: not sure what restrictions of 2@C are -- but he has to bid something, and 2@H would show 5|pg||
nt|kit: I imagine Bates has 3@H splinter here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alway FG   either nat or bal|pg||
nt|ady: flat result with little interest|pg||
nt|ady: unless e/w get too high|pg||
nt|kit: a splinter will cause Wold to go low|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a splinter will discourage E completely|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: little interest?     i think interesting to see how top partnerships handle these bidding situation|pg||
nt|barnets: sounds like  a slightly better shot than 50-50|pg||
nt|kirp:  best to play all your methods after 2N opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: South may think about offering NT with so much secondary values|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is excellent, 4@H is down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: oops  I can stay|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Woolsey was not desparate at this moment with a double:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roman responses  so 4@D=0/3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: steps would be 03, 14, 2  and some add 4th step of 2 + extras|pg||
mb|5C|nt|friggi: 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: I agree.  Almost no such thing as hand with little interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decided NOT to splinter -- that can be dangerous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  easier to remember that way, since you dont know his suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force  2@H=6+|pg||
nt|ady: kib pointed out 4@S might go down on a heart lead   and club switch|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andyv:  a @s lead may make this 3NT contract very awkward|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this will promise a stopper  so 3NT comes closer   again an ugly game|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see a lot of of hts will make for e/w |pg||
nt|kirp:  OK who can find a @H lead after that auction|pg||
nt|kit: Wold will bid 3@S, of course, and then we will see what Bates does|pg||
nt|friggi: lack of Aces should trigger 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well it might make|pg||
nt|joest: both north-souths have hit a rough patch these last two boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 3@D denies 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BJ Becker referred to "shirley doubles" a character he had who often doubled with trump void|pg||
nt|barnets: would you bid 3@H or pass ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass seems like large position to take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 aces, 1 king   but is that the info that Lynch needed?|pg||
nt|kirp:  I suppose with 3A's and no K's you might stop in 5N!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and regret missing some excellent minor suit slams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would have been reasonable to bid 1N-6N  or  1N-4@C//4@D-6N|pg||
nt|kirp:  along with Texas, i use 4S as balanced 44 minors slam invitation at least|pg||
nt|kirp:  which fits this hand perfectly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but why invite?|pg||
nt|kirp:  invite or better, maybe to a grand if key-cards are there|pg||
nt|kirp:  not sure what the hold up is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point they should be in slam force   so there should be a way to investigate minor vs nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the key is  --   when you ask for aces/kings  you have to have a plan   or don't ask|pg||
mb|6N|nt|andyv:  but N won't find that|pg||
nt|kirp:  Made 5 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hands like this make me wonder how game would change if we counted honors|pg||
nt|kirp:  Would u overcall with E's hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 to play in Women's USA1 final   Moss leads Sprung by 37    Women's USA2 "SemiFinal"  Joel now leading Westheimer  by 6  with 7 boards to play|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this was not exactly how i thought it would work|pg||
nt|joest: ok now this is REALLY ridiculous!|pg||

nt|007 joosth: sorry i think i'm commentator of a different game.   i dont understand 2NT nor 3H if thats natural|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Lawrence advises that 2H maybe only 5card   clearly a different school|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only by 1 card|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now it's easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Howard...good to see you surviving this roller coaster:)|pg||

nt|hackenbush: after bd 34|pg||
nt|007 joosth: thats better|pg||
nt|kirp:  this should be fast|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT would have been in jeopardy on diamond lead -- declarer would have to guess which ace to knock out first.|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: although....2Nt is crazy in my opinion|pg||
nt|joest: AKQ may all go on trick 1!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: believe it or not    4@D did not say anything about serious/non-serious slam interest -- just a cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quick claim???|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: 3N was still a possible contract|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i think my grandma can make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like @C ruff holds it to 4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: lead right for defence to have a chance|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, on heart lead and club shift, could easily go down -- and that is the logical defense|pg||
nt|friggi: after 3@S slam was not the case|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: a kib suggested ducking the 10 of hearts!|pg||

nt|kit: Maybe too obvious, but worth thinking about|pg||
nt|friggi: good point|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Here it comes -- but which club will Boyd shift to?|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer ducks 10@H  cannot south still play the ace and switch to a club?|pg||
nt|friggi: still 11|pg||
nt|kit: And will Bates believe it?|pg||
nt|friggi: no|pg||
nt|puncher99: lo  club lead best|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but defender doesn't know that third heart trick might be needed|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: but south may well smell a reat if declarer ducked the 10@H|pg||
nt|friggi: def has to be creative Kit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hackenbush: not sure desperation was called for on lead when they're getting a bad trump break|pg||

nt|kit: 2NT by Boyd takeout|pg||
nt|warrens:  since if partner were 4-4 in the majors, couldn't he bid 1@S over 1@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not much change in womens  thru 57 of 96   Joel over Sprung by 37|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hackenbush: yes when partner showed values|pg||
nt|sybarra: chose to be conservative |pg||
nt|sybarra: on the lay out that works |pg||
nt|kirp:  Wrong sided this one|pg||
nt|kirp:  Still has 9 trix, as @Hs are 4 4|pg||
nt|friggi: poker bid|pg||
nt|ady: I agree lucky|pg||
nt|kit: well, too high in theory :)|pg||
nt|barnets: when dec finessed diamonds east won and cleared hearts|pg||
nt|kit: it would seem that way Warren|pg||
nt|kirp:  In my style I would rebid 1N with S hand, 1@S with more unbal shape or weal dbleton |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hackenbush: this was beatable on an unlikely @c or @dA lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Declared gets the lead she needed to make this|pg||
nt|hackenbush: bye for now, hope the internet connection gets better!|pg||
nt|andyv:  a club lead would have set this|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye Howard|pg||
nt|007 joosth: even that I dont believe|pg||
nt|kirp:  Thoughtful lead, hoped to find 5-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier on their auction|pg||
nt|barnets: thats not best for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: on this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chick: down 5?|pg||
nt|kirp:  weak dbleton in 4th suit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: this may have been a mixup here -- not sure|pg||
nt|kit: So now Boyd has bid 3 suits, perfect way to describe 4-3-3-3 :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: 1@c was precision|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3S seems right    even with the good clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: comes from spending time with Kit Woolsey  --  essentially  if you can't lead your 5 card suit -- try to find partner's|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Robinson would have chosen 3@C on xx if 2NT offered a choice.|pg||
nt|barnets: still not home though |pg||
nt|barnets: yet|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: 1@h was probably artificial|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only an agressive diamond lead will bring the slam?|pg||
nt|joest: when I firrst started bridge the auction would have gone 2NT-6NT|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 23 was also then to much for 2NT?|pg||
nt|joest: 22-24|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: old old days|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|007 joosth: at least you made it|pg||
nt|kirp:  intersting theory, always attack with 5-card suit|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR, the splinter sort of gave it away|pg||
nt|friggi: 2NT was out of touch|pg||
nt|santyclz: The presumed @d shortage makes n's hand look like gold.|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D lead would be better aganst 1N, even tho declarer rates to have some|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: They did well enough to stay out of game, but even 3@H looks like it will fail|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, he convinced Passell that he only had 1 @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and which one would you lead?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: This lead gives them a chance -- transfers do help sometimes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: However, it does look like 3@C will power home-- still a 7 IMP loss|pg||
pc|s8|nt|joest: the slow boat but they got there|pg||
nt|joest: one of the black tens|pg||
nt|007 joosth: club is best i think|pg||
nt|kirp:  Cant trust these guys|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|joest: not if dummy has AJ8x and declarer has Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: spade is safer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not when you change the 7 and 8?|pg||
nt|joest: i guess a straightforward line is jump, hook the heart, test the spades and fall back on the diamond hook|pg||
nt|barnets: he may make 4@D 2@H a club and 2 spades now|pg||
nt|kirp:  4th best|pg||
pc|hA|nt|007 joosth: 3C with Jxxxx  and now 2S on this very strong hand     how can partner guess it all the time?|pg||
nt|friggi: regardless Kit|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT call looks fine to me -- choice of minors|pg||
nt|friggi: after this action?|pg||
nt|friggi: still @Dðs|pg||
nt|friggi: no way|pg||
nt|friggi: as you call it in USA - a blind shoot|pg||
nt|ady: did 1@D opening promise this sort of strengh?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|kirp:  Looks like 10 trix for declarer, unless we now strip and endplay N|pg||
nt|kit: Now club to ace, pass 10 of clubs, and no second diamond loser|pg||
nt|kirp:  See, no problem, its an easy game|pg||
nt|kit: I am informed that if Boyd had bid 1@H it would have denied 4 spades|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|kit: no -- but Boyd isn't selling to 2@S with a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: slow down guys  i'm still trying to decide if Wold should shift to @C at trick 3|pg||
nt|barnets: so this board was a triumphfor 4th from your longest and strongest|pg||
nt|eamongall: 0.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kirp:  Other possibility is to go for some sort of endplay on 3rd trump|pg||
nt|kit: wrong idea here|pg||
nt|kirp:  certainly gives N more problems|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|kit: Now defense gets the diamond trick|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|007 joosth: 1S is ok i think.   no need to prempt here when you have both majors|pg||
pc|s6|nt|007 joosth: show up squeeze i think for -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  ignorance is bliss    in our auction  Bates KNEW  Boyd had @H stoppers|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: big swing at this point in match|pg||
nt|warrens:  that works, but he might play for @S to come in and just play on trumps.  he doesn't know if Passell had Ax or not|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kirp:  Neither N or S knew E had 5@Cs|pg||
nt|ady: how can 2NT be a good bid  there is a good lay out to make a 3 level contract  and 18 hcp opposite  which he did not know?|pg||
nt|kit: he does know about the 18 HCP from the way the bidding went -- and if he can't make something, opponents can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: It is almost always wrong to sell out at 2-level with shortness in their suit|pg||
nt|ady: yes   1NT from north more like it   then Boyd can compet   I think as it went  a risky enterprise|pg||
nt|kit: particularly with none vul, when down 1 is only 50|pg||
nt|kit: passing 2@S riskier than bidding 2NT IMO|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: That is betting that 2@S and 3 of a minor are both down -- I don't like that bet|pg||
nt|ady: any chance of a stakc for a penalty of 300 or 500 when partner is weaker and cards not so well placed?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: yes. Bates will know he is down seconds before the hand is over|pg||
nt|kit: do you really think opponents will be able to double on this auction?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kirp:  now endplay coming up|pg||
nt|kit: But still chances on and end-play|pg||
nt|kit: He will try jack of hearts now, hoping for K10 doubleton in East hand|pg||
nt|kit: When that doesn't work, queen of spades, spade ruff, exit in hearts, and West is end-played|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then the match is very close again|pg||
nt|joest: Woolsey will take the lead here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|007 joosth: well  really unlucky for EW|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: as long as east knew|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and very slim with them stopping in 2|pg||
nt|ady: where I come from yes|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: an overtrick appears, cutting loss to 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Kit, that way he can find out if @S's break before @C's are played|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: finding the endplay   rubbing salt in the wound?|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: wooo hooo  only lose 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a difference a lead makes|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|psyck: wow, Lynch bid 2@d on the balancing x other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kit: she expected some diamond support I guess -- remember, they play Precision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: aah, more understandable with limited prec hand|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: Not obvious how to play this -- should Lair go for spades or hearts for bulk of tricks?|pg||
nt|psyck: will just play @s from top now|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like it should go down on repeated @D leads|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: 4 spades, 1 heart, 2 diamonds, 1 club will see him home|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|barnets: looks like  4 spades 1 heart  2daimonds and 1 club|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|warrens:  right, defense can only get 5 tricks in.  the clubs disappear.|pg||
nt|kit: Going after hearts needs basically jack of hearts onside|pg||
nt|psyck: catering to Hx ot 33 in @s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hayden: "I don't know whether to say yay or nay ... whether you needed that for 2N or ..." Lair: "only I know"|pg||

nt|andyv:  so far a good set for Westheimer|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome back|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after this board EW should have the lead again|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d is not the world's best contract but it seems like it deserved a better fate than 1100 minus|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes  sorry    its the other team|pg||
nt|kirp:  its 14-10 after 10 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but movie says 7|pg||
nt|kit: Effective 4@S save in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and finally some breathing room for Kasle  with 5 boards left to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet-another-1@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are players on break?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Maybe upgrade to 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is better for operator to keep old hand visible until players remove new cards from the board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not even sure worth 14-16 NT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|007 joosth: 800 would have been standard?|pg||
nt|joest: well in top tricks you have 5 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts so I would hope to limit it to 500|pg||
nt|santyclz: We've seen some quality bridge to this point.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: KnR calls it 12.30  [i didn't think they'd downgrate that much, but knew not 14]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Hopefully to a stable connection|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jon Wittes|pg||
nt|joest: Bates bidding 4@s where Woolsey settled for 3 next door|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed but thats after you know how well the hearts behave|pg||
nt|joest: rosenberg will bid 5@d as well I would imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i cant imagine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3 sure tricks in defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: interesting bidding in other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  a real 18 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 1N|pg||
nt|ady: nice save in OR    4@SX     e/w can make 11 tricks   may have been difficult to gauge|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- 270 -- still 7 IMPs|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  precision 1@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably for the majors|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  " sure"  :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute EW ended up in @S after South opened 1@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jwit: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  i give up|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW need to stay low with this misfit...probably 2@s|pg||
nt|kirp:  hard to figure|pg||
nt|baldfriede: would not be my choice, especially with that @s suit E has|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if really 2@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what year is this?|pg||
nt|kit: I'm stunned that Robinson didn't open multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@Hs  is possible by EW, hard to bid maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: KnR hates Jacks and @CKQ isn't worth nearly the 5 points Walter the Walrus would assign|pg||
mb|d|nt|kirp:  2@C a range/major ask|pg||
nt|kit: first seat, favorable -- what more can he want?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i said that about you earlier in the weak Kit  when 1st seat  favorable  you passed with  @SKQJ9x  @HTxxx (22)|pg||
nt|ady: do they play the multi as 5 major  and a minor?|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd trying to figure out what sort of a hand Robinson could have and not open multi|pg||
nt|kit: no -- a weak 2|pg||
nt|kit: doesn't show a minor|pg||
nt|ady: usually 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|kit: but who cares about minors when you have spades?|pg||
nt|kit: at this vul, 5 more often than 6|pg||
nt|ady: but usually a 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use opening 2@S as more constructive than 2@D|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S is 10-13 6-card suit|pg||
nt|kit: full opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: and 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 4S likely contract here|pg||
nt|joest: Well now we'll see if Cohen can hold down the carnage a bit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: playing with a Cohen  I would expect some more law|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished|pg||
nt|kit: Not exactly sure what 2NTis|pg||
nt|kit: But great decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|kit: if Lynch bids 3@H, Passell might shoot out game|pg||
nt|kirp:  was the 2@D dble penalty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: after a club switch, Cohen has major problems getting back to his hand (if he really wants to try for a spade ruff)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I would expect 2D|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may not even bid his @hs and settle for 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well they will be higher i'm afraid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: KnR says South worth 18.95|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think boyd had a bid specifically with game force, 4@H and no @S stop|pg||
nt|chip: not clear|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kirp:  Easy to bid???|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Should be no problem for declarer|pg||
nt|irwinbo: cards sit nicely|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the roof comes down if he tries to play on clubs|pg||
nt|kit: and even greater by Bates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about 2N   :(    you stole my bid AND i have max?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: a messy auction :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Levin in deep thought.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wd|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have guessed well to go to 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and a good spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe he can discard a spade on a heart|pg||
nt|joest: double dummy he could make it now|pg||
nt|joest: flies ace plays one round of diamonds then works clubs|pg||
nt|joest: spade ruff, etc.|pg||
nt|kit: It normally would not be right to go to 5-level with each having xx in spades, but it sure was this time.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women's USA2 Final  set 1 of 6   thru 12 boards  dead even|pg||
nt|kit: and with the very lucky heart lie it looks like it will make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: perhaps, but I think can make game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentator from other room confirmed  they really played 2@S|pg||
nt|warrens:  also helps that all the high spades are onside|pg||
nt|kirp:  too bad, it looks like 500|pg||
nt|chip: seems N didn't think it was penalty.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kirp:  Should go down on spade ruff|pg||
nt|kirp:  Cant tell what range of NTs they are playing, a bit surprised by 2N after opening 1n|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using the stayman sequence to show 5@S invite frees up 1N-2@H//2@S-2N for artificial sequences|pg||
nt|kit: Note in other room -- North opened 2@S, East bid 3@H, and South psyched a 4@C call -- hard for opponents to get to 5@H after that|pg||
pc|dK|nt|007 joosth: why that silly 9?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok it just dont hurt|pg||
nt|007 joosth: just 1 trick maybe  haha.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: now the 5 is a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surprised by 1N    SHOCKED by 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roman Club players    1N=18-20|pg||
nt|kirp:  15+->18- on their card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chip  what do you think of Kozloves balancing DBL vs 1@S?|pg||
nt|chip: either is reasonable.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like time to benefit from 22 trump and 33@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead helped too|pg||
nt|kirp:  this hand is alll about 2 trump losers at most|pg||
nt|kit: one heart play from dummy and won't be 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|kit: and ace of hearts known to be onside after queen of spades opening lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  continuing spades may hold him to 4|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, won't be more than 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|santyclz: If they force dummy twice, the 2nd @h loser reappears.|pg||
nt|kirp:  notice i said 'may' not 'will'|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|kirp:  any roaman club players left in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "multi" may not have had as large an impact|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but you never know unless you try|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who just arrived, the score shown is not accurate...no result for board 37 and board 36 has been misscored.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: total tricksters will translate all of that good stuff into 3@S going down a bunch|pg||
nt|kit: now cross to the diamond, lead a heart, and hand falls into place|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: i was just thinking if NOT sitting for a conversion/DBL from Kasle that more consistent to reopen with 1@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: have to pick up the diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: needed TWO @S ruffs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jwit: Could have lost as many as 5 tricks in this contract with a different layout, but everything lies well for declarer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: plaing the J would have been ok|pg||
nt|007 joosth: tryiong clubs now i think|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|chick: and she might not do that|pg||
nt|joest: he is still going to telescope into a club development line for down 1|pg||
nt|kirp:  that looks better than spade play|pg||
nt|kit: if she tries for discards first, could get into trouble|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c5|nt|007 joosth: but alas for him   4-1|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kirp:  now there are defensive possibilties|pg||
nt|kirp:  didn't S show AKQ of @S on lead, A@H has to be right|pg||
pc|h9|nt|007 joosth: but finesseble|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: Roman was fun to play, but you didn't see it much in north america  ACBL banned much of the system|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: in the other USA2 "Quarter Final" [where only 2 matches]    thru board 41  Kasle leads Milner by 31|pg||
nt|andyv:  I believe 36 turned out to be a push|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  during auction  Boyd could easily have 1@S|pg||
nt|kit: Now should be safe as the cards lie|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: but i'm not sure about the play after @D lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: pointed out to me   if 2@S inv, then  pass with min  so 2N=2@S, MAX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so apologies to Chambers  about  my reaction to that call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the snowball effect of that one change really supports 4@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|007 joosth: al together Roosenberg will win 900 here i think|pg||
nt|joest: -200 to win 14|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some days are worse|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  so Woolsey would have 6 less imps|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|pc|s2|nt|Walddk1: Operator, 3NT+1 on board 1 was made by EW, not NS|pg||
nt|Walddk1: so the board is flat|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Do you know how to correct?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Players taking a break.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 37 may have been a push as both sides made 4@s (but didn't bid the game)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sounds right Andy|pg||
nt|ady: bu North went to 4@S eith the same 5 card suit after the 4@C  so there must have been some understanding  last hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good pressure bidding from both pairs there|pg||
nt|barnets: south led @S 10 v 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: oh I agree, bidding the game was a long shot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps  only 34 boards left to play|pg||
nt|kit: Two nice results by O'Rourke, and match suddenly tight|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  E had to not cover the 9@C on last hand lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: easier to bid south hand if the @S quacks located elsewhere|pg||
nt|kirp:  forget that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great lead Bruce!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kit: enterprising 2@S call by Boyd, but at favorable opposite a passed partner I like his odds.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at the open room auction  --   not sure what else he could lead   [thanks mike]|pg||
nt|kirp:  the dreaded @D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  S has a problem trying to describe her hand|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d-2@c is a difficult auction in Standard that requires a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h should not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C either 4-card limit raise  or   Game force    shame usbf can't require convention card submission :(|pg||
nt|kit: Another game in a 4-4 heart fit here|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  2N probably xfer to @d|pg||
nt|chick: 2N probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i do short hand better:)|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|joest: does a 2@d rebid show five?  Does 2 of a major show extras? etc.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes indeed I can recommend the Lawrnce book 2/1 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with the length  the @S honors wasted here  [term is trump poor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was Game Force @S raise  [jacoby]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think this 2@C has 4@H/@S only if 6+@C|pg||
nt|joest: yes he has a well thought out method in his book|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@H call is like a normal Q-bid|pg||
nt|kirp:  is dble here better than 3@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hackenbush: routine 4@s here, Westheimer's opening will have to come on one of the last 4 boards|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  2@D=5+|pg||
nt|joest: and then either 3@h followed by 3Nt or just 3NT directly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so   now we have to guess   was 3@H weaker or better than PASS|pg||
nt|kit: This is just asking for stopper I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is East to an upgrade for 1@C opener?    [and should Lynch bid 4@H instead of 3]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: EW slightly stole this one, though they will have to do some scrambling to make this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some play 2D as balanced   11/12  maybe only 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  this is like rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be  1@D isn't a real suit to support|pg||
nt|kit: No reason for Boyd not to lead a spade, and then it appears declarer will have no play.|pg||
nt|barnets: three different spades will beat it S109 or 5|pg||
nt|barnets: not the @SQ or @SA|pg||
nt|kit: Lynch too conservative here -- I think she should shoot out 4@H|pg||
nt|warrens:  a real underbid by East here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL was lead-direct|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E might play for a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: only in 2 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D works too|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|kit: A kib points out that if declarer wins and leads a spade back, North is in trouble on run of spades|pg||
nt|kit: But with declarer expecting 6 spades in South hand, that isn't going to happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how likely is that if Boyd can have 6@S|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec says win and play a spade back|pg||
nt|barnets: north is squeezed in minors if south cashes|pg||
nt|barnets: but dec expects 6 in south hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  especially playing precision|pg||
nt|kit: Partner could have Kxxx of hearts and out, and game would have real play|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H cant be worse than a finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lynch has bid EW weakest suit    will she lead it too?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: I was going to say she would need a safety play in diamonds, but doesn't look like she'll get the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: makeable |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for definition of duplicated values   see this NS combination|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jwit: Lead actually helps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then 2NT can be 13/14  gf  or  18/19|pg||
nt|kit: Need to cover jack of hearts to block suit|pg||
nt|kit: Now fourth round of hearts can potentially promote a trump trick|pg||
nt|ady: what difference   got 2 hearts and a ruff and A@D  |pg||
nt|kit: on 4th round of hearts, what does East ruff with?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 2@D didn't deny 4@H/@S  but 3@D did|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @h suit will provide one pitch so S should immediately play it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah  at rubber you'd rebid 2N instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Diams are friendly layout|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like only 9 trix|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C look tempting as possible source too|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: but Bates-Wold play precision so |pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead maybe  but N did not double 3H|pg||
nt|ady: well not the king or queen|pg||
pc|d4|nt|007 joosth: fine lead here|pg||
nt|joest: many pairs lead second highest from four small and so, apparently, does this north-south pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  if someone holds honor doubleton|pg||
nt|kit: I would be very surprised if Wold doesn't just assume spades are 6-1, so sets up long club|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  now can get to board with K@c to pitch other @c on @h|pg||
nt|barnets: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 19 points in the round suits but only 6 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kirp:  we need a probability chart of rthat vs @D play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer also factoring in @S33|pg||
nt|kit: has to be 9 to make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jwit: Trumps and spades both behave and 9 of clubs is a big card, so they should probably make this|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: where are Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley when we really need them?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: needs a little care now|pg||
nt|kit: In other room only 1@S overcall, but declarer didn't find the suicide squeeze|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D hook now |pg||
nt|barnets: see you all tomorrow for the final bye|pg||
nt|kit: no reason for her not to claim her 10 winners and go on to the next hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|007 joosth: 3NT maybe down i think|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd had right idea, but wrong execution|pg||
nt|kirp:  and thats all she'll take|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: if @D shift  does he duck or fly?   i think choice is just whether to lose a @D or lose a @H|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has no choice but to ruff with 9|pg||
nt|kit: Too late for suicide squeeze now, as a diamond shift after the run of the spades breaks it up.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|007 joosth: esp now|pg||
nt|kirp:  All in all, this is the first positive swing we've seen for NS here, EW have had most of it till now|pg||
nt|kirp:  he'll take|pg||
pc|hT|nt|warrens:  even with 3 rounds of clubs, still makes 4.  |pg||
nt|kit: and now she can make 5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: wonder if N considered the possibility of a club ruff|pg||
nt|kit: better to win king of hearts, cash king of spades, heart to 10|pg||
nt|warrens:  has she lost track of one of the @H honors?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: both kings onside for woolsey  --  not expected on this auction|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: defense appears headed to two spade tricks + 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 suit preference for @S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|warrens:  no, ok now|pg||
nt|kirp:  still ok with @Ds available|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: wold with 3 diamonds + 2 spades + 2 clubs + 1 hearts|pg||
nt|joest: he may well have to decide which hook to take|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess not|pg||
nt|kirp:  I think 33 is in the high 30's, dblton both honors adds about 4%, so we are over 40%. That seems better than dblton honour missing 7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Perhaps she lost track of the @dq.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  big swing on this board |pg||
nt|kirp:  no throw in to E, 6 trix|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: trump back was a good move, now she has a club trick|pg||

nt|kirp:  2c-2d-2s-3c=bad hand,  now what|pg||
nt|baldfriede: pass and pray|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree  flexible hands starting 2@C yield very complicated auctions|pg||
nt|kirp:  what's the hold-up?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: boys took break|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am not a fan of 2@d waiting bid after strong 2@c openings|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 24 imps   3 boards|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: curiously?|pg||
nt|kit: Here is their 2@S opening -- and maybe it will help them stay out of game|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a bit high   need good lay of  heart ace and king of clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: i could think of several reasons why one might not preempt :)|pg||

nt|kit: I don't know what North has available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same team playing 1N   there's a Mollo story in there somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  invite will get W to 3 and down quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Womens USA2 SemiFinal  3 to play  ALL TIED|pg||
nt|kit: But he made an unsuccessful game try, assuming no imaginative king of clubs lead|pg||
nt|kit: Wold will have to make this just to break even|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows 4, so Boyd will just bid 4@S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|joest: but it is in Kit's character to do so I would say|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure  but its nice when p knows what to lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  hehe|pg||
nt|kirp:  33 is 35.5% i am informed. dblton with 2 honours out of 6 cards, is 3 possibilities out of 64. Looks like around 40%.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Women USA1 Final  5 remaining   Moss over Sprung by 29|pg||
nt|ady: north flatish with some jacks that might be useless|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a Roland slam|pg||
nt|chick: much too good for Roland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's how Fantoni-Nunes play their 1-suit openings|pg||
nt|baldfriede: a shot in the dark which does not hit the target but winds up in the blue|pg||
nt|kirp:  Is W thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should have 11 or 12 @Hs, not 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wold needed to DBL to prevent Bates from thinking|pg||
nt|kirp:  Dbl might have encouraged Bates to bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but [rightly] feared they have a better spot|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hackenbush: too many losers to bid game, even vul, assuming 3@h is not a limit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i recall Drew claiming his regular partner Jim Krekorian convinced him that 2 aces opposite strong NT = GAME|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N showing 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: even if clubs behave Rosenberg has only eight tricks|pg||
nt|joest: he will needed to work diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: and will need to assume East has the ace, else he's just down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: true  but the disadvantage of the 2S is that maybe N will guess the clubs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: quickly with a diamond lead .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  ordinarily 8 hcp enough in this type of auction...but hcp are in Aces and E is berift of spot cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Senior USA1   5 to play  Schwartz +52 over Lynch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Lynch will get night off then play 60 board match vs winner here  to determine USA2|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  might be right:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson could have relayed with 2N to learn 6(322) and not 2 of top 3 honors  min/max|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Wold is 6-5 and might well have bid -- he was right passing, but could have been wrong.|pg||
nt|ady: can Boyd be any better for 2@S?|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- how about a singleton?|pg||
nt|ady: but not much better than 12 hcp?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hcp max  just one more jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-13 with 6@S and no side 4|pg||
nt|ady: and shows 6 card suit?|pg||
nt|kit: you can count HCP all you want, but it is distribution that makes the games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less hcp with more shape|pg||
nt|ady: with 6 card suit and outside singleton say 6-3-3-1   would not consider open 1 spade with 12 or 13?|pg||
nt|kit: Wold not sure what to play for here|pg||
nt|kit: His partner might have a stiff heart, but might be ruffing with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|kit: And this may be last time to put club through|pg||
nt|kit: so I think he will shift to a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well this helps   but still doesn't look like enough -- even if he'd unblocked @S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bad spade break wont hurt enuff on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 10 of hearts lead will help declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse hesitations --  the slow 5@H shows confidence|pg||
nt|kirp:  as Mike has only 3@Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  no dble at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NOT  1N opener with 5@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: a likely challenge|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks good at first glance of the dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  E may simply play @ss back to K and Q and lose an imp here|pg||
nt|joest: once spades are abandoned for sure the ace of diamonds resides in east|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if N guesses the clubs i think there may be an endplay at E|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce happy they aren't vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: may duck this lead in both hands|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: courtesy raise of 3@C from Wold [instead of original pass] would have been interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D2 attitude, not count  so he really likes @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you let dummy win now or later?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson did well with the diamond shift -- now declarer will have to discard a potential winner on the third round of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: or not at all!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: Bates better not duck this!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if @H2 was systemic or Passell|pg||

nt|ahollan1: lack of winners does seem to be an issue|pg||
nt|kirp:  is he thinking or gone for a break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thinking|pg||
nt|kirp:  i can see 6 sure winners, probably a 7th trick in the wash, |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: I dont see a way to make 9 tricks on this layout |pg||
nt|kit: And he might -- his partner could have stiff queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   win @D exit @S and declarer endplayed?|pg||
nt|kit: right -- I think that is the best idea|pg||
pc|c9|nt|007 joosth: the fast way:)|pg||
nt|joest: enough of that suit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: now an endplay with clubs:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: happier that 2N wasn't making|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  nope|pg||
nt|007 joosth: reat will be automatic?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jwit: trump lead would be great, but almost impossible to find|pg||
pc|c7|nt|007 joosth: rest|pg||
nt|kit: Good suit-pref 9 of spades discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bridge progression    read Clyde Love  and then there was a squeeze in every hand   read Kit's Partnership Defense and then there was suit preference in every card|pg||
pc|s2|nt|007 joosth: ok he doen not knao how many hearts E has|pg||
nt|007 joosth: does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just not sure if they play 1N forcing or semi-force|pg||
pc|cK|nt|007 joosth: know:):)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  so now have to guess @d to push board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: messing around|pg||
nt|joest: nor spades for that matter|pg||
nt|kit: King of clubs shift quite sensible -- if partner has Axx of clubs, only way to beat the contract|pg||
nt|kirp:  what was wrong with encouraging diamond?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: maybe needed to pound pards suit |pg||
pc|c6|nt|joest: at least not yet|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: but looks like Woolsey can be endplayed |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well AQ  diamonds are known|pg||
nt|007 joosth: endplay with a diamond?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  lots of work for  down 2 :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: usually it is the declarer who has the advantage, but this time it will be the defense -- 1NT down 1 at both tables|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|007 joosth: should be automatic indeed|pg||
nt|joest: i think a slight inference that bates has 4 hearts b/c not likely to switch to a low one from xxx|pg||
nt|joest: not cast iron|pg||
nt|ahollan1: players have worked very hard for such a low scoring set|pg||
nt|kit: Key at other table was could unblock the spades|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: declarer will take 1 shot at ruffing out queen of hearts, and will then take club finesse.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Time for a Joey Silver impression:  NEXT!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|007 joosth: this is ok  and safer|pg||

nt|kirp:  but a lot|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|barnets: iI thought that - I had a ? from a learned spectator|pg||
nt|kit: When I know what trumps are, I bid the suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hayden: "I didn't want to unilaterally bid 3N" then "3N is pretty good" Schermer - "3N is very good"|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfb: Maybe not for this pair though - Lair said "you could have had a huge hand with 4 hearts"|pg||

mb|4H|an|KCB !ds|mb|p|nt|barnets: too good|pg||
nt|psyck: with @d set as trump, with get to 6 now & make an o/t with finesse on|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h kickback?|pg||
nt|kit: I guess Lair intends 4@H as kickback, but Hayden might not think so|pg||
nt|warrens:  hayden must be thinking about showing the @C void (5@H, I would think)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I didn't see an alert by South, but did by North. Might have missed it by South though|pg||
mb|5H|an|2 + void?|nt|kit: Nothing wrong with that agreement, but you better have firm rules.  4 of previously bid major is often an offerto play.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: (Kickback is bidding the suit above the agreed suit as Roman Keycard Blackwood)|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, this had to be pretty clear, Kit, since 3@H would have been forcing)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair definitely said that 5@h showed 2 + Q so 4@h was Kickback|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@h even keycards with a void likely|pg||
nt|barnets: 7@H in closed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair and Hayden agree that 4@s would have been Keycard in hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: north south agreed hearts and keycarded|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, with @h set as trump, they did not know of the @dK ...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: south bid 5N|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: and north bid 6@D|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

mc|12|nt|barnets: a club was led v 7@H|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|joest: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3H?|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul should damper NS's hopes here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: finally a slam?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think passell @SA did protect against Kasle holding @DQ|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfe: Short break.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: responsive dbl first??|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like they missed slam in OR on this also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen-Ferguson have been posting some pretty good sets for a new partnership|pg||
nt|kirp:  wow, aggressive dble by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: Cohen has no good bid    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16    you just need to count using new math|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why i mentioned that   they were on defense this hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jwit: This contract doesn't rate to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stewart opened 1N=10-12 and described exact shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: have seen this hand make 4 hts but e/w were only in 2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Leading club to king is tiny bit better since doesn't lose to stiff queen -- to play North for queen, must run jack first round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N might be start of short suit game try|pg||
nt|kit: Bates taking a scientific approach -- I would expect him to just bid game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=17-18   [i think 19 opens 2N]|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  N has too much defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 10's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit is this   DBL = 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|santyclz: As expected the open room got to 4@h on 12, things have tightened up.|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like relatively easy 6@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: sure almost a double|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1 quickly|pg||
nt|ady: lead obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not|pg||
nt|ady: as said all boils down to club guess|pg||
nt|kit: I guess so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might talk Bates out of super accept|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1N opener  that DBL can also be 1-suit @C or @D|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N plays reasonably well, spade lead would have been best |pg||
nt|kit: this contract could be close, but will probably make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier after 3@H rebid now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if 3@D ....|pg||
nt|kirp:  is 2@D GF?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@D game force  then i prefer 2N rebid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kirp:  Cant see them missing slam here|pg||
nt|kirp:  but still 9 trix, assuming you get clubs right|pg||
nt|kirp:  agree with u|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  those who think down 2 are optomists or pessimists|pg||
nt|kirp:  E knows Kx in @Cs is great|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my favorite online toy  Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator  says East worth 13.65   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
mb|4N|nt|007 joosth: diff lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade i guess|pg||
nt|kirp:  KCB? or Invitational?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other ways to invite -- no other ways to get to RKC @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: S will reason that N is broke|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok almost:)|pg||
nt|joest: i like that reasoning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit  haven't seen 3rd seat opener with 4 AND extra values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RKC|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: can't on drugs be an option?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he also knows too many points in reds|pg||
nt|kit: North doesn't figure to have a small singleton club, as with that he might shift to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  always is, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been easier for East if Bates could complete his shape|pg||
nt|ady: will be almost impossible to get decent count|pg||
nt|kit: So on that basis, I think declarer should get it wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room auction very similar except here we didn't know North's minor until the opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and not a good lead for the defense|pg||
nt|kit: No, looks like it allows a make|pg||
mb|5N|nt|joest: i had a feeling the the ten was coming|pg||
nt|baldfriede: undo|pg||
nt|kirp:  E is now trying to backtrack on his 14-16hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final set supposed to start in about 10 minutes    color me skeptical|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when no @CK or @DK  Kasle will settle for 6@H|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: nice lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought he'd try Jack   just to confirm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just wondering if Kasle grand slam try would be 5@S or 5N|pg||
nt|kirp:  which K?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note  if Kozlove had @SAKQxx he might have bid 7 right away|pg||
nt|kirp:  6@D showed 1 K|pg||
nt|chip: not sure what difference would be, or even if they knew what 5S is.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the key is that 5N isn't demand for specific information as much as showing interest in grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when the responder has undisclosed extra playing strength he just jumps to 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this shows how useless   of kings is  --  Kasle needs to know WHICH|pg||
nt|kirp:  Assuming 5@S asked for specific cards, then 5N was a general try|pg||
nt|kirp:  and yes, he wanted to know which K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet   Kasle is the one who is thinking|pg||
nt|kirp:  But @S K is maybe too high!!|pg||
nt|chip: Well, it is hard to bid too much here.|pg||
nt|kirp:  In OR on 28, NS played in 4@Hs , again no dble, small loss only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news -- worst case  this is 50% slam   and it happens to make|pg||
nt|kirp:  7NT can go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7N not in the picture  -- it's 6@H or 7@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs asking if Kozlove should have shown 2 keycards + void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Chip can confirm    i think only show void IF  1) partner knows which void  2) known that the void is useful|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: still thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|nt|007 joosth: spade again|pg||
nt|kit: should be able to take 2 spades, 1 heart, 4 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|kirp:  played N for K@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: auction seemed to scream    lead trump THEN look at your hand|pg||
nt|kit: He figures to guess hearts, so will take 6 hearts and 3 diamonds to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kirp:  whatever the auction, 6@S looks solid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|007 joosth: trying not to be endplayed|pg||
nt|kit: Also North has 2 spades, South 3 -- another argument for playing North for longer clubs, hence queen.|pg||
nt|kit: Now 2 hearts, making it easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that lead gives declarer even more options|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks unlucky for Lynch, @D lead would have put them to the te|pg||
nt|kirp:  st in 6 H, but not 7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jwit: This should fail by 2 or 3 tricks, but NS can probably make a part score, so no disaster|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bruce should try the @h finesse even though his sure it won't work|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems dropping K of H is last chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well credit Wold for upgrading his hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  which means O'Rourke is now in the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry missed a pass--contract is 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Kathy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: robbins didn't bid|pg||
nt|kirp:  think you can take 4 @C trix|pg||
nt|kit: Many would not have made a takeout double on Boyd's hand, but passing can be just as dangerous -- would not have gotten to game if he had passed.|pg||
nt|kirp:  Boyd's action i think won this board|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kirp:  actual score is 27-21|pg||
nt|chip: this lead gives extra options, complicates the play.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wold wasn't listening as hard|pg||
nt|ady: hardly conclusive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what inferences might Kozlove make by failure of Lynch to lead trump?|pg||
nt|kirp:  6Â¨D bid in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe i should say    they caught up?????|pg||
nt|kirp:  this lead slows this hand even further|pg||
nt|warrens:  he'd like to ruff 1 @S and see if the Queen drops third, then fall back on the @D finesse, but he doesn't have the entries for that|pg||
nt|chip: He could try for 13 on a crossruff: 8 trumps, AK, A, AJ in the side suits.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: with 1 to play in the set  Kasle 100  Milner 69   winner of that match plays winner of this match tomorrow in USA2 "Semi-Final"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just not enough with only one board remaining|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: holding @DQ  the shift seems surprising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course  he too may expect Chambers to hold 5@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead in other room was killer|pg||
nt|joest: not a comfortable pitch here for cohen|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jwit: Of course, diamonds would have been a better contract for EW, or even spades.|pg||
nt|kit: not conclusive, but makes it more likely North has queen of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one hint   Robinson had 2@S but did not make takeout dbl     [i'm really reaching]|pg||
nt|kit: Really little else to go on -- possession of queen of clubs wouldn't be enough to give either North or South a callon this auction|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: @D10 probably makes it tougher for declarer|pg||
nt|joest: Wold playing this great so far|pg||
nt|007 joosth: for the moment S problem is over|pg||
nt|007 joosth: should play 7|pg||
nt|joest: on the heart lead was it down one trivially?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: otherwise he is down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe N should have played the T  easy from here|pg||
nt|joest: if he holds off the queen, cohen will have to give him a red trick |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i don't think anything was trivial about the play at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: cos winning the heart queen and shooting a club up is a strong start for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @CQ was allowed to win|pg||
nt|joest: at teh risk of repetition: Eddie has played this well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when Stewart then attacked @D it was all over|pg||
nt|joest: ic|pg||
nt|joest: and clubs were abandoned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Jack says  Wold playing this well -- honestly this is 2nd time i've seen all 4 hands and still don't now how to declare it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Wold did well indeed,  but I think N missed a chance by not playing the T of diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Joost  then @Dx from Cohen and Wold is on a guess|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh -- he is getting itwrong|pg||
nt|chip: Well, so much for the crossruff.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jwit: Did well to get out for down 1|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kirp:  their notes say 4-card majors n 3/4 position|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: and ruffing out @SQ|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|kit: oddly enough the club lead vs. 7@H which gives up a trick may cause declarer to go down, as now he has alternate lines of play other than the diamond finesse.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, not 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checl local start times  using http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe non trump lead  convinced kozlove to abandon cross ruff??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lynch certainly not overbidding this hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: Women's USA2 Final [96 boards] will start then too|pg||
nt|kit: Wold hoping opponents stay in notrump, but he will be disappointed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: 4@S easy, an overtrick on the expected heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|joest: my prediction wasn't so hot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some science in play here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always feels wrong bidding AFTER opp have exchanged info|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H bid and made in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  this is last board of the afternoon session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 2 hours 45 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N might have done better to bid 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  will someone explain this sequence|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson likely will compete to 3@S, which appears to make on favorable heart suit despite 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it had to be pointed out to me     another hand where same team played 1N in both rooms   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  typo     1 hour 45|pg||
pc|d6|nt|007 joosth: a light opener. maybe getting to high now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could come home, but not enough imps |pg||
pc|dA|nt|jwit: South did well not to double. Knowledge of bad trump break might have given declarer a fighting chance.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good lead for defense|pg||
nt|joest: i can't leave AKxx of hearts unbid.  If they double me, I apologize I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack if it makes you feel any better   i made same prediction 40 minutes ago|pg||
nt|007 joosth: haha|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW open lighter than most|pg||
nt|kirp:  so W is catering to light OB|pg||
nt|ady: club start  amd diamond return should beat 3@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  S can afford to lose 2@s and a @c|pg||
nt|chick: will lose only one of each on this lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here is there opportunity|pg||
nt|hackenbush: potential pickup for Westheimer here, open room stopping in 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: I agree -- I think Wold should get right out there with 3@C-- and if he had, he might have stolen the pot|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N makes easily here, clubs 33 and k@D onside|pg||
nt|kirp:  E is endplayed at trick 1|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very bad hand for 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|007 joosth: glad I did not say a word:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N goes down on @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're pretty normal for context of big club system|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: the USA2 Senior matches are 60 boards   USA1 Senior Final is 90    Women are playing 96 board matches now  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 bracket = undefeated teams   USA2 = 1 loss  [so lose again, go home]|pg||
nt|pef: sorry Joanne Sprung|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 17-19|pg||
nt|friggi: sry router problem|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us....final set of this segment to start in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what a lead...|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a chance now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW haven't played much together  otherwise Ferguson might have just tried 2N|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little too deep for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe thinking Casen could bid this way with 1435 and singleton @SQ/J ??|pg||
nt|andyv:  still a pretty deep position to take.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a lead that isn't??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D fairly passive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is this an auction that calls for passive lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew still stunned by the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem is augmented by the holding of 10x with the K, blowing the whole suit apart for the defense if you are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit   i wouldn't have counted either of the last 2 hands the way Wold did|pg||
nt|kirp:  that may still beat it|pg||
nt|kirp:  but its now closer than you might think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N would have been interesting|pg||
nt|kit: spade king on doesn't hurt either|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: Cohen with a surpised winner |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|joest: in any event it is going to prove to be an expensive pass resulting in a double game swing|pg||
nt|kirp:  Made only 3S in other room, so not clear cut. Looks like N is vulnerable to endplays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Schermer's hand too good to beat 3N|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  and you can be sure that lead will not be duplicated at other table|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer needs to unblock the @s, but aFTER THAT THERE ARE NO MORE ENTRIES TO DUMMY|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming @S worth 5 tricks -- what's best try for  9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe immediate guess of @C10?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Think he'll play for something good to happen in @Ds and@Ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @D7 could have been from 87x|pg||
nt|kirp:  N coul have lead from 3 or 4 small @Ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right  or 87xx|pg||
nt|warrens:  this really is a friendly layout|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: no, wrong|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries and W known to be long in 2 other suits, lead the 10 and run it|pg||
nt|kit: We can see it is cold with diamond finesse, but remember declarer can't see that|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the biggest swing of the session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but IF [keyword] you expect a better hand in West   what does partner hold  and which lead works for that holding|pg||
nt|kirp:  Poor pass. So 6 more imps to Kasle to lead by 34, 30 of which coul dhave been recovered if the 'lucky' grand slam went down|pg||
nt|kirp:  thx all and cu in Toronot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: there goes that option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15 boards remain in this match to see who plays 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch |pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Once again this hand shows the value of the strong hand being declarer -- defense doesn't know where the high cards are|pg||
nt|kirp:  2@H may look like a @D entry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hackenbush: can't really go wrong here, clubs 5-2 and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest: O'Rourke will finish with 13 more and take the lead at the half|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok  almost:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not same auction either|pg||
pc|c4|nt|007 joosth: as I said N might be advised to read the book of the other Cohen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: why a heart to the Q    KJxx might be in N to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 44  Bates did double 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: did he need to either  hook @C  or  reverse dummy|pg||
nt|kit: If Wold knew the hand he could have attacked diamonds in time|pg||
nt|kit: no way declarer did that|pg||
nt|kit: He will be thinking that East may have king of diamonds and be looking for endplay|pg||
nt|chip: yes, that is what crossruff.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  gtg...bye all!|pg||
nt|kit: or is there?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i admit unable to ignore seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my plan was for Wold to think longer at trick 1|pg||
nt|chip: means.|pg||
mc|10|nt|007 joosth: 1 tr back again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke team has playes extremely well this set|pg||
nt|007 joosth: harte now would be fine|pg||
nt|007 joosth: heart|pg||
pg||
