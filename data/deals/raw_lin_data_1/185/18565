mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: This may die in 1NT.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: seems like only last year this event began :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: north, who has held boring cards, now excited|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Hi, I'm Mary Smith, hope we have a commentator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: north sighs|pg||
nt|jcwla: A DSI double it would be but none forthcoming so 2@H the spot.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pef: a bit surprising north didn't double, but joel was a third hand opener and it is imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: Still it was a 1-opener and I don't think S is the most apt to get frisky in this context.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|d2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcwla: With the @D count S could safely duck the @DK later but with @CJ coming down doubleton in either case not a major factor here.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: e/w perhaps can make 4 spades despite the lack of hcp, but unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|jcwla: A Gabrage Stayman hand here for E who is delighted to hear 2@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Peter do you know the EW 1NT range?|pg||
nt|pef: I believe it is 15-17, but I'll check|pg||
nt|jcwla: 14-16 I'm told, thanks.|pg||
nt|pef: ah, ok|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: I certainly agree with bidding 1NT so long as the hand is within the agreed range.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sometimes you hear people say "But you have an easy 1@S rebid" - so often that is not the case.|pg||
nt|pef: not sure if I like 1nt on that hand anyway with the 4252 shape, but some believe in opening 1nt whenever it's even barely conceivable|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ron says he showed 22-23|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|s6|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d2|pc|s3|nt|pef: since she knows hearts are 3-3, I'm quite a bit surprised she returned a club|pg||
nt|tez: 1 imp..,its important in tem match|pg||
mc|10|nt|pef: while likely the opening 1nter had the k of diamonds, so what?|pg||
nt|tez: team|pg||
nt|jcwla: The "give unto Caesar" card.  But here it allowed Balderson to carry out her plan.|pg||
pg||

mb|1S|nt|mikam1: Best not to get too high|pg||
mb|d|nt|mikam1: Tough rebid problem for West after 1@H-2@D|pg||
mb|2S|an|weakest raise; <7 HCP|nt|mikam1: Tempting to bid 4@C splinter, especially playing Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: if that's what 4@C would mean|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4C|nt|mikam1: or the simple route|pg||
nt|drg: on one hand, 6@D is missing 2 keycards if you can find that out given the club void, but on the other, 6@D is pretty much on a finesse, so it's not that bad a spot|pg||
nt|mikam1: likely 4@C here|pg||
nt|mikam1: I don't see what else Pollack can bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: east thinking|pg||
nt|drg: she might just try 3NT, it's an awkward position|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, Rozanne Pollack is an excellent player and "careful" too....by that I mean speedwise|pg||
nt|mikam1: 3N just feels "wrong"...although it could be right on some hands|pg||
nt|mikam1: hard to defend the action when partner has no spade stop and you lose the first 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drg: partner didn't splinter in spades though, so a singleton isn't that likely|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well you were right David|pg||
nt|drg: the spade splinter is safer than the club splinter|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|drg: west can't really pull given how long it took her to bid 3NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mikam1: This is a tough declarer play problem|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe the heart finesse is correct|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|drg: indeed a hard problem. The heart finesse seems like the only way to make it on this layout|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|drg: declarer finished now, will lose the clubs when taking the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|mikam1: This won't work|pg||
nt|mikam1: right David|pg||
pc|c5|nt|drg: but the play seems reasonable|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'm still not sure what was right...it does seem reasonable|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|drg: The winning line was a heart finesse or diamonds from hand, followed by ducking 2 clubs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|mikam1: Problem with the spade play is that South would quickly rise when they have the diamond king|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||

nt|pef: of course at this stage everyone is probably getting more than a little bit tired|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well N and W could make beautiful music here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|tez: i bet it will not end at 4@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|peachy: One of Benito Garozzo's "rules" says one must have agood reason not to lead trump|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfj: real slow 3h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|puncher99: east worried about spades|pg||
nt|peachy: The club values though good in isolation, have lost their luster|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: west thinks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: you were right|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@s quickly at the end|pg||
nt|pef: vul. with partner probably having a yarborough on this auction?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|puncher99: non trump lead usually means honor is offsides|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: can he resist?|pg||
nt|tez: i know we are vuln..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: I'|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Levin's wafer thin raise kept NS out of @H - but fairly astounding that W settled for a GT with a red bonus at stake.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|peachy: I've been reminded it was lustre (luster is a person who, hm, er, lusts)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pef: that I certainly agree with.  vul at imps a game try is to bid game and try to make it, especially on a hand like west|pg||
nt|pef: by guess is that this is going down 1 which will bring the match back to a 1-1 tie|pg||
nt|tez: i belive my partner has every time 1 quick trick:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|tez: nice try|pg||
nt|tez: but not enuf|pg||
nt|pef: floating the 7 might have worked better, but that would require very good vision :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s8|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|tez: play @s|pg||
nt|tez: kill to dummy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pef: well considering she had three losers already and the ace of trumps was out, making this was going to be difficuilt|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfj: says if there down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: big swing|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: You may be right David|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mikam1: Another slam here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mikam1: 6@C is best - 7@C is possible|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|drg: 6@C is a great spot, may be hard to find after this start|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|drg: 2@S probably a game try inquiry, and 3N likely showed a balanced max with 3|pg||
nt|mikam1: This looks difficult|pg||
nt|mikam1: They never mentioned the key suit|pg||
nt|mikam1: Tough lead here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mikam1: Not that that matters really|pg||
nt|drg: the lead doesn't seem to matter on this layout|pg||
nt|drg: declarer may have to run this to the J|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think as long as West is careful....this will not make|pg||
nt|drg: if west had held the T@S there may be a winning line, but as east has it and the J is doubleton, I don't think declarer can make|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
nt|drg: 6@C making at the other table, well done there|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder who should have bid clubs|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps even at the end South could have bid 5N if that was "pick a slam"|pg||
nt|drg: The auction from the other room doesn't look all that helpful, it was not recorded correctly|pg||
nt|mikam1: Although cases can be made for either player to bid clubs at other turns|pg||

nt|mikam1: true|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|drg: after 1NT, a GF checkback should reveal the club fit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|mikam1: Was quite reasonable to duck at trick one...simplified the hand to a heart finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: Good result for Joel here.|pg||
nt|pef: perhaps, although with the ace of clubs lead it can be beaten 2 fairly easily|pg||
nt|pef: ace of clubs, either red suit, club ruff, other red suit, club ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfj: no swing here|pg||
nt|pef: I know it's hard to be objective, but who leads their stiff ace?|pg||
nt|tez: why not @c ace|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: SDAM Six Diam Always Makes|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pef: I meant that as a question to the panel, a suggestion that it woulod be a bad lead|pg||
nt|tez: you need @c king and another ace|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: English is a funny language.  In fact, I would have led the club ace|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: this is an excellent contract, 6NT probably making also on a squeeze|pg||

nt|tez: i have baby english..sry for that:)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|d7|nt|jcwla: Well, a certain many time world champion led the @CA and has written up +100 which as I said some minutes ago is a good result for her team.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|mc|10|nt|eok: The reason 4S was only one down is that E carefully cashed the HA to see whether the lead was indeed a singleton. W  discouraged so she switched back to clubs. |pg||

nt|drg: and trying to squeeze them|pg||
nt|drg: any other winning layout will give east the Q@S|pg||
nt|drg: barring a very unlikely Q doubleton of diamonds|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|drg: Set almost even again|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mikam1: I think North will raise to 2 and South will make a game try|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: And North will accept|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|drg: 4 clear losers in spades|pg||
nt|mikam1: I guess 3@S was not a try|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mikam1: But they've done well here not to bid it|pg||
nt|mikam1: On the lie of the cards anyway|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'm a bit surprised South didn't try for game|pg||
pc|h3|nt|drg: only 22 HCP between them.  it's worse than the spade finesse, sometimes the club ruff isn't with the bare ace of trumps and sometimes you can't avoid the 3rd club loser|pg||

nt|pef: at the other table they did sort of make a takout double over the weak 2 bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: north doing a lot of bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: and vals hand would normally be an acceptance|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pef: 2d multi was opened and the defense they were playing was that 2h was a t/o double of hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pef: that led to 3 clubs down 3.  west might have doubled opposite partner's vulnerable weak 2, but some people open multi on anything, even vul.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well, putting 7 points in pd's hand to go with your 12 (four of which are in @H) makes 19.  The other suits - esp @S (though you do have 4) are not compelling.  I think the pass ...|pg||

nt|mikam1: Michael, would you have bid over 4@H with East's hand?|pg||
nt|mikam1: David, would you?|pg||
nt|scotty: West would have pulled the double in this room - after 2@c.  Not so clear after 1 (natural)@c, when partner can have more defense|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think I would have|pg||
nt|drg: probably not, I only have 7 tricks in clubs and there's no guarantee partner has spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|pef: for what it's worth I agree with her pass|pg||

nt|jcwla: What don't you like about it?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pef: it's not that's it's bad or even wrong, just too many times partner has hearts and you get a situation like this where you miss a game|pg||

nt|fabsayc: does it really matter they were mislabeled, if the same at both tables|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose the laws define what vulnerabilities are in each board number and the game cannot be played with boards that are not "legal", I am just guessing of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if it takes away a good result and replaces with a worst one, i have a feeling this entire match may go to commitee|pg||
nt|peachy: in any case, it is prob good that any discrepancies/mixups are resolved before match continues, to have accurate current score|pg||

nt|mikam1: Actually, Westheimer has slightly the best of the missing two boards - they could be pushes, but they could also be small gains|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: bathroom break|pg||
nt|mikam1: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: director took some bds to look at|pg||

pc|cT|nt|pef: this is going to take a lot of work to make.  it may not even be possible|pg||
nt|pef: the straightforward line would be to rely on the diamond finesse but we can see that that fails|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pef: the only route to success would seem to be to use both heart entries to ruff clubs and then be lucky that the doubleton heart was with the stiff spade|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you are :)|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm|pg||
nt|pef: north bid 2n unusual.  sokolow doesn't much like her diamond suit, but it does seem right to do something with the north hand|pg||
nt|pef: so this hand might win those 8 imps right back|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: action|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S looks cold but is not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: trump best?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: breathing can cost too|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: trump is certainly possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamonds wicked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the alternative is tap declarer if possible and duck diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chambers must think lead could be from KJ10xxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: this was made in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is why i like jack denies, and for sure in this situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: they say it costs but in 7 years has never hurt me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|pef: for the specs asking, it's not clear to me why sokolow doubled with only 2 spades either.  usually that double would be a good hand with heart shortness and the other three suits|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: this appears to be a better contract than 3nt simply because at worst it goes one down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pef: this will require a bit of care in the play, but only a bit|pg||
