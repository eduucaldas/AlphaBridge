pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||

nt|joest: this could be a swing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2NT maybe|pg||
nt|joest: if north-south play puppet stayman, they might land in 4@s|pg||
nt|joest: that should still fetch it looks like but its a bit harder than 3NT|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: E will never be on lead. so Kx of clubs stay protected|pg||
nt|joest: treating his hand as too big for an initial 2NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  on board 34, 5@c was made in OR, slicing the lead to 13 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: was a very poor effort|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h probably shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can understand it with so many controls|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing East bid 2@d instead of North|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  good guess Howard:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|joest: so they are playing puppet|pg||

nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=838&pid=607|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm guessing that 2@d was xfer to @hs showing a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that's more likely, if 2@c and 2@h not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Two diamonds was alerted by West but not by East.|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: as in other room no puppet here|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|joest: actually you can't determine that by a 3@s rebid :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed:)|pg||
nt|joest: so this presents the ninth trick but the contract is always cold just by keeping east off lead, for overtricks even|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades may even make 5   she will probably make 4 hearts here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not the lead at 4S  :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: could have doubled 3@D, 3@H was a bit much|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 9 tricks for the taking|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand does not merit much thought, are we still here|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think she is worried about a 4-1 heart break andbeing tapped in dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck one heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|chick: are we stuck or is S thinking?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: not necissarily bad however, EW can make 4@H|pg||

pc|sT|nt|Vugraphzfe: Pollack was thinking.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  W still has @c loser so making 2 seems to be the most likely outcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, make that a @h loser now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: no more club loser, but now a heart loser|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  that play doesn't make much sense|pg||
nt|chick: not unreasonable play, since there was a ruff, entirely possible the J will fall now-doubleton|pg||
nt|chick: the club was a sure loser|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought W would finesse for J@h|pg||

nt|joest: but if he makes a 'responsive double' or some such they are probably headed to 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: 5@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p!|nt|joest: takes teh pressure off partner which is always appreciated|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: club finesse is needed  after that at least 9 tricks|pg||

nt|007 joosth: well  he may be right:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing Eddie leads a @d|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||
nt|joest: 4 hearts + 4 diamonds + 1 club = 9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when it's about avertricks he can better start clubs immediately|pg||
nt|007 joosth: overtricks    i think:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: partnerships differ about whether 2NT is Lebensohl after a 2@d opener|pg||

nt|007 joosth: In the Netherlands almost everybody plays multi,  so I don't know|pg||
nt|joest: Bates may be asking himself: "do we play Lebensohl here"?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hope he asked it before|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is possible that they do and that Wold follows up with 3@h over a forced 3@c rebid showing four hearts in a NT hand and offering a choice of games|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Welcome back|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after this board EW should have the lead again|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d is not the world's best contract but it seems like it deserved a better fate than 1100 minus|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes  sorry    its the other team|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 800 would have been standard?|pg||

nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|joest: does a 2@d rebid show five?  Does 2 of a major show extras? etc.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes indeed I can recommend the Lawrnce book 2/1 here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: i think this 2@C has 4@H/@S only if 6+@C|pg||
nt|joest: yes he has a well thought out method in his book|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: routine 4@s here, Westheimer's opening will have to come on one of the last 4 boards|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  2@D=5+|pg||
nt|joest: and then either 3@h followed by 3Nt or just 3NT directly|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jwit: EW slightly stole this one, though they will have to do some scrambling to make this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some play 2D as balanced   11/12  maybe only 3 diamonds|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chick: I was going to say she would need a safety play in diamonds, but doesn't look like she'll get the chance|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jwit: Lead actually helps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then 2NT can be 13/14  gf  or  18/19|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D didn't deny 4@H/@S  but 3@D did|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but Bates-Wold play precision so |pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead maybe  but N did not double 3H|pg||

nt|joest: many pairs lead second highest from four small and so, apparently, does this north-south pair|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jwit: Trumps and spades both behave and 9 of clubs is a big card, so they should probably make this|pg||

nt|joest: he will needed to work diamonds|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|jwit: South did well not to double. Knowledge of bad trump break might have given declarer a fighting chance.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good lead for defense|pg||
nt|joest: i can't leave AKxx of hearts unbid.  If they double me, I apologize I guess|pg||

nt|chick: with no entries and W known to be long in 2 other suits, lead the 10 and run it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the biggest swing of the session|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|hackenbush: can't really go wrong here, clubs 5-2 and diamonds 3-3|pg||
