mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Operator is Jan Martel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators Barnet Shenkin and Peter Crouch|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Hi guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: W may dredge up a 1NT response and E will have to find a rebid, potentially something like 3@D.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hi roland|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  6@d pretty good|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like some conventional understandings in play here and a @D lead will cause E no consternation whatever.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 6@H can also make but that is lucky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D by East is a very good contract|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@d now from west?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  has extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Really not a fan of this double, which should say this is the only place I can contribute so unless you have your own clear lead, demands @D.  Not the case with this middling suit. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla:  And obviously competing is not in the picture.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|pitiful:  4@d was a nice bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|jcwla: Wow - not a good stop with a @D lead coming.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  6NT was not a nice bid|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|barnets: now a guess on a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, North is not Fisher|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs hearts -3-3|pg||
nt|pitiful:  why not bid 5N pick a slam if available rather than 6N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher as West is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Lair's partner is not Fisher|pg||
nt|barnets: it is weichsel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weichsel|pg||
nt|barnets: this contract is less than 20 percent|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i suspect you would prefer most of your bids to be assigned to another name Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT is a poor contract, even by my standards|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but 6@d by east would be what 90% +|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we can always blame it on Fisher|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, not any more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: south led ten of clubs out of turn, but screen was not opened, so director ruled no harm and north can lead normally|pg||
nt|barnets: not exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice Jerry|pg||
nt|barnets: if hearts split 4-2 and diamonds 4-1 declarer has problems|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True Barnet, but if you don't want to be in 6@D, you require too much for your slams|pg||
nt|barnets: no it is decent |pg||
nt|barnets: in 6N dec would play 3top hearts and then lead a spade|pg||
nt|pitiful:  can you not play 2 trumps, ace of @h ruff a @h, draw trump, cross to @c?|pg||
nt|barnets: on a club lead which is best|pg||
nt|barnets: you cant do that|pg||
nt|pitiful:  why not|pg||
nt|barnets: as you have no entry back to hand if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not knowing that diamonds are not 5-0, declarer can't claim, so there is thinking|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|jcwla: Will draw trump, unblock @CA, go over to @DQ, pitch a @H on @CK, and try the @H hook to make 4.|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hello Henry!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can we expect 4@d from W?|pg||
nt|hlortz: hi Ralf its 10:43 in seattle so good morning :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 4@d from W Henry?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I need to go deal with some of the other rooms, so I won't be able to tell you the play here - will be back to claim and do the next board|pg||
nt|hlortz: i would kq is too strong to not offer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but perhaps good for the match:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks now|pg||
nt|hlortz: well we dont need play by play here think 13 tricks with @H 3-3|pg||

nt|jcwla: Could it go the other way - yeah, there might be trouble on say a trump lead.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  win @c ace, play 2 trumps, @h ace, ruff @h, draw trump, cross to @c King?|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe thats right|pg||
nt|barnets: yes you are right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet would find that line at the table :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so it is much better|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps after 21 minutes but find it he would :)|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks roland|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pitiful:  anyone wouldn't be an issue for Roland, he could never reach 6@d playing acol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teasing Barnet is as much fun as teasing Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: E chose a 3NT rebid in the OR and made four.  That was the other possibility.|pg||
nt|jcwla: So as predicted 6 to Schwartz.|pg||
nt|barnets: top spot here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: Correct, 6 to Lynch, the teams are not ID'd properly here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lynch is getting the scores for EW here for some reason.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Acol would get you to 6@D without any sweat|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 2NT is all the rage but I quite like 1@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Allow me to recommend that system|pg||
pc|s9|nt|barnets: with one partner we had a system to show 2 suiters over 2N|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Will be corrected I'm sure, pls bear with us.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, folks, we've got it - the team names are reversed - thank you.|pg||
nt|barnets: not that we ever used it|pg||
nt|barnets: but once wechsel sontag used it to bagainst me in the trialsgame id |pg||
nt|barnets: to bid game|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: W will now show his @d I think, but which level?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I see you think he should have made 7 on the first board here, but I promise that Passell's scorecard says 660 - I wasn't here so I don't know any more than that :)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Normal looking 4@S but not laydown|pg||
nt|barnets: down 1 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends on the lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what would open as west?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Am I alone?|pg||
nt|barnets: If I was playing Polish 2@H|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well i hate to admit that i would never pass|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 suiter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish or not, 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't pass in 3rd favourable with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a fan of Acol 2's, so 2@H it will be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: not much chance in 4 @H unless defense give you something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have that funny feeling .......|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and it is not a good feeling|pg||
nt|barnets: in the local duplicate @DA and another @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet, your bid|pg||
nt|barnets: are the players there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E: KQ2, KQT83, 9, J872|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfd: short break turned out longer than expected|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Took a while for Lair to pass; he had a tough decision to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: S; AJ865, 97, K42, Q94|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: W: T4, 642, AJ53, K65|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcwla: 4@S down on a @C lead with two quick entries in S.|pg||
nt|barnets: to lose only one diamond trick you need the single Q in west or 10 in east singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: so dont hold your breath|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: west needs one more |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nine of hearts lead|pg||
nt|barnets: cards and point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be easy when you have 51 cards :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: won by ten.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, the new board was played in 4@H next door and made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: spade king to ace, heart to ace, third heart|pg||
nt|swanson: There was no club ace - West needs it for his bidding.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: club to king, ace, third club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: soiuth wins Q of clubs, plays diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ace of  diamonds, club|pg||
nt|barnets: its hard enough when you can see the hands :)|pg||
nt|swanson: This is more mystifying than watching the original 18.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have to lead a card, then claim Jerry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: just any card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hearts, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: four hearts down one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: doesn't matter which card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lead a card and claim down 1|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but Hamilton must lead something|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: and if @HJ then there is still a problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: for Fisher|pg||
nt|barnets: now he has to win the A|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: declarer confirmed carding of EW -- upside down, odd-even|pg||
nt|barnets: I would have led a trump|pg||
