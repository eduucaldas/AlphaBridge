mb|1C|nt|scotty: Declarer started well, but needed to play @sA, S to K then fourth club - and if W ruffed in pitch a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or bad result for Moss   depends how you look at it|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vul  4333 but Radin still kicks it up another level|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|scotty: West must double to show values|pg||
nt|scotty: At matchpoints, E might pass....|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: but 4@c at imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems reasonable here too -- especially at these colors|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: Michael, why so sure not PASS?|pg||
nt|scotty: West will raise|pg||
nt|scotty: too risky at imps - change a club and a H with N-S to see why|pg||
nt|scotty: West is thinking, not S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is 4@C passable?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: Notice if N-S stayed silent, E-W might not reach game - and if they did, it might well be 3N|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  just trying to glean likelihood of 5@C vs 3@SX|pg||
pc|d2|nt|scotty: 4@c is certainly passable - but not with that hand.  More likely to subside when spades are 2-2 - no 3N and too many losers for 5@c|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|swanson: A spade overcall and preemptive raise will annoy E-W, but they will still bid game.|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|tez: dbl now|pg||
nt|ybob: now X and 4@C or 4@H ?|pg||
nt|swanson: 500 is adequate compensation for game should East pass a reopening double.|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@h|pg||
nt|tez: to dbl|pg||
nt|swanson: (I would pass.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Barnet|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: should make easily, 4 clubs a heart and 2+ spades|pg||
nt|tez: hmmm.surprized pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  Interesting that Peter chose not to open 2@s in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|swanson: That was unexpected.  Shows how little they can rely on opening bid values for an opening bid.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|barnets: he is at adverse vul|pg||
nt|peachy: I was thinking the same, opp passed partner red he perhaps thought it would bee too risky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes, but even so|pg||
nt|barnets: i wouldn't chance it|pg||

mc|7|nt|swanson: When evaluating the merits of opening light, this hand must be applied to the debit side.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so Seamon-Molson was in a no lose situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: probably easier these days to assume light opening and just refer to pairs who don't|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: sorry  sun was in my eyes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|scotty: East has a pretty good hand if partner has 4-card support, but questionable if she should bid - a lot of red losers to take care of|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: flip flop West's red cards  and you'll see a good argument for transfers after 1@C-(1@D)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|swanson: I except E-W to reach 4@S here, but it has no real chance of coming home.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|swanson: A takeout double is possible here by Levin.  That gives E-W as chance for a plus by defending.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|othered1: NS still should be able to find 3N, but 5@D will work also, as cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joel planning a 2-step to show good hand with 6@S & 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably with weaker hand she would rebid 2@S immediately|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|barnets: his is down a couple|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Defending is for children - bid those games.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w limit is 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: weichsel relatively lucky|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  good afternoon all|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: this is nice -- i forgot to think about options if Sokolow bidding 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: North can only lead one round of trumps, so the simple defense of winning two diamonds and shifting to a spade seems best.|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe E hopes supp 4th , the only reason to bid 3@H over X|pg||
nt|swanson: East might have redoubled 2@S to indicate a good hand and then listen to what partner has to say.|pg||
nt|ybob: agree|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: 11 tricks likely here, too, as @SQ comes down while cashing out|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hackenbush: natural to finesse trump now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- retain ability to ruff @H if finesse loses|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|swanson: North shouldn't be concerned about solving a spade guess for declarer; the double has already given away the spade situation.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|ritong: in that sense that 3@s is down, so the board was lost already  but yes, probably 4@d makes|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hackenbush: good shift, knockout late entry to spades|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: play was too fast -- i was contemplating @S @S ruff then @DJ|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|swanson: South doesn't mind this cross ruff - her spades are looking better and better.|pg||
nt|tez: down 1|pg||
nt|tez: whats your choise with west hand..2@s or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff and @D ... ?|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s showed 4+ right?|pg||
nt|swanson: I expect that the 1@S bid showed five cards, so the raise is routine.|pg||
nt|tez: in europe 1@c 1@d 1 major 4+|pg||
nt|ybob: Both tables raise with 3 cards|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@h 1@s 5+|pg||
nt|ybob: I play 1@S as 4 + over 1@D , X = 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: mark me down for 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|swanson: Doesn't have to show five, but I would raise unless I knew for certain that partner held only four spades.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c 1@d dbl shows both majors|pg||
nt|swanson: Some play that the negative double of 1@D is exactly four spades and four or more hearts (using the theory that you can bid spades, then hearts with five spades).|pg||
nt|tez: migry's connection bad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I think she will never play|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room in 2@S   Stansby's 2@D over the 2@C rebid focused on @H|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|hackenbush: oops unguarded spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did she really do that?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  July|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ybob: now 4 ruffs to -1|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: EW  1N=14-16 throughout   wonder if that means 2N = 19- something|pg||
nt|hackenbush: perhaps an upgrade|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: some number of @H likely but 4 could be tricky.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but West is 2N opener regardless of  how Walter the Walrus counts points|pg||

nt|ahollan1: same in other room|pg||

nt|swanson: I would have guessed from the timing of the bids that East and South are on the same side of the screen.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|othered1: north's 3@H is unnderstandable and catches south with  the perfect flat minimum|pg||

mb|1D|nt|andyv:  S hand rich in high card points but poor in playing quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin still thought East was 1@S opener|pg||
nt|hackenbush: maybe they play equal-level conversion, where if North bids 2@c, and South 2@d showing @h+@d but not extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@S-DBL    3N north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S really put pressure on NS|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close double decision with Joel, here only 3 hearts with minimum values, but singleton spade|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: I have to go, will leave you all in the capable hands of Barnet Shenkin, Ed Shapiro, and Henri "ritong" Schweitzer. Thx all|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a good question to ask in these situation is, "do I want to defend"?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|andyv:  and S should bid the game|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: good x by east in open|pg||
nt|barnets: he knew his partner had 1 spade on auction|pg||

nt|othered1: But what if partner had 0 @S?|pg||
nt|barnets: and his partner had 1 for luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, the luck element once again enters|pg||

nt|barnets: to beat it|pg||
nt|barnets: i like the x|pg||
nt|daman: North should pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defending 2@S when 6@D actually has a [single dummy] play    conclusion: sometimes preempts work|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: 3N would have better play as cards lie|pg||
nt|andyv:  both rooms should get to 4@h..only question is whether EW will take the 5@d push|pg||
nt|othered1: more like will west solo to 5@D, since east doesn't have much positive  to say with those tricks in defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  and spec points out that 4@s is another possible EW contract|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: So do I|pg||
nt|barnets: and will be a nice swing for lynch|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: unless they get the ruffs right now, then a lesser swing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tez: nonevuln:)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h4|nt|daman: looks like declarer will make at least 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|swanson: After South shows with six diamond to the AKJ there isn't any possibility she also holds the @SK so declarer will take the winning club finesse.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: Make a large number of @D EW, but that may be the 4th suit and could be hard to find|pg||
nt|hackenbush: too weak for michaels, if better spades then 1@s|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a reasonable slam - until clubs go 4-1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this must be multi landy?|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D = one major|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  E's @h bid will make it harder to get to the slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Every time I make a contrarian play like that, turns out it was contrary to *our* success |pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S is the winning bid here|pg||
nt|othered1: And was made in the OR|pg||
nt|barnets: although 3N may make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|daman: 2H = pass or correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same start -- but Jill Meyers balanced with West hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: another close decision to double, with Radin's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: not good percantage slam..|pg||
mb|3N|nt|barnets: club lead is best|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: but west is known to hold 7 @hs|pg||
nt|barnets: but can make a ninth in hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: big bob would not open 3@h a six bagger first seat at equal vul, would he?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if you can trust partner to pass when it's right, then you can double 4@h more often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or close for Moss to re-open|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  E should raise here|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but @H bid opposite void won't improve west hand a whole lot.|pg||
nt|othered1: What would west open with 4=1=4=4?|pg||

nt|ybob: only cold 3NT|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|barnets: but non vul|pg||
nt|barnets: partner could have less and game bonus is less|pg||

nt|daman: I am informed14-16 NT|pg||
nt|ybob: sry not here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the recommended defense against that 2@H opener  --  wouldn't be surprised if DBL did show bal hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: it probably does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sokolow over 2@S  --  tough  give credit to the EW system|pg||
mb|3N|nt|daman: 6 more for Joel on Board 7|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but from South's perspective, needs partner to have a max to have a shot at 3nt, and might not even make 14 vs 11 with no source of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true  partner was passed hand|pg||
nt|ybob: yes here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: @s to the A, back to dummy and another @s, right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: with four spade tricks declarer just wants to get the trumps drawn, but it's slightly awkward to get to dummy fast|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to take advantage of the free finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no @s losers, he may just play A@h and @h|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA yes|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will be in game here.  4@S is down, but 3NT is on.|pg||
nt|ybob: AQ stiff @C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ybob: 4@S was -2 if guessed|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|ritong: yes, say you lose a @d ruff now, you do not lose the @h anymore|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will grind it out looking for an overtrick, but by that time she will have nine in the bank.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hackenbush: 9 or 10 tricks here after ruffing a diamond|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: not sure you can afford to give up on the trump finesse quite that happily - if trumps are 3-1, and the defender with @HKxx plays a third round, you only have nine tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|swanson: Guarding against 5-1 spades.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: unless the lead was stiff K|pg||
nt|daman: South has a "surround" in @Ss|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  then you have to be unlucky in both minors|pg||

mb|p|nt|scotty: It was natural to bid her Hx in spades - remember, she did not know about stiff @d, so pictured a doubleton heart|pg||

nt|ybob: i don´t like show stiff with A but here works fine|pg||
nt|swanson: North might have help her partner by playing the @D10 on the the second round.  That would have saved the overtick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: will north open 1N or 1@D?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D 1@S 2@D double, seems a possible start|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: Will Moss open in 3rd?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised he opened 1nt - not because of the 5422 but just because it's a bit good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reliable source tells me  "dbl was 13-15 or 19-plus bal but not essential with that hand opposite a ph"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: hamman sticks to his convictions|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H far from obligatory|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 2@d looks like a good raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|ybob: now 3@H or 3@S ?|pg||
nt|ybob: i like 3@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: passing 12 decent|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: end of auction, I presume|pg||
nt|ritong: quacks, etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D transfer   [better raise than 2@H]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and North should double again|pg||
nt|swanson: Too much playing strength for 3@S.  3@H invites game.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: I don't know if 2@H is controls or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and NS earns 50, rather than the 130 that *might* have been attainable|pg||
nt|barnets: X could get 500  now if they pass it|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|ybob: O.R. bids 3@S over 2@S|pg||
nt|swanson: A club lead would hold the contract to nine tricks, but East has no reason to lead anything but a heart.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: xx was 3 card support|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then again, defending is right if they're only in a 7-card fit|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C was Puppet|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  or 120|pg||
nt|athene: having given up control in trumps, north has to be a bit worried about declarer running the spades|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect him to try to cash out in the minors - he would have to find his partner with one king and get him in to lead to the other AQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: and 3@Sx showed extra values|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry 3@Dx |pg||
nt|barnets: showed extras|pg||
nt|barnets: looking at all the hands you can make 10 tricks in spades|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: 3@H showed no major|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess he just didn't want to commit to one or other suit|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer is not a lock for 9 tricks should spades be 3-1 and the @DA in the West hand.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north's heart spot should be suit preference for the minors|pg||
nt|swanson: Things looking good now.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: bramley now knows his pard had 3@d for his t/o double|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|athene: maybe south's heart spot|pg||
nt|hackenbush: have to get a club ruff to beat it now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ybob: after cue by E one Ace there|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Levin is playing very slowly|pg||
nt|swanson: East should duck the diamond to give the defense any chance.  If West wins the @DJ and returns the @CJ it might get interesting.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: I'm not sure we'll ever finish lol|pg||
nt|ybob: now she needs only 4/2 @D |pg||
nt|ybob: @S to K, @D to K @D ruff , @H ruff, @D ruff|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff both @H´s to go to the 5th @D and discard|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: dec can guess spades now then give up 2 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  good result for EW|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting that a natural 1@D opening likely would have facilitated the defense|pg||
nt|ritong: time considerations?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: are you sure about that??|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: She must have a blind spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Even Weichsel would have finished in 2 minutes max|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: am i wrong supposing weichsel wanted to signal slow opponents?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Joel has the trump tenace|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|swanson: This is an attempt to go set - should East by some chance have started with a doubleton club.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|hackenbush: true, they just have to avoid blowing a black suit trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @D tap works too|pg||

pc|d7|nt|scotty: As against that, if partner has 4-card @s and about 7 HCP, you may miss game with 1N opening|pg||

mb|1S|nt|barnets: well game is lucky with @CK falling|pg||
nt|othered1: and you  have to get the position right if you're as  high as 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now how will South get her values across...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|barnets: you could play east for kX club|pg||
nt|barnets: doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: that loses here|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of alert explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force   jump to 3N should show 1N strength [but some flaw for 1N open]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and we have our answer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be less or more than 1N opening strength|pg||
nt|ybob: 130 here i hope|pg||
mb|3D|nt|barnets: same bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: next board is promising as well|pg||
nt|barnets: now it went all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was probably a close call for Joel|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe Passell was playing his partner for the @SK rather than a minor-suit king|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N says they never bypass 4-card majors in responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: and so it goes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: personally i think if north shows a club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: south should support him|pg||
nt|barnets: but that my view  who knows|pg||
nt|daman: this will be down quickly    once East wins the @C Ace     EW will cash 2 @Hs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: rather weird, yes  a ten cards fit buried in both rooms|pg||
nt|othered1: @DQ doesn't look very positive and @S were bid on his left, but still A9x is above expectations|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N shows clubs to all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: north has bid his suit with 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she was going to guess the @H10 anyway|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|barnets: I am not sure on their system what 2@C would mean|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c7|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: when south responds 1@D here it's not saying "I have no 4-card major" but it is saying "you can ignore your 4-card majors to rebid 1nt, i will check back for them if i want to"|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room 1N was clearly alerted to show clubs?|pg||
nt|barnets: can you say if it was clearly alerted here ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause = negotiating claim|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hackenbush: if East had played back a low heart, inserting @h9 is indicated from restricted choice, besides the fact that East might've tried @hK or spade from @hKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please let that be the case|pg||
nt|swanson: It seems a bit out of charater that Jill Meyers didn't open 1NT.  The hand does offer significant potential should partner have a big pointed suit fit.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: mary said so|pg||
nt|barnets: if 1n showed clubs 2@C would likely be a cue bid , as would 2@D|pg||

nt|barnets: slam is not wonderfull but it makes|pg||
nt|barnets: just one entry to south hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the question is: at which level|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wonder why south didn't bid 4@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which 5?   [sorry  i gotta be me]|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  when pd asks you to pick a major, do you like to torment him by bidding the other minor?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hackenbush: @sT will be an encouraging card for Moss, partner ostensibly showing @sHx|pg||
nt|swanson: West might have bid 4@C over 3NT, being unwilling to allow the opponents a shot at a vulnerable 3NT.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: every imp is vital now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to distinguish  serious vs non-serious slam tries|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  this should be over quickly...S will take the @s hook into W hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so weichsel showed a rockcrushing 6/5 and lair declined|pg||
nt|barnets: a 1 imp swing could be very important for deutsch |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ybob: after the 3@C bid, could win 5@D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ybob: need guess @D only ...|pg||
nt|swanson: In 3NT with a spade lead declarer leads the @DQ.  If East covers (the reflex play) declarer ducks and has nine winners.|pg||
nt|ybob: scary if E play small :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|swanson: It's clearly the correct play - but one has to make it in tempo (like many good plays) to be successful.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|swanson: These ladies are so aggressive with their opening bids and in other situations, I'm surprised that South didn't take a shot at 3NT.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|ybob: or bid 4@D over 3@S ...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|swanson: The downside is that if diamonds don't come it 3NT will be set multiple tricks.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: minimum number of tricks again|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of operator lost play  --   time enough to guess @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but back to trump   why not cater to 5-0 trump and float 1st trump?|pg||
nt|scotty: And you would naturally guess it, since You know S has stiff spade - and you never find out about 6-2 clubs|pg||

nt|barnets: lynch have a likely pick up on the last board so this hand may be decisive|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: whatever he leads helps declarer to an extent|pg||
nt|barnets: north will place the final contract\|pg||
nt|ritong: one of weichsel's problems currently is: if i raise @ds, what will be the agreed suit|pg||
nt|daman: a thoughtful lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer might throw a club on a spade and play for a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively try and get the diamonds going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has Sokolow had ANY easy bids this set?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|barnets: souths 3@D shows 3  card spade support|pg||
nt|othered1: Turns out 2N wasn't free here.  Wonder what 4@D would have meant over 2@S?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|barnets: some play it has 3 and a non minimum|pg||

nt|barnets: 6@D could be right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ybob: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: saving 2 imps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hackenbush: this double partner almost certainly has 4 spades, looking for the big payoff when both 2@h and 2@s makes|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|barnets: souths decision could have been a match winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Dummy showed max, stiff heart|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks sure to be flat|pg||
nt|ritong: lair took a huge view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 & 6 imp swings also add up quickly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: definitely|pg||
nt|ybob: she needs run the first @S to 12|pg||
nt|swanson: And guess diamonds.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: looks innocuous, but is enormous|pg||
nt|barnets: of course north had not guaranteed 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: so the whole situation is wooly to say the least|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: seems she should have gotten that right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just don't ask me why|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c3|nt|athene: declarer is going to go for a club ruff|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: now needs exact @S layout  and that will mean Radin holds @CQ  else she would have opened 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is just for down 1|pg||
nt|hackenbush: unfortunately can't get to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right  needed @HK as entry|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  one of the key facets in defense is to try not to break new suits for declarer hence Bob's return of a @s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: finally getting some real help from opp|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|swanson: Still has to guess diamonds for 11. |pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|pc|h8|nt|andyv:  the tough part is now|pg||
nt|andyv:  best seems AK @h and ruff @c|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only worry now is holding the trump losers to one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you ruff a diamond now|pg||
nt|athene: you know west has the king still so that isn't getting overruffed|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @d ruff, E pitches @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but you might still be able to combine chances in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: with some trump coup possibilities|pg||
nt|andyv:  so basically the same thing but ruff 1@d first then AK@h?  that works too|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|daman: she will take the money and run    no finesses|pg||
nt|ybob: now 11 surely|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: does doubleton trump Q help here?     @C finesse, @SA @SK   nope doesn't help|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ritong: soooo....|pg||
nt|ritong: is that one mundane?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the idea of ruffing some diamonds was that you might then be able to cash the @HAK and even if west showed out you would not necessarily be dead|pg||
nt|athene: as you might have a trump coup against east|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hand|pg||
nt|daman: NS will end up in another lazy 4@H contract|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well Valerie Westheimer in the BBO Junior club calls that the flying ace syndrome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C by many would be artificial  [example: same bid as if RHO opened 1N]  so PASS/DBL/3@C were her options|pg||
nt|hackenbush: most play double as negative here over 3@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but might be scary if partner passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with the lack of values  negative would definitely apply|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  good point|pg||

nt|ahollan1: stopped NS from finding @S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: sutherlin knows everyone has about a ten count|pg||

nt|ybob: Now W shows 9 cards @C @H so ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: on the rule of 11, north has one club higher than the six|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the king or jack you want to play low in dummy; if it's the 9 or 8 you want to stick in the ten|pg||
nt|othered1: Deutsch has gotten into the lead on the basis of that potential slam on board 42, where they found 6@D in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you can get south on lead next|pg||
nt|andyv:  so odds about 2-1 in favor of 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  as most don't lead away from Jacks|pg||
nt|athene: isn't it exactly 50-50?|pg||
nt|barnets: and this made it more difficult for /s|pg||
nt|daman: North*|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h down 2|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: S will play 4@S anyway, now X p 4@S|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@C is a 'fit bid' showing clubs with heart support.  I guess partner has to work out whether it shows any real values or not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Director, please|pg||
nt|tez: maybe they will stay here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|barnets: a good tactical bid|pg||
nt|hackenbush: tempting to pass with West but priority still goes to bidding your own contract first|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, he sort of wants to be in dummy to finesse spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: with 3 defensive tricks, and a fairly offensive hand, both @d and @s might be making|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in other match  with 4 to score in the set  Sprung leads Westheimer by 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after long dinner break   30 more boards to complete the USA1 semi-final matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winners advance to USA1 Final   losers got to USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good lead, holding values in both unbid suits|pg||
pc|h7|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
nt|swanson: I would think that North would take an essentially certain profit against 4@H.  Wrong again.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
nt|ybob: true moment :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: Profits are good|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@D rounds pitch @C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
nt|hackenbush: still making, as NS can't get in to lead trumps again|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||

nt|daman: thanks to our operator Gary Hann    super job|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the set   restart in about 2.5 hours|pg||
nt|ybob: OR lead was J@C and declarer win the first trick and go down|pg||
nt|ybob: if she duck 1 @C cold too |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzff: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C anyone?|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|hackenbush: too bad they're favorable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: no trf response after X|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: next session begins in roughly 40 minutes|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C must show @Cs obviously|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many pairs like to play that 3-level preempts have tighter range, depending on colors|pg||
nt|tez: last here.ty all.enjoyed .ty Roberto. TY SPECS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|hackenbush: so favorable 3@c = bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable = random hand  but 2nd seat ??|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes 2nd seat should usually be stronger|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 3@c certainly works better for this hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|daman: an inspired lead|pg||
nt|ybob: Ty Tezcan|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: no reason to get too fancy|pg||
nt|daman: over to a @S    @C finesse    @C Ace|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: Ty gary:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: the more i watch, the more convinced i am that transfers over the DBL work much better than standard  [i.e. a forcing 1@H feels wrong]|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: Sokolow DBL = 3@H  [support dbl]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: NS did avoid going for 800 in 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminds me of my grandfather     i saved $100,000 dollars today   saw a house i loved and didn't buy it     [it was a long time ago]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: certainly pairs that play transfers over 1@c opening, play it over the double, e.g. Garner-Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if not playing them over 1@C-P   many play them over 1@C-X and 1@D-X|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many more play them over 1M-Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of agony here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those have been around longer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: from the players or the specs following our ramblings?>|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzff: It was a bit of an ordeal lol :)|pg||
