nt|bjacobs: What to lead?  I like hearts myself ... the good old unbid suit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT was forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: David Bird's book on opening leads, which is compulsory reading, says that 3NT is often defeated via a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|smithd:  Kim probably has a fair idea that clubs are unfavourable now|pg||
nt|petergill: H5 looks normal|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: So Melbourne's choice made some sense, but of course, on this auction, it is quite likely that partner has 5 hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And East will certainly have at least 4 clubs|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: Ishmael Delmonte's theory is that in such caes, you lead the suit of the person who has the entries to get in when the suit is set up - that means "lead hearts" in this case|pg||
nt|serhat: all ends with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right, South's hand was a little short of side entries.  It will have to be the @DK - not all that likely to work out|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But such clues are not totally definitive.  For example, could East be 3=4=3=3 on this auction?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a lot of logical thinking that can go into opening leads, but there is rarely a clear "right" or "wrong" about them|pg||

pc|s9|nt|smithd:  Good valuation by South, I think. Only 7 losers using LTC.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I agree.  The club singleton is useful given the 3@C bid (i.e. probably North doesn't have huge wastage in clubs).  And the QJ in hearts are excellent cards|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table reached 4@S with EW silent via 1@C - 1@H transfer - 3@D minisplinter - 4@S|pg||
nt|serhat: Is this singleton? |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = @d singleton  and 4 card spade support|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@S is trivial to make ... 4@H needs tender loving care, and Ish is just the person to give it|pg||
nt|petergill: strength - either invit, or too good, to splinter 4@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If North tries a trump-ectomy: @HA and another, I think West can counter by winning the king and playing a 3rd (low) heart|pg||
nt|smithd:  Ish will be worried that the lead was a singleton|pg||
nt|serhat: if he plays @H A and a @H he will have some trouble|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: A third heart by Bruce doesn't really give away a trick, because as soon as declarer ruffs a club, the @H9 becomes good|pg||
nt|petergill: Many declarers think "that's a pretty good way ot play it" and away they go, no more thinking. Ish thinks: "there might be a better way to play it, so I'd better run through all ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the possibilities." He does this much faster than I do.  |pg||
nt|serhat: now @D is good for Neill|pg||
nt|smithd:  Really, Peter :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: David's irony here is understood by all our Aussies.  EVERYONE does things faster at the bridge table than Mr Gill|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, this line of play seems to fail, as long as West plays partner for @DA|pg||
nt|serhat: well Ish thought spade single and H must be at least 2 cards. then 4H is cold|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, good lead by Morrison. Though it was a fairly obvious lead, it did look like a singleton. |pg||
nt|serhat: if he has 3 @D say xxx still cold even after spade ruff|pg||
nt|serhat: 3@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he led a spade because everything else is worse ... so a good lead for negative reasons|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|petergill: Bd 5:  Bruce Neill's sound play of @S8 at Trick1, playing UDCA, might have helped lead declarer to think spades were 3-1. In the ending, the reason @CQ works and @D 's don't work ...|pg||
