mb|p|mb|1H|nt|gracelin: in closed room south opened 3C and West overcalled 3H to end there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|gracelin: the 3H overcall was a bit too heavy for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lorderic: what's your suggestion Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe 3NT|pg||
nt|lorderic: I would also bid 3NT|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jarronshih: agree with 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: each partnership has to decide the minimum and maximum for an 3H overcall over 3C, so his partner will know when to raise.|pg||
nt|lorderic: @CA provides a good stopper. unlike K, you know the opponent cannot hold up for communication|pg||
nt|lorderic: if @CA becomes @CK i would prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: YT has all the confidence that the 3D just shift was based on a genuine suit, which may not always be the case.|pg||
nt|gracelin: jump shift|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lorderic: yup. W might jump with hands like 6 hearts and 3 diamonds|pg||

nt|lorderic: keep 4@H a possible choice|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: I prefer 4D, in case partner does have a 2-suiters.  He will know ehere to play when he made the jump shift.|pg||

nt|gracelin: tks, but this match is nearly over|pg||
nt|gracelin: And a final between two teams from same school is always anti-climax|pg||

nt|lorderic: and they are dominating in KO stage|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: but unless all semi-finalists are from BTU, I'd assume you can arrange to have the final between two different schools. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: well, this year we have 3 of 4 semi-finalists from BTU|pg||
nt|gracelin: that is, teams from same school will meet at the semi-final|pg||
nt|jarronshih: there are 3 teams from NTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: last year, all 4 teams get to the semi-finals|pg||
