mb|d|mb|1S|nt|petergill: Bd 18 - 4@H should be -2 after @sK then @SA (that way to show doubleton) - suit pref by East ---> clubs and -2, so 5@DX -1 is not good|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I suppose there is no way to go wrong in clubs if you cash a top one first (which Thomson did)|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 18 - Bill is right, plus the @HK lead (which might be from KQ or might (less likely?) be Kxxxx in expert games) has some effect on the best play|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: the team of four is outlasting the team of six, but the sixsome played 4 (the sitting-out pair) or 5 (the 4 playing now) days' bridge in the Seniors Teams before this 7 day event. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder if West might have been better off bidding 3@D with such a solid suit (after 3@C)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3Nt is very much to be avoided. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps I'm resulting, but 3@D might have resulted in a 4@S splinter.  This is one tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|babs59: one needs a good structure after 2NT rebids, that's all|pg||
nt|babs59: personally I like transfers|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D is slighly better than 6@C (possible 4-1 trumps), though both make |pg||
mb|4C|nt|bjacobs: 3@C was probably checkback, so I suppose that means 3@H was a required bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: I think they are doing amazingly well. I saw few awkward lines yesterday ..but not easy to play in 4men team|pg||
mb|5C|nt|petergill: Morrison wanted to splinter over 3@H with 4@s, but that would have agreed the wrong trump suit - @H's|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... they are going to probably get a middling result here: game making an overtrick, but not 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|serhat: 6c ?|pg||
nt|petergill: Peter Newman is so relaxed. I think Matthew Thomson told me at the ANOT in Adelaide last year that his annual game with Peter Newman is like partenring a Rolls Royce (or something ...|pg||
nt|petergill: like that, I cannot remember exactly)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Gee, it doesn't look like a 6@C bid on that East hand, but perhaps on the state of the match ...|pg||
nt|babs59: the other room lacked suitable structure too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The middling result will do the trick!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Like I said before, this is one tough cookie ... the CR auction is hardly ridiculous, but the contract IS ridiculous|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont like Neills 5C|pg||
nt|petergill: Last year's annual game, because Peter Newman with 4 kids, wonderful wife Catherine (daughter of Dick and Val Cummings) and 4 kids, busy job at Fujitsu has time for only one game ...|pg||
