nt|roswolf:  indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: It is South who is thinking ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy:  of course running the 9 would be playin for a misdefence|pg||
nt|roswolf:  south is disciplined|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf:  had south opened game would have been bid|pg||
nt|eggy:  Well if the spades were better, I think that with a 5442 11 you should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|eggy:  because knowing there is a 3 card fit improves the hand significantly|pg||

mb|p|nt|eggy:  That's very nearly a joke Simon|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|eggy:  not usual to lead a singleton with trumps like this, but best here for otehr reasons|pg||

nt|eggy:  when they let you off the hook. get off it|pg||
nt|roswolf:  these situations are rarely discussed even though they should be|pg||
nt|dburn: that is certainly true|pg||
nt|eggy:  well surely 2NT shows a desire to play in partners minor, rather than the necessity to|pg||
nt|roswolf:  5minute gaps last night was the norm|pg||
nt|eggy:  Do we know who is on next Simon?|pg||

nt|eggy:  Same on board 1, Beat 4H on 2 where N didn't bid and led a club.|pg||

nt|dburn: 2/1 people will bid 1NT with North and play from the right side|pg||
nt|eggy:  ooks like a fairly comfortable 3NT by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Acol people might respond 2@d and play from the wrong one|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy:  or maybe 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf:  simple auction|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|dburn: 4@s tough to reach - normal for non-2/1 people would be 1@s-2@d-2NT (forcing) - 3NT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|eggy:  and suddenly an undisciplined 6 looks attractive|pg||

nt|dburn: not that it matters - 3NT cold from either side even if West does hit on a club lead|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|roswolf:  yes everything works here but it was better technique|pg||

nt|roswolf:  a positional slam |pg||
nt|eggy:  still if you guess right, no-one's going to say anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf:  north needs to be declarer to protect the @dK|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|an| |nt|dburn: that may not work so well - South will declare hearts now|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: so, better play in spades or notrump, but that might not be so easy to organise|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|roswolf:  6@s by north may be possible to reach|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - unusual to break transfers with only three-card support, but the partnership now may never bid hearts naturally at all|pg||
nt|eggy:  Now - pretty likely I'd say|pg||
nt|dburn: not that South will necessarily drive to a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf:  a spec asks why south didnt use stayman - i cant give a good answer to that one|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|eggy:  and she still has to rightside the spade suit as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an| |mb|p|nt|eggy:  first objective achieved|pg||
nt|dburn: depends on method - OK to transfer and then bid 3@h if that's how you develop the South hand|pg||
nt|eggy:  but 3H may be a retransfer|pg||
nt|roswolf:  4@c seems obvious now|pg||
nt|eggy:  so hearts possibly still not mentioned|pg||
nt|roswolf:  this will get a @d cue from north|pg||
nt|eggy:  any clue from alerts Simon?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Yes ... I think 3H was a retransfer, not a suit|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
