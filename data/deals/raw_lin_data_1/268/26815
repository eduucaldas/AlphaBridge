mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|athene: traditional relays, where responder asks for opener's shape, don't work so well after 1nt opener|pg||
nt|athene: because if you have one balanced hand and one unbalanced, it's much better for the unbalanced to describe itself|pg||

nt|athene: here if south knows he is facing 2-4-6-1, he gets excited|pg||
