mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|gracelin: the closed room north opened 1NT so the 3NT contract is not tested with a spade lead|pg||

nt|jmchen: 2S should be two off in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|gracelin: yes, so this maybe some exception that when both pairs of a team played in the same denomination, results are often bad to them|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||

nt|gracelin: Like 2S by NS in one room, and 1S by EW in other room|pg||
