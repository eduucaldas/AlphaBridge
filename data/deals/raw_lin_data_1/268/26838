nt|nilsland:  more than twice too|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: perhaps I meant that it was right more than once?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||

nt|nilsland:  so you should not do it automaticly|pg||
nt|nilsland:  it was not a tip for you Jon - it was meant for the others having a chance to beat you :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: I would urge them to do the opposite:)|pg||

nt|nilsland:  This would be a good slam if not two Aces were missing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jbgood: and both cashable...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jbgood: letting the serve go the the ninbe would be too much double dummy?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and now another spade holds it to 10??7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: of course, but he is a good player|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|an|!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 2@d natural?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  first board was a good result for NS thou|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  2@D shows something but we dont know what - maybe 14 pts and 6 hearts?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|nilsland:  But it wont be a succes with that system|pg||
nt|jbgood: something like that|pg||
nt|nilsland:  looks more like 200 to EW|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I would not bid 2D without the @H10|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like the "kiss of death" (200)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: 10 is surely lav for spades|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nilsland:  could be 500 if East was a man and not a mouse :P|pg||
nt|jbgood: 8 confirming|pg||
nt|jbgood: wouldnt tell him that to him face to face if i were you:)|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: one dobled 4@h - for a shared top - 5@c x'ed also gave 500|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 200 was a very good score|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will there be a new leader after this round Jon?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Perhaps not if the Germans bid and make 7NT here|pg||
nt|jbgood: do not thionk so  - they have a lot to go on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: so much for the grand - if Bjarni has a good round he may take the lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  East can be squeezed in the minors for 13 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nilsland:  They led by 100 but only this board should cost that|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so we may have an icelandic pair back in the lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - seems as they dont play the principle of fast arrival showing less|pg||
mc|13|nt|nilsland:  only 1 pair missed slam - the pressure?|pg||
nt|jbgood: just the system i think -. preassure is vastly overrated'|pg||
