mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: the 2S overcall showed spade plus a minor|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: Declarer cannot afford to duck the first club or a spade shift will be fatal|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: West shud raise to 3C|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|gracelin: in balancing position, north may not have a typical t/o double so south retreated to the safe 2D instead of a possible 4-3 spade fit|pg||

mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: on the other hand, if West did raise to 3C in previous round and north double, then south may prefer 3S than 3D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: West needs to duck the first trump play to deny dummy the entry to finesse his D10 later|pg||

mb|1N|nt|gracelin: in closed room north opened 3S to show any solid suit and south rightly chose to play there|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: here I would think it's difficult for south not to go 4S|pg||
mb|r|an|have one 5 card suit|nt|gracelin: if north bids 2C now, it may slow down south a bit|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|gracelin: and 3C is making easily|pg||

nt|gracelin: looking at 4-hand, we know the good breaks and 12 tricks are easy.  But to declarer this is a quite complicated hand.|pg||
