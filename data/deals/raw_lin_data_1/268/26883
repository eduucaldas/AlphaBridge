nt|warrens:  an alternative would be to X 2@D's, but that would more likely be 44 or 45 in the black suits|pg||

mb|1S|nt|frankaus: staying out of slam brought 11 to brown|pg||
nt|ianmcc: after @h wins he knows about trumps|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ianmcc: this should be a quiet 4@s|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: yeah so crossing to ace of clubs and diamond hook was certainly a legitimate and better line|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|petergill: In last year's Grand Final of this event, Peter Newman and Matthew Thomson came from behind to win the Grand Final, having come from behind against Ish, Justin Lall, Joe Grue et al ...|pg||
nt|petergill: to win their semi final|pg||
nt|bebechira: closed room finished|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: Ish bid 4@h for a lead with no intention of partner going past 4@S - Ish knew they'd bid 4@S. |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 14: so Ish will not be too happy with Howard's decision to bid 4!NT over 4@S, which was marginal at best|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, South passed over 2@S.  3@C is a little pushy, but reasonable imho|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C shows 5404, perhaps with extra values|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  Ish showing secondary @H support.  I suppose his partner might be 5503, but I doubt it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: I think N/S play Gazzilli, whereby a 2@C rebid over 1NT shows a weak hand with natural clubs, or various 16+ hands (though I am not 100% sure)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|warrens:  on a @D lead he will have lots of trouble.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: think 3@C is fine,,,  heck bidding @C may be the only way to get to your game in @C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: Howard Melbourne visited our biggest event (400+ tables in one room, world class field) the Gold Coast Congress about 8 times in the last decade. He won the GC Teams twice, and the ...|pg||

nt|petergill: Despite his 5440 shape, Terry Brown passed 2@s at the other table because his strong spades opposite a doubleton made 5@C unlikely to make, a good decision by Terry as it turns out|pg||
nt|petergill: with Axxxx, Axxx, void, AQxx, Terry would have bid 3@C over 2@S, I think|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: in case 5@C was making opposite say xx, Kx, xxxx, KJ10xx|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it was the winning decision...  not so sure it was the right one|pg||

nt|petergill: Bruce topped the datums in the Seniors with Arjuna Delivera, with Kim partnering Simon Hinge as their teammates. |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|3S!|nt|warrens:  this will do it for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: If Bruce Neill wins the double, it will be a sparkling return to top form. In 2007 he made the Aussie Open Team, came 5th of 22 in the Bermuda Bowl (excellent result), then he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: became Chairman of the 2nd biggest bridge body in Australia, stepped down from that role a month ago and is shining. |pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: Bruce's excellent 2007 form was shortly after he retired from work, an interesting (non?)-coincidence|pg||

mc|12|nt|petergill: South's 3@H bid at fav vul was good as it stopped West from cueing 4@H which leads to 6@D|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Warren|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H bid I mean, lead-directing en route to 4@S a really great bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Bruce perhaps was not sure if Pass of 4@H was forcing in the non-regular partnership, 4@s and 5@C cues were out and 4NT - 5@H response is very awkward, so he settled for 5@D, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: thinking he was endplayed in the bidding by South's great bid. |pg||
nt|petergill: but if the looks a bit more deeply into it, what can East have for 3@S but AQxx in @d's and AKQxx in clubs, so @CJ is huge. |pg||
nt|petergill: so he should bite the bullet, bid 4NT and end up in a shaky (very shaky after North's Dbl) 6@d if partner has Q, Qx, A8xx, AKQxxx|pg||
nt|petergill: because the AQxx, AKQxx(x) hand is much more likely|pg||
nt|petergill: play resumes soon|pg||
nt|petergill: in perhaps 10 to 15 minutes I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Ellena for her usual excellenl job as operator|pg||
nt|petergill: Ellena (our operator) won a Bronze Medal at the World Junior Championships in Taicang last year. |pg||
