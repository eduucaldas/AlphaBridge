nt|babs59: yes both articles were excellent - and Peter Marley contributed an earlier Mollo take-off too|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd only vote against Melbourne if I was in the opposition team :)|pg||
nt|serhat: so you dont care about the rest Barbie?|pg||
nt|petergill: Later in Friday's Bulletin, I pulled out a wrong card from my hand (@DQ in 1NT) and the Bulletin Editor who was at my side has no idea that I simply dislodged the wrong card - not ...|pg||

nt|petergill: This event - the story so far - perhaps the top 8 teams in the event made yesterday's quarter finals, then Otvosi's Polish stars who came top chose Brown's 6th seeds who smashed ...|pg||
nt|petergill: them. M Thomson (Del'monte) chose the Indonesia Ladies (2nd in the world recently) and won, my team Bloom chose and lost to Beauchamp, leaving Klinger to play Ware. Astonishingly, ...|pg||
