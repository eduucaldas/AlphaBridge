mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  does S double again?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|Henryb:  I guess 3@h must have shown more than nothing|pg||
nt|roswolf:  south should protect even though north will be uncomfortable but the raise to game will test her dummy play!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|eggy:  I thnk that 2 doubles with SOuth was enough to show the hand though|pg||
nt|roswolf:  4@s is a solo flight which may well score well on this layout|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|Henryb:  which on N or S should have doubled? I think N|pg||

nt|roswolf:  this  is a bits and pieces hand|pg||
nt|eggy:  I doubt that so many will bid to 4H will they?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|Henryb:  probably not - is this a pairs trial or a team trial?|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the scoring by cross-imps?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|Henryb:  I would not dream of opening a 15-17 1NT with that|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a pairs trial the first 3 pairs get invited to form a team|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Cross Imps - maximum +25 for the winners|pg||
nt|eggy:  You can find the pairs in this event on http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/ladiestrials.htm|pg||

nt|Henryb:  the contract would be the same after 1@h - 1@s - 1N|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|eggy:  Three of our current world champion team are in the field, Nicola Smith, Sally Brock and Heather, although none with their habitual partners|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|3H|nt|Henryb:  not really? Pass? 3@c would seem automatic with the N hand|pg||
nt|Henryb:  maybe 5@c now?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|Henryb:  I think Heather missed the boat on this one|pg||

nt|roswolf: this should make shouldnt it?|pg||
nt|eggy:  I think so|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c6|nt|eggy:  as long as Erichsen takes a low spade ruff then a high one|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|eggy:  she will also need to play a diamond, so playing a trump that early may make it a bit more tricky|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer must be clear headed|pg||
nt|eggy:  but still doable I think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|Henryb:  A little unlucky that both kings were offside, but if they were both on N-S would have a slam|pg||

nt|eggy:  Did you say it was x imps divided down Simon?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Cross IMPs, yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: another a big hand for n/s to negotiate|pg||
nt|Henryb:  what system are N-S playing that North passes?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|eggy:  oh and then VPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: north didnt pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt or 4@h is likely|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  I would NEVER open 1NT with 4@s and 5@c|pg||
nt|Henryb:  even with a client|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is too optimistic - i play 3@d is gf whereas 4@d is a slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Cross IMPs - no VPs.  Winner's score capped if over 25|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|eggy:  Not sure if Heather would with Nevena - if it went wrong, it wouldn;t be viewed very well|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  even with my aunt Sadie, who takes two tricks less than anyone else when I let her get her hands on the dummy :)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|roswolf: this is a yucky slam on a @d lead you would be likely to go down most of the time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  Ms Caplan is ambitious|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy:  Still we seem to have arrived in a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: well declarer can scarcely go wrong here - fortune again favors the bold|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Doesn't lok that bad to me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eggy:  when you say most Geoffrey, that isn;t thesame as less than half is it?|pg||
nt|eggy:  club finesse or CQ single I think is OK, with 6-0 hearts on the downside|pg||
nt|eggy:  same in 6NT of course (except the heart break) ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: actually you are right with the @c discard on the @SA|pg||
nt|eggy:  but rather more down when it fails|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I think you make any time trumps are reasonable and either diamonds break or the @cQ is on: about 70%, no?|pg||
nt|eggy:  club discard no good|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: indeed but that is very fortuitous|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|eggy:  as you can't reach the club suit that way|pg||

nt|roswolf: are these 12bd matches?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzar: Six boards|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: hmm this may lead to interesting play|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah -then 4 matches tonight?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  1@h is not the recommended opening bid with 5-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Yes - 4 matches - 5 min break|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|eggy:  true, but you wouldn;t want false preference to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: lays a trap of sorts -but for whom?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy:  Well this 1H seems to have worked swimmingly so far|pg||
nt|Henryb:  In this case for N-S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|an|4 card raise 9-11|nt|roswolf: no doubt 4@s will be reached but 3nt may be better|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@d might be a 4 card limit raise|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Did you notice that South could have made 3N by running the clubs?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|Henryb:  West has to make three pitches. a spade and a diamond are easy.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|eggy:  but the next diamond allows a strip|pg||
nt|Henryb:  And if you open 1@c, get a 1@h overcall, and reach 3N, you might well work it out|pg||
nt|eggy:  so if West sees it comong she should pitch 2 spades and the DT - hard for declarer then|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: meanwhile declarer has made 12 tricks|pg||
mc|12|nt|roswolf: ok see you in 7 mins|pg||
nt|eggy:  Thanks - a table of delights for everyone|pg||
nt|eggy:  At this table we will have two world champions (Nicloa Smith 4 times over plus innumerable other honours)|pg||
nt|eggy:  There partners are less experienced, but Kitty Teltscher has a bronze Olympiad medal from Istanbul and Catherine Seale regularly plays in strong teams in the London Superleague|pg||
nt|eggy:  So it should prove a good match up.|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I see, Steve, that Mike Gold left you his typing fingers|pg||

mb|3S|nt|roswolf: south in particular is very aggressive|pg||
nt|eggy:  Fawcett and Moore have both played a fair amount of international bridge, whereas EW are more "local"|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|eggy:  Hard for East to visualise what West had from x imo|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed that is why 3nt was a serious option|pg||

nt|roswolf: i dont like that 3 card raise on a flat hand|pg||
nt|Henryb:  the @dxxx is really a bad holding|pg||
