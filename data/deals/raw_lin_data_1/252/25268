nt|hedyg:  the official website: http://www.buffettcup.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Fantoni studying the board|pg||
nt|kit: North more likely to have minor-suit length, so declarer will be making his minor-suit plays under that assumption.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  playing S for Ax in @H wont help since it would only give trick|pg||
nt|hedyg:  so he will look elsewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: we have been told that there will be 5 matches played today instead of 4|pg||
nt|hedyg:  so we will have 1 more match after this 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: yes, not sure which european has to leave early on Thurs., so accomodations are being made|pg||

pc|hT|nt|kit: Seems like North could have checked for 4-4 spade fit before committing to 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: board a match... 1 point per win|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg:  right, ty Phyllis|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: 4 points for winning the match...2 for a tie and 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|pbundy: scoring is a hybrid of imps and board a match|pg||
nt|pbundy: first a board is scored as imps|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1 point / win, 1/2 for push|pg||
nt|kit: West would have been better ducking the heart, but from his point of view his partner might have had Qxx from the low heart lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: if it is 110 in one room and 120 in the other - no imps scored, so a push|pg||
nt|pbundy: but - once at least one imp is scored - then it becomes a win and a loss for each team respectively|pg||
nt|pbundy: so - no imps scored is a tie - 1 imp or more - a win or a loss|pg||
nt|pbundy: you can thank the ryder cup :)  trying to model itself after that golf competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: thanks peggy... i had it wrong|pg||

nt|pbundy: oh - it is quite complicated!  took me some instruction to understand it|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Fantunes lead small from odd in partners suit|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|kit: so no difference between 110 and 100, or 90 and 100.  That could change some strategy a lot.|pg||

nt|hedyg:  Slawinski leads: small from even with honour or odd without|pg||
nt|hedyg:  small from odd in pd's suit|pg||
nt|kit: also makes playing 3NT vs. 4 of major a lot less attractive|pg||

pc|dT|nt|hedyg:  maybe higher than that|pg||
nt|kit: East will know to shift to a club regardless -- but West has to be careful to hold onto the heart protection|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: the scores aren't right because the other room was down for awhile, so don't trust the scores|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: Other problem with showing nothing in hearts is that if declarer believes it he will be able to take the heart finesse.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: East should know declarer has queen of clubs since his partner didn't play it, so 8 of clubs safe play|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: nunes covers the card he plays, so hard to follow|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: He can afford 1 club an 1 heart, but the last discard not so easy.  But declarer won't know where king of hearts is.|pg||
