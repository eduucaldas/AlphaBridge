pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  no other opening looks promising, although|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S should take care and cash his @s A when in with @h A|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  otherwise, E will be allowed for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for those spectators which miss scores to compare: each Europe pair is drawn to compare with US pair|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but not with the pair they are playing against|pg||

pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  so, passing 2@h N is sure that he doesn't miss the game|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kjadams: ducking this can hold to 3.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|kjadams: does not look like a way for defense to recover from trick 1 without help from declarer.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kjadams: declarer may be worried that heart Ace with East and that a club ruff looming.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but even if he tries to escape and pitch his last club on @d - to avoid ruff - he succeeds|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I doubt that he'll aply this risky play, though|pg||

mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  defence can't go wrong here|pg||
nt|kjadams: must shift to a diamond.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  extremely lucky lay of the cards for EW for @s game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even after @dA start and @d ruff, declarer will be able to pitch 2 @h losers on @d-s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, if any EW pair reached the game (or was made to bid it after opps preempt).|pg||
