nt|d23nh3: why?:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ritong: because it is physically impossible|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: There we go, that's 15-18 balanced|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: I have been given this link to share: http://bridgewinners.com/article/view/2012-buffett-cup-live-results/|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Since he did'nt bid 1NT, Fantoni limits himself to 14-17, now he's sohwing the upper end and a source of tricks|pg||
nt|vbman: rr|pg||
nt|Walddk2: BridgeGoth, since you are from Finland, a spectator who does not speak English is asking if you can answer the following question .....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Vai oliko partneri ovelasti hyödyntänyt bridgelain salliman mahdollisuuden hyväksyä riittämätön tarjous 1H, jolloin pääsi ilmaisukahdentamaan vähän alemmalla tasolla?|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Fantoni limits his hand to 11 with his 2@S bid, so he clearly has a 4@S  bid after Nunes shows a good fitting hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridgegoth: A@C opening lead would have been magic, but tough to find here, now it looks like Fantoni can set up his tricks before Moss can get a @H|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: He may have some entry issues if he misgusses @Cs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: K@C seems to make sense, now a ruff helpful to the defense|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridgegoth: that was certainly not helpful to the defense, Fantoni will likely draw trumps and finesse the @C as a safety play and find 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: the only worry with that line is 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: It appears even if trumps 4-1, if he ruffs and overtakes the @S, he can still make it by guessing @Cs later, however we all know that he does not need to worry about that.|pg||
