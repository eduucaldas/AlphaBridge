mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pbundy: interesting.  this may be some sort of "reverse" lebensohl that DENIES a spade stopper|pg||

nt|pbundy: today, the pairs are matched with a pair from the other team.  a win for each pairing is 4 points; ties are 2 points - |pg||
nt|pbundy: so - every round, a team has the opportunity to pick up 12 points max|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pbundy: there goes dummy's entry|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pbundy: of course, if diamonds were splitting OR the 10 dropping, it would be right to just play on diamonds and take a ton of tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pbundy: thomas hoping for some honor crashes here :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: a break in the action; declarer has left the room|pg||
nt|pbundy: another inquiry about our location.  omaha, nebraska -  home of warren buffett, for whom the event is named!|pg||
nt|pbundy: declarer has returned - but - hurd has not yet played|pg||
nt|pbundy: oops - perhaps that was NOT declarer who left; it appears that the names are actually reversed.|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - as i mentioned - wooldridge is a VERy deliberate player.  so - the long thought makes a bit more sense|pg||
nt|pbundy: for those who are curious about the scoring TODAY - it is BAM for each round, with each pair from one continent comparing with one from the other|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|pbundy: IF you win your match, you get 4 points; ties are worth 2|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pbundy: so - each team can win a max of 12 points each round|pg||
nt|pbundy: a good switch|pg||

nt|3for3: north south playing 4@H?|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|3for3: strong 2@C|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|3for3: 2@H likely an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|3for3: allows michel an easy lead directing double|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: now hurd, with heart stopper doesnt want to bid nt, and potentially wrong side or get to nt with no heart stopper|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|3for3: i suspect hurd will settle for 3n|pg||
nt|3for3: though it is possible to be in 6@C with these cards|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: wooldridge's lack of club spots would be key...|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|3for3: so, high heart lead, likely ducked...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|3for3: then diamond shift seems normal|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|3for3: notice thomas needs to give attitude towards the jack of @H, so he cant give Suit preference as well|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|3for3: this would be an easier hand at imps, but at pairs or board a match, each trick can swing the result|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s9|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|3for3: thomas was squeezed out of his long spade, if Wooldridge can read it, will make 5 now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|3for3: well done|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|mc|11|nt|3for3: if thomas had kept 3 spades, could have been stripped of his reds, and thrown in with jack of spades to lead from his spade honor|pg||
