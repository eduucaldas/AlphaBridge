nt|chip: not sure if 3D is a Q/value bid and 3S a Q, or an ask (with 3S showing shortness in D).|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: passin science and picking a likely contract.   Needs to get the clubs right, and might get enough of a count to go right.|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|chip: declarer has to guess whether to finesse or not. If he does finesse E should shift to a D (he can read the 6 C as high).|pg||
nt|chip: D shift holds it to 4.|pg||

nt|chip: looks like it will be on a heart guess (N needed to lead a non-spade to beat it for sure, club gets down 2).|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chip: but spade was normal enough.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|chip: If declarer plays a heart and missguesses, then he may be squeeze endplayed for down 2.|pg||
nt|chip: and down 2 immediately if spades are 6-3, but look like they are 5-4.|pg||
nt|chip: declarer now suspects EW can make 4S (losing a trick in each side suit), so doesn't want to go -200 and lose to 140 or 170.|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: bathroom break|pg||
nt|chip: when NS get into the auction over a strong club or 1D opening.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|chip: On the actual hand, even if he leads a heart to the Q, the NS hearts are blocked, so can always go down 1. Now looks like he gives up on his heart play from dummy, but can now exit ...|pg||
nt|chip: with the heart K to good effect.|pg||
