nt|ahollan1: if vP relays, he will learn Verhees 6@H 4@D  which will discourage him|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think the scoring is "silly" - I would matchpoint (or imp) each of the pairs sitting N-S with the three pairs of the same team sitting E-W. Using the 2-1-0 (European) matchpointing, each board would allow a total of six points|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: they just differentiate  between 6 to AKQ and suits not that good|pg||

nt|ahollan1: their 2@C-2M not as constructive as Precision 2@C which guarantees long @C|pg||
