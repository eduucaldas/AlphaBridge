nt|robinswr: if you were leading standard and had 10976 you're second lead would be the six|pg||
nt|robinswr: therefore south should know that partner led a 3-card suit|pg||
nt|gerstman: south is still working for clues:  44 hearts and knock out the ace of spades or hearts not breaking and try the diamond first.  of course if the diamonds do not break that sets up ...|pg||
nt|gerstman: a 5th trick for the defense if the hearts were 44|pg||

nt|robinswr: if he guesses the hand correct he'll make 10 tricks|pg||

nt|robinswr: my guess is that north will misguess clubs|pg||
nt|robinswr: my guess is 430|pg||
nt|gerstman: the hand may play itself as there is no entry back to the clubs without using hte ace of spades|pg||
nt|gerstman: east's best play is to win the first or second diamond and play diamonds, assuming he wants to hold declarer to minimum number of tricks and concedess making the hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: if east continues spades, the hurd might guess clubs correctly. the percentage is to play east for the queen since you can pick up the 4-2 and don't lose to the singleton queen|pg||
