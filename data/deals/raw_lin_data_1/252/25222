nt|ahollan1: USA has won both sets 8-4  but I'm not sure about the individual breakdown of "matches"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you check the tournament web page  http://www.buffettcup.com    you'll see team for this side of pond referred to as USA and North America -- less typing with the former|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: many defenders use the order of play in trump to describe suit preference|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: so if being used, Lall @S5  @S7 prefers @C|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: but as mentioned before   Hamman has never been fond of signalling|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i mentioned the 3@S rebid because actual hand LOOKS like Smolen, but that was just a coincidence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yke:  vugraph operator, can you change the name to Van Prooijen?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: usually balanced hand 1@D is decent 12-14|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: so Verhees decision was optional|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm sure vP responded 1@S showing 4+ suit and usually less than game force|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|yke:  but why didn't verhees supported  spades?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a good question yke --  maybe  auction was really  P-P-1@D-P//1@H ??|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact that makes much more sense since Louk's  hand doesn't really qualify for 1@D opener|pg||

mb|2H|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D=5+@S & 5+@D, stronger than (2@H)-3@H|pg||
nt|yke:  the bidding was probably -p -p 1@D -p 1@H -p 1NT -p 2@H. which makes a lot of sense|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  (2@H)-3@H  can stop in 3@S/4@C/@D   but (2@H)-4m = forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H = slam interest in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that only makes sense with west being passed hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|yke:  I would have led the @CQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yke:  to try to force declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: right -- why try for ruffs with natural trump winners|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yke:  oops|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|yke:  this can't be happening|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this line shows why it is so important to set up side suit early|pg||
mc|11|nt|yke:  probably one off|pg||
nt|yke:  but im just guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BBO results are UNOFFICIAL  [i.e. i'm sure no overtrick]|pg||

nt|yke:  commentry doesn't make much sense like this. We are constantly guessing what happened|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: and transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman learning new tricks :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is there any way to beat this??|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs NT  Ace asks attitude|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|yke:  no, 9 tricks, due to the fact that @SAK is in West|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: majority  input   @Sx lead  --  some  commenting about potential based on Hamman's age|pg||
nt|yke:  claim|pg||
mc|12|pg||

mb|p|nt|yke:  12, that''s a lof tricks :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yke:  I like the @SA lead|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S, if 2-suiter then 2nd is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4+fit|pg||
nt|yke:  can 1@S be balanced?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i take that back   could be 5332|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not 4@S and balanced hand|pg||
nt|yke:  well then I think 3@S by van prooijen might make some sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: delayed 2N unusual -- showing ANY 2-suits|pg||
nt|yke:  but he probably bid only 2@S because South was a passed hand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: and 10 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  9 losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yke:  you can't count 2 spade losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why can't i?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 6 tables in play all sessions|pg||
nt|yke:  because partner has 4, so even opposite xxxx you have a chance of only one loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at 3  NS = Europe   at 3  NS = USA|pg||
nt|yke:  but ofcourse you are allowed to count it as 2 :) I just don't agree ;)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|yke:  I think van prooijen regrets his 2@S bid now|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|yke:  well maybe they make 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even opposite known 5-card suit, i would still count 2 losers -- but in that case with an asterisk "*"  since highly unlikely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that after finding 8+@S fit that Verhees did NOT disclose his longer suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yke:  this helps|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|yke:  but it would even make on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: fantunes in 5@C   wolpert-levin never in the auction|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: and because many have asked   North is  Justin Lall  [son of Hemant]|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is new partnership after the split-up of Hamman-Zia|pg||

pc|h7|pc|c7|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yke:  but they have played before right? just before hamman played with zia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been shamed into mentioning that NS did win the inaugural 6-session Platinum Pairs  prior to the Nickell team Hamman-Zia shuffle|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: and if memory serves  that wasn't long after Justin was on the Silver Medal team in the 2011 Bermuda Bowl  [won be EW's team]|pg||
