mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bridgegoth: Interesting note about the Fantunes system, had Jenny passed, Nunes would open 1NT :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: I am being told we do not have any individual results at the moment, only the overall score, which is 16-8 in favor of the US|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|bridgegoth: This might not be a good result for Fantunes, looks like 4@S makeable|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bridgegoth: She need not worry near as much as she might think. @Hs must be 4-1 for this to happen, so she knows on defense they will get no @Hs, 1@S, 1@D, and 1@C, so she just must just avoid ...|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: A couple people mentioning what happens if Levin pitches a @D instead of ruffing, she will make it.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I would X with Fantoni's hand in their system then bid 3NT over whatever Nunes says|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: He need not worry about Nunes forcing a @S contract, X denies 6@S and X denies 3!X|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: denies 3@S|pg||
