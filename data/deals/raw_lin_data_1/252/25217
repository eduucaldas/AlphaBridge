mb|1H|mb|2H|an|spades and wide range|mb|3D!|an|no alert|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: another strong club here and a negative D response. Even at this Vul, E gets his lead director in.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|chip: 5D looks to be a trick short, though some chance of a black suit squeeze against E if the defense goes wrong.|pg||

mb|p|nt|chip: 2C is natural, typically 6+ card suit.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|chip: whether forcing nor not, N will raise and will reach 4S. A of clubs lead will beat 4S, but doubt that will happen.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chip: Guess it was NF, but surprised N didn't raise (not a great hand, but a good fit).|pg||
