nt|kit: Well, maybe this really did happen?|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Nunes has a 1NT opening, 12-14|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: would be very surprised if East did open 1NT, that isn't a very good 14|pg||
nt|kit: East's hand is so junky he might have just miscounted it by a king -- but I still don't believe it.|pg||
nt|kit: They do play 14-16|pg||
