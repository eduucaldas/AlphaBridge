nt|bridgegoth: 2@S: inv with exactly 4@S|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|scotty: How would he invite with FIVE spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: He would use 2NT I believe with 4+|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: sorry 5+|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: sorry 2@H|pg||
nt|kit: Well, they did find the only game which has a chance -- but it still isn't very good game.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Yes I hear you Roland, I think with 5@S he would use 2@H|pg||
nt|scotty: And if partner bid 3@d?  I don't see how this system can work|pg||

nt|scotty: Now the club goes on the heart|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: sorry, rare sequence :(|pg||
nt|kit: now diamond to ace, 9 of hearts for club discard, and the awful game actually makes.  Obviously South could have done better ducking the opening lead.|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@s apparently 4!+spades invitational|pg||
mc|10|nt|bridgegoth: Yes exactly invitational, I had to get my notes out|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Last board, thanks everyone for joining us, we hope to see you all back for the next segment. Special thanks to our operator and our great commentators on both voice and here in ...|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: the room.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: For those asking: 2@H would be a forcing relay: 2@S is EXACTLY invitational with 4+@S|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Sorry I misexplained 2@S, I had to look on my system notes|pg||
