nt|rbeye2: who is the operator here?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  looks like East has shown spades and a minor with 2@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  West knows that East is short in @h and so expects the hands to fit well even though East's second suit is surely diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer does not know how well everything is breaking|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but usually right to play to make rather cut losses|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has a decision whether to try for the clubs or the diamonds|pg||
nt|queequeg: Article written by Fulvio Fantoni (participating for European Team) about the Buffett Cup:|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer takes the club finesse, this will set up the suit even if it loses|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://www.fulviofantoni.com/en/50-latest-news/100-buffett-cup.html|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  then if trumps are 3-2 the contract is home|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  5-card majors, 2/1, natural system|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Thomas Bessis and Michel Bessis are the only pair without a system card filed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: they seem to be playing 2 way ckbk|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: so 2@C relay to 2@D, then 3NT = 5@S , balanced choice of contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  South chooses a heart lead, unbid major, knowing North has most the entries|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will be pleased to see the king appear|pg||
nt|pelu:  here is a link to NS-system: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/france/bessis-bessis.pdf|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South could not be sure whether North had continued with the 10 just to pin the 9|pg||
mc|8|nt|yorkbeach:  or whether the 10 was some sort of signal - but well judged to overtake|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not see how that was -50|pg||

mb|2H|nt|pelu:  operator why not down 2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  2@h = both majors 3-8|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  not quite what North wanted to hear :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still cautious to pass with 18|pg||
nt|mildredb: NV 2@H = 4+4+ w. 4-8 hcp|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  North did not have an invitational 2NT available - 2Nt would have been an enquiry - so 3NT or pass|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h on the 4-2 fit will be more fun to play|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if a little slower :(|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on a normal 3-1 club break, declarer can see only 4 sure winners|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another reason why North might have passed 2@h is the hope that East would bid something|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  sometimes the play does not go exactly as we see it on screen|pg||
nt|pelu:  Hi Operator, pl. check the last 2 results|pg||
nt|mildredb: -1 |pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  range is 6-10|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for 2@h|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  with the misfit East takes the cautious view|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tactics are similar to matchpoint pairs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so less pushing for thin games than you would usually see|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 9 lead suggests the king is offside |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might try a ruffing finesse against the king|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the NS system card seems to suggest they are playing zero or two higher leads|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  so the 10 was the right lead but declarer should have known the king was offside|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  with 9 cards missing the queen, the odds suggest playing for the drop|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  all the more so when opponents pass throught, suggesting they do not have extreme shape|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  textbook auction so far|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South does not mind defending 4@h, which may explain why he passed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  EW have judged well to stay out of game (as the cards lie)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  with the @cQ and @dQ both offside, 10 tricks the limit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this time declarer will be planning to finesse South for the @dQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|dJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but cashes one top diamond first in case North has the bare Q|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has length in spades, which is why South is likely to hold the @dQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  having found the news in trumps, declarer should play clubs rather than hearts because the club spots are better|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  but has to consider the possiblity of cashing the @hAK first in case the queen drops|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would do that if this was IMPs and the contract was 5@d|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but here does not want to risk setting up the @hQ for South to cash when in with the @cQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mildredb: IMPs less wearing on declarers than MPs|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  as does South|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  on board 7 we think the score should be 130 rather than 150|pg||
nt|mildredb: great lead by Jill|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  looks like a misunderstanding by NS|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will need a lot right to make this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but cards do lie well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will need to finesse the @dQ to dispose of the @hJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and hope for help in the black suits too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  risks going an extra one down byt having overbid seems right to play to make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Eats's @s10 is probably going to take the setting trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East's|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is thinking how many tricks EW could make in @d|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|hJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  the finesse was attractive in view of East's overcall|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West knows that North started with only 3 red cards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be expecting them to be 6-4 rather than 5-5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  but if they are 64, hard to see how to beat this|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lack of entries to dummy a problem|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer knows it is unlikely that trumps are 2-2 and clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhpas right to play the s!A and taking a view depending upon the size of East's card|pg||
nt|mildredb: he could easily go dn 2 |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East dtops the K or Q, trumps are probably 3-1|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  drops|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||

mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  South liked the well placed @d and the 4th spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|yorkbeach:  with a singleton in her partner's suit, West might have looked elsewhere if she had a 5-card suit of her own|pg||
