mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|warrens:  Phyllis, do you?  I would guess around 30 now.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaq: 25 i think|pg||

nt|warrens:  This is just what Europe wanted,  a board likely to be flat.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other matches   Europe up by 1 in one match  USA up by 1 in one match|pg||

mb|1C|nt|pbundy: and - preempting in diamonds would not be everyone's cup of tea in any case with the south hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pbundy: we might see 1@D tho|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pbundy: i am guessing that 2@H shows both majors|pg||
