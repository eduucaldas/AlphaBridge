pc|c6|nt|djneill:  very odd|pg||
pc|h2|nt|djneill:  West is basically planning on North not to have messed up, so may cash out here rather than go down extra, but South just pitched a @h!|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2H|nt|bridgegoth: Trying to play it :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H!|nt|bridgegoth: Correct, with regards to defensive bidding, Fantunes play mostly natural and standard treatments|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: N/S play Slavenski leads, so he will give count based on his honor holding|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  NV, West goes for a steal here|pg||
nt|djneill:  down 1 or 2 might be fine vs N-S's 1NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  scoring is board-a-match, so the little 10 or 20 point difference is the whole board|pg||
pc|hT|nt|djneill:  N-S can make +120 in 1NT on a club lead by East, 1 club, 4 diamonds, 2 hearts, 1 spade|pg||
nt|djneill:  so down 2 here might be fine|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||

nt|djneill:  but if 1NT makes just +90 other room, down 2 here is bad|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c9|nt|djneill:  diamonds blocked, down 1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|djneill:  so probably a win for Europe - defending 1NT can be difficult, better to be declaring than defending|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Also probably a better choice than his other option, a nebulous 1@D|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: They allow 4 card majors in 3rd seat|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: losing 3@D, 2@H, 1@C and 1@S in the process|pg||

nt|djneill:  so a swing but not for the reason I thought|pg||
mb|1D|nt|djneill:  welcome danny|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|djneill:  1@d precision, 2+@d 10-15, may have longer @c|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|djneill:  as 1NT denies a 4 card major, South might rebid clubs here to get to some sort of minor contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|djneill:  3@d seems to be preemptive since there is no game possible opposite 10-15|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  East never got to mention the @s, which plays pretty well, so kudos to Cheek|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|djneill:  South kind of knows that E-W have a lot of HCP and West did not bid @s over 2@c so suspects East has all the HCP|pg||
nt|djneill:  must eliminate East's @h and @c and throw in with @dQ, else East sticks South on dummy and gets a @dJ as North tries to return|pg||
nt|djneill:  still a likely win for the US since even 3@s has no problem|pg||
nt|djneill:  hard to believe but the short @d made it easier to find @d|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: cannot be 5422, but can be 6322|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: I would XX, Fantoni knows that Nunes very likely has a 2nd suit, |pg||
nt|bridgegoth: They haven't doubled 2M for penalty yet, and unlikely they would pass a double holding only 5 trumps.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 2@D also a possibility, however no bid is clear here|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: This unfortunately is one of the weaknesses of the system, when 2 bids are passed around|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

nt|djneill:  brd 3 other table, South opened a precision 2@c and West (Sontag) went for the gold by Passing East's reopening takeout double|pg||
nt|djneill:  Bessis T should not reveal the @hAK if possible, else it will make the rest of the hand readable for N-S|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe a low @h?|pg||
nt|djneill:  would be suspicious to say the least|pg||
nt|djneill:  East has denied a 4 card major|pg||
nt|djneill:  East is afraid of a club shift|pg||
nt|djneill:  down 1 seems to be the result unless East can find a way to score a @s too|pg||
nt|djneill:  another @s|pg||
nt|djneill:  opponents may play @d but the 1NT kind of promises diamonds|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bridgegoth: Yes, @C could work to, tough vs this auction because you aren' sure what anyone has|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: In a standard auction, east would be marked with at least 4, usually 5 @Cs, so a @C would be much less attractive. But here you just don't know.|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|djneill:  4@c, 3@d, 2@s, 1@h - I think South will take the chance on @h if the spades are not removed by then|pg||
