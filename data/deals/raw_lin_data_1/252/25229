nt|sfoxa:  with singleton in the view, lot of pairs signalling suit preference, not attitude|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it would help E find @d shift|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at the first glance, defence has 2 tricks in @d, 1 club and 1 heart, but declarer had to manage @c ruff or dicard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so will rather go down, but I was wrong with predictions last board|pg||
