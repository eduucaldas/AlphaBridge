mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pbundy: scoring is not what we are used to seeing|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: this is IMPS.  but - each board, after being scored at imps is THEN turned into a win or loss|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pbundy: so - 110 and 120 would be a tie|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|pbundy: but - something like 100 and 200 would be an imp differential - so that would turn into a win and a loss respectively for the teams|pg||
nt|pbundy: buffett's rules are different from all others :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gerstman: a pretty routine hand with the ace of spades singleton onside, no chance of three rounds of trumps so two club ruffs will be easy|pg||
nt|pbundy: this does indeed look like one of those boards where no one will score|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|gerstman: 9 trumps and 26 hcp's; two trump losers, a push across the room regardles of which room it is|pg||
nt|pbundy: sometimes the Great Shuffler does not deal us excitement.  not too often, however!|pg||
nt|pbundy: and now and then the players seem to steal excitement from boredom!|pg||
nt|gerstman: so peggy, while we're waiting for the king of hearts, just what are those rules?|pg||
nt|pbundy: for the scoring, danny?|pg||
nt|pbundy: for today, it is a team event|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gerstman: im amazed by that pass of 2H; you'd think a new suit by responder is forcing regardless of what the opps are doing|pg||
nt|gerstman: poor joel with the most quick tricks at the table|pg||
nt|gerstman: if he does pass it out, will he lead a diamond or a trump?  it appears the trump would work best. hard to imagine 3H making if 3 rds of trumps are played|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|pbundy: double dummy i think this could have been beaten (low club from opener)|pg||
nt|pbundy: but - this does NOT seem to be the way|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|gerstman: joel of course has no idea johnny has such good spades, but he does know he has 4 of them.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|gerstman: he must have your low club comment peg|pg||
nt|gerstman: but it's going to be tough to beat now.  if declarer plays a trump, joel has to grab it to give johnny the ruff and then he can't play a 2nd after getting that ruff.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|gerstman: if declarer leads a club, it will be easy to beat:  ace of clubs and a ruff and then ace of hearts, heart.|pg||
