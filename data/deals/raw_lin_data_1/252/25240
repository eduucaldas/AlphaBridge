nt|bridgegoth: 1@H 14+ unless 5@H + 4@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gizzydrop: this not the auction |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|bridgegoth: here is how the auction likely went:|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 1@H, 2@C(forcing with @Hs, or inv+ with @Cs/bal), 2@S (@ds) 3@H, 3N(non serious) 4@H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridgegoth: Would you agree that would be our auction Adam?|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: i agree, and this contract has no problems|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 1NT surprises me, i would treat that as 17-19 and open 1@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gizzydrop: You are on your own there =)|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: E/W play a strong 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|bridgegoth: not sure what 2NT was all about, but 3NT looks normal|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: diamond lead gives an extra trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: now the @H guess will decide if he has a sure win, or a likely win of the board|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|gizzydrop: Fantoni may feel some pressure on 4 discards, may pitch one |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: nope, he is letting spades go|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pc|c7|nt|gizzydrop: someone points out 6@C makes...not exactly a good contract though|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: nor really possible to reach, balanced 16 and balanced 12, this is "Everybody's 3NT"|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|pc|c3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|cQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: it sure feels like Fantoni is protecting 4@hs with his discards|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|gizzydrop: more space for north to have the J@h|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Great play there|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: It did seem to make sense though, and in BAM, that extra trick can be worth a whole board very easily|pg||

mb|r|mb|1S|nt|bridgegoth: XX usually 6-8|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|gizzydrop: 3@D now, a competitive hand with @D support|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Would say at least inv though, he did XX|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bridgegoth: Fantoni does'nt really have anything else to say, so 3@D likely ends the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gizzydrop: what do we know|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridgegoth: I suspect David will find the killing lead here|pg||

pc|dK|nt|gizzydrop: 4@D was the limit to the hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridgegoth: I would have passed with Fantoni's hand, he already said he had 14+ and 5@D, he really didn't have anything extra to offer, and Jxxx@S not helpful either|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 2@D asking for clarification|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: full relay auction coming up|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|gizzydrop: 2@H=3+@H|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 2@H 3+ @H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bridgegoth: 2N - re ask|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: 2@S would now be FORCING with @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|gizzydrop: so 2NT a further enquiry|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridgegoth: 3@S now exactly 3415|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 4@C will set trumps|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 6@C however is likely to fail, a sure @H loser + a very likely trump loser|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 4@D I think is a slam try in @Hs over 3@S|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: for those asking|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gizzydrop: it is, Jay|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Yes i think we had that bid come up once lol|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: bidding openers known shortage is usually the slam try for openers longest major|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: @S lead likely here i think|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|bridgegoth: Me either|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: nothing springs to mind|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bridgegoth: nunes going out on a limb here|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: My understanding is that Nunes is much more aggressive than Fantoni|pg||

nt|gizzydrop: defence needs to be a little careful, i think a club here would lead to Fantoni getting squeezed in the blacks|pg||

nt|hedyg:  event:http://bridgewinners.com/article/view/2012-buffett-cup-live-results/|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Needs to play a @S now or this has a chance|pg||

nt|andyv:   CRASH (an acronym for Color-RAnk-SHape) is a defense against a strong 1@C or a 1NT opening that first appeared in an article by Kit Woolsey in The Bridge World[1]. Within the framework of CRASH, subsequent bids denote|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 3@H i think is the bid now|pg||
nt|kit: That will get the bidding up to a high level, for sure|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4H|nt|kit: I'm surprised West didn't go to 5@H.  Surely he isn't going to sell to 4@S.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  two suiters of the same color (black or red), the same rank (major or minor), and the same shape (pointed or rounded).|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: if they reach 6@S, I suspect Sontag will double it and collect a ruff|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bridgegoth: in fact, 4@S does not even make|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 5@C = odd keycards|pg||
mb|5D|nt|gizzydrop: lots of BAD GIB|pg||
nt|kit: Not so clear he will double.  He probably has natural trump trick, so double could just blow a trick|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Now any @S contract is toasted|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kit: If 5@H a last train type of invite, I can't see South bidding slam|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bridgegoth: I suspect 5@S or 6@S is going to get doubled|pg||
mb|6H|mb|6S|nt|bridgegoth: He has to be wanting to double this, I can't imagine anything else going through his mind|pg||
