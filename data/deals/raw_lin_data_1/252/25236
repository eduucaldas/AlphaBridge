mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 1@S 14+ unless 4+@H|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|bridgegoth: 2@C inv+ in @C/bal or Forcing @S riase|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 2@D = @Hs|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 3@S = slam try in @S|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 4@D = cue|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 4@H = cue|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 5@C = odd keycards + @C control|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|curtis:  Hi, this is Phyllis Cheek.  Curtis is playing with Marc instead of Joe, because Fred had to bow out |pg||
nt|bridgegoth: if Fantoni bids 7@S here.... |pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Hi and thank you |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Fantoni has a problem he does not know if 5@C showed 1 or 3, or about the trump Q@S|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: He very well might bid a grand here|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: He knows that Nunes has either 1 ace or all 3 missing aces, and a good hand. |pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 5@C was TURBO showing 1 or 3 keycards|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Fantoni does not know which it is, and I'm not sure he can find out, |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: For those asking about 3@S: 2@S is nf since 2@D could be 11 points, 3@S is a slam try and 4@S is to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Fantoni plays it safe and passes, good choice, |pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Had Fantoni bid anyting except 2@D, it would confirm 14+ and set a game force.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: Us lesser mortals would probably have at some point bid Blackwood, found we were off 2 aces, and stopped in 5@S also.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Yes, in my version of Fantunes, I added Blackwood :)|pg||
nt|curtis:  Fantoni is looking at the board and in deep thought|pg||
nt|kit: Sout will likely duck the first round of spades, get a signal from partner on the second round, and underlead his ace of diamonds to get his club ruff.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|curtis:  he's picking his hand up and play resumes|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine declarer will do anything but draw trumps|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: well that isn't going to work|pg||
nt|kit: Oh right, I forgot this is board-a-match|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: His play does look right at BAM -- A little unlucky|pg||
pg||
qx|o14|st||md|4ST98HAKJ86532D8CA,S54HQDT42CKJT9864,S73HT974DKQJ7653C,SAKQJ62HDA9CQ7532|sv|o|mb|1S|nt|bridgegoth: 1@S 14+ unless 5@S + 4@H|pg||
nt|kit: South could have defeated it 2 tricks, but understandably was happy with the result.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: N-S will surely compete to 5@H over the inevitable 4@S call|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|kit: And then the difficult decisions start|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: makes 5@S it looks like|pg||
nt|kit: actually 6@S makes on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: At  this point, the 14+ is confirmed since Fantoni cannot have 4@Hs in this auction, |pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|bridgegoth: Yes 6@S does make, lucky lie|pg||
nt|kit: A good time to be leading partner's suit :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: This will be down 2 on the trump promotion|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: quite surprised no one took a call here, surely in board a match when you have over half the deck and have reason to think you have game, 50 a trick can't win too many boards|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|hQ|pc|dJ|pg||

qx|o15|st||md|1S8764HTDA9CAKJ873,SAQJ32H875D762C64,SK95HQJ9642DK8C92,STHAK3DQJT543CQT5|sv|n|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|kit: This is an unexpectedly light overcall at the 2-level I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridgegoth: I must agree, I would not have even overcalled 1@S over 1@C with that.|pg||
nt|kit: North has a problem -- not clear that negative double is best.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: So does Fantoni, he thinks his partner has something|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 1@S is okay -- partner will give you some leeway.  But 2@S over 2@C almost forces partner to overbid.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bridgegoth: that will likely draw a red flag|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|kit: I can't imagine selling out to 3@H undbouled with the East hand|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: If 3@H didn't draw a ticket, 4@C has to|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bridgegoth: My favorite contract!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: South knows his partner doesn't have great hearts since his partner passed 3@C -- that's why he went back to 4@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 4@Cx probably at least 200|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D doubled wouldn't exactly have any bells on it either.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I have a rule: When the ops want to play 4@C or 4@D, you let them.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: He must have been planning on winning ace of diamonds, giving his partner an overruff, and getting a heart ruff.  Pretty difficult to duck -- how does he know his partner has the ...|pg||
nt|kit: king of diamonds/|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: This is a surprise.  Doesn't he know his partner has a doubleton club?|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: now can play a @D and claim -1|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|bridgegoth: must have had some kind of signalling mixup since AK@C were led|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: I guess they play UDCA, and North chose (wrongly IMO) to discourage -- so South thought North had 3 clubs.|pg||
pg||
qx|o16|st||md|2SAK76432HJ9DK87C9,SQT98HT76DAQ5CT72,SJHAQ8543DT96CQ63,S5HK2DJ432CAKJ854|sv|e|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|kit: South would like to bid the third and final spade perhaps, but can he?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Nunes just bid some @Ss|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridgegoth: Looks like -3, @C, 2@S, @H, 2@D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: East needs to decide who has the singleton club -- I think he will go right and shift to a diamond, |pg||
pc|s2|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: He will get a 2nd chance however when he's in with the K@H, |pg||
nt|kit: However, on this layout it doesn't matter, but if his partner had, say, KQx of diamonds it would have mattered a lot.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Cheek has to get rid of that card before he can do anything with the @Ds, by then Fantoni will know exactly what to do|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: Holding the king of hearts, I don't see the urgency to continue clubs.  They can't run away if partner has a stiff.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I would have thought he would get it right as well Kit, Nunes has to be doubling on natural tricks and can't want a ruff if he has the singleton, and they arne't going anywhere|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: Nunes would be leading a singleton club whether he wanted a ruff or not, so I don't see that as a solid inference.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Right, but i'm saying the @C can't profit immediately|pg||
mc|7|nt|kit: yes, that seems clear.|pg||
pg||
qx|o17|st||md|3SQJ98754HJ87DQCA5,STHAQ9DKJT76CJT62,S2HT432D5432CK873,SAK63HK65DA98CQ94|sv|o|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|3S|nt|kit: 3@S looks about right to me.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 1@C 15+ @Cs or balanced|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridgegoth: X = cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: So will get to routine 3NT, unless East shoots out a pass.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: he very well might, no sure thing that 3NT is making, but i'd probably bid it|pg||
nt|kit: I think he has the wrong spade holding to defend.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: agreed|pg||
nt|kit: as well as the wrong distribution, with no ruffing potential|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 3NT seems clear cut to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: I had a feeling he would pass though|pg||
nt|kit: However, if he does pass it will probably be successful, as declarer would go to dummy and lead a spade to the 9|pg||
nt|kit: maybe|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: But maybe not, since if East has 4 spades, the finesse won't do any good|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|kit: Here is moment of decision -- is it more likely that East has AKx(x) or K10x?|pg||
nt|kit: I think on that analysis going up queen is the right play.|pg||
nt|tez: if east has AKTX ..same..J or Q right i thk|pg||
nt|kit: any time East has 4 spades including the 10, declarer must lose 3 trump tricks even if he plays the 9.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c6|nt|bridgegoth: looks like 500 now and a sure loss on this board|pg||
nt|kit: Full top to bottom swing, with 3NT cold and normal, and it is 500 vs. 300|pg||

pc|d5|nt|bridgegoth: Well done there|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: the problem now is if he cashes the @D,s he loses 5 tricks, 3@H T@D + A@S, if he does not, he loses them forever|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: which is why the @D play to kill the entry was critical|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|kit: Now, can Cheek find the brilliant jack or king of hearts lead?|pg||

nt|gizzydrop: says you|pg||
nt|kit: Spade continuation will work if declarer 2-2 in spades and diamonds, but would he open 1NT with that shape?|pg||
nt|kit: Problem is that South doesn't even know which suit to shift to if he does shift.|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: He knows north has some values, perhaps his best hope is north has AQ@H|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|h4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|kit: keep in mind that this is BAM, not IMPs, which complicates the issue a lot.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think it clearly best on balance to lead a spade honor from this holding, but it doesn't work well on this hand.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridgegoth: I might shy away all together from a @S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|kit: At IMPs I might agree with avoiding a spade lead since only a 4-card suit, but at BAM too much danger partner has ace of spades or jack of spades and another ace.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|bridgegoth: Had Fantoni opened 1@C, things get complicated, so 2NT probably better|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: In other words, holding 3NT to 3 might be great at BAM, while it is meaningless at IMPs.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: This is the last board of the match, thanks to all our viewers and our other commentators for their help. We hope to see you all return for the final segment of the day. It will ...|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: start soon.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridgegoth: If Fantoni had decided his hand was worth 23+, he would open 1@C, since that starts an occasionally complicated sequence to show 23+|pg||
nt|kit: This puts some pressure on South -- not clear whether he needs to grab the king or not.  |pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Also, from this long huddle declarer may work out that South has 9 of spades, and finesse the 7.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: In other words, if South had KQxx of spades it would be less difficult to duck.|pg||
mc|12|nt|gizzydrop: could argue it was worth 23+ with 8 tricks in his hand|pg||
