nt|djneill:  welcome, scorring is point-a-board, so the higher score wins, not IMPs|pg||
nt|djneill:  N-S play 1NT/2@c/2@d/2@h/2@s as minimum opening hands, and 1@c/1@d/1@h/1@s as very solid opening hands|pg||
nt|gavin:  hi|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome gavin|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gavin:  the stars have alligned for me to be able to watch a set|pg||
nt|djneill:  which Wolpert is West|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gavin:  My wife, Jenny|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill:  ok thanks, good to know|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@h is minimum 1@h opening in standard|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|djneill:  Levin really could not evaluate the hand, anything was possible, so 4@s is a stab|pg||
nt|djneill:  South could have chosen a @c too|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gavin:  This is one of the benefits of their strange methods. |pg||
pc|h7|nt|gavin:  An evenly split deck got high very quick|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|djneill:  at matchpoints it's not so incumbent upon someone to bid game, but gavin, what about board-a-match?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|gavin:  I like Levin's game bid.  I think in the face of an opening hand and a negative double that west should take the low road|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so West may have overbid here, not East|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gavin:  and just compete to 3@S rather than invite game with the soft values|pg||
nt|gavin:  after 2@H - 2@S - X west knows its a split deck|pg||
nt|gavin:  2@H opening hand, 2@S opening hand double competitive values|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|djneill:  3@h does not leave room for counter-consultation, as, say, a 3@d cue would allow 3@h|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|gavin:  b-a-m is very different at this level |pg||
nt|gavin:  in previous buffett cups|pg||
nt|gavin:  we've seen that players are all insanely hungry|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sQ|pc|d3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gavin:  i'll try to point out some examples as they come up|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|djneill:  it appears East has reached open ground but the clubs now are a problem, with no pitches thanks to precise defense|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|gavin:  but watching this event isnt neccessarily a good learning session for 'how to play b-a-m'|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|djneill:  East would have loved to reverse this dummy, ruffing red cards in hand, high where necessary|pg||
nt|djneill:  other room has indeed stopped in 3@s since they were given more room to bid precisely|pg||
nt|gavin:  In the bidding|pg||
nt|gavin:  somthing interesting|pg||
nt|gavin:  the negative double changes the meaning of a 3@S bid by wolpert|pg||
nt|gavin:  if it went pass then wolpert's raise to 3S would be more constructive|pg||
nt|gavin:  once they have made a negative double, wolpert would need to be more aggressive to bid 3S |pg||
nt|gavin:  because it is now a competitive auction|pg||
nt|djneill:  so 3@s would have had a lighter lower end|pg||
nt|gavin:  and there is a lot of benefit of preventing north from mentioning a second suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|djneill:  1@c is a solid 1@c opening, forcing|pg||
nt|gavin:  two nice black jacks give you 13 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  should wolpert bid a fav michaels, gavin?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|djneill:  1NT game forcing, positional, balanced|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  theres some upside and some downside|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@c checkback|pg||
nt|gavin:  west knows the opponents have a game and potentially a slam|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|gavin:  the major downsde is not what you would assume|pg||
nt|gavin:  everyone things the bad part of bidding michaels with west hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  is that you might go for a number|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  everyone "thinks"|pg||
nt|gavin:  but the major downside of bidding michaels with west's hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  is that when the opponents end up decarling|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|gavin:  you are telling them your distribution and how to play the minor suits (their long suits)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  when you are non - vul against vul|pg||
nt|gavin:  the major upside in bidding michaels is finding a nice sacrifice|pg||
nt|gavin:  or having partner fit you well and further the preempt|pg||
nt|gavin:  by quickly bidding 4 of a major taking up a ton of room|pg||
nt|djneill:  N-S here have bid around fishing for a fit and ended up with nothing|pg||
nt|djneill:  North opposite a standrd 1@c would be ok with 6NT, but after a solid 1@c, thinking 7|pg||
nt|gavin:  there is a lot to be said about overcalling 1@H|pg||
nt|gavin:  at least you are accomplishing a goal|pg||
nt|gavin:  getting partner to lead the suit you want them to|pg||
nt|gavin:  you still have a chance at catching a heart fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: IN THE WELL|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point gavin, the @h lead would save some tempo and tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  thanks Gabsi, North is tanking, Fantoni is known for this|pg||
nt|djneill:  but unlike my tanks, he comes out with the correct solution|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has been applying the brakes steadily, reducing HCP range from 15-18, to 15-16|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  should North have tried 7 with no fit and combined 36-37 gavin?|pg||
nt|djneill:  we all would like to know your thoughts|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  still you would expect the other room to be in 7NT|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  1NT = 14-17, which perhpas explains it|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if South showed a minimum, North could see 'only' 35-36 points|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|5D|nt|yorkbeach:  3@d might be any decent hand with 4-card support 'mixed raise' rather then necessarily a splinter|pg||

mb|p|nt|gavin:  both world class norths bid 6nt|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin:  looking at dummy it is a very simple club shoft at trick 2|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can see the threat on the dummy - long @s, so it is time to get active |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|gavin:  need to set up whatever winners north sout have before the spades set up|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  many top pairs play that a positive response to 2@c shows two of the top three honors in the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  so East may know that West's clubs are good|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps not judging from the final contract|pg||

nt|djneill:  again, East here opened 1@h, heavyyyyyyy|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  but, at the other table, N-S made the last mistake|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|djneill:  Gavin is that a 1@h or 2@c for you|pg||
nt|gavin:  Definitely 1@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  seems like 21 HCP and long suit is cutting it close|pg||
nt|gavin:  east west I believe play Kokish Relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  it makes heart hands a real pain in 2@C|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gavin:  need to back the bidding up so east is the 1@H bidder|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|djneill:  so after 2@c, it would be impossible to show @h below the 3-levle which is possibly too high for an accurate auction?|pg||
nt|djneill:  europe is ahead so far, thanks to boards 1 and 3 - board-a-match scoring, not IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|gavin:  yeah their auction after 2@C would start 2@C-2@D-2@H-2@S-3@S|pg||
nt|gavin:  on this particulary hand 2@C wouldnt get a 2@D response|pg||
nt|gavin:  particular|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  showing hearts and spades|pg||
nt|gavin:  very uncomfortable|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|djneill:  any chance of 6@c?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  5@c would not score as well as 4@h often, hardly ever unless 4@h went down and 5@c made|pg||
nt|gavin:  yeah the risk of ending in 5@C |pg||
nt|gavin:  is too much|pg||
nt|gavin:  basically if you end up in 5@C you might as well bid 6@C|pg||
nt|gavin:  as you can see in the other room they made 650|pg||
nt|gavin:  so ending in 5@C the board is lost|pg||
nt|djneill:  making 8 clubs is just too rare|pg||
nt|djneill:  Nunes is evaluating the lead here - West has shown clubs, East @h and @s|pg||
nt|djneill:  but leading from an AQ combo is one of those rare things|pg||
nt|gavin:  on the deal with spades 3-3 they make 6 spades but west is aware that east will be forced to use one of her spades when the opponents lead diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin:  so west did the sensible thing of offering 4@H with a known singleton|pg||
nt|djneill:  It appears East is 4612 from the 4@c call, yes?|pg||
nt|gavin:  east's strength was at the top of her range (obviously from our discussion of whether to open 1@H or 2@C)|pg||
nt|gavin:  so when west was picturing what hands easy might have|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gavin:  some of them included being off two aces|pg||
pc|h9|nt|djneill:  hmm, there went the @dK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|djneill:  sorry North can ruff|pg||
nt|gavin:  you were right|pg||
nt|gavin:  north can ruff the first one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gavin:  but you can re-enter with the queen of spades|pg||
nt|djneill:  oh overruffed and @sQ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|djneill:  big decision, other room led a club|pg||
nt|gavin:  a missed opportunity here|pg||
nt|gavin:  the risk in playing clubs is that someone may have a singleton club and Txx of hearts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gavin:  but the reward is the layout we see|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|djneill:  was he afraid of 4-1@c that much|pg||
nt|gavin:  or if the person with the doubleton club has the king of hearts|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  1NT is minimum balanced opening|pg||
nt|djneill:  standard defense to this kind of NT, is strength-showing doubles|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|djneill:  that way, E-W can get to game, or at least avoid being stolen from|pg||
mb|2D|nt|djneill:  sometimes the party is over, and East runs, as here|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill:  but other table got pretty high, europe|pg||
nt|gavin:  one of the worst things about the east hand |pg||
nt|gavin:  is if you pass 1NT|pg||
nt|gavin:  you have no idea what to lead|pg||
nt|gavin:  so whenever its close|pg||
nt|gavin:  you should tend to pass when you have a nice safe lead |pg||
nt|gavin:  and pull the double when you have no idea|pg||
nt|djneill:  like @dQJTx?|pg||
nt|gavin:  yes or even JT9 third|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gavin:  or somet T98x suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|gavin:  sequences|pg||
nt|gavin:  if it is indeed a split deck hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@s was interesting, I did not know that 2@d promised 2 suits|pg||
nt|gavin:  and your opening lead is your opponents source of tricks|pg||
nt|gavin:  you are going to struggle to beat 1NT X|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  looks like us won the battle of this board, just bad for each side at the 3-level|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|djneill:  2@s seemed to be the winning call|pg||
nt|gavin:  this was a strange situation|pg||
nt|gavin:  because east probably thought they were making their 2 level contract|pg||
nt|gavin:  and didnt get a chance to show her strength|pg||
nt|gavin:  and likely wanted to double 3@C to protect against their 110|pg||
nt|gavin:  but her trumps were xx, and she didnt know how many the opponents had|pg||

nt|djneill:  3@sx making|pg||
nt|djneill:  where N-S can make 4@d|pg||
nt|djneill:  the key there was North's takeout double of 2@s with 9 HCP, a spade void, and no Aces|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|djneill:  but the double would have worked out a lot (by both sides)|pg||
nt|djneill:  the theory is that the person short in their suit should be the more aggressive, can't be shorter than a void|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|djneill:  we can't predict what would have happened had North doubled, but it seems like reasonable for South to double 3@s, hoping for the magic +200|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
mc|9|nt|djneill:  the reason 200 is abnormally good at board a match or matchpoints, is that it outscores pretty much any partial out there, so as long as you don't have game, +200 is a top|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South may have intended his double as responsive|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  it would be usual to jump to 3@s with 3-card support|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  this auction has pinpointed the club lead|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  so North prefers the 5-2 fit|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  East can preevnt any ruffs by winning the @s and return the suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as North bid @s @h and NT, East should have an idea that North is short in @d and so West will have the @d covered|pg||
