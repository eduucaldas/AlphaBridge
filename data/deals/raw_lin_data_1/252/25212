pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: all boards scored BAM [board-a-match]  aka  Point-A-Board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  win/lose/tie|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: at end of 11 board match against each of other 5 opposition pairs [excluding the anchor]  win=4 points, tie = 2 points, lose = 0 points|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs play a Strong 1@C system|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 2@D tends to deny 4@H  [otherwise overcall Raptor 1N]|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: Sontag 3@H looks like mixed raise  that is increasingly common treatment for bid of  3M-1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mixed raise is 4-fit with something between single and invitational raise strength|pg||

mc|9|nt|ahollan1: i know Hamman has played in all of the Buffett Cup events [every other year beginning with 2006]  it is possible that Berkowitz has also played them all|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both teams have one women's pair|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: team rosters listed on tourney home page   http://www.buffettcup.com/|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: I'd explain the mechanism for determining the team makeup -- but i don't know what it is|pg||
nt|chip: This would be a dull IMP hand with 9 tricks, but more exciting at BAM/Matchpoint scoring. Did E really play D ace? hard ot imagine.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to be large factor of    magic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great to have you join in Chip -- i seem to recall you've had some success at BAM|pg||
nt|chip: Also seems wrong to duck the spade lead with 3 stoppers (that is a big spade 7).|pg||
nt|chip: Perhaps declarer won the spade and played a D to the K and A?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Sontag cannot open 2@D -- that would show 3-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chip: presumabely DBL is T/O|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D  negative   DBL=extras, unsuited for other action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about the delay Chip|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so not pure takeout|pg||
nt|chip: how weak was 1D response?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 0-7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman was +190 in 4@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: and E's 2H bid is probably at the low end of that, so W quits.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is vanProoijen to PASS of 2@DX?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: doubt if he event thought about it|pg||
nt|chip: Would have been the winner here. Hard though with partner's hand type so variable (could have 5 hearts).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how in the world did Hamman go +190?    my guess operator error|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, making 7 is not likely. Perhaps a couple of revokes?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: still way before noon -- so i don't think before i report|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my story  and i'm sticking to it|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think about the @S lead rather than top @D or trump?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP can take a lot of tricks if he reads exact trump layout - but only we are allowed to peek|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: sonty-berk 1N opener is always strong, so bal 1@D  11-14|pg||

pc|c6|nt|chip: looks like 11 tricks with one minor friendly and the other not.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|chip: I'm pretty sure declarer played the club A here.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: wouldn't he actually play @CK then @CA?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H5 winning is amusing -- if not accurate :(|pg||
nt|chip: club to the ace is fine and less revealing to the defense. Doesn't want a heart shift if E has the D king.|pg||
nt|chip: I predict declarer played a club to hand to take the D finesse.|pg||
mc|11|nt|chip: 11 tricks as predicted.|pg||
