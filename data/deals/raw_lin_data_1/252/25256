nt|pbundy: welcome to omaha!|pg||
nt|pbundy: the room looks a bit different today; an executive decision to take down screens.  should speed up play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lall also pass over 1@H-(2@H)     but papa Bessis did not proceed to game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other room auction showing as  1N-7N|pg||
nt|pbundy: some of our vugraph operators are very new.  if it is too difficult to follow an auction - they may skip to get in the final accurate contract|pg||
nt|pbundy: although - maybe that IS how it went! :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never held 21 opposite a strong NT opener :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: you just haven't played long enough, al :)|pg||

nt|pbundy: this is the auction so far.  joel is thinking..........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if operator gets a chance - maybe correct spelling of west name  usually only room for  Prooijen  or  v Prooijen|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hurd's 1st DBL = 4/5@S|pg||
nt|pbundy: tough call for wooldridge here|pg||
nt|pbundy: at this odd IMP format - passing could be right, 3NT if read for the minors could be right......|pg||
nt|pbundy: at "real" teams i imagine passing would never be a thought for south|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the real answer might be --- PASS in 1st seat :)|pg||

nt|pbundy: it appears that this will make.  some overkill with the closed room result.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Peg|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pbundy: i would say that the US should be happy they are not scoring with "real" imps - yet - i am quite certain that with "real" ones at least some contracts would not be duplicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but how do you play after trump lead which does seem best|pg||
nt|pbundy: definitely the best lead by joel.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pbundy: hearts can obviously be set up - but - declarer must judge what to do|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pbundy: a wrong guess and that 260 will be looking mighty fine|pg||
mc|13|nt|ahollan1: probably  NOT  direct or ruffing finesse  -- just try to ruff out @HK|pg||
