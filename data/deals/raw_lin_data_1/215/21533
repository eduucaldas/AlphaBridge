nt|queequeg: hi Marshall :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: we start out with a routine 4@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ciao friederike|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: stat with 20-20   pts|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam to begin   best in no-trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Buona sera|pg||
nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so Breno is going very strong so far in this match|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Maggio needs a miracle|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|engsetter:  now tell me whats wrong with 1H pass pass 2S intermediate?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: Wow, 3@s is a *big* bid here!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably 2D = 18-19  balanced|pg||
nt|ady: 2 clubs presumably transfer response showing diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ga ge all            7nt C must be easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  the King of hearts is not a good card is it?|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi David:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: increasingly common treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not sure about 1@D|pg||
nt|psyck: different sequences are possible to show 55 invitational & game force hands, usually in combination with Smolen sequences|pg||
nt|baldfriede: unless South has ideas, which he should not have because North is a passed hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  looks like a strong @C auction here ending in 4@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|engsetter:  however with no entry to MARTA|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree on 2 @S Dave|pg||
nt|engsetter:  its going to make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  will be no problem with @SK and @DK onside|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: east showing 3 controls   thinking rkc in spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why 7@D boot ok|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a puzzle:)?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Bad trumps and weak @h keep N out of 4@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Operator can you show us the names ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  d'avossa is a former junior world champ|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unlikely to make    |pg||

mb|p|nt|aramesh_:  Hello Serhat- Welcome:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT seems even better than 4@S|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  with the doubleton Q10 of @H he will make 6....  but a very low percentage slam.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|engsetter:  jonathan we are asking what the actual percentage is|pg||
nt|ady: problem is what action with 15-16 pts by north?|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 1@d natural or 15-17 bal|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sommer: a @Clead would be nasty for E, but only S' 2nd choice of course|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2nt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  checking the @C finesse, if it loses may need either @D finesse or @H ruff|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|engsetter:  hello all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: so 15  or 20   same bid|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|cuan: la manovra corretta delle atout è l'impasse al fante, con la variante inferiore del 10 a girare contro il Fante secondo o terzo in sud ed il 9 in nord|pg||

nt|dkkello:  The Great Shuffler has been nice to us now ..  ;)|pg||
nt|engsetter:  it will work well wehn west bids 4 hearts|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  not my tastes... but I agree|pg||

nt|othered1: Turns out high @S lead  would have done better or north might have tried J to keep entry|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will probably widen the gap.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Gerben42:  mini NT so it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  a routine 3NT here|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he he |pg||
nt|engsetter:  pass is wise|pg||
nt|santyclz:  40% (3-2 @hs) * 10% (1 of 5 3-2s) * 50% (@da onside) =  2.5% or did i miss something?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  though they are in trouble whatever|pg||
nt|fabsayc: battle of the 2@D bids, this one multi|pg||

nt|baldfriede: what is the NT range for N/S?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: not nice|pg||
mb|2N|nt|serhat: 3d must be nat|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  this time not so great timing as 4@H EW might be too tough|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2NT*|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  losing 2@H 2@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: part score hand      1NT  for n/s looks about right|pg||
nt|sommer: it looks like 15 to me;-)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..now 4@S:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..with the requested @H lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|atlantajon:  looks like it has a chance...on a non-@h lead....since south has no @H to put on the track...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt feels right|pg||
nt|sommer: ..MUST be in S|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I don't like the x here. does East really want @h lead?|pg||
nt|sommer: retrans, pls|pg||
nt|psyck: N will probably retransfer|pg||
nt|spenny80: here probably 4@h made|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  Santorio is very sensible it was possible 5 clubs would make|pg||
nt|serhat: 3d my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but i suppose could be minors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is a bit timid|pg||
nt|sommer: ..4@S|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H close        also 3NT  looks a possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  always nice to hit to Aces on the flop  |pg||
nt|serhat: pas is a little wuss?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  otoh now N has pinpointed @C lead :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: is this Blue Club? so 1@C 16+, 1nt 4 controls?|pg||

nt|engsetter:  no surprises here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: start @DA @D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any lead  disattractive|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it is right to take out 3NT|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: Hello, everybody!|pg||
nt|athene: not much interest here; perhaps you think more at MP|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is it best to overtake K spades at some stage?|pg||
nt|ady: can now discard 2 diamonds   and lose 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but would not we all?|pg||
nt|ady: cashing A@D   would certainly have set 4@H   on the distribution there is|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass as N after 1@S can|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: north too strong for simple preference to 2@D    so 2NT|pg||
nt|serhat: vul-non vul|pg||
nt|spenny80: in e-w agreement w has bidded unbal @d @h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Probably trump A, followed by another @h.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: i would think declarer will concede the @SQ and make ten tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but South optimistic to bid on     most plat 3@H as forcing   asking to chose between a heart or no-trump game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass is a fair shot at MPs or BAM, because opps are vul in a probable nonfit. but at IMPs it is dangerous to "fade the shooter" in these situations (analogy from dice, meaning to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bet against the one with the dice)|pg||
nt|sommer: "Tnx East":)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well if you dont lead @C then one goes on the @SQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|psyck: Unfavorable vulnerability & a balanced hand, & opps have already exchanged some info...was a poor time for East to step into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: still likely to do down  as defence should get 3 trump triicks and a club|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  losing @HA @HJ and @CA only|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: diamonds break well   but still not enough|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice work to get to the very good 3N.  True double-dummy bidding would have had it played by west, however|pg||
pc|hA|nt|serhat: 3nt could have been cold?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the reuslt of the x. with a minor lead 4@h would have been set|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: probably no need to overtake @SK, with all those entries to dummy|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so after 3 bds could be 70-4...|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well a surprise make|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  I was asked also....have no idea.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: this is not the kind of auction where opponents bid 4 when you give them a second chance|pg||
pc|s3|nt|queequeg: @D@D Correct Result: Uggeri 61 Iommi 21 @D@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: result*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for me 3nt and pass by S too DD|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: someone might have @SQx after all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true hang opps in 1@S is prehistory mart:)|pg||
nt|ady: 7@D   was a push|pg||
nt|jaapfr: was it really?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: both could not ask @CK for 7nt??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can claim before the lead 13 tricks if pd AKAK|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nd surprise make of 4@h by w.  It that enough for a trend?|pg||
nt|ady: west has to lose 2 more trump tricks and a club  unless defence mangles |pg||
nt|jaapfr: saves time:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|engsetter:  less dramatic of course|pg||
nt|baldfriede: E/W are being forced to do something, and this of course increases the risk to go too high.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: S not W|pg||
nt|ady: west must avoide winning with Q@H and playing A@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: could go wrong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3NT is better then 4@h|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dkkello:   lavazza never play italy cup,   thank you Richard|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: now making|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: might however get home    now with the good spade pips has 3 spades and 2 clubs    and can make 2 hearts and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|serhat: this hand never should pass at imps. 1 stopper 2 good runnng minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i think we all aggreed about that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: which entry?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H was a normal contract but N's @C transfer pointed out the killing lead|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: you overtake the king when you have stiff king facing AJ109xx and only one side entry to the long suit, of course|pg||
nt|ady: may have entry problems|pg||

nt|athene: not for spades|pg||
nt|engsetter:  2 |pg||
nt|athene: how vigorously will east bid diamonds over a strong club here?|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming 4N was RKC, just another hand to add to the long list wihere something went wrong after RKC|pg||
nt|engsetter:  it looks normal 3D to me|pg||
nt|mcphee: all the same 4@H was ill judged|pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S@S REAL SCORE: Uggeri 72 - Iommi 28 @S@S@S|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I lost a match recently by leading KQ of an unbid suit so I have been reflecting|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those not familiar with Sabine Auken:  http://bridgefiles.net/Person/Auken_Sabine.htm|pg||
nt|serhat: exactly. if you duck no H danger also|pg||
nt|psyck: *push|pg||
nt|baldfriede: "punch" would have been fitting too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: powerhouse card with very limited defense values|pg||
nt|spenny80: probably W has to hope sgl@c in north|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  playing @HA was costly|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but impressive play by D'Avossa|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  not so easy on table to make this play|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@h are possible here for N/S.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Due to the 3-3 split.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps not so vigorously, in view of the previous hand :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|queequeg: welcome to Dan Neill :) @H|pg||
nt|athene: if you don't think your opponents will reach the right contract anyway, you might not risk so much to pre-empt them :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@D looks about right with that hand at favourable vulnerability over a strong club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well here 4 diamonds may make|pg||
nt|ady: should lose only 500   5 diamonds may make on a spade guess|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  interesting hand here|pg||
nt|engsetter:  4 spades of course here but will it make?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: which club level are EW?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry unfamiliar to me|pg||
mb|d|nt|dkkello:  Sabines exelent book:  http://canadianbridgesupplies.com/work/i-love-this-game-bridge-book-by-sabine-auken/|pg||
nt|spenny80: board 3 Uggeri plays 5@h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: you still have heart danger if you duck, because now you might win only one club trick, and they can still lead hearts. you will get 2 heart tricks but you may have several tempos ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to concede and they might get a  couple long hearts|pg||

nt|queequeg: @d@d  Clair - Br. Breno  22-35|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  a fair spot   but should go down with the bad diamond break|pg||
nt|spenny80: can defeat on a lead @s|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a difficult hand to bid over 1@S, even without the overcall.  Support doubles might simplify things here.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  25 HCP but no game appeals|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|othered1: If EW can find them, don't they make more @H than NS can make @S?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  5 clubs stands no chance|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  nor 3nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i like direct 3nt by W too kibs with a 3333333333333333:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H pass and then up to S|pg||
nt|farrukh: Thinking of bidding 2@d or 2@h or DBL|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: 4C is an excellent bid. it runs a small risk of missing 3N if pd has just the right hand, but it puts considerable pressure on NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but less after opps do lead @HA:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think Dbl should show some @S no?|pg||
nt|farrukh: dbl Should confirm @ds and should ideally not have a 4M thats how usually it works but then again all depends on agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  indeed I was a little surpised that west did not bid 3 hearts he cant see many spades|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hard to awoid now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody can just below game now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh sorry missed the 1-14 1nt|pg||
nt|spenny80: n/s here 4@d |pg||
nt|spenny80: not 4@s with 2round @h and 2 in @c in defence|pg||
nt|othered1: do we know what double meant?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: * nobody can jump"|pg||
nt|psyck: many would prefer a 6th @d for the ovecall here & with no @s wastage double 1@s instead|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   may well have made on diamond lead     can recover from K@C lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club lead  gives no chance |pg||
nt|serhat: 4S is good|pg||
mb|3S|nt|baldfriede: well done not to raise to 5@d|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  will ask my pd what he thinks :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Apparently S thinks it shows @s too.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dkkello:  but a fair shoot |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I actually like a pass over the overcall.   denies 3 spades....and when parter reopens...I can raise @S showing Hx....|pg||
nt|engsetter:  this cannot be right its like saying we can wrap up 9 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: If playing support x's, 3@s should show hx, but I don't know if it extends to 10x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: East has a huge hand for hearts, given he bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch required|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee, I would be getting nervous now if I was E:)|pg||
nt|farrukh: yes it should show tolerance in MAJORs else he could easily have bid 2@d over 2@c|pg||
mb|5D|nt|engsetter:  no interest to the play|pg||
nt|othered1: East sold out?  Taking 4@H as some kind of lead director?|pg||
nt|psyck: E did his job with the 3@s raise|pg||
nt|farrukh: @h @h @h should beat it or @d @d @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: when both opps are bidding and partner is silent at these colors, the percentages greatly favor the advantages of the preempt over the measly 2C overcall. a decisive point is that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont have an entry to your clubs so the idea of attracting a lead to beat their 3N doesnt hold as much water as it would with an entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is makeable no doubt, but no certainty|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: 4@h had chance to make but 5@d has no chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe he thinks his partner's delayed 4@H bid shows a weak hand and he is worried opps have a lot of spades on|pg||
nt|engsetter:  unlucky|pg||
nt|spenny80: I thionk they dosn't play support double (in italy its'n common this agreement)|pg||
nt|remo: *bel, srry|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|atlantajon:  careful not to block suit|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's basically on a spade finesse|pg||
nt|ady: possible to have gained stopping out of game|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well done|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably just shows a good hand, but didn't exactly solve the rebid problem.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|athene: the main issue here is what it means to pass THEN bid 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it would be masterminding as partner asked you to  bid 3nt with a stop.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doesnt look easy to me on diamond lead with club back, as long as W puts up heart queen on first round of sui, which should be fairly automatic at this level|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: With a @D fit, why didn't west raise at once?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Jon NS had 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but if @H lead?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: some might play that 3@H over 3@D shows a diamond fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not on a @H lead |pg||
nt|ady: on the mis fit  hand 19 where 4@H went down 1   Clair gained 10 imps making 3NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with the ATxxxx @H and AKJxx @C Versace?|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|engsetter:  I am a little confused why they didnt want the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm ga ge all|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: or a defensive blunder|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  either one....   "nor" is a contraction that is acceptable|pg||
nt|engsetter:  ha ha someone has not been paying attention|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  sorry that ways private|pg||
pc|d3|nt|engsetter:  the operator|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Italians have always been known for off-shape doubles, but this one pushes the envelope|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not if 3@H is a spade preempt it does not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was joking|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 6@d here with A@h right-sided. 6@c won't work due to the @c split|pg||

mb|2C|nt|spenny80: 6@d is a good contract here...|pg||

nt|dkkello:  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x106s6_leonard-cohen-closing-time_music|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes spade preempt so double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C then 4@H would be ideal?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now is this supposed to be pen or responsive?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@S down after @C @SA x@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: not that arcane and north used to be a clear 1@S opening, unless you have gadget bids to sort out major 2-suiters|pg||
nt|ady: nice first trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: some players use a redble to show an honor card in @S|pg||
nt|mcphee: that helps defensively at times if redble were to show the A or K for example|pg||
nt|ady: helps for lead if defending no-teump contract|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Bob!|pg||
nt|ady: in the old days   a pass out here|pg||
nt|othered1: Plus on those cards NS isn't a terrible result, despit its magnitude.|pg||

nt|ady: would have tht  pass best by west rather than showing any preference in the minors   after the dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: sorry I was wrong|pg||

nt|psyck: maybe they play Rubensohl or Rumpelsohl with 3@h transfer here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: np:) you are doing great Daniela:)|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@h is negative with canapé|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: ... for NS, even though their teammates overstepped to 6@HX, down.|pg||

nt|spenny80: (and short @h)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: declarer easily has seven tricks now|pg||
nt|engsetter:  2 spades from minimum opener seems very odd to me can anyone explain??|pg||
nt|dkkello:  You have to look at North hand 3-3-4-3 an no extra , bid slowly then or ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I approve of the pass even if 1nt doesn't imply extra values.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  that was a very minimal overcall|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: two spades, four diamonds, club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  lay bets how many tricks here I predict 8|pg||
nt|athene: and probably should be able to endplay north to concede the @HK|pg||
nt|santyclz: But 2@s?  I found another ace?|pg||
nt|psyck: South could have bid that the 1st time around w/o passing too|pg||
nt|spenny80: down if they found ruff in spade|pg||
nt|othered1: still there to set up|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: might get @CQ shift now, and that can just be ducked|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  if you are not playing support doubles...then I have to agree|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I like pass rather than 1nt|pg||
nt|dkkello:  likes 9-10 loosers  or in plain words , a shitty hand |pg||
pc|cT|nt|santyclz: Right, I meant if the choices were pass or 1nt.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|athene: spade lead would be costly|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like this is the way they begin 3-card limit raises|pg||

nt|athene: west might do that after the raise i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H lead also quite helping declarer:)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  as long as he starts D right away|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: west does not really want diamond ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
nt|athene: so he might well just go for the spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|xenya: win in dummy and a diamond to the Q -- offers lots of chances   |pg||
nt|ady: down at least 1 in 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is definitely safer|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: it's amazing how often people lead from this sort of holding after their partner raised, and how often it costs a game swing|pg||

nt|giuliocs: Vinci 30 - Cabiati 16|pg||
nt|baldfriede: North may have slam thoughts now|pg||
nt|ady: nice 6@D from Verace 1st round   but even if the diamonds are 2-2 with east and south   the trick likely to come back    but well played by declarer|pg||

nt|spenny80: I'm thinking why E has did finess in club at 3@h...|pg||

nt|giuliocs: Grimaldi 20 - Uggeri 39|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but after bidding you know where @SK most likely is (but 5@D or 4@S more realistic|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if partner contributes @DK might go for grand assuming you can discard @H on @D but not now|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: the 7@CX-4 and the 6@D C are for the HOG fansm|pg||
nt|ady: yes 7@C down 4 at most   800  against a vul small slam|pg||
mb|r|nt|othered1: That's a rather maximum 2@C opening.|pg||

nt|jaapfr: normal defense 11 tr|pg||
mb|6S|nt|engsetter:  in most systems 1C 1D-3C and north bids 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: N wisely just bids 4@s with just 3 low @s's though he has a great hand with double fits|pg||
nt|psyck: hopefully Souths pass of 5@h was not a forcing pass|pg||
nt|psyck: in which case N would be dreaming slam now|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  XX must show 1st round control|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: Zaleski team "contains" Lauria, Versace...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 15-17 normal not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: perhaps allowing for 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  likely to make....east needs to start 10S to give the most trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  here we go again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I would have bid 3@H next as east I guess|pg||

pc|c5|pc|s4|pg||

pc|sA|nt|atlantajon:  east can lead his shoe...now|pg||
