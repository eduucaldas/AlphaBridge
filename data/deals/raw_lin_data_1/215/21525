nt|atlantajon:  with the doubleton Q10 of @H he will make 6....  but a very low percentage slam.|pg||

nt|engsetter:  hello all|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gluckenval: il sistema di Tosi/Pantusa mi manca... sry|pg||

nt|engsetter:  pass is wise|pg||
nt|santyclz:  40% (3-2 @hs) * 10% (1 of 5 3-2s) * 50% (@da onside) =  2.5% or did i miss something?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  though they are in trouble whatever|pg||

nt|sommer: ..now 4@S:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..with the requested @H lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|atlantajon:  looks like it has a chance...on a non-@h lead....since south has no @H to put on the track...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt feels right|pg||
nt|sommer: ..MUST be in S|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I don't like the x here. does East really want @h lead?|pg||
nt|sommer: retrans, pls|pg||
nt|psyck: N will probably retransfer|pg||
nt|spenny80: here probably 4@h made|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  Santorio is very sensible it was possible 5 clubs would make|pg||
nt|serhat: 3d my choice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: but i suppose could be minors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is a bit timid|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  always nice to hit to Aces on the flop  |pg||
nt|serhat: pas is a little wuss?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: is this Blue Club? so 1@C 16+, 1nt 4 controls?|pg||

nt|engsetter:  no surprises here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: start @DA @D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any lead  disattractive|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it is right to take out 3NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: Hello, everybody!|pg||
nt|athene: not much interest here; perhaps you think more at MP|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is it best to overtake K spades at some stage?|pg||
nt|ady: can now discard 2 diamonds   and lose 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but would not we all?|pg||
nt|ady: cashing A@D   would certainly have set 4@H   on the distribution there is|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass as N after 1@S can|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: north too strong for simple preference to 2@D    so 2NT|pg||
nt|serhat: vul-non vul|pg||
nt|spenny80: in e-w agreement w has bidded unbal @d @h|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|athene: i would think declarer will concede the @SQ and make ten tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but South optimistic to bid on     most plat 3@H as forcing   asking to chose between a heart or no-trump game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass is a fair shot at MPs or BAM, because opps are vul in a probable nonfit. but at IMPs it is dangerous to "fade the shooter" in these situations (analogy from dice, meaning to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bet against the one with the dice)|pg||
nt|sommer: "Tnx East":)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|psyck: Unfavorable vulnerability & a balanced hand, & opps have already exchanged some info...was a poor time for East to step into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: still likely to do down  as defence should get 3 trump triicks and a club|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: diamonds break well   but still not enough|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice work to get to the very good 3N.  True double-dummy bidding would have had it played by west, however|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|serhat: 3nt could have been cold?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the reuslt of the x. with a minor lead 4@h would have been set|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: probably no need to overtake @SK, with all those entries to dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|engsetter:  well a surprise make|pg||

pc|sT|nt|athene: someone might have @SQx after all|pg||

nt|jaapfr: was it really?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: both could not ask @CK for 7nt??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can claim before the lead 13 tricks if pd AKAK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: 2nd surprise make of 4@h by w.  It that enough for a trend?|pg||
nt|ady: west has to lose 2 more trump tricks and a club  unless defence mangles |pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes i think we all aggreed about that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: which entry?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|athene: you overtake the king when you have stiff king facing AJ109xx and only one side entry to the long suit, of course|pg||

nt|jaapfr: we have 13 @C:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and settled for 5@C C|pg||
nt|othered1: might lose an imp, however. |pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  no bets on the contract here|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C - 3@H - 3@S ?|pg||
nt|athene: 4-loser hand facing a 4-loser hand...but when you are contemplating 6 or 7, the LTC is not so accurate|pg||
nt|athene: you need to know if opps can actually take the first trick or two|pg||
nt|athene: if they can, the fact that you have about 24 tricks yourself is irrelevant|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @S @H @D @C ITALY CUP - Running Score:|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: of course if opps are from the "lead trumps vs 7" school, you might bid 7@S :)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  anyone else choose a small @h lead on that last one?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  tres amusante|pg||

nt|jaapfr: if in @S|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s is a good sacrifice|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: 2@c natural, limited|pg||
nt|othered1: Treating the north hand as more than a minimum black 2-suiter with longer @C, if they play classical Blue Team|pg||

mb|p|nt|engsetter:  there is a trend in the modern game to overcall at the 2 level on next to nothing with length in openers suit|pg||
nt|serhat: interesting convention here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a save     in hearts |pg||
nt|spenny80: but difficult to bid for e-w|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaapfr: i never seen before 13 for 1 pair |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: And I guess they play 2@H forcing (not everyone does)|pg||
nt|athene: south may now splinter with 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: which is just what north wants to hear|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and -1100's build character....LOL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did you?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, this is sensible|pg||
nt|athene: south does not care all that much about anything except keycards|pg||
nt|othered1: kExcept that south doesn't know of north's "extra' @S|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c limit natural|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if he finds his partner with @SKQ @DA @CA he is going to take a shot at the grand i assume|pg||
nt|queequeg: Welcome to Bob McPhee :)|pg||
nt|ady: well done south   has not removed    this looks around 500|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   likely 2 down   unless either minor led|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7-6 fit how to handle the trump suit:)?|pg||
nt|spenny80: not easy to play at 26 cards...|pg||
nt|spenny80: he dosn't know clubs are good|pg||
pc|sK|nt|engsetter:  indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D raise or transfer to NT?|pg||

nt|serhat: s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@H pls|pg||
nt|ady: sold|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: i am told it shows a fit|pg||
nt|serhat: must be GF fit|pg||
nt|serhat: may be 2nt nat|pg||
nt|serhat: duck is best here|pg||
nt|serhat: from both hand|pg||
nt|ady: could not exite west    but still prefer double rather than 1@H from east|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: i would be tempted to overcall 2@D with the east hand|pg||
nt|serhat: small small small. and then big big ..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E must smell after 3@H not to stop before 6 level imo|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: in case partner is on lead vs 3NT|pg||
nt|engsetter:  can anyone explain 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, Sabine would certainly approve.  She believed taking away the 1 level with a 2@c over 1@d overcall is worth a few risks.|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  I have to agree Joe...  but I have sat as dummy for more then a few 1100's....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: hand 18 where 6@S was missed   4@S X + 2 in OR|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in dummy, for sure. less clear to me that declarer should duck in his own hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: but it could easily run into a lot of trouble|pg||
nt|engsetter:  for most denies Q spades|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|santyclz: *believes!  (no implications intended.)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: maybe just two keycards, saying nothing about @SQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: Not an auction I would have predicted, but that extra @S is signficant here.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|queequeg: hi Bob :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: hi gang|pg||
nt|engsetter:  theres an interesting issue about the lead|pg||
nt|serhat: bec if E carries on then you are relax|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like this line|pg||
nt|spenny80: an @h back from W was best defence|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: 9 of clubs makes me relax anyway:)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: so 11 imps for leaders though they did not bid the lay down slam|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|h3|nt|engsetter:  yes the responses to 4Nt seem odd here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
pc|d7|nt|spenny80: bu difficult because he see all Clubs good (when north has xx)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|engsetter:  on balance how often does it pay to lead from KQ and small ones?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|serhat: N is on a right track anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i would simply knock out the ace of D and see what develops. uncharacteristically prosaic, but that seems the most flexible line|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|xenya: here, the 2@C overcall worked nicely too -- albeit in a different way |pg||
pc|h8|nt|atlantajon:  I agree...after the 3@D/3nt.... I find anything but Kd|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: could claim after that trick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: ruff heart, @SQ, dummy is good|pg||
nt|engsetter:  clealry a major misunderstanding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: my guess is 5@H did show two keycards with no @SQ|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: this nasty now|pg||

nt|serhat: exactly. if you duck no H danger also|pg||
nt|psyck: *push|pg||
nt|baldfriede: "punch" would have been fitting too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: powerhouse card with very limited defense values|pg||

mb|p|nt|queequeg: welcome to Dan Neill :) @H|pg||
nt|athene: if you don't think your opponents will reach the right contract anyway, you might not risk so much to pre-empt them :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@D looks about right with that hand at favourable vulnerability over a strong club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well here 4 diamonds may make|pg||
nt|ady: should lose only 500   5 diamonds may make on a spade guess|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  interesting hand here|pg||

nt|spenny80: board 3 Uggeri plays 5@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: you still have heart danger if you duck, because now you might win only one club trick, and they can still lead hearts. you will get 2 heart tricks but you may have several tempos ...|pg||

nt|ady: 4@S  a fair spot   but should go down with the bad diamond break|pg||
nt|spenny80: can defeat on a lead @s|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a difficult hand to bid over 1@S, even without the overcall.  Support doubles might simplify things here.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|othered1: If EW can find them, don't they make more @H than NS can make @S?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  5 clubs stands no chance|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  nor 3nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i like direct 3nt by W too kibs with a 3333333333333333:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4C is an excellent bid. it runs a small risk of missing 3N if pd has just the right hand, but it puts considerable pressure on NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but less after opps do lead @HA:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  indeed I was a little surpised that west did not bid 3 hearts he cant see many spades|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hard to awoid now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody can just below game now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh sorry missed the 1-14 1nt|pg||
nt|spenny80: n/s here 4@d |pg||
nt|spenny80: not 4@s with 2round @h and 2 in @c in defence|pg||
nt|othered1: do we know what double meant?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: * nobody can jump"|pg||
nt|psyck: many would prefer a 6th @d for the ovecall here & with no @s wastage double 1@s instead|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   may well have made on diamond lead     can recover from K@C lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club lead  gives no chance |pg||
nt|serhat: 4S is good|pg||
mb|4C|nt|baldfriede: well done not to raise to 5@d|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|dkkello:  but a fair shoot |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I actually like a pass over the overcall.   denies 3 spades....and when parter reopens...I can raise @S showing Hx....|pg||
nt|engsetter:  this cannot be right its like saying we can wrap up 9 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: If playing support x's, 3@s should show hx, but I don't know if it extends to 10x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: East has a huge hand for hearts, given he bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch required|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee, I would be getting nervous now if I was E:)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|engsetter:  no interest to the play|pg||
nt|othered1: East sold out?  Taking 4@H as some kind of lead director?|pg||
nt|psyck: E did his job with the 3@s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: when both opps are bidding and partner is silent at these colors, the percentages greatly favor the advantages of the preempt over the measly 2C overcall. a decisive point is that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont have an entry to your clubs so the idea of attracting a lead to beat their 3N doesnt hold as much water as it would with an entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is makeable no doubt, but no certainty|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe he thinks his partner's delayed 4@H bid shows a weak hand and he is worried opps have a lot of spades on|pg||
nt|engsetter:  unlucky|pg||
nt|spenny80: I thionk they dosn't play support double (in italy its'n common this agreement)|pg||
nt|remo: *bel, srry|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|atlantajon:  careful not to block suit|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's basically on a spade finesse|pg||
nt|ady: possible to have gained stopping out of game|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well done|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably just shows a good hand, but didn't exactly solve the rebid problem.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|athene: the main issue here is what it means to pass THEN bid 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it would be masterminding as partner asked you to  bid 3nt with a stop.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doesnt look easy to me on diamond lead with club back, as long as W puts up heart queen on first round of sui, which should be fairly automatic at this level|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: With a @D fit, why didn't west raise at once?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Jon NS had 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but if @H lead?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: some might play that 3@H over 3@D shows a diamond fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not on a @H lead |pg||
nt|ady: on the mis fit  hand 19 where 4@H went down 1   Clair gained 10 imps making 3NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with the ATxxxx @H and AKJxx @C Versace?|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes|pg||

nt|othered1: And if I have to give them extra auctions by opening with an artificial bid, even more reason not to open|pg||
nt|athene: sure, it gives opps two chances to bid|pg||
nt|athene: but often that just gives them more room to get tangled up :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H best chances|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|othered1: expecially a way to get a @H suit into the auction without much risk|pg||

nt|santyclz: I'm right there with the original x, after that...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  7 loosers or something like that , to many for a 3 @H bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 14 houses:)?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 clubs and a heart likely  to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I agree    |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and souths @d bids...is just showing a preference....|pg||
nt|bobholl: should have played 9 for @S|pg||
nt|spenny80: here better 4@h from north to show A (with 4@d look like K now)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: The Open room started a little after this room, so that they could get comparisions, but with the Ferrari (G Ferraro) playing in that room, they may soon overtake us|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  but there seem to be 4 losers in that|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he is likely to have a 0-2 count.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: hard for the defence to come to 4 tricks against spades, even if it might look as though they have @C@C@H@D|pg||
nt|othered1: the 2N bid implies they have detailed agreements about follow-ups.  but somehow they missed the good slam.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: just think if E also held 9@H|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  opener in west...XX in east...and holding a 15(ish) count.  south cant have anything|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you all assume a diamond lead is obvious|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S down after @C @SA x@S|pg||

nt|ady: nice first trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: some players use a redble to show an honor card in @S|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Bob!|pg||
nt|ady: in the old days   a pass out here|pg||
nt|othered1: Plus on those cards NS isn't a terrible result, despit its magnitude.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: 10 tricks    then the play was different|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best solution by our operator:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|engsetter:  I predict 1NT by East|pg||
nt|mcphee: did not quite see why S did not advance with @S over the 2@H bid|pg||

nt|engsetter:  double here only show some extra values|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we have to remind that operating is a very tough job (I would not sleep if I ever had to do that:)|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht  pass best by west rather than showing any preference in the minors   after the dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: sorry I was wrong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c here show naturale or any 15-16 hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: like gazzilli|pg||
nt|othered1: Did 1@S show @S?|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes 1@s natural|pg||
mb|3D|nt|atlantajon:  they must not be playing support X's|pg||

nt|dkkello:  ?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  in deep now....if that is right|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe they play Rubensohl or Rumpelsohl with 3@h transfer here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: np:) you are doing great Daniela:)|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@h is negative with canapé|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: ... for NS, even though their teammates overstepped to 6@HX, down.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really?|pg||
nt|spenny80: (and short @h)|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to have comprehensive methods|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: declarer easily has seven tricks now|pg||
nt|engsetter:  2 spades from minimum opener seems very odd to me can anyone explain??|pg||
nt|dkkello:  You have to look at North hand 3-3-4-3 an no extra , bid slowly then or ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I approve of the pass even if 1nt doesn't imply extra values.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: two spades, four diamonds, club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  lay bets how many tricks here I predict 8|pg||
nt|athene: and probably should be able to endplay north to concede the @HK|pg||
nt|santyclz: But 2@s?  I found another ace?|pg||
nt|psyck: South could have bid that the 1st time around w/o passing too|pg||
nt|spenny80: down if they found ruff in spade|pg||
nt|othered1: still there to set up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: might get @CQ shift now, and that can just be ducked|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  if you are not playing support doubles...then I have to agree|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I like pass rather than 1nt|pg||
nt|dkkello:  likes 9-10 loosers  or in plain words , a shitty hand |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right, I meant if the choices were pass or 1nt.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe N pulled out a wrong card|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good luck p  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: otherwise hid bidding makes no sense at all|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is this 2 down ?|pg||

pc|s9|nt|spenny80: 3@d sorry|pg||

nt|othered1: Can I assume 3@D denies 5@S?|pg||

nt|dkkello:  No @S lead :)|pg||

mb|4H|nt|engsetter:  I dont think anyone makes game here do they?|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  protecting his partners @C's|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: didn't miss much|pg||

nt|spenny80: 2NT limit raise with 3 cards|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|athene: spade lead would be costly|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like this is the way they begin 3-card limit raises|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps a direct raise would show a weaker hand|pg||
nt|athene: west might do that after the raise i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H lead also quite helping declarer:)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  as long as he starts D right away|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: west does not really want diamond ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
nt|athene: so he might well just go for the spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|xenya: win in dummy and a diamond to the Q -- offers lots of chances   |pg||
nt|ady: down at least 1 in 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is definitely safer|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|athene: it's amazing how often people lead from this sort of holding after their partner raised, and how often it costs a game swing|pg||
nt|othered1: does show the merit of using something other than the simple raise to promise a high honor in support, |pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|othered1: but perhaps at the cost of preemption|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was a push on 24|pg||

mb|3N|nt|athene: north might respond 2@C to 1nt intending to pass any rebid? but south might or might not have a 1nt opener|pg||

nt|jaapfr: so wd EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -110 too -50|pg||
nt|othered1: To the point he likely can discount the expected bad trump split..  What he had to discount is that south would take what looks to be a very aggressive 4@S bid.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|engsetter:  I bet on 8 tricks|pg||

nt|giuliocs: Vinci 30 - Cabiati 16|pg||
nt|baldfriede: North may have slam thoughts now|pg||
nt|ady: nice 6@D from Verace 1st round   but even if the diamonds are 2-2 with east and south   the trick likely to come back    but well played by declarer|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 7@CX-4 better than 6@D C IF they bid that|pg||
nt|ady: there are systems for sspades and diamonds|pg||
nt|spenny80: I'm thinking why E has did finess in club at 3@h...|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  betting on 5@c sac|pg||
nt|giuliocs: Grimaldi 20 - Uggeri 39|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but after bidding you know where @SK most likely is (but 5@D or 4@S more realistic|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: the 7@CX-4 and the 6@D C are for the HOG fansm|pg||
nt|ady: yes 7@C down 4 at most   800  against a vul small slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That's a rather maximum 2@C opening.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not easy to bid?|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: could have had both one less @C and one less high card.|pg||
nt|queequeg: the match tomorrow will be Clair - Zaleski|pg||
nt|jaapfr: normal defense 11 tr|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  in most systems 1C 1D-3C and north bids 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: N wisely just bids 4@s with just 3 low @s's though he has a great hand with double fits|pg||
nt|psyck: hopefully Souths pass of 5@h was not a forcing pass|pg||
nt|psyck: in which case N would be dreaming slam now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|queequeg: Zaleski team "contains" Lauria, Versace...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 15-17 normal not?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: perhaps allowing for 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  likely to make....east needs to start 10S to give the most trouble|pg||

nt|santyclz: Some days it's just not your day.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: but 5 loser hands with a good suit aren't common 1N openings|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|othered1: their 2@C openings have shown very badly  here, or at least their judgment in using them.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  east can lead his shoe...now|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  my choice is 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: for any Indian kibitzers, a Bhosale lead would have worked here|pg||
