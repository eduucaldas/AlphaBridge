nt|vugraphzvw: but it looks like N/S have solid game values and are playing in 3NT.... feels like a flat board, meaning ireland win by around 3|pg||
nt|jallerton: England 4@s-1 in 4-3 fit in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: just to clarify to the kibs asking.  Board 28 has to be substituted for a new one as it was fowled next door|pg||
