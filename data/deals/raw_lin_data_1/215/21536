nt|baldfriede: unless South has ideas, which he should not have because North is a passed hand|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jonathan Slaney|pg||
nt|santyclz: S's @ds are too good to lead, perhaps a @h can talk declarer out of his winning play.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi Jonathan |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  with the doubleton Q10 of @H he will make 6....  but a very low percentage slam.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  hello all|pg||
nt|ady: if n/s have a clear run   may still stop out of game|pg||
nt|spenny80: I know E-W system I can halp you understanding|pg||
nt|spenny80: E-W play like precision system|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: wow..we got info:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also achieved nothing as this will make|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Probably will make 4 now even.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  opps were close to missing 4@S, not the right time for balancing...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jfaria:  I wonder if they would not be in game if trailling...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|engsetter:  jonathan we are asking what the actual percentage is|pg||
nt|ady: problem is what action with 15-16 pts by north?|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 1@d natural or 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c likely to be Gazzilli and 2@d shows good 7+, 2@h to show 5@h+4+@c min hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts very lucky make - the kind of game the chasing side might bid|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: a @Clead would be nasty for E, but only S' 2nd choice of course|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: 2nt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  checking the @C finesse, if it loses may need either @D finesse or @H ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|engsetter:  hello all|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I believe so, but wih a passed hand i wouldnt risk to be letft in 1 @s :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: so 15  or 20   same bid|pg||
nt|spenny80: this hand was a bad spot because a spade lead with ply J from Noth would defeat the contract|pg||

mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|Gerben42:  mini NT so it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  a routine 3NT here|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he he |pg||
nt|engsetter:  pass is wise|pg||
nt|santyclz:  40% (3-2 @hs) * 10% (1 of 5 3-2s) * 50% (@da onside) =  2.5% or did i miss something?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  though they are in trouble whatever|pg||
nt|fabsayc: battle of the 2@D bids, this one multi|pg||
nt|sommer: tempting 4@S in S... may make in S on @Hlead|pg||
nt|baldfriede: what is the NT range for N/S?|pg||
nt|ady: nice mis fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not nice|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 spades needs to find spade queen-maybe West will pass 2H|pg||
mb|2S!|an|fit !H|nt|serhat: 3d must be nat|pg||
nt|baldfriede: "nt must be a transfer to @c then.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this time not so great timing as 4@H EW might be too tough|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2NT*|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  losing 2@H 2@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand      1NT  for n/s looks about right|pg||

nt|sommer: ..now 4@S:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..with the requested @H lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: Multi has stuckwell here|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  looks like it has a chance...on a non-@h lead....since south has no @H to put on the track...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt feels right|pg||
nt|sommer: ..MUST be in S|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I don't like the x here. does East really want @h lead?|pg||
nt|sommer: retrans, pls|pg||
nt|psyck: N will probably retransfer|pg||
nt|spenny80: here probably 4@h made|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  Santorio is very sensible it was possible 5 clubs would make|pg||
nt|serhat: 3d my choice|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not finished yet|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|othered1: Hello, everybody!|pg||
nt|athene: not much interest here; perhaps you think more at MP|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is it best to overtake K spades at some stage?|pg||
nt|ady: can now discard 2 diamonds   and lose 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but would not we all?|pg||
nt|ady: cashing A@D   would certainly have set 4@H   on the distribution there is|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass as N after 1@S can|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: north too strong for simple preference to 2@D    so 2NT|pg||
nt|serhat: vul-non vul|pg||
nt|spenny80: in e-w agreement w has bidded unbal @d @h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Probably trump A, followed by another @h.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|athene: i would think declarer will concede the @SQ and make ten tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but South optimistic to bid on     most plat 3@H as forcing   asking to chose between a heart or no-trump game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass is a fair shot at MPs or BAM, because opps are vul in a probable nonfit. but at IMPs it is dangerous to "fade the shooter" in these situations (analogy from dice, meaning to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bet against the one with the dice)|pg||
nt|sommer: "Tnx East":)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well if you dont lead @C then one goes on the @SQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: Unfavorable vulnerability & a balanced hand, & opps have already exchanged some info...was a poor time for East to step into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: still likely to do down  as defence should get 3 trump triicks and a club|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  losing @HA @HJ and @CA only|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: diamonds break well   but still not enough|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice work to get to the very good 3N.  True double-dummy bidding would have had it played by west, however|pg||
pc|h3|nt|serhat: 3nt could have been cold?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the reuslt of the x. with a minor lead 4@h would have been set|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: probably no need to overtake @SK, with all those entries to dummy|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so after 3 bds could be 70-4...|pg||

nt|jaapfr: was it really?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: both could not ask @CK for 7nt??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can claim before the lead 13 tricks if pd AKAK|pg||
nt|rv: some play 2M on 2@d (Multi) to show t/o of M, would have worked well here if Lo Presti had that treatment available|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: 2nd surprise make of 4@h by w.  It that enough for a trend?|pg||
nt|ady: west has to lose 2 more trump tricks and a club  unless defence mangles |pg||
nt|jaapfr: saves time:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|engsetter:  less dramatic of course|pg||
nt|baldfriede: E/W are being forced to do something, and this of course increases the risk to go too high.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some Easts might double 4 hearts- partner liable to have spade fit and some values|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Cant see a gulty 4 not entering auction from E/W field|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jaapfr: S not W|pg||

nt|spenny80: can defeat on a lead @s|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a difficult hand to bid over 1@S, even without the overcall.  Support doubles might simplify things here.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: and a flat game- no hope for trailing team|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|othered1: If EW can find them, don't they make more @H than NS can make @S?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: i like direct 3nt by W too kibs with a 3333333333333333:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H pass and then up to S|pg||
nt|farrukh: Thinking of bidding 2@d or 2@h or DBL|pg||
nt|odysseus69: are we allowed something stronger?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: 4C is an excellent bid. it runs a small risk of missing 3N if pd has just the right hand, but it puts considerable pressure on NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but less after opps do lead @HA:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think Dbl should show some @S no?|pg||
nt|farrukh: dbl Should confirm @ds and should ideally not have a 4M thats how usually it works but then again all depends on agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  indeed I was a little surpised that west did not bid 3 hearts he cant see many spades|pg||

nt|spenny80: not 4@s with 2round @h and 2 in @c in defence|pg||
nt|othered1: do we know what double meant?|pg||
nt|rv: most expert folks play 2@c on 1M as art GF relay and nothing about @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: * nobody can jump"|pg||
nt|psyck: many would prefer a 6th @d for the ovecall here & with no @s wastage double 1@s instead|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club lead  gives no chance |pg||

pc|h9|nt|baldfriede: well done not to raise to 5@d|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  will ask my pd what he thinks :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Apparently S thinks it shows @s too.|pg||
nt|jfaria:  with a minimum hand 2@s or 2@d?|pg||
nt|rv: wrong contract and wrong lead|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|dkkello:  but a fair shoot |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I actually like a pass over the overcall.   denies 3 spades....and when parter reopens...I can raise @S showing Hx....|pg||
nt|engsetter:  this cannot be right its like saying we can wrap up 9 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: If playing support x's, 3@s should show hx, but I don't know if it extends to 10x.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: East has a huge hand for hearts, given he bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch required|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee, I would be getting nervous now if I was E:)|pg||
nt|farrukh: yes it should show tolerance in MAJORs else he could easily have bid 2@d over 2@c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|engsetter:  no interest to the play|pg||
nt|othered1: East sold out?  Taking 4@H as some kind of lead director?|pg||
nt|psyck: E did his job with the 3@s raise|pg||
nt|farrukh: @h @h @h should beat it or @d @d @d |pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: when both opps are bidding and partner is silent at these colors, the percentages greatly favor the advantages of the preempt over the measly 2C overcall. a decisive point is that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont have an entry to your clubs so the idea of attracting a lead to beat their 3N doesnt hold as much water as it would with an entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is makeable no doubt, but no certainty|pg||
pc|sA|nt|farrukh: 4@h had chance to make but 5@d has no chance|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he thinks his partner's delayed 4@H bid shows a weak hand and he is worried opps have a lot of spades on|pg||
nt|engsetter:  unlucky|pg||

nt|remo: *bel, srry|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|atlantajon:  careful not to block suit|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's basically on a spade finesse|pg||
nt|ady: possible to have gained stopping out of game|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well done|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably just shows a good hand, but didn't exactly solve the rebid problem.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|athene: the main issue here is what it means to pass THEN bid 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it would be masterminding as partner asked you to  bid 3nt with a stop.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doesnt look easy to me on diamond lead with club back, as long as W puts up heart queen on first round of sui, which should be fairly automatic at this level|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: With a @D fit, why didn't west raise at once?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Jon NS had 4@H|pg||

nt|dkkello:  the scores so fare: I can't say much has happened since  (Leonard Cohen , Closing Time )|pg||
nt|serhat: so 500 good result|pg||
nt|serhat: but I wont be surprised if 4s makes other room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S doomed here even DD|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt NS? quite a go|pg||
nt|serhat: last hand Jaap|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but 4H is not, i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: understood Serhat|pg||
nt|ady: however on clair lost 8 imps  failing in 3NT by 2  on the good lead of a spade  where 2NT was made plus 1 here|pg||
nt|ady: yes Jaap|pg||
nt|othered1: north's hand is a variant of the "Bridge World Nightmare Hand," and needs special methods to handle it  . . . |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, I would touch 4@h with as much reluctance as a bra with spikes on the inside.|pg||
nt|rv: I presume South could have bid 2n to break relay (if they were playing further relays) and North could have shown his shape  (atleast 6@s)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 2C was natural and I am being unfair about lead - it wasnt alerted|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jaapfr: hoi all ge ga gm|pg||
nt|athene: transfer pre-empts! |pg||
nt|athene: i think these might be under-rated|pg||
nt|othered1: And if I have to give them extra auctions by opening with an artificial bid, even more reason not to open|pg||
nt|athene: sure, it gives opps two chances to bid|pg||
nt|athene: but often that just gives them more room to get tangled up :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H best chances|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @s @h @d @c Running Score|pg||
mb|p|nt|giuliocs: @s @h @d @c http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: expecially a way to get a @H suit into the auction without much risk|pg||
nt|athene: and right-siding the final contract might well counterbalance any tactical disadvantage|pg||
nt|ady: the 1100 only cost 4 imps    5@D X +1 in OR    950|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg operation is a *very* tough job.  For some reason many players don't realize that their top priority should be to insure the vg oper can clearly see all their bids and plays.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now X|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is that penalty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Italians have always been known for off-shape doubles, but this one pushes the envelope|pg||
nt|jaapfr: seems not so simple for N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if 3@H is a spade preempt it does not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was joking|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 6@d here with A@h right-sided. 6@c won't work due to the @c split|pg||
nt|psyck: nice slam from Wests hand, do not need to rightside as cards are|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but completely different bidding i just saw|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 6@d is a good contract here...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  yes...I agree....and we all should be VERY grateful to them for thier time and effort!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x106s6_leonard-cohen-closing-time_music|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes spade preempt so double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C then 4@H would be ideal?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now is this supposed to be pen or responsive?|pg||
nt|farrukh: that is possibly going to be a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i will bet Versace is not sure how N means it|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ok we have to decide who does the sarcasm and who plays it straight|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as S I do not care with that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fair enough martin:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: intreresting to hear whether the voices above agreed with the pass on 1@S By N or the 2@D:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b19|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ah other table also got @C into play so 4@H failed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: again cards friendly for 4 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: West with 2 Aces and 4 trumps took conservative action by passing 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south sitting with all the hcp hearing everyone else get aggressive|pg||
nt|engsetter:  presumably the double is good pre emot?|pg||
nt|ady: I would think the pair that made +950 will be disappointed to lose|pg||
nt|mcphee: right David|pg||
nt|spenny80: not easy to found it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but East would probably pass a raise to 3H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: meanwhile a vey ""brave"" 5@H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Where did noeth find that action?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ideal bidding for me X 4@C 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Another hand where you really need methods.  A forcing 2N here may be among them|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @s @h @d @c  Vinci 62 - Uggeri 17 @s @h @d @c|pg||
nt|farrukh: not every hand is gonna open that 4-3-3-3 hand with 11 count, and once u dont open it, opps are going to play 3NT with a most likely @s lead giving declarer the 9th trick|pg||
nt|rv: as Vic remarked, even @s ruff can't beat 4@h here|pg||
nt|rv: best lead for defense|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|mcphee: not so sure about bidding 2@H , really ratty suit plus I have 3@D|pg||

nt|runnerup: 6 @d -doent need @h ace rigth /west (-6nt makes also -because south must keep 4 @c and @h ace -and in the end you must play him @h ace|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@h could be svalues|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D = please pick a major I am serious|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  can be misunderstood though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I would just bid 3@H I told pd I have no pref he should know by now|pg||

nt|santyclz: I'm right there with the original x, after that...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  7 loosers or something like that , to many for a 3 @H bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 14 houses:)?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 clubs and a heart likely  to lose|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: I agree    |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and souths @d bids...is just showing a preference....|pg||
nt|bobholl: should have played 9 for @S|pg||
nt|spenny80: here better 4@h from north to show A (with 4@d look like K now)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: The Open room started a little after this room, so that they could get comparisions, but with the Ferrari (G Ferraro) playing in that room, they may soon overtake us|pg||
pc|d5|nt|engsetter:  but there seem to be 4 losers in that|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he is likely to have a 0-2 count.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: hard for the defence to come to 4 tricks against spades, even if it might look as though they have @C@C@H@D|pg||
nt|othered1: the 2N bid implies they have detailed agreements about follow-ups.  but somehow they missed the good slam.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now south ruffs 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north going to play small diamond to make sure|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|rv: 8 tricks still safe|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mcphee: just think if E also held 9@H|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  opener in west...XX in east...and holding a 15(ish) count.  south cant have anything|pg||

pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: and do we hang 2@D or not pd?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: pd replied defintely not pd we are going to play a lgic 4@H|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|athene: i would expect 4@S to come home somehow or other|pg||
nt|athene: also you might be able to build diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ady: down 3|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: 100 is a cheap price for that|pg||
nt|athene: for example if south leads @DA, you can draw trumps and lead @DQ throwing a loser|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't have a problem with 2@ds but would pass to allow  pd to escape into a potential 5 card @c suit.|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  E in hot spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so north might feel a bit worried about bidding 3nt with a stiff spade|pg||

pc|d3|nt|atlantajon:  400 on @S....perhaps 430 now....if he fires back D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|farrukh: yes @h 2-2 or singlton honour falling will allow it to make, because defence cant play @h twice else they give away a @h trick and get 2@s so  unlikely to beat the hand|pg||

nt|othered1: Did 1@S show @S?|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes 1@s natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  they must not be playing support X's|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and another of the same- 3s showing singleton is becoming popular|pg||
nt|rv: on 1n-3M is played as either fragment or splinter and show 54 either way in minors GF|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: i read it once, could not sleep for weeks|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the point of using splintr instead of fragment deals with declarer staying in NT hand if playing in the  4-3 fit other major|pg||
nt|rv: playing 4 suit transfers, 1n-3m can be played as minors NF/Inv/GF or as both minors better @cs/better @ds resp GF|pg||

nt|engsetter:  2 spades from minimum opener seems very odd to me can anyone explain??|pg||
nt|dkkello:  You have to look at North hand 3-3-4-3 an no extra , bid slowly then or ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I approve of the pass even if 1nt doesn't imply extra values.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  that was a very minimal overcall|pg||
nt|rv: you might play different treatment for 3 level bids if you play 2@s as minor suit stayman though|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: two spades, four diamonds, club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  lay bets how many tricks here I predict 8|pg||
nt|athene: and probably should be able to endplay north to concede the @HK|pg||
nt|santyclz: But 2@s?  I found another ace?|pg||

nt|othered1: still there to set up|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: might get @CQ shift now, and that can just be ducked|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  if you are not playing support doubles...then I have to agree|pg||

pc|cT|nt|odysseus69: alternatively you could play that 2S is a transfer to clubs - allowing opener to indicate support or not- then continue with 3S to show minors and splinter - |pg||
pc|cA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: even with the heart ruff   looks as though 3@D makes|pg||
nt|rv: soft defense, @d shift would have been interesting|pg||

nt|ady: suspect that wil be around 5 imps for IOMMI|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  most newer players spend so much time on "systems" and slam bidding....and forget that this game is more about good defense than anything else|pg||
nt|engsetter:  will 4 spades make here?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not easy to play on Rama ..  I must confess I dont the players |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  doesnt look like it on a @S lead|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  although it is the likely contract....1@S...4@c...4@s|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will not be bid , but if.. S will lead the @C 10 , then maybe|pg||
nt|jfaria:  NS took their chance in board 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  lets see ;)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: it is not unreasonable to think partner is allowed to compete, bidding a @D wins them 5 this time, next 5 times will be losing posions|pg||

nt|baldfriede: sorry, lost connection for a moment|pg||

nt|odysseus69: slam again makeable but not so good|pg||
mb|2N|an|18-20 bal|nt|athene: ok, he really wants 17+ HCP strictly for his 1@C|pg||
nt|engsetter:  all according to plan so far|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 spades, 3 diamonds @CA and  club ruff -- on a @S lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  No @S lead :)|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  protecting his partners @C's|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i expect they will bid this one|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|psyck: didn't miss much|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I must be missing something.  With @ds 3-3 with the K onside, it doesn't look too tough.|pg||

nt|spenny80: 2NT limit raise with 3 cards|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N 3-card invitational raise?|pg||
nt|othered1: would be even more attractive with west's majors reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: not sure why N did not simply raise @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: the state of the score however does mean they need to get started|pg||

nt|engsetter:  still makes doesnt it?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  if he doesnt try to ruff any @c|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  getting to hand to continue to ruff is the issue|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even though I'm blind (the @dk is offside) you still have time.|pg||
nt|engsetter:  no point after the doubek he cant set the ckubs up it has to diamonds|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he has to find 3-3 @D|pg||
nt|engsetter:  sorry for the typing|pg||
nt|dkkello:  so far 23-1 for E-W   |pg||
nt|engsetter:  yes but if KD onside ( we know it isnt)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  doesnt matter where K is|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: spade lead would be costly|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like this is the way they begin 3-card limit raises|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps a direct raise would show a weaker hand|pg||
nt|athene: west might do that after the raise i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H lead also quite helping declarer:)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  as long as he starts D right away|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: west does not really want diamond ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
nt|athene: so he might well just go for the spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|xenya: win in dummy and a diamond to the Q -- offers lots of chances   |pg||
nt|ady: down at least 1 in 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is definitely safer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it's amazing how often people lead from this sort of holding after their partner raised, and how often it costs a game swing|pg||
nt|othered1: does show the merit of using something other than the simple raise to promise a high honor in support, |pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S@S REAL SCORE:      Uggeri 91 - Iommi 32      @S@S@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: seems that more and more are discounting 2NT - I am not in favour of 18 as a minimum|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: sorry of course the 3@D was a gain for Uggeri|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  pulling trump as he sets @D|pg||
nt|queequeg: Clair and De Micheli are from Padova|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 2 spades can go down 1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as in 2@S ic no 8 tricks|pg||
nt|queequeg: De Micheli is the sponsor of the team, Clair a very famous bridge teacher|pg||
nt|odysseus69: With a maximum North might have bid 4C over 3NT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: but perhaps at the cost of preemption|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was a push on 24|pg||
nt|mcphee: west might have made a t/o dble over the @D opening|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @S @H @D @C ITALY CUP - Running Score:|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: so only @C lead and direct @S switch quarantees down|pg||
nt|queequeg: one of the most important ones in italy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i think garozzo has a special bid here for east - he bids 1nt to say "i have a raise but no top honour"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think this lead will beat 4@H|pg||
nt|giuliocs: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||

pc|c2|nt|queequeg: yes Padova is the same town of De Falco|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: will need to get diamond right|pg||

nt|queequeg: @S@S@S   http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html |pg||
nt|ady: and west will already have shown 13 hcp  after the successfull heart finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can ruff 2 @cs unless n leads a @h for a @s lead.  Which of course would set up the q.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcphee: and susrely would make t/o dble with 4@S in that case|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|atlantajon:  ruff A@s|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and pulls trump and lead H up|pg||
nt|queequeg: they play at the same bridge club|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|nt|othered1: the outside of trumps K more likely to take a trick than the Q, than trump Q10x is to lose a trick.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: must have discarded 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: or redouble to show honor, or the like|pg||

nt|queequeg: u welcome :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would have ensured a set too|pg||
pc|d3|nt|atlantajon:  J@s will be promoted now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: maybe west wanted to get a force going|pg||
nt|athene: hoping south had 5-1-(43)|pg||
nt|mcphee: the rosenkranz redble showing A K orQ|pg||
nt|engsetter:  any minor lead|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there was really any urgency to cash out spades just for the sake of cashing them out|pg||
nt|athene: with west having that hand he can see declarer can never just "draw trumps and run a minor throwing his spade losers"|pg||
nt|engsetter:  So we are all agreed that was a terrible lead?|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was unsucessful :)|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe with a likely, unexpected trump trick, west thought to giv ethe least away on opening lead and chose the suit partner raised.  Not terrible on the auction, befoe dummy was ...|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mcphee: not so clear |pg||
nt|ady: I think so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is so lonely here:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H is a conventional call that instructs the opponents to bid a game they might not otherwise bid and tells them how to make it|pg||
nt|spenny80: flat board the 11th|pg||
nt|othered1: sound preempt  by west|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, you take every chance to make even at cost of 1 or 2 more down unless doubled|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - not silly - I am silly|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north might respond 2@C to 1nt intending to pass any rebid? but south might or might not have a 1nt opener|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  not the best lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|psyck: both tables choose to bid 2N instead of 3@c|pg||

nt|jaapfr: so wd EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -110 too -50|pg||
nt|othered1: To the point he likely can discount the expected bad trump split..  What he had to discount is that south would take what looks to be a very aggressive 4@S bid.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|engsetter:  I bet on 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: well passed    by north   collect 50   rather than lose 10 in 3@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so deserves 2 imps (so next board pls:)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: not the usual Jacoby start|pg||
nt|jfaria:  delayed supp in @c must mean somethoing...|pg||

nt|jfaria:  i wonder what|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect 2@h showed 5@h+4@s any strength|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe West just showed 4-5-0-4 but maybe not|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s is further relay, not sure of sequences beyond that|pg||
nt|rv: many Italians play 1M-2@C-2@D variety of min hands w/o 4OM, 1M-2@C-2@h shows 5M+4OM any strength etc|pg||
nt|jfaria:  looks like E didnt show @h yet|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jaapfr: 110%?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: go team|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: lose 100|pg||
nt|ady: very little in this set    Clair had a mountain to climb   and never really looked like  getting close|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and if @SK on and @HJ then some 10 specs were shouting why the nfools did not bid 4@S (poor bridge:(|pg||
mb|6C|nt|engsetter:  7 then|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  maybe he is thinking : " too strong to bid 4@h now"|pg||
mb|6H|nt|atlantajon:  they can still recover though|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  not now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  but ther goes 7 |pg||

nt|ady: would not 3NT then be right from East?|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  this is a good example of jacoby VS texas transfers.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C rebid GF any distribution|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6 bids and at 2 level    great|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3@c must be some clever bid :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C might be Stayman - unusual treatment if it was|pg||
nt|rv: looks like 3@c was transfer to @d possibly stayman|pg||
nt|rv: playing rubensohl or rumpelsohl here, all bids from 2n onwards are transfers|pg||
pc|d8|nt|engsetter:  lead diamond underlead top hearts|pg||
nt|engsetter:  anyone out there good at dealing with damp cellars?|pg||
nt|ady: seems 1 in each suit|pg||
nt|rv: transfer to opps suit is played as stayman as indicated by Vic|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: surely if played by N|pg||
nt|mcphee: trump lead will be no fun for S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a GF 1@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D 0-1 controls|pg||
pc|d2|nt|atlantajon:  for the newer player.....  2@D transfer...followed by game bid show minor sdlam interest|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I like to bid 4 @H on V hand first time just to play ..|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@H may not be so easy|pg||
nt|mcphee: although he can make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no 1c has many meanings|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1 suppose 2@C was GF|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play double as stayman (Inv+, semibal hand), transfer to opps suit as showing shortness GF, 2n as @cs or weak comp in any suit and rest transfers Inv+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks ok for deep finesse - tougher for mortals but the 2S bid is a good help|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: If I were east, I'd think partner was void of trumps|pg||
nt|ady: can make if north not awake|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: good result and claim +1 pls operaror:) next board|pg||
nt|ady: shoul|pg||
nt|ady: best to duck|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|rv: Lo Presti will try his best not to give entry to dummy|pg||
nt|rv: @DQ or run @H8 now?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: be obedient and a bit brave and play @S lead W!|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  give east a 4 ace opener....and he wants to go|pg||
nt|jaapfr: OR did it in 11 bids and here in 9 bids|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: the notes i have end at 2@D|pg||
nt|queequeg: next round we will broadcast Vinci-Cabiati|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: wd|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can make    ruffing 2 clubs in hand after drawing 2 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|mcphee: now should trump a @C after @S finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: lets see how he manages|pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S@S REAL SCORE:      Uggeri 105 - Iommi 32      @S@S@S|pg||
nt|ady: and must duck again|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the rest is a mystery|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|othered1: why did west play 3 to first trick?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|baldfriede: It would be mine. Part of the system I have with my usual partner.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West knwn to have 4 diamonds and 2 spades and too strong for weak NT - GOOD CLUES|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: needs to draw a second trump before ruffing another club|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|ady: now making    not that easy |pg||
pc|s8|nt|jaapfr: well self correction|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rv: why cash only @SA, strange play?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: playing for 7 spades - not best- club to 8 was the way forward|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|engsetter:  this is not cheap |pg||
nt|mcphee: defenders did well|pg||
nt|mcphee: 800, perhaps a bit unlucky|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: mostly we blame partners for that flop|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now N can deal with W 4 9 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes still ok|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  now this is a NICE slam|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  playing something like Bergen should be trivial to reach|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yep. Temting to go for grand though.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Tempting*|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S p 3@C mixed raise, 4@C cuebid, 4@H cuebid, 5@C voidwood, 1, asking for kings, @DK is missing, too bad|pg||
nt|rv: Lo Presti had to exit in @HQ when in with @CK to make Cerreto commit @c finesse early|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: part score hand    no-trump best for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: reach 3nt here as NS  unbeatable|pg||
nt|engsetter:  place your bets 4S NS or 5C EW|pg||
nt|giuliocs: Vinci 30 - Cabiati 16|pg||
nt|baldfriede: North may have slam thoughts now|pg||
nt|ady: nice 6@D from Verace 1st round   but even if the diamonds are 2-2 with east and south   the trick likely to come back    but well played by declarer|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @S @H @D @C ITALY CUP - Running Score:|pg||
nt|giuliocs: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@CX-4 better than 6@D C IF they bid that|pg||
nt|ady: there are systems for sspades and diamonds|pg||
nt|spenny80: I'm thinking why E has did finess in club at 3@h...|pg||
nt|rv: well done nonetheless|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jfaria:  any number of @s bellow 6 |pg||
mb|1N|nt|atlantajon:  betting on 5@c sac|pg||
nt|giuliocs: Grimaldi 20 - Uggeri 39|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but after bidding you know where @SK most likely is (but 5@D or 4@S more realistic|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if partner contributes @DK might go for grand assuming you can discard @H on @D but not now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: the 7@CX-4 and the 6@D C are for the HOG fansm|pg||
nt|ady: yes 7@C down 4 at most   800  against a vul small slam|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: That's a rather maximum 2@C opening.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not easy to bid?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I think we can forget 5C now|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  yep|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  4@h has issues|pg||
nt|santyclz: Viewgraph in your timezone:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|giuliocs: Maggio 42 - Mattioli 19|pg||
nt|psyck: on their way to find the same sacrifice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: results other tables:|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 7@C -3 more likely here|pg||
nt|othered1: What is NS 1N range?  Very strong,I'd hope.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5h is a save but 5S is a make|pg||
nt|rv: I think North will bid simple 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: 5@h, 3 down on @d ruff|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now after 2@S|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure why S pass|pg||
nt|engsetter:  west needed to dither for longer over 1 club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Grimaldi 28 - Uggeri 121 @s Maggio 86 - Mattioli 43 @s Clair 36 - Breno bridge 85|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: could have had both one less @C and one less high card.|pg||
nt|queequeg: the match tomorrow will be Clair - Zaleski|pg||
nt|jaapfr: normal defense 11 tr|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  in most systems 1C 1D-3C and north bids 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: N wisely just bids 4@s with just 3 low @s's though he has a great hand with double fits|pg||
nt|psyck: hopefully Souths pass of 5@h was not a forcing pass|pg||
nt|psyck: in which case N would be dreaming slam now|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  XX must show 1st round control|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thx all |pg||
pc|dK|nt|queequeg: Zaleski team "contains" Lauria, Versace...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 15-17 normal not?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: perhaps allowing for 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  likely to make....east needs to start 10S to give the most trouble|pg||
pc|d5|nt|atlantajon:  here we go again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I would have bid 3@H next as east I guess|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some days it's just not your day.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: but 5 loser hands with a good suit aren't common 1N openings|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|othered1: their 2@C openings have shown very badly  here, or at least their judgment in using them.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  east can lead his shoe...now|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  my choice is 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: for any Indian kibitzers, a Bhosale lead would have worked here|pg||
nt|queequeg: next match shown : Clair - Breno|pg||
nt|psyck: (Bhosale is leading your doubleton, & Rev Bhosale is leading pd's doubleton) :)|pg||
nt|queequeg: at 17.30 local time (11.30 EST)|pg||
nt|ady: clair not going to be insulted with 17 HCP|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@DX+1 better than 6@D for EW|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|atlantajon:  2nd choice J@c|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: y i like 2nt after 2@S by S with such a heavy 2@C    agree?|pg||

nt|rv: famous last words:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C was the jackpot bid|pg||
