nt|dkkello:  he he |pg||
nt|engsetter:  pass is wise|pg||
nt|santyclz:  40% (3-2 @hs) * 10% (1 of 5 3-2s) * 50% (@da onside) =  2.5% or did i miss something?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  though they are in trouble whatever|pg||
nt|fabsayc: battle of the 2@D bids, this one multi|pg||
nt|sommer: tempting 4@S in S... may make in S on @Hlead|pg||
nt|baldfriede: what is the NT range for N/S?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|serhat: 3d must be nat|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: part score hand      1NT  for n/s looks about right|pg||

nt|sommer: ..now 4@S:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..with the requested @H lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  looks like it has a chance...on a non-@h lead....since south has no @H to put on the track...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt feels right|pg||
nt|sommer: ..MUST be in S|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I don't like the x here. does East really want @h lead?|pg||
nt|sommer: retrans, pls|pg||
nt|psyck: N will probably retransfer|pg||
mb|3H|nt|engsetter:  Santorio is very sensible it was possible 5 clubs would make|pg||
nt|serhat: 3d my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but i suppose could be minors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is a bit timid|pg||

nt|engsetter:  no surprises here|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hello, everybody!|pg||
nt|athene: not much interest here; perhaps you think more at MP|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is it best to overtake K spades at some stage?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north too strong for simple preference to 2@D    so 2NT|pg||
nt|serhat: vul-non vul|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: i would think declarer will concede the @SQ and make ten tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but South optimistic to bid on     most plat 3@H as forcing   asking to chose between a heart or no-trump game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass is a fair shot at MPs or BAM, because opps are vul in a probable nonfit. but at IMPs it is dangerous to "fade the shooter" in these situations (analogy from dice, meaning to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bet against the one with the dice)|pg||
nt|sommer: "Tnx East":)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|psyck: Unfavorable vulnerability & a balanced hand, & opps have already exchanged some info...was a poor time for East to step into the bidding|pg||

nt|ady: diamonds break well   but still not enough|pg||
pc|sK|nt|serhat: 3nt could have been cold?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the reuslt of the x. with a minor lead 4@h would have been set|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes i think we all aggreed about that|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||

mb|1D|nt|engsetter:  no bets on the contract here|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C - 3@H - 3@S ?|pg||
nt|athene: 4-loser hand facing a 4-loser hand...but when you are contemplating 6 or 7, the LTC is not so accurate|pg||
nt|athene: you need to know if opps can actually take the first trick or two|pg||
nt|athene: if they can, the fact that you have about 24 tricks yourself is irrelevant|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @S @H @D @C ITALY CUP - Running Score:|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: of course if opps are from the "lead trumps vs 7" school, you might bid 7@S :)|pg||

nt|queequeg: @S@S@S   http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html |pg||
mb|1S|nt|engsetter:  there is a trend in the modern game to overcall at the 2 level on next to nothing with length in openers suit|pg||
nt|serhat: interesting convention here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|othered1: And I guess they play 2@H forcing (not everyone does)|pg||
nt|athene: south may now splinter with 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: which is just what north wants to hear|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and -1100's build character....LOL|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: ok, this is sensible|pg||
nt|athene: south does not care all that much about anything except keycards|pg||

nt|serhat: may be 2nt nat|pg||
nt|serhat: duck is best here|pg||
nt|serhat: from both hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: i would be tempted to overcall 2@D with the east hand|pg||
nt|serhat: small small small. and then big big ..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: in case partner is on lead vs 3NT|pg||
nt|engsetter:  can anyone explain 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, Sabine would certainly approve.  She believed taking away the 1 level with a 2@c over 1@d overcall is worth a few risks.|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  I have to agree Joe...  but I have sat as dummy for more then a few 1100's....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: hand 18 where 6@S was missed   4@S X + 2 in OR|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in dummy, for sure. less clear to me that declarer should duck in his own hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: but it could easily run into a lot of trouble|pg||
nt|engsetter:  for most denies Q spades|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|santyclz: *believes!  (no implications intended.)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: maybe just two keycards, saying nothing about @SQ|pg||

nt|othered1: Not an auction I would have predicted, but that extra @S is signficant here.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|queequeg: hi Bob :)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 9 of clubs makes me relax anyway:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: so 11 imps for leaders though they did not bid the lay down slam|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|engsetter:  yes the responses to 4Nt seem odd here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: hi|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|serhat: N is on a right track anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i would simply knock out the ace of D and see what develops. uncharacteristically prosaic, but that seems the most flexible line|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|xenya: here, the 2@C overcall worked nicely too -- albeit in a different way |pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|athene: could claim after that trick|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: ruff heart, @SQ, dummy is good|pg||
nt|engsetter:  clealry a major misunderstanding|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is 5@H did show two keycards with no @SQ|pg||

nt|athene: if you don't think your opponents will reach the right contract anyway, you might not risk so much to pre-empt them :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@D looks about right with that hand at favourable vulnerability over a strong club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well here 4 diamonds may make|pg||

mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: you still have heart danger if you duck, because now you might win only one club trick, and they can still lead hearts. you will get 2 heart tricks but you may have several tempos ...|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  nor 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4C is an excellent bid. it runs a small risk of missing 3N if pd has just the right hand, but it puts considerable pressure on NS|pg||
mb|4D|nt|engsetter:  indeed I was a little surpised that west did not bid 3 hearts he cant see many spades|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hard to awoid now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody can just below game now|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: * nobody can jump"|pg||
nt|psyck: many would prefer a 6th @d for the ovecall here & with no @s wastage double 1@s instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club lead  gives no chance |pg||
nt|serhat: 4S is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: well done not to raise to 5@d|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|dkkello:  but a fair shoot |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I actually like a pass over the overcall.   denies 3 spades....and when parter reopens...I can raise @S showing Hx....|pg||
nt|engsetter:  this cannot be right its like saying we can wrap up 9 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: If playing support x's, 3@s should show hx, but I don't know if it extends to 10x.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: East has a huge hand for hearts, given he bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch required|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee, I would be getting nervous now if I was E:)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|engsetter:  no interest to the play|pg||
nt|othered1: East sold out?  Taking 4@H as some kind of lead director?|pg||
nt|psyck: E did his job with the 3@s raise|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: when both opps are bidding and partner is silent at these colors, the percentages greatly favor the advantages of the preempt over the measly 2C overcall. a decisive point is that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont have an entry to your clubs so the idea of attracting a lead to beat their 3N doesnt hold as much water as it would with an entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is makeable no doubt, but no certainty|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|athene: maybe he thinks his partner's delayed 4@H bid shows a weak hand and he is worried opps have a lot of spades on|pg||
nt|engsetter:  unlucky|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|atlantajon:  careful not to block suit|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's basically on a spade finesse|pg||
pc|d6|nt|engsetter:  well done|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: the main issue here is what it means to pass THEN bid 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it would be masterminding as partner asked you to  bid 3nt with a stop.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doesnt look easy to me on diamond lead with club back, as long as W puts up heart queen on first round of sui, which should be fairly automatic at this level|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: With a @D fit, why didn't west raise at once?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: some might play that 3@H over 3@D shows a diamond fit|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I am a little confused why they didnt want the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm ga ge all|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: or a defensive blunder|pg||

nt|psyck: The Open room started a little after this room, so that they could get comparisions, but with the Ferrari (G Ferraro) playing in that room, they may soon overtake us|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@S down after @C @SA x@S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|othered1: not that arcane and north used to be a clear 1@S opening, unless you have gadget bids to sort out major 2-suiters|pg||
nt|ady: nice first trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: some players use a redble to show an honor card in @S|pg||
nt|mcphee: that helps defensively at times if redble were to show the A or K for example|pg||
nt|ady: helps for lead if defending no-teump contract|pg||
nt|ady: no-trump|pg||

nt|engsetter:  will 4 spades make here?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not easy to play on Rama ..  I must confess I dont the players |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  doesnt look like it on a @S lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  lets see ;)|pg||

mb|p|nt|engsetter:  I dont think anyone makes game here do they?|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  if he doesnt try to ruff any @c|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  getting to hand to continue to ruff is the issue|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even though I'm blind (the @dk is offside) you still have time.|pg||
nt|engsetter:  no point after the doubek he cant set the ckubs up it has to diamonds|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he has to find 3-3 @D|pg||
nt|engsetter:  sorry for the typing|pg||
nt|dkkello:  so far 23-1 for E-W   |pg||
nt|engsetter:  yes but if KD onside ( we know it isnt)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  doesnt matter where K is|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he can lose 2H and 1D|pg||
nt|engsetter:  as they are 3-3 of course|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead would be costly|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like this is the way they begin 3-card limit raises|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps a direct raise would show a weaker hand|pg||
nt|athene: west might do that after the raise i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H lead also quite helping declarer:)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  as long as he starts D right away|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: west does not really want diamond ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
nt|athene: so he might well just go for the spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|xenya: win in dummy and a diamond to the Q -- offers lots of chances   |pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is definitely safer|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: it's amazing how often people lead from this sort of holding after their partner raised, and how often it costs a game swing|pg||
nt|othered1: does show the merit of using something other than the simple raise to promise a high honor in support, |pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S@S REAL SCORE:      Uggeri 91 - Iommi 32      @S@S@S|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  pulling trump as he sets @D|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: but perhaps at the cost of preemption|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was a push on 24|pg||
nt|mcphee: west might have made a t/o dble over the @D opening|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: so only @C lead and direct @S switch quarantees down|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: i think garozzo has a special bid here for east - he bids 1nt to say "i have a raise but no top honour"|pg||

nt|mcphee: the rosenkranz redble showing A K orQ|pg||
nt|engsetter:  any minor lead|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there was really any urgency to cash out spades just for the sake of cashing them out|pg||
nt|athene: with west having that hand he can see declarer can never just "draw trumps and run a minor throwing his spade losers"|pg||
nt|engsetter:  So we are all agreed that was a terrible lead?|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was unsucessful :)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ady: non vull  so not much lost|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: the 2@C opening has a wide range and you have to discuss how to distinguish hands with competition.  Here 2@S didn' take away all that much space|pg||
nt|psyck: last deal of this match coming up, but looking at the score, the match is already about over|pg||

nt|santyclz: Which I invariably seem to do.|pg||
nt|psyck: 50+imps is too much to make up in the 17 deals reamining|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, will be difficult to close the gap with only 16 more boards to come.|pg||

nt|nemeo: la linea per 4 prese a quadri secondo percentuale è battere l'asso (78%) che come si vede qui perde|pg||
nt|remo: poi occorre decidere quale impasse fare e, se a @S, da quale parte, anche se è meglio prima cercare la Q@S terza in caduta e caso mai fare l impasse a @C|pg||
