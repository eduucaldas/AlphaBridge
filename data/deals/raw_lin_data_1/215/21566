mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: dbl?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H!|an|8+ fit !S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Gerben42:  a bit much for 1NT so Dbl is fine|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H showing a good raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @H a spade raise?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  important point is that S does NOT bid 2@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H probably a good raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome Mike |pg||
nt|sybarra: New Years in Oz  now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a direct 2@s would show a weakish raise to 2@s, which can be a useful distinction|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  50 more minutes right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no its 1211 already |pg||
nt|jbennet: north now can change minus for plus by bidding 3 h. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  2NT would probably have been better for S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: spec asks why North passed 2@h instead of doubling - think a double should show a bit more than six small and out |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although 6421 is a promising shape|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  South sort of knows that partner is broke, but he also knows singleton @S|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  probably PASS by S is best and N can bid on knowing that partner doubled with 3+@S so he is strong|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|sybarra: yes I think this could have gone better for n/s |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  he will be happy of course that @D10 falls|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of how the bidding should have gone however |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT looks a decent value bid, with A108x in spades - would probaBly play 3@h |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Gerben42:  in the other room, W moved again after this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but really 1@H means you dont make game here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with 4-4 majors, partner must respond 1@S then bid 2@H over your X|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so 4@S the only possible game is out|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: looking for 3 nt maybe |pg||

pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: a trifle high. Still, maybe EW are looking for swings |pg||

nt|mdgraham: Interesting that both Wests doubled. 1NT is also a possibility, but J10 doubleton in the opening suit is a minus feature|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it does show the balanced nature of the hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and may be what West intended to show with 2@d|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well in my book pd can raise 1N to 3 with three small...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case, maybe 2@h by East is enough - but it's easy from where we are sitting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, which makes 1NT dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I just think white on red East should pass 1@H in tempo and hope to lure opps into balancing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: passing is certainly an option for West|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now declarer has to find his chance which is to lose no @H trick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42:  this requires Kx in S|pg||
