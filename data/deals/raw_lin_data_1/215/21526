nt|mug: Roberts checking the backs of the cards|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|gsper:  EW can make 3NT but will hardly bid it|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2c=majors I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|mug: the standard is never very high on the first evening|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mug: again I can't agree with Basil Letts' opening lead, it's not a pairs tournament|pg||
nt|mug: longest and strongest|pg||
nt|mug: 1NT is reasonable on values, but why not just pass and let the opponents declarer the hand vulnerable?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: E/W are fine in clubs of course but West may think partner has six diamonds not four|pg||
nt|mug: he's probably supposed to in theory|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mug: East should be bidding game unless his partner is in the habit of opening total rubbish|pg||
nt|mug: well I suppose you can hardly describe Williams' hand as otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: rajesh probably meant 3h as premptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: as a Dutch specator observes, double would have given a better impression of East's hand|pg||
nt|mug: couldn't have put it better myself|pg||
nt|mug: 2@C over 1NT might also have given a better impression of West's hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|mug: might work out though by knocking out declarer's certain spade entry to dummy |pg||
nt|mug: Jones knows the spade position from declarer's play of @SA at trick one|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|gsper:  I thought 2@C was enterprising, but S is of a different opinion|pg||

nt|mug: predict two|pg||
nt|mug: fortunately for England also bound to make on the normal heart lead|pg||
nt|mug: in Philadelphia England prevailed in the world championships semi-final with a big comeback and a dubious ruling|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: Today's Bulletin will be uploaded tonight at: www.tinyurl.com/winternationals2011|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mug: that's quite a lot of spades for a man who couldn't bid over 1@H the previous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: can our boys punish him?|pg||
nt|mug: a chance to get 8 of their 11 bills back|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|mug: will Rainforth take the safe game or go for the throat?|pg||
nt|mug: Ed Jones is nearing the end of his junior career and it shows passing that hand in third seat|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mug: a sound player won't be going for more than 500 for 3@S in this position|pg||
nt|mug: so it's easy to imagine the Netherlands being well up for this encounter|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  That D will get a lot of @S from W|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mug: very little point opening 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|mug: and occasionally declarer is 7-4 and buys a nice side-suit situation and makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  I would have expected more|pg||
nt|mug: 13 top tricks in notrumps here, but I fear E/W will struggle having missed the diamond fit|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps 2@D would have been a better choice than 3@C, always time to repeat the clubs next round|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|mug: so I have fair sympathy with a simple game bid although I might have chosen 3NT|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gsper:  But since NS have not discovered their @D fit, 2 was enough|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes I agree, should have bid 3s atleast |pg||
nt|mug: they now appear to have clubs agreed, not ideal|pg||
nt|mug: looks like 4@D was a cue-bid agreeing clubs, and 4NT was KC|pg||
mb|6S|nt|mug: double showing 3-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: perhaps two rounds of trumps, then a club up?|pg||
nt|mug: let them have one ruff|pg||
nt|mug: annoying hand to play and declarer is rightly taking his time|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: perhaps East with his three aces could add a seventh?!|pg||
nt|mug: would be brave|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: the best England can do here is put declarer on the spade guess, that requires a heart to the ace next, probably too hard|pg||
nt|mug: Letts may simply play a second diamond, playing his partner for singleton|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mug: it's normally best when partner jumps to six to pass without thinking too much, assume he knows what he's doing|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphztm: thx subhran|pg||
nt|mug: dubious duck at trick one in theory, as opps might be able to shift to spades|pg||
nt|mug: on the other hand they rarely do|pg||
mb|3S|nt|subhranp: Manywar lucky to get away with 5H in the other room|pg||

nt|mug: same thing here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mug: 2NT is a bit thin but he can afford to play his rush|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: North has a good hand facing the minirs|pg||
nt|mug: will he stand it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: think Shah might have risked 4@S with his 6/5|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|subhranp: 5h makes as the cards are but I would have preferred dbl of 4s..|pg||
