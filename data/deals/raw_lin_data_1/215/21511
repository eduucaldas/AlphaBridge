nt|engsetter:  pass is wise|pg||
nt|santyclz:  40% (3-2 @hs) * 10% (1 of 5 3-2s) * 50% (@da onside) =  2.5% or did i miss something?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand      1NT  for n/s looks about right|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|atlantajon:  looks like it has a chance...on a non-@h lead....since south has no @H to put on the track...|pg||

nt|athene: not much interest here; perhaps you think more at MP|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is it best to overtake K spades at some stage?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: north too strong for simple preference to 2@D    so 2NT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i would think declarer will concede the @SQ and make ten tricks|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: diamonds break well   but still not enough|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  with 2 minor kings...and a 7 card @s suit with a void... south opens 1...not 3.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|engsetter:  no bets on the contract here|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C - 3@H - 3@S ?|pg||
nt|athene: 4-loser hand facing a 4-loser hand...but when you are contemplating 6 or 7, the LTC is not so accurate|pg||
nt|athene: you need to know if opps can actually take the first trick or two|pg||
nt|athene: if they can, the fact that you have about 24 tricks yourself is irrelevant|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: of course if opps are from the "lead trumps vs 7" school, you might bid 7@S :)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  anyone else choose a small @h lead on that last one?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  tres amusante|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: 2@c natural, limited|pg||
nt|othered1: Treating the north hand as more than a minimum black 2-suiter with longer @C, if they play classical Blue Team|pg||
nt|ady: how many diamonds|pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S@S ITALY CUP - Running Scores: |pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S@S   http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html |pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  there is a trend in the modern game to overcall at the 2 level on next to nothing with length in openers suit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|othered1: And I guess they play 2@H forcing (not everyone does)|pg||
nt|athene: south may now splinter with 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: which is just what north wants to hear|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and -1100's build character....LOL|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, this is sensible|pg||
nt|athene: south does not care all that much about anything except keycards|pg||
nt|othered1: kExcept that south doesn't know of north's "extra' @S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: if he finds his partner with @SKQ @DA @CA he is going to take a shot at the grand i assume|pg||
nt|queequeg: Welcome to Bob McPhee :)|pg||
nt|ady: well done south   has not removed    this looks around 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i would be tempted to overcall 2@D with the east hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: in case partner is on lead vs 3NT|pg||
nt|engsetter:  can anyone explain 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, Sabine would certainly approve.  She believed taking away the 1 level with a 2@c over 1@d overcall is worth a few risks.|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  I have to agree Joe...  but I have sat as dummy for more then a few 1100's....|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: hand 18 where 6@S was missed   4@S X + 2 in OR|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: but it could easily run into a lot of trouble|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: *believes!  (no implications intended.)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: maybe just two keycards, saying nothing about @SQ|pg||

nt|santyclz: I approve of the pass even if 1nt doesn't imply extra values.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: two spades, four diamonds, club|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  getting to hand to continue to ruff is the issue|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even though I'm blind (the @dk is offside) you still have time.|pg||
nt|engsetter:  no point after the doubek he cant set the ckubs up it has to diamonds|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he has to find 3-3 @D|pg||
nt|engsetter:  sorry for the typing|pg||

nt|engsetter:  yes but if KD onside ( we know it isnt)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  doesnt matter where K is|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he can lose 2H and 1D|pg||
nt|engsetter:  as they are 3-3 of course|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|athene: spade lead would be costly|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like this is the way they begin 3-card limit raises|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps a direct raise would show a weaker hand|pg||
nt|athene: west might do that after the raise i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H lead also quite helping declarer:)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  as long as he starts D right away|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: west does not really want diamond ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
nt|athene: so he might well just go for the spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|xenya: win in dummy and a diamond to the Q -- offers lots of chances   |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|athene: it's amazing how often people lead from this sort of holding after their partner raised, and how often it costs a game swing|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  pulling trump as he sets @D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|s6|nt|othered1: but perhaps at the cost of preemption|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was a push on 24|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so only @C lead and direct @S switch quarantees down|pg||

nt|mcphee: the rosenkranz redble showing A K orQ|pg||
nt|engsetter:  any minor lead|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there was really any urgency to cash out spades just for the sake of cashing them out|pg||
nt|athene: with west having that hand he can see declarer can never just "draw trumps and run a minor throwing his spade losers"|pg||
nt|engsetter:  So we are all agreed that was a terrible lead?|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was unsucessful :)|pg||

mb|5S|nt|atlantajon:  here we go again|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Some days it's just not your day.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: their 2@C openings have shown very badly  here, or at least their judgment in using them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  east can lead his shoe...now|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  my choice is 3@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|atlantajon:  2nd choice J@c|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: y i like 2nt after 2@S by S with such a heavy 2@C    agree?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: despite the liht @SAT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: great stuff by operator and so fast:)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|othered1: see also board 8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: light|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well its  hard hand to bid with their system the intervention gave them some chance|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: this time the 4 card overcall  not going to work so well|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: @cJ first choice for me.  Don't want to pickle my pds qxx or jxxx of @hs.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: non vull  so not much lost|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: the 2@C opening has a wide range and you have to discuss how to distinguish hands with competition.  Here 2@S didn' take away all that much space|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|santyclz: Which I invariably seem to do.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c7|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcphee: S should bid 1N|pg||
nt|ady: maybe south hoping for a re-opening double|pg||
nt|mcphee: n/s could have a vul game|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
mc|10|nt|mcphee: seems a bit much to want to defend 1@S for penalty|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  I am getting questions about the 3@h lead.   after 5@S  (2 with Q..) partner doesnt hold Qxx of hearts...and if Jxxx....then it is pickled always|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|engsetter:  surely no one gets to failing slam here?|pg||

mb|6H|nt|ady: e/w have hearts    and n/s spades     the spades really should win|pg||
nt|mcphee: E hand is getting worse|pg||
nt|santyclz: I agree, leading the @h is very unlikely go give anything away -- unless i do it.|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: *to|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: @S over his head and N is bidding NT|pg||

mb|p|pc|cA|nt|mcphee: now may be dbled at 3 level|pg||
nt|ady: east reulactant to sit for 2@S   with a decent 6 card suit    and an outside ace opposie an opening bid|pg||
nt|engsetter:  lightner double dont lead your suit?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  oh dear|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and the J@c...  gives declarer a chance to drop partners stiff K@c....since noones leads from KJ|pg||

nt|ady: speculative double from north  |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: was 2@D artifcial raise of @H?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: waas Nelson Piquet Brazilian:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Arthur Senna|pg||
nt|ady: needed a trump lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: that may allow it to make|pg||
nt|mcphee: this auction really is a loud noice to lead trumps|pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S@S REAL SCORE:      Uggeri 105 - Iommi 32      @S@S@S|pg||
nt|ady: yes    but the double is poor|pg||
pc|h7|nt|engsetter:  who expects 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|mcphee: partner bid NT, even tho he may have 2@S the lead is dangerous in a way|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh my!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  my thoughts exactly|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or director will be aske if makes 11 tricks here:)|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well surely double says lead something else than your suit????????|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|othered1: maybe 11 because of fear of @D ruff?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|engsetter:  ace hearts IS safest unlikel though it is there is diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: no way he play 7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|engsetter:  so unlikely! but|pg||
