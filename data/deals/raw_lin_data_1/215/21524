mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  South's pass here feels right - he can't double without heart support|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and to bid 2D would have suggested a better suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzuz: aggresive auction by east in the closed room.. |pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  if 2@S is positively constructive, then East would be considering a try|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|d|mb|3D|nt|pjs_ch:  but otherwise the most he can think is of preempting with 3@S|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  North would have like to offer hearts after 2N-X but you'd need|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  all the spade honours (but it would have beenif he had won the @SA|pg||

nt|vugraphzuz: don't know EW lead agreements, but East led his lowest @S|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  questionis whether the combination of extra values shown in the |pg||

nt|mug: miracle|pg||
nt|mug: well spotted kibitzer!|pg||
nt|mug: but there are alternative lines|pg||
