nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he he |pg||
nt|engsetter:  pass is wise|pg||
nt|santyclz:  40% (3-2 @hs) * 10% (1 of 5 3-2s) * 50% (@da onside) =  2.5% or did i miss something?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  though they are in trouble whatever|pg||
nt|fabsayc: battle of the 2@D bids, this one multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: 3d must be nat|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: part score hand      1NT  for n/s looks about right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  looks like it has a chance...on a non-@h lead....since south has no @H to put on the track...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt feels right|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  Santorio is very sensible it was possible 5 clubs would make|pg||
nt|serhat: 3d my choice|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: but i suppose could be minors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is a bit timid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dkkello:  always nice to hit to Aces on the flop  |pg||
nt|serhat: pas is a little wuss?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: is this Blue Club? so 1@C 16+, 1nt 4 controls?|pg||

nt|engsetter:  no surprises here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Hello, everybody!|pg||
nt|athene: not much interest here; perhaps you think more at MP|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is it best to overtake K spades at some stage?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: north too strong for simple preference to 2@D    so 2NT|pg||
nt|serhat: vul-non vul|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|athene: i would think declarer will concede the @SQ and make ten tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but South optimistic to bid on     most plat 3@H as forcing   asking to chose between a heart or no-trump game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass is a fair shot at MPs or BAM, because opps are vul in a probable nonfit. but at IMPs it is dangerous to "fade the shooter" in these situations (analogy from dice, meaning to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bet against the one with the dice)|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: might however get home    now with the good spade pips has 3 spades and 2 clubs    and can make 2 hearts and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|serhat: this hand never should pass at imps. 1 stopper 2 good runnng minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i think we all aggreed about that|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|athene: you overtake the king when you have stiff king facing AJ109xx and only one side entry to the long suit, of course|pg||

pc|cT|nt|remo: gestione del tutto naturale della licita in questa sala, rispetto all'altra, ma il risultato non cambia. Può invece cambiare una presa a favore di N|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  with 2 minor kings...and a 7 card @s suit with a void... south opens 1...not 3.|pg||
nt|serhat: just a joke..|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  no bets on the contract here|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C - 3@H - 3@S ?|pg||
nt|athene: 4-loser hand facing a 4-loser hand...but when you are contemplating 6 or 7, the LTC is not so accurate|pg||
nt|athene: you need to know if opps can actually take the first trick or two|pg||
nt|athene: if they can, the fact that you have about 24 tricks yourself is irrelevant|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @S @H @D @C ITALY CUP - Running Score:|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: of course if opps are from the "lead trumps vs 7" school, you might bid 7@S :)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|athene: 2@c natural, limited|pg||

mb|p|nt|engsetter:  there is a trend in the modern game to overcall at the 2 level on next to nothing with length in openers suit|pg||
nt|serhat: interesting convention here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: And I guess they play 2@H forcing (not everyone does)|pg||
nt|athene: south may now splinter with 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: which is just what north wants to hear|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and -1100's build character....LOL|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, this is sensible|pg||
nt|athene: south does not care all that much about anything except keycards|pg||

mb|p|nt|engsetter:  indeed|pg||

nt|serhat: may be 2nt nat|pg||
nt|serhat: duck is best here|pg||
nt|serhat: from both hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: i would be tempted to overcall 2@D with the east hand|pg||
nt|serhat: small small small. and then big big ..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: in case partner is on lead vs 3NT|pg||
nt|engsetter:  can anyone explain 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, Sabine would certainly approve.  She believed taking away the 1 level with a 2@c over 1@d overcall is worth a few risks.|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  I have to agree Joe...  but I have sat as dummy for more then a few 1100's....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: hand 18 where 6@S was missed   4@S X + 2 in OR|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in dummy, for sure. less clear to me that declarer should duck in his own hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: but it could easily run into a lot of trouble|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|santyclz: *believes!  (no implications intended.)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just two keycards, saying nothing about @SQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: Not an auction I would have predicted, but that extra @S is signficant here.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|queequeg: hi Bob :)|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: 9 of clubs makes me relax anyway:)|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ady: hi|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|engsetter:  on balance how often does it pay to lead from KQ and small ones?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|serhat: N is on a right track anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i would simply knock out the ace of D and see what develops. uncharacteristically prosaic, but that seems the most flexible line|pg||
pc|h9|nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|athene: could claim after that trick|pg||

nt|athene: ruff heart, @SQ, dummy is good|pg||
nt|engsetter:  clealry a major misunderstanding|pg||

nt|athene: how vigorously will east bid diamonds over a strong club here?|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming 4N was RKC, just another hand to add to the long list wihere something went wrong after RKC|pg||

nt|serhat: exactly. if you duck no H danger also|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: perhaps not so vigorously, in view of the previous hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: welcome to Dan Neill :) @H|pg||
nt|athene: if you don't think your opponents will reach the right contract anyway, you might not risk so much to pre-empt them :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@D looks about right with that hand at favourable vulnerability over a strong club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well here 4 diamonds may make|pg||
nt|ady: should lose only 500   5 diamonds may make on a spade guess|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  interesting hand here|pg||
nt|engsetter:  4 spades of course here but will it make?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dkkello:  Sabines exelent book:  http://canadianbridgesupplies.com/work/i-love-this-game-bridge-book-by-sabine-auken/|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: you still have heart danger if you duck, because now you might win only one club trick, and they can still lead hearts. you will get 2 heart tricks but you may have several tempos ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to concede and they might get a  couple long hearts|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|othered1: If EW can find them, don't they make more @H than NS can make @S?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  5 clubs stands no chance|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  nor 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4C is an excellent bid. it runs a small risk of missing 3N if pd has just the right hand, but it puts considerable pressure on NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  indeed I was a little surpised that west did not bid 3 hearts he cant see many spades|pg||

nt|serhat: 4S is good|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dkkello:  but a fair shoot |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I actually like a pass over the overcall.   denies 3 spades....and when parter reopens...I can raise @S showing Hx....|pg||
nt|engsetter:  this cannot be right its like saying we can wrap up 9 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: If playing support x's, 3@s should show hx, but I don't know if it extends to 10x.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: East has a huge hand for hearts, given he bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch required|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee, I would be getting nervous now if I was E:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|engsetter:  no interest to the play|pg||
nt|othered1: East sold out?  Taking 4@H as some kind of lead director?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when both opps are bidding and partner is silent at these colors, the percentages greatly favor the advantages of the preempt over the measly 2C overcall. a decisive point is that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont have an entry to your clubs so the idea of attracting a lead to beat their 3N doesnt hold as much water as it would with an entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is makeable no doubt, but no certainty|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|nt|athene: maybe he thinks his partner's delayed 4@H bid shows a weak hand and he is worried opps have a lot of spades on|pg||
nt|engsetter:  unlucky|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|atlantajon:  careful not to block suit|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's basically on a spade finesse|pg||
pc|h4|nt|engsetter:  well done|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: the main issue here is what it means to pass THEN bid 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it would be masterminding as partner asked you to  bid 3nt with a stop.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doesnt look easy to me on diamond lead with club back, as long as W puts up heart queen on first round of sui, which should be fairly automatic at this level|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: With a @D fit, why didn't west raise at once?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: some might play that 3@H over 3@D shows a diamond fit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|engsetter:  I am a little confused why they didnt want the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm ga ge all|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: or a defensive blunder|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  either one....   "nor" is a contraction that is acceptable|pg||

pc|h3|nt|engsetter:  the operator|pg||

nt|athene: sure, it gives opps two chances to bid|pg||
nt|athene: but often that just gives them more room to get tangled up :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H best chances|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|othered1: expecially a way to get a @H suit into the auction without much risk|pg||

nt|ady: the 1100 only cost 4 imps    5@D X +1 in OR    950|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@S down after @C @SA x@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: not that arcane and north used to be a clear 1@S opening, unless you have gadget bids to sort out major 2-suiters|pg||
nt|ady: nice first trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: some players use a redble to show an honor card in @S|pg||
nt|mcphee: that helps defensively at times if redble were to show the A or K for example|pg||
nt|ady: helps for lead if defending no-teump contract|pg||
nt|ady: no-trump|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes|pg||
