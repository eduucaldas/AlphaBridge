nt|andyv:  N can count up to 8 tricks|pg||

nt|andyv:  E will be endplayed to give up the 9th|pg||
nt|serhat: lucky 3nt .. no entry to W|pg||
nt|gracelin: winning line is win this then DQ|pg||
nt|serhat: duck is bad|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 rounds of spades almost does E in|pg||
nt|gracelin: if low D to King and another D, East can play a Heart to cut communication to dummy for long D|pg||
nt|serhat: true|pg||
nt|gracelin: but declarer has no idea about the distribution, he maybe worried to let West in to play club through|pg||
nt|serhat: then he wont have a chance Patrick|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think N will succeed thru default...E will have a very hard time getting out of the way|pg||

pc|sK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|serhat: it is still makeable|pg||
nt|gracelin: the SQ play (instead of S10) will help partner to count how many tricks declarer has in spades.|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...E will eventually give the 9th trick|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure, if declarer knows to finesse HJ and end play ast with the 5th H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like her options are now very limited|pg||
