nt|engsetter:  pass is wise|pg||
nt|santyclz:  40% (3-2 @hs) * 10% (1 of 5 3-2s) * 50% (@da onside) =  2.5% or did i miss something?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  though they are in trouble whatever|pg||
nt|fabsayc: battle of the 2@D bids, this one multi|pg||
nt|sommer: tempting 4@S in S... may make in S on @Hlead|pg||

nt|jaapfr: not nice|pg||
mb|2D|nt|serhat: 3d must be nat|pg||

nt|sommer: ..with the requested @H lead|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  looks like it has a chance...on a non-@h lead....since south has no @H to put on the track...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt feels right|pg||

nt|baldfriede: I don't like the x here. does East really want @h lead?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|engsetter:  Santorio is very sensible it was possible 5 clubs would make|pg||

nt|jaapfr: start @DA @D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any lead  disattractive|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it is right to take out 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: Hello, everybody!|pg||
nt|athene: not much interest here; perhaps you think more at MP|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is it best to overtake K spades at some stage?|pg||
nt|ady: can now discard 2 diamonds   and lose 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but would not we all?|pg||
nt|ady: cashing A@D   would certainly have set 4@H   on the distribution there is|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass as N after 1@S can|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: north too strong for simple preference to 2@D    so 2NT|pg||
nt|serhat: vul-non vul|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|athene: i would think declarer will concede the @SQ and make ten tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but South optimistic to bid on     most plat 3@H as forcing   asking to chose between a heart or no-trump game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass is a fair shot at MPs or BAM, because opps are vul in a probable nonfit. but at IMPs it is dangerous to "fade the shooter" in these situations (analogy from dice, meaning to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bet against the one with the dice)|pg||
nt|sommer: "Tnx East":)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psyck: Unfavorable vulnerability & a balanced hand, & opps have already exchanged some info...was a poor time for East to step into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: still likely to do down  as defence should get 3 trump triicks and a club|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: diamonds break well   but still not enough|pg||
pc|c6|nt|serhat: 3nt could have been cold?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the reuslt of the x. with a minor lead 4@h would have been set|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|s2|nt|athene: wow|pg||

nt|ady: diamond switch required|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee, I would be getting nervous now if I was E:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|engsetter:  no interest to the play|pg||
nt|othered1: East sold out?  Taking 4@H as some kind of lead director?|pg||
nt|psyck: E did his job with the 3@s raise|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: when both opps are bidding and partner is silent at these colors, the percentages greatly favor the advantages of the preempt over the measly 2C overcall. a decisive point is that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont have an entry to your clubs so the idea of attracting a lead to beat their 3N doesnt hold as much water as it would with an entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is makeable no doubt, but no certainty|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: maybe he thinks his partner's delayed 4@H bid shows a weak hand and he is worried opps have a lot of spades on|pg||
nt|engsetter:  unlucky|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  careful not to block suit|pg||

nt|ady: possible to have gained stopping out of game|pg||
pc|d2|nt|engsetter:  well done|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|athene: the main issue here is what it means to pass THEN bid 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it would be masterminding as partner asked you to  bid 3nt with a stop.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doesnt look easy to me on diamond lead with club back, as long as W puts up heart queen on first round of sui, which should be fairly automatic at this level|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

mc|9|nt|athene: some might play that 3@H over 3@D shows a diamond fit|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you all assume a diamond lead is obvious|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S down after @C @SA x@S|pg||

nt|ady: nice first trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: some players use a redble to show an honor card in @S|pg||

nt|ady: helps for lead if defending no-teump contract|pg||

nt|santyclz: I approve of the pass even if 1nt doesn't imply extra values.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: two spades, four diamonds, club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  lay bets how many tricks here I predict 8|pg||
nt|athene: and probably should be able to endplay north to concede the @HK|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s6|nt|athene: it's amazing how often people lead from this sort of holding after their partner raised, and how often it costs a game swing|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|othered1: but perhaps at the cost of preemption|pg||

nt|dkkello:  an easy 4 @H  .|pg||
nt|fabsayc: weak minors or limit spades or better according to bridgeguys notes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 99% surte no @C to T(whilst @DK 100%)|pg||
nt|psyck: W cannot make once he threw @ct...else he had an option of not cashing @d & taking @c fin instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: DD 7nt C here but expect 6@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|engsetter:  I am prepared to stake my house this will be 4H|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: that chance larger than @CK with N so I agree with Ed|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I was making the point that it was possible that NS would make 5C on last hand which is why I like 4 hearts|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  a nice place?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|engsetter:  it needs some work|pg||
nt|santyclz: I am prepared to stake Dave's house too.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 3NT likely outcome    no plain sailing    but spades lay very well and may manage 3 spades 3 hearts 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   should be down 1   |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: was 5@C unbeatable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S   some game forcing 4th suit I assume|pg||

nt|jaapfr: a GF 1@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D 0-1 controls|pg||
pc|d6|nt|atlantajon:  for the newer player.....  2@D transfer...followed by game bid show minor sdlam interest|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I like to bid 4 @H on V hand first time just to play ..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcphee: 4@H may not be so easy|pg||
nt|mcphee: although he can make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no 1c has many meanings|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1 suppose 2@C was GF|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: If I were east, I'd think partner was void of trumps|pg||

nt|giuliocs: Vinci 30 - Cabiati 16|pg||
nt|baldfriede: North may have slam thoughts now|pg||
nt|ady: nice 6@D from Verace 1st round   but even if the diamonds are 2-2 with east and south   the trick likely to come back    but well played by declarer|pg||

nt|giuliocs: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@CX-4 better than 6@D C IF they bid that|pg||
nt|ady: there are systems for sspades and diamonds|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2N|nt|atlantajon:  betting on 5@c sac|pg||
nt|giuliocs: Grimaldi 20 - Uggeri 39|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but after bidding you know where @SK most likely is (but 5@D or 4@S more realistic|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jaapfr: the 7@CX-4 and the 6@D C are for the HOG fansm|pg||
nt|ady: yes 7@C down 4 at most   800  against a vul small slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: That's a rather maximum 2@C opening.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not easy to bid?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I think we can forget 5C now|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  yep|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  4@h has issues|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: Grimaldi 28 - Uggeri 121 @s Maggio 86 - Mattioli 43 @s Clair 36 - Breno bridge 85|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: could have had both one less @C and one less high card.|pg||
nt|queequeg: the match tomorrow will be Clair - Zaleski|pg||
nt|jaapfr: normal defense 11 tr|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  in most systems 1C 1D-3C and north bids 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: N wisely just bids 4@s with just 3 low @s's though he has a great hand with double fits|pg||
nt|psyck: hopefully Souths pass of 5@h was not a forcing pass|pg||
nt|psyck: in which case N would be dreaming slam now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|queequeg: Zaleski team "contains" Lauria, Versace...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: perhaps allowing for 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  likely to make....east needs to start 10S to give the most trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  here we go again|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: Some days it's just not your day.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: their 2@C openings have shown very badly  here, or at least their judgment in using them.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|atlantajon:  east can lead his shoe...now|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  my choice is 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: for any Indian kibitzers, a Bhosale lead would have worked here|pg||
nt|queequeg: next match shown : Clair - Breno|pg||
nt|psyck: (Bhosale is leading your doubleton, & Rev Bhosale is leading pd's doubleton) :)|pg||
nt|queequeg: at 17.30 local time (11.30 EST)|pg||
nt|ady: clair not going to be insulted with 17 HCP|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@DX+1 better than 6@D for EW|pg||
pc|h5|nt|atlantajon:  2nd choice J@c|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y i like 2nt after 2@S by S with such a heavy 2@C    agree?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls claim 11|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: ouch|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: non vull  so not much lost|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: the 2@C opening has a wide range and you have to discuss how to distinguish hands with competition.  Here 2@S didn' take away all that much space|pg||
nt|psyck: last deal of this match coming up, but looking at the score, the match is already about over|pg||
