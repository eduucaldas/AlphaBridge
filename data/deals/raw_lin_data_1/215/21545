mb|p|nt|marlowepi: increasingly common treatment|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Victor Silverstone|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not sure about 1@D|pg||
nt|psyck: different sequences are possible to show 55 invitational & game force hands, usually in combination with Smolen sequences|pg||
nt|baldfriede: unless South has ideas, which he should not have because North is a passed hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  looks like a strong @C auction here ending in 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|engsetter:  however with no entry to MARTA|pg||

nt|farrukh: well its not a matter of making 3NT but Bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|farrukh: and this hand in MOST of the systems will be played 3NT |pg||
nt|fabsayc: kind of a backwards way though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: north may well make 110-140 in hearts   so not much in this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|baldfriede: W could reopen with 2@d|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Gerben42:  2@D must be some kind either-or bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  either simple raise or strong with something|pg||
nt|psyck: wow|pg||
nt|psyck: nice|pg||
nt|psyck: pd could have much less in @h's on a bad day...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2NT in north position could have been a fair bit weaker|pg||

nt|psyck: but this works great today...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 3@H   South?|pg||

nt|queequeg: UGGERI 61 IOMMI 21|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N should be comfortable, esp as @c will not be lead|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@D is forcing and may ask for @S pref|pg||
nt|farrukh: It looked like as if 2@d either Natural GF or a normal 2@s call|pg||
nt|giuliocs: simple raise or strong with @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  slam is like < 5 %|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to ed Shapiro and Fabio Lo Presti|pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck: a reasonably judged gamble, Giubilo can see enough source of tricks & as long as pd has something decent in @h's for the 4@h bid & opps preempt indicate pd will be very short in @c ...|pg||

nt|baldfriede: I am not too fond of this 3@h overcall. Not in this vulnerabilty situation.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: down on spade lead, might make otherwise but kind of double dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jonathan Slaney|pg||
nt|santyclz: S's @ds are too good to lead, perhaps a @h can talk declarer out of his winning play.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi Jonathan |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  with the doubleton Q10 of @H he will make 6....  but a very low percentage slam.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  hello all|pg||
nt|ady: if n/s have a clear run   may still stop out of game|pg||
nt|spenny80: I know E-W system I can halp you understanding|pg||
nt|spenny80: E-W play like precision system|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sommer: wow..we got info:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also achieved nothing as this will make|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Probably will make 4 now even.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  opps were close to missing 4@S, not the right time for balancing...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jfaria:  I wonder if they would not be in game if trailling...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|engsetter:  jonathan we are asking what the actual percentage is|pg||
nt|ady: problem is what action with 15-16 pts by north?|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 1@d natural or 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c likely to be Gazzilli and 2@d shows good 7+, 2@h to show 5@h+4+@c min hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts very lucky make - the kind of game the chasing side might bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sommer: a @Clead would be nasty for E, but only S' 2nd choice of course|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jaapfr: 2nt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  checking the @C finesse, if it loses may need either @D finesse or @H ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|engsetter:  hello all|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I believe so, but wih a passed hand i wouldnt risk to be letft in 1 @s :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|ady: so 15  or 20   same bid|pg||
nt|spenny80: this hand was a bad spot because a spade lead with ply J from Noth would defeat the contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Hello, everybody!|pg||
nt|athene: not much interest here; perhaps you think more at MP|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is it best to overtake K spades at some stage?|pg||
nt|ady: can now discard 2 diamonds   and lose 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but would not we all?|pg||
nt|ady: cashing A@D   would certainly have set 4@H   on the distribution there is|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass as N after 1@S can|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north too strong for simple preference to 2@D    so 2NT|pg||
nt|serhat: vul-non vul|pg||
nt|spenny80: in e-w agreement w has bidded unbal @d @h|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|athene: i would think declarer will concede the @SQ and make ten tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but South optimistic to bid on     most plat 3@H as forcing   asking to chose between a heart or no-trump game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass is a fair shot at MPs or BAM, because opps are vul in a probable nonfit. but at IMPs it is dangerous to "fade the shooter" in these situations (analogy from dice, meaning to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bet against the one with the dice)|pg||
nt|sommer: "Tnx East":)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well if you dont lead @C then one goes on the @SQ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|psyck: Unfavorable vulnerability & a balanced hand, & opps have already exchanged some info...was a poor time for East to step into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: still likely to do down  as defence should get 3 trump triicks and a club|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  losing @HA @HJ and @CA only|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: diamonds break well   but still not enough|pg||

nt|serhat: 3nt could have been cold?|pg||

mb|d|nt|dkkello:  Sabines exelent book:  http://canadianbridgesupplies.com/work/i-love-this-game-bridge-book-by-sabine-auken/|pg||
nt|spenny80: board 3 Uggeri plays 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you still have heart danger if you duck, because now you might win only one club trick, and they can still lead hearts. you will get 2 heart tricks but you may have several tempos ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to concede and they might get a  couple long hearts|pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S    Incontri in corso:    |pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S  Vinci - Cabiati  35-16|pg||
nt|queequeg: @h@h  Grimaldi - Uggeri 21-57  |pg||
nt|queequeg: @c@c  Maggio - Mattioli  44-27|pg||
nt|queequeg: @d@d  Clair - Br. Breno  22-35|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  a fair spot   but should go down with the bad diamond break|pg||
nt|spenny80: can defeat on a lead @s|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a difficult hand to bid over 1@S, even without the overcall.  Support doubles might simplify things here.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  25 HCP but no game appeals|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and a flat game- no hope for trailing team|pg||
nt|jfaria:  easy 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: coffee/tea deal, easy 4@s|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|othered1: If EW can find them, don't they make more @H than NS can make @S?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  5 clubs stands no chance|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  nor 3nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i like direct 3nt by W too kibs with a 3333333333333333:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H pass and then up to S|pg||
nt|farrukh: Thinking of bidding 2@d or 2@h or DBL|pg||
nt|odysseus69: are we allowed something stronger?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4C is an excellent bid. it runs a small risk of missing 3N if pd has just the right hand, but it puts considerable pressure on NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but less after opps do lead @HA:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think Dbl should show some @S no?|pg||
nt|farrukh: dbl Should confirm @ds and should ideally not have a 4M thats how usually it works but then again all depends on agreements|pg||
nt|psyck: both EW in the two room use lot of artificial conventions , so good chance of both reaching slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  indeed I was a little surpised that west did not bid 3 hearts he cant see many spades|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hard to awoid now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody can just below game now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh sorry missed the 1-14 1nt|pg||
nt|spenny80: n/s here 4@d |pg||
nt|spenny80: not 4@s with 2round @h and 2 in @c in defence|pg||
nt|othered1: do we know what double meant?|pg||
nt|rv: most expert folks play 2@c on 1M as art GF relay and nothing about @cs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: * nobody can jump"|pg||
nt|psyck: many would prefer a 6th @d for the ovecall here & with no @s wastage double 1@s instead|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   may well have made on diamond lead     can recover from K@C lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11-14|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: club lead  gives no chance |pg||
nt|serhat: 4S is good|pg||
nt|jfaria:  first 2@d |pg||
nt|odysseus69: noot sure about "most" but certainly plenty|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baldfriede: well done not to raise to 5@d|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  will ask my pd what he thinks :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Apparently S thinks it shows @s too.|pg||
nt|jfaria:  with a minimum hand 2@s or 2@d?|pg||
nt|rv: wrong contract and wrong lead|pg||
nt|psyck: East knows partner has @cA & a K after pd;s 1st bid itself, so would be thinking of slam at the word go|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dkkello:  but a fair shoot |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I actually like a pass over the overcall.   denies 3 spades....and when parter reopens...I can raise @S showing Hx....|pg||
nt|engsetter:  this cannot be right its like saying we can wrap up 9 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: If playing support x's, 3@s should show hx, but I don't know if it extends to 10x.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: East has a huge hand for hearts, given he bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch required|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee, I would be getting nervous now if I was E:)|pg||
nt|farrukh: yes it should show tolerance in MAJORs else he could easily have bid 2@d over 2@c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|engsetter:  no interest to the play|pg||
nt|othered1: East sold out?  Taking 4@H as some kind of lead director?|pg||
nt|psyck: E did his job with the 3@s raise|pg||
nt|farrukh: @h @h @h should beat it or @d @d @d |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when both opps are bidding and partner is silent at these colors, the percentages greatly favor the advantages of the preempt over the measly 2C overcall. a decisive point is that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont have an entry to your clubs so the idea of attracting a lead to beat their 3N doesnt hold as much water as it would with an entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is makeable no doubt, but no certainty|pg||
pc|hA|nt|farrukh: 4@h had chance to make but 5@d has no chance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: maybe he thinks his partner's delayed 4@H bid shows a weak hand and he is worried opps have a lot of spades on|pg||
nt|engsetter:  unlucky|pg||
nt|spenny80: I thionk they dosn't play support double (in italy its'n common this agreement)|pg||
nt|remo: *bel, srry|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: if 4N was RKC, i suppose 5@c was 03 key cards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|atlantajon:  careful not to block suit|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's basically on a spade finesse|pg||
nt|ady: possible to have gained stopping out of game|pg||
pc|h7|nt|engsetter:  well done|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably just shows a good hand, but didn't exactly solve the rebid problem.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: the main issue here is what it means to pass THEN bid 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it would be masterminding as partner asked you to  bid 3nt with a stop.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doesnt look easy to me on diamond lead with club back, as long as W puts up heart queen on first round of sui, which should be fairly automatic at this level|pg||
nt|bobholl: oops|pg||
nt|psyck: some would bid 6@h to show odd key cards with a void (5N=even with void)|pg||
nt|psyck: but E wasnt interested in showing void in pd's suit i suppose|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: With a @D fit, why didn't west raise at once?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Jon NS had 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but if @H lead?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not a triumph for the method- lucky escape- ill judged lead|pg||
nt|rv: 2 wrongs do make a right on scoresheet for N-S:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: some might play that 3@H over 3@D shows a diamond fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not on a @H lead |pg||
nt|ady: on the mis fit  hand 19 where 4@H went down 1   Clair gained 10 imps making 3NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with the ATxxxx @H and AKJxx @C Versace?|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|engsetter:  I am a little confused why they didnt want the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm ga ge all|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, both have reached the normal slam|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c cue must have made E happy as pd would not have much @h wastage after that, & after another cue, Dano had enough shape & trumps to take control|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: or a defensive blunder|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  either one....   "nor" is a contraction that is acceptable|pg||
nt|engsetter:  ha ha someone has not been paying attention|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  sorry that ways private|pg||
pc|s5|nt|engsetter:  the operator|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt W played the @H8 |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  "nor 3nt"  someone asked if correct....  rather than "neither 3nt"|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: this is the english room:) welcome Jaap|pg||

nt|jaapfr: hoi Marshall glad whilst me no Italian:)w|pg||
nt|serhat: no on a good lead and good defense 4S can be set|pg||
nt|spenny80: if he found Kxxxx he can make game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart queen and another diamond|pg||
pc|c8|nt|baldfriede: now it makes 5|pg||

nt|dkkello:  the scores so fare: I can't say much has happened since  (Leonard Cohen , Closing Time )|pg||
nt|serhat: so 500 good result|pg||
nt|serhat: but I wont be surprised if 4s makes other room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S doomed here even DD|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt NS? quite a go|pg||
nt|serhat: last hand Jaap|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but 4H is not, i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: understood Serhat|pg||
nt|ady: however on clair lost 8 imps  failing in 3NT by 2  on the good lead of a spade  where 2NT was made plus 1 here|pg||
nt|ady: yes Jaap|pg||
nt|othered1: north's hand is a variant of the "Bridge World Nightmare Hand," and needs special methods to handle it  . . . |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, I would touch 4@h with as much reluctance as a bra with spikes on the inside.|pg||
nt|rv: I presume South could have bid 2n to break relay (if they were playing further relays) and North could have shown his shape  (atleast 6@s)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 2C was natural and I am being unfair about lead - it wasnt alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some players use system on after a double that would have helped north on last board|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-14|nt|jaapfr: hoi all ge ga gm|pg||
nt|athene: transfer pre-empts! |pg||
nt|athene: i think these might be under-rated|pg||
nt|othered1: And if I have to give them extra auctions by opening with an artificial bid, even more reason not to open|pg||
nt|athene: sure, it gives opps two chances to bid|pg||
nt|athene: but often that just gives them more room to get tangled up :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H best chances|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @s @h @d @c Running Score|pg||
nt|ady: something back for Vinci   but a long way to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|giuliocs: @s @h @d @c http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
mb|2D|an|tr !h|nt|othered1: expecially a way to get a @H suit into the auction without much risk|pg||
nt|athene: and right-siding the final contract might well counterbalance any tactical disadvantage|pg||
nt|ady: the 1100 only cost 4 imps    5@D X +1 in OR    950|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg operation is a *very* tough job.  For some reason many players don't realize that their top priority should be to insure the vg oper can clearly see all their bids and plays.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now X|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is that penalty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Italians have always been known for off-shape doubles, but this one pushes the envelope|pg||
nt|jaapfr: seems not so simple for N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if 3@H is a spade preempt it does not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was joking|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 6@d here with A@h right-sided. 6@c won't work due to the @c split|pg||
nt|psyck: nice slam from Wests hand, do not need to rightside as cards are|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but completely different bidding i just saw|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on n/s     will the reach it|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 6@d is a good contract here...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  yes...I agree....and we all should be VERY grateful to them for thier time and effort!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x106s6_leonard-cohen-closing-time_music|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes spade preempt so double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C then 4@H would be ideal?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now is this supposed to be pen or responsive?|pg||
nt|farrukh: that is possibly going to be a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i will bet Versace is not sure how N means it|pg||
nt|psyck: i'm guessing 2@d=balanced 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ok we have to decide who does the sarcasm and who plays it straight|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as S I do not care with that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fair enough martin:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: intreresting to hear whether the voices above agreed with the pass on 1@S By N or the 2@D:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b19|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ah other table also got @C into play so 4@H failed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: again cards friendly for 4 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: West with 2 Aces and 4 trumps took conservative action by passing 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south sitting with all the hcp hearing everyone else get aggressive|pg||
nt|engsetter:  presumably the double is good pre emot?|pg||
nt|ady: I would think the pair that made +950 will be disappointed to lose|pg||
nt|mcphee: right David|pg||
nt|spenny80: not easy to found it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but East would probably pass a raise to 3H|pg||
nt|ady: balanced from North|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: meanwhile a vey ""brave"" 5@H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Where did noeth find that action?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ideal bidding for me X 4@C 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Another hand where you really need methods.  A forcing 2N here may be among them|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @s @h @d @c  Vinci 62 - Uggeri 17 @s @h @d @c|pg||
nt|farrukh: not every hand is gonna open that 4-3-3-3 hand with 11 count, and once u dont open it, opps are going to play 3NT with a most likely @s lead giving declarer the 9th trick|pg||
nt|rv: as Vic remarked, even @s ruff can't beat 4@h here|pg||
nt|rv: best lead for defense|pg||
nt|ady: another good result for Vinci|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the momentum has definitely swung|pg||
nt|ady: even better that 2 hearts will make|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|mcphee: not so sure about bidding 2@H , really ratty suit plus I have 3@D|pg||

nt|runnerup: 6 @d -doent need @h ace rigth /west (-6nt makes also -because south must keep 4 @c and @h ace -and in the end you must play him @h ace|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@h could be svalues|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D = please pick a major I am serious|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  can be misunderstood though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I would just bid 3@H I told pd I have no pref he should know by now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: finest lead but all leads ok|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any idea who N is?|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|engsetter:  it would be good if 4 spades making|pg||

nt|dkkello:  7 loosers or something like that , to many for a 3 @H bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 14 houses:)?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 clubs and a heart likely  to lose|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: I agree    |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and souths @d bids...is just showing a preference....|pg||
nt|bobholl: should have played 9 for @S|pg||
nt|spenny80: here better 4@h from north to show A (with 4@d look like K now)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: The Open room started a little after this room, so that they could get comparisions, but with the Ferrari (G Ferraro) playing in that room, they may soon overtake us|pg||
pc|h3|nt|engsetter:  but there seem to be 4 losers in that|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he is likely to have a 0-2 count.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: hard for the defence to come to 4 tricks against spades, even if it might look as though they have @C@C@H@D|pg||
nt|othered1: the 2N bid implies they have detailed agreements about follow-ups.  but somehow they missed the good slam.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now south ruffs 3rd diamond|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@S down after @C @SA x@S|pg||
nt|ady: at last hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: not that arcane and north used to be a clear 1@S opening, unless you have gadget bids to sort out major 2-suiters|pg||
nt|ady: nice first trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: some players use a redble to show an honor card in @S|pg||
nt|mcphee: that helps defensively at times if redble were to show the A or K for example|pg||
nt|ady: helps for lead if defending no-teump contract|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Bob!|pg||
nt|ady: in the old days   a pass out here|pg||
nt|othered1: Plus on those cards NS isn't a terrible result, despit its magnitude.|pg||
nt|jfaria:  ten tricks as guessed by RV|pg||
mb|1D|an|Bal 12-15 or 5+!d 11-15|mb|p|nt|ady: 10 tricks    then the play was different|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best solution by our operator:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: anything happened on hand 8?|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  I predict 1NT by East|pg||
nt|mcphee: did not quite see why S did not advance with @S over the 2@H bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: now however a new era?|pg||
nt|spenny80: in open room n-s are playin 1nt|pg||
nt|rv: South might bid 3@s as splinter to show 54 minors |pg||
nt|psyck: they could well find the par fav vul sac here too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: wow this vul o/c would never cross my mind|pg||
nt|fabsayc: www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/NightmareSystem.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mcphee: that is playing with fire|pg||
nt|engsetter:  double here only show some extra values|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we have to remind that operating is a very tough job (I would not sleep if I ever had to do that:)|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht  pass best by west rather than showing any preference in the minors   after the dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: sorry I was wrong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c here show naturale or any 15-16 hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: like gazzilli|pg||
nt|othered1: Did 1@S show @S?|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes 1@s natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  they must not be playing support X's|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and another of the same- 3s showing singleton is becoming popular|pg||
nt|rv: on 1n-3M is played as either fragment or splinter and show 54 either way in minors GF|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: i read it once, could not sleep for weeks|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the point of using splintr instead of fragment deals with declarer staying in NT hand if playing in the  4-3 fit other major|pg||
nt|rv: playing 4 suit transfers, 1n-3m can be played as minors NF/Inv/GF or as both minors better @cs/better @ds resp GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: And, as expected, 4@S on Board 5 picked up double-figure imps for N|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @H 1 down ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  no|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  in deep now....if that is right|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe they play Rubensohl or Rumpelsohl with 3@h transfer here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: np:) you are doing great Daniela:)|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@h is negative with canapé|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt a force for shape clarification|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not, 3nt seems strange|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: ... for NS, even though their teammates overstepped to 6@HX, down.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really?|pg||
nt|spenny80: (and short @h)|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to have comprehensive methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer easily has seven tricks now|pg||
nt|engsetter:  2 spades from minimum opener seems very odd to me can anyone explain??|pg||
nt|dkkello:  You have to look at North hand 3-3-4-3 an no extra , bid slowly then or ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I approve of the pass even if 1nt doesn't imply extra values.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  that was a very minimal overcall|pg||
nt|rv: you might play different treatment for 3 level bids if you play 2@s as minor suit stayman though|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: two spades, four diamonds, club|pg||
nt|engsetter:  lay bets how many tricks here I predict 8|pg||
nt|athene: and probably should be able to endplay north to concede the @HK|pg||
nt|santyclz: But 2@s?  I found another ace?|pg||
nt|psyck: South could have bid that the 1st time around w/o passing too|pg||
nt|spenny80: down if they found ruff in spade|pg||
nt|othered1: still there to set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: might get @CQ shift now, and that can just be ducked|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  if you are not playing support doubles...then I have to agree|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I like pass rather than 1nt|pg||
nt|dkkello:  likes 9-10 loosers  or in plain words , a shitty hand |pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Right, I meant if the choices were pass or 1nt.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe N pulled out a wrong card|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good luck p  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: otherwise hid bidding makes no sense at all|pg||
nt|engsetter:  is this 2 down ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Typ  , where is the real hand ?|pg||
nt|farrukh: cant see him getting more then 7 tricks even if he guesees @h right|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 3@d sorry|pg||
mb|4N|nt|engsetter:  ducked twice|pg||
nt|othered1: Can I assume 3@D denies 5@S?|pg||
nt|spenny80: at 99%|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  I think souths double is completely normal|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can you ask in Italian who knows some background of EW?  when you have time to do so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3 quick tricks is good hand in context, so north keeps going|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dkkello:  but of course more easy when we can see all hands ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: @S@S@S REAL SCORE:      Uggeri 91 - Iommi 32      @S@S@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this may be turbo, 2 or 4 key cards, not blackwood|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: @S6 is a big card too|pg||
mb|5S|nt|queequeg: @S@S@S ITALY CUP - Running Scores: |pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: @S@S@S   http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html |pg||
nt|rv: this will complicate play, don't think he could take safety play in @cs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 3@C  looks a make    so e/w have done ok   |pg||
nt|santyclz: Agreed.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now downalot|pg||
nt|farrukh: now better cash 6 tricks and end of story|pg||
nt|farrukh: but he is still gonna get 7th trick if he plays @h to the J|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so more cue bids confirming enough controls|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|atlantajon:  I have a joke with one of my partners....dummy comes down... "thank you partner....nice hand...but not the one you bid"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: note this is not a great slam and vinci has found the best lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|dkkello:  thugh North didnt took a good look at his own hand |pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: now north can be thrown in with a heart to concede a third spade trick, i think|pg||
nt|jfaria:  luckily a @h came back :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|psyck: Rubensohl & Rumpelsohl are improvements over Lebensohl see article by a BBO Yellow: http://gerbenbridge.blogspot.com/2005/12/your-sohl-or-mine.html|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: alternatively you could play that 2S is a transfer to clubs - allowing opener to indicate support or not- then continue with 3S to show minors and splinter - |pg||
nt|ady: hi    sorry    still got connection problems|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|ady: even with the heart ruff   looks as though 3@D makes|pg||
nt|rv: soft defense, @d shift would have been interesting|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: @CA forces heart pitch|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: that may well be so|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: then @S8 10 J and heart exit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|santyclz: No vul, undoubled.  Probably only -100 or 150 at worst.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|atlantajon:  good defense...if he can return D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcphee: so much for over tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: hmmmm ok declarer didn't read the cards, but no great harm done|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|atlantajon:  then last C|pg||

nt|ady: suspect that wil be around 5 imps for IOMMI|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  most newer players spend so much time on "systems" and slam bidding....and forget that this game is more about good defense than anything else|pg||
nt|engsetter:  will 4 spades make here?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not easy to play on Rama ..  I must confess I dont the players |pg||
nt|atlantajon:  doesnt look like it on a @S lead|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  although it is the likely contract....1@S...4@c...4@s|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will not be bid , but if.. S will lead the @C 10 , then maybe|pg||
nt|jfaria:  NS took their chance in board 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  lets see ;)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  lol|pg||
nt|psyck: another great result for Zaleski's team, lot of catching up to do for Vinci|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: it is not unreasonable to think partner is allowed to compete, bidding a @D wins them 5 this time, next 5 times will be losing posions|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like there are enough entries to bring in the @d's to make 5@h|pg||
nt|psyck: if defense does not go up with @sA, @d's would have to be set up, as it went in other room, @s's could be set up too|pg||
nt|ady: same lead in Or    wone   played spade to the ace   took a heart finesse  to the spade finesse  and mad 12 tricks|pg||

nt|ady: no good action  by south   2@D   vul  dangerous|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slam again makeable but not so good|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, he really wants 17+ HCP strictly for his 1@C|pg||
nt|engsetter:  all according to plan so far|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 spades, 3 diamonds @CA and  club ruff -- on a @S lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  No @S lead :)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and the X....confirms the @S lead|pg||
nt|ady: north might enter wiith 6 card suit|pg||
mb|2H|an|tr !s|nt|engsetter:  I dont think anyone makes game here do they?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  dont be to sure about that|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  protecting his partners @C's|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i expect they will bid this one|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: didn't miss much|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can south double this|pg||
mb|2S|nt|santyclz: I must be missing something.  With @ds 3-3 with the K onside, it doesn't look too tough.|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|psyck: 2N cold be one of the 'sohl variants|pg||
nt|psyck: nope, looks like just a @c transfer|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  @C 10|pg||
nt|ady: still north wondering|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2NT limit raise with 3 cards|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N 3-card invitational raise?|pg||
nt|othered1: would be even more attractive with west's majors reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: not sure why N did not simply raise @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: the state of the score however does mean they need to get started|pg||

nt|engsetter:  still makes doesnt it?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  if he doesnt try to ruff any @c|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  getting to hand to continue to ruff is the issue|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even though I'm blind (the @dk is offside) you still have time.|pg||
nt|engsetter:  no point after the doubek he cant set the ckubs up it has to diamonds|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he has to find 3-3 @D|pg||
nt|engsetter:  sorry for the typing|pg||
nt|dkkello:  so far 23-1 for E-W   |pg||
nt|engsetter:  yes but if KD onside ( we know it isnt)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  doesnt matter where K is|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  he can lose 2H and 1D|pg||

nt|fabsayc: or perhaps 2nt at the end, but terrifying|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: spade lead would be costly|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like this is the way they begin 3-card limit raises|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps a direct raise would show a weaker hand|pg||
nt|athene: west might do that after the raise i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H lead also quite helping declarer:)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  as long as he starts D right away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like another part score swing|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: west does not really want diamond ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
nt|athene: so he might well just go for the spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky|pg||
nt|xenya: win in dummy and a diamond to the Q -- offers lots of chances   |pg||
nt|ady: down at least 1 in 3@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is definitely safer|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: it's amazing how often people lead from this sort of holding after their partner raised, and how often it costs a game swing|pg||
nt|othered1: does show the merit of using something other than the simple raise to promise a high honor in support, |pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S@S REAL SCORE:      Uggeri 91 - Iommi 32      @S@S@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: seems that more and more are discounting 2NT - I am not in favour of 18 as a minimum|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: sorry of course the 3@D was a gain for Uggeri|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  pulling trump as he sets @D|pg||
nt|queequeg: Clair and De Micheli are from Padova|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 2 spades can go down 1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as in 2@S ic no 8 tricks|pg||
nt|queequeg: De Micheli is the sponsor of the team, Clair a very famous bridge teacher|pg||
nt|odysseus69: With a maximum North might have bid 4C over 3NT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: but perhaps at the cost of preemption|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was a push on 24|pg||
nt|mcphee: west might have made a t/o dble over the @D opening|pg||
nt|giuliocs: @S @H @D @C ITALY CUP - Running Score:|pg||
nt|psyck: did well to push to the same contract, so the gap will just be 2 good swings instead of 3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jaapfr: so only @C lead and direct @S switch quarantees down|pg||
nt|queequeg: one of the most important ones in italy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i think garozzo has a special bid here for east - he bids 1nt to say "i have a raise but no top honour"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think this lead will beat 4@H|pg||

nt|ady: and west will already have shown 13 hcp  after the successfull heart finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can ruff 2 @cs unless n leads a @h for a @s lead.  Which of course would set up the q.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcphee: and susrely would make t/o dble with 4@S in that case|pg||
pc|cK|nt|atlantajon:  ruff A@s|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and pulls trump and lead H up|pg||
nt|queequeg: they play at the same bridge club|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: the outside of trumps K more likely to take a trick than the Q, than trump Q10x is to lose a trick.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: must have discarded 2 diamonds|pg||

nt|queequeg: u welcome :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: diamond lead would have ensured a set too|pg||
pc|h6|nt|atlantajon:  J@s will be promoted now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: maybe west wanted to get a force going|pg||
nt|athene: hoping south had 5-1-(43)|pg||
nt|mcphee: the rosenkranz redble showing A K orQ|pg||
nt|engsetter:  any minor lead|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there was really any urgency to cash out spades just for the sake of cashing them out|pg||
nt|athene: with west having that hand he can see declarer can never just "draw trumps and run a minor throwing his spade losers"|pg||
nt|engsetter:  So we are all agreed that was a terrible lead?|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was unsucessful :)|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe with a likely, unexpected trump trick, west thought to giv ethe least away on opening lead and chose the suit partner raised.  Not terrible on the auction, befoe dummy was ...|pg||

mb|1D|an|Bal 12-15 or 5+!d 11-15|nt|jaapfr: the word terrible to be replaced by BBO language: mb not his best lead:)|pg||
nt|rv: good point by Vic, lazy bidding by North on last deal, should have bid 4@c to cater to South holding not enough for quant|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: a guy would easily reach 6@D here|pg||
nt|engsetter:  can North South play in clubs here?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  4H is not likely to be bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pas ?   dont like that west |pg||
nt|jfaria:  showing fit first round would allow S to make a moove|pg||
mb|2C|nt|atlantajon:  more likely a @h partial|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is oldprecision (3 suiter and opening values)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: think defense slipped in the 2@S but not sure|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2NT ask|pg||
nt|rv: part-score competition|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|engsetter:  many have rigid standards for weak 2 suit quality|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and they still wait for the perfect hand to open ..|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 9 trics in hearts if they get clubs right - only 8 in spades|pg||

nt|othered1: That's a friendly lead for declarer|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I can't see a way to avoid losing 4 tricks.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: if north showed the @HA and declarer decided he could not have the @DK too given his silence over 4@S, i suppose he might try ace and another diamond hoping south ducked :)|pg||

nt|ady: and south 3NT|pg||
nt|mcphee: bidding 3@D over 2@S there?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  this is dull hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  The Italian mathematician who lived 300 years ago?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  they played 1nt at other table....  but that is tricky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: marshall?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but minaldo did not keep winners so overtrick anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, was away for a bit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: fell asleep?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hcp 20-20 and only 7 trumps and he managed 10 tricks:)|pg||
nt|psyck: team Vinci is not doing too bad either, that slam on 18 & game on 23 were not easy to get to & the rest mostly push boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: not so clear |pg||
nt|ady: I think so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is so lonely here:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H is a conventional call that instructs the opponents to bid a game they might not otherwise bid and tells them how to make it|pg||
nt|spenny80: flat board the 11th|pg||
nt|othered1: sound preempt  by west|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, you take every chance to make even at cost of 1 or 2 more down unless doubled|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - not silly - I am silly|pg||
mb|2C|an|11-15 5+!c|nt|athene: north might respond 2@C to 1nt intending to pass any rebid? but south might or might not have a 1nt opener|pg||
nt|mcphee: Cost nothing to lead @H beofre playing @D finesse as an added chance as slight as it may be|pg||
nt|athene: depending on the flavour of blue club they are using|pg||

nt|marlowepi: very popular method in europe|pg||

mb|2H|nt|engsetter:  A British general conquered Sind his meassge to base was one word Peccavi  I have sinned (I have Sind)|pg||
nt|athene: operator needs to multiply the auction by i and re-enter it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: and north has an  ugly choice to make, but took what I think would be the majority's choice.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: substandard overcall|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: need strong drink Vic:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 5@d not easy (preemptive not vul could be weaker)|pg||
nt|spenny80: or shorter|pg||
nt|spenny80: north is thinking really?|pg||
nt|othered1: south was unpassed hand and north has real extras for play in @S, including no duplicated low @D honors.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Doing "mi-mi" already :)|pg||

nt|psyck: must have been some defensive slip other room|pg||

nt|mcphee: S is very very good for this bidding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if I X as E yes 100%|pg||
nt|psyck: in 4@s , you do not need those lovely @d's, & in 3N, you do not need those lovely @s's|pg||
nt|ady: high enough   but will east balance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hugony will have to win and switch to diamonds, not obvious|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: maybe had too many aready-here a grand makes|pg||
nt|psyck: aah ok, @c switch was not found after @d's cleared|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: sure kibs IF @C9 was played after @DK then surely W would have made 4@S so I assume @C9 was NOT played|pg||
nt|mcphee: how can this bidding be right?|pg||
nt|athene: well it is right if we rotate it by 90 degrees :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: i thot e/w were playing wk nt:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Do you think that's an editorial statement?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  not the best lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: both tables choose to bid 2N instead of 3@c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S does make and 3@D -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so wd EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -110 too -50|pg||
nt|othered1: To the point he likely can discount the expected bad trump split..  What he had to discount is that south would take what looks to be a very aggressive 4@S bid.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|engsetter:  I bet on 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: well passed    by north   collect 50   rather than lose 10 in 3@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so deserves 2 imps (so next board pls:)?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: not the usual Jacoby start|pg||
nt|jfaria:  delayed supp in @c must mean somethoing...|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect some relay sequence here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  i wonder what|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect 2@h showed 5@h+4@s any strength|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe West just showed 4-5-0-4 but maybe not|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s is further relay, not sure of sequences beyond that|pg||
nt|rv: many Italians play 1M-2@C-2@D variety of min hands w/o 4OM, 1M-2@C-2@h shows 5M+4OM any strength etc|pg||
nt|jfaria:  looks like E didnt show @h yet|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 110%?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: go team|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you double you win a colossal 2 IMPs against 4H, so it is a good save since E may not double. to prove that he might nt, he didnt:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: lose 100|pg||
nt|ady: very little in this set    Clair had a mountain to climb   and never really looked like  getting close|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and if @SK on and @HJ then some 10 specs were shouting why the nfools did not bid 4@S (poor bridge:(|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|engsetter:  7 then|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jfaria:  maybe he is thinking : " too strong to bid 4@h now"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  they can still recover though|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|atlantajon:  not now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jfaria:  but ther goes 7 |pg||
nt|jfaria:  not a perfect one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jfaria:  but one thatmakes :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to commentate unless we speak Italian |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes dear|pg||
nt|rv: yes we are guessing here, I also play 2@C relay after 1M, slightly different from here|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|engsetter:  is it possible they are despondent?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: better to voice commentating then you can not hear anything:)|pg||

nt|athene: duck this is sensible|pg||

pc|d9|pc|s5|pc|d2|nt|engsetter:  I think he should have taken 2 trumps only|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: comical on hand 25   where 3@D was made e/w after dubious 1@D overcall    in OR 3 passes   1@D by west   and after some competitive bidding ended in 4@HX   800|pg||
nt|psyck: @c could surely be found, where else can you get enough tricks when dec does not have @h & is working on @d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: eventuall  5 losers  1 in each major and 3 clubs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|atlantajon:  not very good entry management.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: are  we all looking at the same board??|pg||

pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: W showed no defence, and at these colours i cant be confident 4H was going to make, can i ?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mcphee: perhaps allowing for 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  likely to make....east needs to start 10S to give the most trouble|pg||
pc|s2|nt|atlantajon:  here we go again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I would have bid 3@H next as east I guess|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: Some days it's just not your day.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: but 5 loser hands with a good suit aren't common 1N openings|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|othered1: their 2@C openings have shown very badly  here, or at least their judgment in using them.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|atlantajon:  east can lead his shoe...now|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  my choice is 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: for any Indian kibitzers, a Bhosale lead would have worked here|pg||
nt|queequeg: next match shown : Clair - Breno|pg||
nt|psyck: (Bhosale is leading your doubleton, & Rev Bhosale is leading pd's doubleton) :)|pg||
nt|queequeg: at 17.30 local time (11.30 EST)|pg||
nt|ady: clair not going to be insulted with 17 HCP|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@DX+1 better than 6@D for EW|pg||
nt|rv: will cash @HA after this bidding|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  2nd choice J@c|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: y i like 2nt after 2@S by S with such a heavy 2@C    agree?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls claim 11|pg||
nt|rv: famous last words:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: 4@C was the jackpot bid|pg||
nt|ady: yes  but could have settled for 5@D  undoubled if passing  was last|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: any thing happened on hand 15|pg||
nt|fabsayc: next segment is tomorrow, one more board after this|pg||

pc|h7|nt|othered1: see also board 8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: light|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well its  hard hand to bid with their system the intervention gave them some chance|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: this time the 4 card overcall  not going to work so well|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: @cJ first choice for me.  Don't want to pickle my pds qxx or jxxx of @hs.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|psyck: ouch|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: non vull  so not much lost|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator and the Italian bridge federation for allowing us to broadcast this event|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: the 2@C opening has a wide range and you have to discuss how to distinguish hands with competition.  Here 2@S didn' take away all that much space|pg||
nt|psyck: last deal of this match coming up, but looking at the score, the match is already about over|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|santyclz: Which I invariably seem to do.|pg||
nt|psyck: 50+imps is too much to make up in the 17 deals reamining|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, will be difficult to close the gap with only 16 more boards to come.|pg||
mc|12|nt|fabsayc: and to David Erwin for various cameo appearances|pg||

nt|ady: this looks a penalty double    unusual for opening no-trump to remove|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :(:(|pg||
nt|othered1: lead is good in that it gives nothing up, but it's going to be tough to beat this even though declarer is very likely to lose a @D trick.|pg||
