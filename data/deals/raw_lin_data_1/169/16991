nt|dburn: still, give North a lot of credit - he must have known what South would have for this sequence, and he backed his judgement|pg||
nt|arobson:  That was an awesome 4NT bid by North, Maddocks|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|dburn: and it would have been very cruel to go down after all of that|pg||

nt|dburn: but this one was a decent contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 7 card fit is still allowed under ur well known law David|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, if South views this as a strong no trump....|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  at the other table, north showed 4=@s, over the double south showed 11-14 with 3@s|pg||

nt|copeyj: I hope so|pg||
nt|dburn: he might indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: will be hard for North not to insist on a vul hame here|pg||

nt|arobson:  @C10 lead?...|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|copeyj: yes pls|pg||
nt|dburn: close decision|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2NT is too pessimistic for me if 14-16|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - would bid game|pg||
nt|arobson:  Wow, I'd certainly chance 3NT with North, rather than landing on a pinhead |pg||
nt|pitiful:  vul games are ok to bid unless copey at helm|pg||
pc|cT|nt|copeyj: I don't know what a vulnerable game bonus is worth Peter, not scored one since 1992|pg||
mc|8|nt|arobson:  4-1 diamonds, 2NT the limit|pg||

nt|paulg:  welcome back everyone .. i guess we've missed 17 as the connection settled down|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|dagold: 3@h might steal it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
nt|delberto:  2H failing by one.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
nt|delberto:  1H here showing spades|pg||
mb|d!|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
nt|arobson:  The vulnerability will probably see NS try 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
nt|dburn: this might not play all that well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
nt|dagold: even a heart lead won't beat this as the spade is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes connection problems here keeps crashing|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  South doubles to show that he had a very good 2NT bid, North has nowhere to go|pg||
nt|ady: Caroll decided on a penalty  rather than try 3NT  |pg||
nt|ady: this will cost plenty|pg||
nt|dburn: very sensible, even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: w does not expect pard to make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Evening|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: This room will have severe connection problems|pg||
nt|arobson:  Although 2@H dbeled no fun for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ns time?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare may have difficulty developing his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mcarroll: declarer|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|delberto:  I think that double showed hearts and 1S indicated a weak NT with 3 spades|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: no matter, E saved them|pg||
nt|dburn: if the defenders can force declarer to play clubs himself, this looks down about five|pg||
nt|delberto:  so Neil has opted for the 4-3 fit, compensated by soem extra values and a bit of shape|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts we assume|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mmm interesting|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S always need to have a semi inside.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hi all|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime has an absolute HIROSHIMA!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|steshome:  Potential loss for England on board 17|pg||
nt|steshome:  Sad to say|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S on    difficult to reach|pg||
nt|ady: will do well to get out for 800|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it isn't easy to defend perfectly in this kind of situation|pg||
nt|ady: do not want to over do shortening declarer |pg||
nt|arobson:  N will lead @H7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: therer isa lot of thism about these days|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not start with a high heart?|pg||
nt|arobson:  My guess is five tricks after twice as many minutes...|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer needs to decide where to take tr 1|pg||
nt|delberto:  Declarer would probably like to get the diamonds established|pg||
pc|d9|nt|the saint: Can be difficult to get across hands with thatmany HCP|pg||
nt|galadriel: good shot|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: seems u were dealt that to lead but as it happens 2 off whatever|pg||
nt|paulg:  Most of the cards are marked for Matheson, so he will be planning how to endplay South to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|the saint: That is one way. Was 2NT in that sequence 25+ or a specific range?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But now may duck second Heart to set up the King|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If he plays Diamonds he has enough of a count to place S with a doubleton Heart|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|steshome:  Ah A downside of Kokish|pg||
nt|dburn: now, for example, South may have to play a trump or blow a trick, and that's difficult|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||
nt|jcomyn: honestrly i dont see the point|pg||
nt|lestergold: often tho achieves right siding contracts|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi mike and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ruud|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i know about right siding but why not protect the Ck and those queens|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pdjourdain:  Denning has four spades to cash so Micheal looking ahead|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  If scores remain as now Eng & Rep lead on 117 with Wales on 116|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcarroll: light opening  helps EW keep Wales out of a making 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|lestergold: well i wasnt referring to this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards for all pairs are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|steshome:  South is Norman Selway btw|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe a bit quicker but the same number of tricks I guess|pg||
nt|arobson:  I think it will boild down to a 2-card ending with Nortth on play holding @DA8 having to give declarer @DK. Let's see.|pg||
nt|arobson:  A lot of imponderable for young Mancunian Mike Bell; my guess is a trump.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: trump continuation?|pg||
nt|arobson:  He may be worried that his partner will be endplayed and may switch to a club, but I think trump better|pg||
nt|arobson:  N-S have done well to double EW given the vulnerability and that neither N-S have four trumps|pg||
nt|delberto:  having sustained a ruff, at least that has shortened East's trumps|pg||
nt|peachy: in light of E showing heart suit, surprised that no HQ lead from W|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|paulg:  and East is John Matheson|pg||
nt|ady: good slam|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|arobson:  Okay, worried about the endplay. But I think N-S will struggle to get more than eight tricks now.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: but othe odds are that the opening bidder is the stronger hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|the saint: With all the bangers and a solid 9 card fit, the hand was pulling extra. Some risk of missing grand, but could that be bid with confidence if it were there?|pg||
nt|arobson:  S best tumping this and leading a trump through|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|arobson:  Well done South|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|mc|9|nt|jcomyn: and scarcely mattered on this hand|pg||

nt|lestergold: arithmetic there|pg||
nt|lestergold: id say it was a rueful rabbit underbid and got lucky this time|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|arobson:  East can make 3NT, otheriwse no EW game|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no - for the Rabbit, 2NT is forcing since the Hog always bids game|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i prefer 1@s to the 4@s bid at the other table in theory but Martin maybe trying to mix it up|pg||
mb|2N|an|nat|mb|3S|nt|arobson:  east is skimpy but his high cards are right where they need to be|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: good decision by East - not obvious to bid at all there|pg||

mb|p|nt|yke:  I think they are the favorites in this final|pg||
nt|rodal f: So system for EW is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as Donder and u Yke?|pg||
nt|yke:  I;m not sure|pg||

nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, that looks reasonable alright|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  ofcourse you would, I think now 2@H means hearts an a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: vul and nice 11HP now.|pg||
nt|delberto:  West probably feels that he must do something..|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w should reach game   but if 3NT may well go down|pg||
nt|dagold: assume north opened 2@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yke:  ah ok, 2NT means hearts + clubs, they play multi defence|pg||
nt|steshome:  I love North's double|pg||
nt|ady: was as expected   800|pg||
nt|arobson:  Interesting non-transfer by the experienced Welsh East|pg||
nt|delberto:  not sure how penalty-oriented the double is b ut East can pass sensibly |pg||
nt|delberto:  If EW get a heart ruff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: That was hard.|pg||
nt|arobson:  Playing Weak Notrump Acol it would be South in 1NT (after opening it)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good decision on this particular lie of the cards|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT with 1@c always promising at least 3|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has a chance   but can go down to a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dagold: cleary this isn't right specs|pg||
nt|arobson:  Many would lead a higher heart with N|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|yke:  I'm informed by a specatator that 2NT means a strong two suiter with a minor|pg||

pc|d4|nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems a normal way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and good eve all|pg||
nt|ady: no game making if defence right with 26 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: dummy amuses everybody|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|steshome:  No game makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W has a lead problem|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aand now the polish club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 3NT by W would have been better|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
pc|cK|nt|2hplus4: Hi there|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Uttam welcome|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and ty|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s seems normal contract |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 3@H=invit for 4 in @D or @H since a M and a MIN?|pg||
nt|yke:  he could have overcalled 2@H which would be 5 hearts + 4+ minor|pg||
nt|arobson:  Better than in India this morning (the Ian)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Y. Capp|pg||
nt|yke:  so he was thinking if he could afford to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|steshome:  Seriously though chaps, don't you think that doubling on the North hand is winning bridge?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If he finds the @S switch the contract goes down|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, the Italians seem to think so|pg||
nt|mcarroll: otherwise the @Hs can be set up for @S discards|pg||
pc|c9|nt|galadriel: and who would argue with them :)|pg||
nt|ady: declarer will play on diamonds   and likely play low from west  to cater for sing. ace with north|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good morning all|pg||
nt|ady: should just lose 2 more tricks  1 heart and 1 spade|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Hi all|pg||
pc|c3|nt|steshome:  West eschewed leading clubs|pg||
nt|galadriel: @C opener steering Sime away from his 5 carder lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||
nt|the saint: Byrne (North) is forever telling the U20s to double on those hands. Playable in 3 suits. |pg||
nt|arobson:  Very good decision here by East to pass 1NT; 1NT will make whereas 2@S stood no chance|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I must admit i would failed that test|pg||
nt|pitiful:  have|pg||
pc|sA|nt|delberto:  well looks like -3  then|pg||

mb|1D|nt|dburn: well, another chance to bid game with not very much|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|dburn: 11 facing 11, but game has decent chances|pg||
nt|dburn: and so does 2@h doubled - from the point of view of the defence, at any rate|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what would everybody overcall|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@S for me|pg||
nt|copeyj: (1N if I am playing with you to try and secure declarership, Peter)|pg||
nt|arobson:  I am happy with 1NT, shows the strength, gets to a 4-4 fit 4@S etc|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i prefer 2@c, only 1@s if a one bid hand|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT OK, 1@s not very senisble, 2@c equally insensible, pass or double OK|pg||
nt|copeyj: have you got your freedom bus pass yet peter?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  double!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@c with that suit never|pg||

nt|dburn: theyre those green cards, Peter - I know you take them all out of the box before you start, but...|pg||
nt|arobson:  This may not be so bad|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but what, i don't miss them|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so easy for Erichsen to doubl;e because from hism point of view there is no  guarantee of 6 plus defensive tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: no, but you can't pass - maybe he thought this was a forcing auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: probably but what is Selway supposed to bid?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: double, if he can't think of anything else to do|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: SElway cannot envisage a game with no further action from E and vul why risk a penalty if there is a misfit  which will normally meanthat 2@h isnt making in any case|pg||
nt|dburn: if pass was forcing, "no further action from East" means nothing - East could have any number of points|pg||
nt|arobson:  I doubt any bid was forcing|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: well they have a lot of experience as a partnership so you would think they would knowm what their agreement was here|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|dburn: still, apparently South was being devious - the operator informs me that he bid as if he had some values|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|arobson:  I really can't see that second round duck. It is inconceivable East has asing,eton club on the bidding|pg||

nt|arobson:  West's non-diamond switch looks odd|pg||

nt|lestergold: Selway's hand must now be open book to Erichsen|pg||

nt|rodal f: Last was interesting. Never used it my self.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Possible gain there for England, if played by West hand|pg||
nt|galadriel: on a @C lead|pg||
nt|delberto:  3NT by East is ok|pg||
nt|delberto:  but no other game|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pitiful:  another 1NT contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: a lot play like that but they do it well|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: n;x can make 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell might bid 2@h here|pg||
nt|ady: n/s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: minus 2 becoming a habit|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Two trumps and a singleton - I suppose a reasonable rasie|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: is it all artificial then|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u bid suits that u havent got to show what u have got it does make it difficult for opps|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I'd open W hand with 2@S|pg||

nt|mcarroll: another strong club opening|pg||
mb|2D|nt|galadriel: Think we may be in for a bumpy ride|pg||
nt|delberto:  An aggressive 1S overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: because their bids often become ambiguous is double for takeouit or showing the suit thats been bid etc....|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Hello et Bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|steshome:  I am confident that England can bid this game |pg||
nt|paulg:  this would be a good time for Matheson to bid 2@d ...|pg||
nt|ady: there is a complication with 4@S     |pg||
mb|2N|nt|steshome:  Oh my - North is going to struggle to get his spades across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and put a Pass card on Sime's side of the bidding tray for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell is going to bid 2@H this time|pg||
nt|steshome:  And North will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: if north plays 4@S   and east leads J@D    west will have to duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|ady: has chosen the unbeatable  contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it does not seem to matter where the Camrose is held, there are often connection problems in the first session ... very frustrating for the vugraph operators|pg||
nt|steshome:  Nice vulnerable save from the Scots|pg||
nt|paulg:  good pressure bidding|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: I agree with problems|pg||
nt|steshome:  So easy to find|pg||
nt|paulg:  Byrne definitely thinking he has an RHO, LHO and CHO at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: if east leads a club or heart should north play 4@S   dont think it can be made|pg||
nt|the saint: There are no screens in the Camrose - am I right?|pg||
nt|steshome:  He might've done better to rebid 2@S at his second turn|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might hve to bid bid 6@s to end all confusion|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: screens in use|pg||
nt|ady: now 10|pg||
nt|mcarroll: indeed |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: sort of mixture of  Walsh, martens, carrot and ekrons|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But you have the vital intermediates in the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said i would open it for that reason|pg||
nt|pitiful:  east has the shape for 2@c but give weight to his @h honours|pg||
nt|arobson:  What happened on the previous deal, how did 1NT go down?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry was still basking in football|pg||
nt|pitiful:  wasn't watching|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and smiling now I presume|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes|pg||

nt|pitiful:  sure|pg||
pc|sT|nt|the saint: Ah OK, makes this hand easier for the players.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Twelve tricks with the clubs behaving. 1Nt showing 18-20|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1@S control showing|pg||
nt|delberto:  sensible contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  it's not a save is it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes it is :)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: it is now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it would not surprise me if Bell is still thinking|pg||
nt|steshome:  Not sure about the 4@h bid - seems a bit previous - horrible hand to play now|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be made if playing carefull as 9@S comes down   so can plat spades from the top and later discard a diamond on a heart   lose 2 spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@H sounded like he has longer hearts to me. 2@H seemed more descriptive. Partner was still in the game.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i still prefer my initial 2@h over 1@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  5@d looks cold on any lead, declarer just established the hearts|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye|pg||
nt|the saint: I would be surprised if they didn't have that agreement.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doesnt that 7 make it difficult fo s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not that it matters|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we stuck or something|pg||
nt|steshome:  Connection problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes sorry but connection crashing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have gone beyond 3NT which makes because the @H finesse an 3-3 brek produces 4 tricks|pg||
nt|delberto:  but North can take a top spade and switch to clubs|pg||
nt|delberto:  and has teo further entries|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|uttam: y i think ,now a days most would open 2s w/west hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: jT empty i wouldnt|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Board 3 can easily be corrected in MOVIE but must be done by the operator. I don't have a remote control (although I wish I had)|pg||
nt|arobson:  Overtricks here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Code is 1NW+1|pg||
nt|delberto:  ahhh...that has given declarer three club tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|ady: 4@S  interesting    might well be the contract OR    as they lay  will likely make as defence cannot profitably attack clubs    and west has a useful holding in hearts combined ...|pg||

nt|ppiglett: Interesting action by Towers. Holding a five card suit doesn't want to play against the room|pg||

nt|pitiful:  if north had overcalled 2@c it would have likely continued 3@d fit, 5@c to west|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: my point is why not explore the possibility of 6d and stop in 5|pg||
nt|arobson:  Yes, intersting. I think West would have looked @HAK and the defnsive spade @SA and doubled. Not easy though.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: 5 can go off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not safe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whov was it said clubs disappeared 10 years ago and diamonds are on the way out.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love unsafe contracts if there is a smell of a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think this combined 26 count with 8 card @d fit and the rest of thehand misfitting is one to explore for slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: however caution i.e. un derbidding would be rewarded today|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a viable opinion, but again it goes back to the main goal of preempting. if we are doing it mainly to get in the opponentss' way, then a wider range is BETTER than a narrow ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: range -- we will get to do it more often, and when they opops play the contract they will have a harder time reading the layout|pg||

nt|2hplus4: May go for 1  of 2 finesses. Or to discard @C on @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so worst scenario needing 2 out of 3 finesses i think this was a normal slam to bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|uttam: of course all north will bid the slam ,after they hear south open 1h|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u when east ruffs in on the third round of @ds there is still play left in the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can play on clubs|pg||

nt|lestergold: well maybe it can be made after all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With K@S falling he may make this|pg||
nt|uttam: depends on trick 1|pg||
nt|yke:  it's generally a good idea not to let your opponents play at the one level in a suit, unless you suspect they have a better fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT or X there. What give ure pard best freedom?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nt feels as a order and a X ure pard give the advice|pg||
nt|yke:  ith such a flat hand, i would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as Terence Reese always said, the more narrowly a preempter's hand is defined, the less effective a weapon it is  ("a dull swrod" was his phrase)|pg||
nt|chick: The idea of not let opps play at the 1 level depends a bit on the auction, I think.    1@D P P ?   is not the same situation as   1@D P 1@H P 1@S P P ?|pg||

nt|ady: this should not be too taxing for Neil|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, but perhaps South's 1NT at this suitable vulnerability in 3rd seat was partly to try to "preempt" EW out of any spade contract?|pg||
nt|petergill: EW make 3@S (I think), so minus some 50's in 3NT is no disaster|pg||

mb|4S|nt|2hplus4: Must go now. Thanks for your company|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i agree with the 6H call. S could be stronger for sure, and there is play even off 2 aces|pg||
nt|yke:  strange north didnt ask for aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  maybe because of the state in the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes that's what happened|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: last hand  e/w have 10 tricks in diamonds   could be useful part swing score for the Irish|pg||
nt|arobson:  Aggressive 2NT but he's on a roll|pg||
nt|delberto:  despite the 4-0 break..thiscontract is most secure|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boedhy: would you balance with south??|pg||
nt|jcomyn: noooooo|pg||
nt|steshome:  So, would you make a two suited overcall on the East hand? |pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, if i could|pg||
nt|paulg:  but it has worked out well for Matheson without one|pg||
nt|paulg:  they cannot show the black suits over 1@d|pg||
nt|steshome:  Only because his partner raised spades in a sequence that could have been 4-6|pg||
nt|the saint: Holding the spade suit you are always under less pressure. Because you can always come over the top|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might have doubled 2@s with 4-6|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h, sorry|pg||
nt|peachy: then, brb for me, coffee|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|uttam: 4s here|pg||
nt|yke:  will east git this right?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i disagree. he needs a swing, so the last thing he wants is to push the board, what is exactly what KC would achieve|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|chick: Looks like you were right, Marshall,  board 9, EW found 5@C|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H non forcing|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chilloncan: double dummy this was cold after D lead, but declarer's line is very understandable|pg||
nt|arobson:  Agee with 3NT (assum 15-17 range)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: regrettably I must go too lunch time....so bye all for now|pg||

nt|pitiful:  well need to get a @s lead of @c Ace and switch|pg||
nt|arobson:  This shd fail, but...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: fighting for partscores a terminal disease|pg||
nt|boedhy: really? I would 3@d is made I think...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: glad you can see around corners|pg||
nt|boedhy: Ai BCOB on a running streak on the last board they defended 2@h doubled that cannot be defeated...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Terry is doing a tremendous job in very trying circumstances. I do wonder how long before he just picks up the laptop and throws it across the room!|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not a good spot in theory|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south should discourage |pg||
nt|pitiful:  imo|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looking for @s switch|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or even in practice - unless takes inspired view in @Ds|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yke:  I think he will err, it's very logical to ash the king of diamond|pg||
nt|arobson:  Declarer can overtake hearts to make four tricks but still can't get home ven if they aset up his ling club. It boild down to whether the defnce will swiutch to spades (they will)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||

nt|arobson:  Jones (England) doubled at other table|pg||

nt|dburn: prefer double - three places to play, or four if partner passes, which I hope he won't|pg||
nt|dburn: but close|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As it is he can play in 3 places|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but east will surely save against 6 if they bid|pg||
nt|arobson:  But not 4@S Dbled|pg||
nt|dburn: still, you're not supposed to double with a void|pg||
nt|arobson:  And if you bid 4NT you can't|pg||
mb|6C|mb|6S|nt|arobson:  East will bid 6@S sure|pg||

nt|dburn: or so Zia tells me - but then, he always tells me I'm not supposed to do whatever I just did|pg||
nt|arobson:  Pass forcing|pg||

pc|h9|nt|pitiful:  wd|pg||
nt|dburn: there was a hand long ago and far away when Kirby-Armstrong pulled to 7NT with this spades stop|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But still way to go before they catch Wales|pg||
nt|dburn: no one cares about second - this is all about Wales, and congratulations to them|pg||

nt|yke:  well done, the discard was count so he knew to cash the ace of spades|pg||

nt|chick: I have no idea what the @S9 actually meant, but if it was count, it was the perfect signal, good analysis by W knowing what partner needed|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: back do dullsville|pg||
nt|boedhy: again 3NT with some tricky play|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If W play @H from right place odd grove for @S on.|pg||
nt|yke:  maybe declarer should have switched to his only legal chance.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry, was disconnected|pg||
nt|delberto:  and South to double it I think|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|peachy: N must take the bull by the horns, he has too much|pg||
mb|5C|nt|paulg:  Maethson giving respect to the vulnerable 2@c overcall, and presuming his partner is not that strong|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yes, when you have so many HCP, partner may not re-open|pg||
nt|paulg:  I was thinking that you could be missing slam .. more of a concern at a reversed vulnerability|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Interesting that East didn't show a two suiter - good/bad. |pg||
nt|delberto:  so now North will be wondering whether to look for a slam or not|pg||
mb|5S|nt|petergill: East likes to preempt at the suitable vul in 3rd seat, I guess!|pg||
nt|delberto:  and East will have his say !|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  nice bid, 4NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat or +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Liked it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this is last of the session     hard for all  especially Terry      thx all|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Pass?|pg||
nt|peachy: fascinating deal|pg||
nt|delberto:  I guess thAT North will double 5S|pg||
mb|6C|nt|boedhy: after @d lead if you play on @h its close|pg||
nt|petergill: I think it's 800 on perfect defence if 4@CX was passed, maybe 500. |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Spade lead would be a killer|pg||
nt|petergill: Even spade switch might be troubling, with shortage of entries to North hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: he must duck this...|pg||
nt|uttam: 2h .pass or correct|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i would pass in a flash with S hand. maybe N has already won a big swing with the 3N bid|pg||
nt|delberto:  wrong !|pg||
mb|p|nt|arobson:  Good start for the defnce|pg||
nt|arobson:  Nasty hand to play|pg||
nt|delberto:  now West migh tbid again|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzzd: espen asking questions|pg||
nt|steshome:  Could have taken it more slowly but there are a lot of queens in that hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  i mean, suppose partner held @sxx @hAKxxx @dKJ10xx @cx|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: 3 ace dble|pg||
nt|ady: with trumps 2-2   and  clubs well placed will make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: De Donder coenraets also play in dutch competitions|pg||
nt|ady: likely to make an overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: good shot by east   but I think he will run this|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: kinder asking |pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: about signals |pg||
nt|delberto:  either double..hoping to alert partner for a heart ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: ooooh|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|delberto:  with 6S so cheap...I'm not sure if I'd want to be defnding this hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: dont thin Rosen overcalls at the 2 level on A empty to 5 only|pg||
nt|peachy: the possibilities in this hand for both sides are endless almost|pg||
pc|hT|nt|boedhy: Steven (de donder) told me that he is pretty ambitious and in Holland there is much more good competition |pg||
nt|delberto:  so declarer needs to bring in the diamonds for no loser|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: no point in lookng atit has toplay J|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I find this pace tedious|pg||
nt|delberto:  there are 2 chances|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: unfortunately not|pg||
nt|paulg:  we play until board 32, it is not a JEC match :)|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   yes   16 hands|pg||
nt|delberto:  singleton J with west|pg||
nt|delberto:  singleton king with east|pg||
nt|delberto:  he will get it right|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: I was expecting W to transfer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  might lead @s towards 9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|peachy: void and side king might induce W to open 1S instead of 4|pg||
nt|delberto:  by counting out West's shape|pg||
pc|c5|nt|galadriel: It's the right vulnerability for a penalty - would anyone consider passing?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ppiglett: moment of truth|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|steshome:  I would pass|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: If neutral @d exit, best was to try to drop heart Qx or Qxx, then finesse in @S|pg||
nt|delberto:  I htink East might have bid 6s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: another clb better|pg||
nt|ady: club|pg||
pc|h4|nt|steshome:  And p would reopen with 2D|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|steshome:  And I would heave a gusty sigh|pg||
nt|galadriel: will partner always re-open with shortage?|pg||
nt|arobson:  Passive |pg||
pc|s8|pc|cQ|nt|arobson:  any non diamond|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still going down|pg||

pc|d2|nt|arobson:  WBU playing very well|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|vugraphzzd: It's driving me crazy. Need several bacardis at this stage|pg||
nt|petergill: Previous board: On spade exit, it's reasonable for North to assume @SK is offside, as otherwise spade to North's !Jx might backfire if North has Jx, xxx, Kxxxxx, xx or similar|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|the saint: Double isn't on my radar with that West hand|pg||
nt|delberto:  1D showing hearts|pg||
mb|d|nt|galadriel: I think so too - but it's possible opener has a weak NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d is a transfer response showing 4+@h|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT likely to make n/s   but not liikely to be bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm pretty sure the double is takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|delberto:  so I think North will bid 2H to show a minimum with four hearts|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|boedhy: probably went 1 off...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: passing with a good 6-bagger dosnt appeal to me at all|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   may be reached   and could make if west fails to lead diamonds early  so that east can ruff and return a spade|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@H shows 3 hearts in a balanced hand|pg||
nt|delberto:  and South will be interested|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|ppiglett: absolutely. But bluff and double bluff at play.|pg||
nt|petergill: When the Buffett Cup was in Wales, there were similar connection problems from the hotel in a different part of Wales. |pg||
nt|petergill: Exciting quick bidding to a decent contract, but 4-2 breaks in both minors make the play very hard. |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I mean 4-2 and 5-1|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Win the diamond Ace , play a spade to the A and finesse the eight if diamonds? might make!|pg||
nt|petergill: When @DQ drops, perhaps (double dummy? @D6 can be run (9th trick), and perhaps a 10th trick might emerge out of thin air? |pg||
nt|petergill: East would pitch a @h (not @D) on 3rd trump, as he can see the @d's in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: If clubs are led twice from dummy, East has to withhold @CA both times|pg||
nt|petergill: West has to, I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not easy, after this unrevealing bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: interesting hand 4@s losing 3 trump tricks makes 3n a struggle|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont know if my comments about the slam hand came through before i was disconnected, so i will repeat them now: S did not play to best advantage. attacking hearts first was ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plausible, but:  (1) he should lead small from dummy instead of the king, just in case he can slip past the Ax. But more importantly...........|pg||
nt|arobson:  Look at play at other table, declarer might have made 4@H|pg||
nt|delberto:  so 4C = splinter|pg||
nt|delberto:  I doubt that North will bevery interested|pg||
nt|delberto:  might feel he has enugh for 4D|pg||
nt|peachy: I think not|pg||
nt|delberto:  which would probably be "LAst Train"|pg||

nt|steshome:  I'm not sure opening is on my radar with that West hand|pg||
nt|ady: little chance now for 4@H from north side    diamond  or even spade lead good enough|pg||
nt|paulg:  England finally on the board in this set with a part-score swing on 27|pg||
mb|4H|nt|arobson:  Club finesse...|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: If that is the case and dec is playing something like a 6-0 fit. You might get game in 100s anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: poor double  opposite a pre-empt      seems not the auction though|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: could have bid 2s now has to bid 3|pg||
nt|peachy: you were right derek|pg||
nt|delberto:  ok so NOrht announced that he was not totally unsuitable|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: n/s  stopped in 3@H    but that looks like down 1 |pg||
nt|delberto:  and South left it up to NOrth to move again|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well with west's hand all tops elsewhere but single spade i would bid 41s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s|pg||
nt|boedhy: dont know what 3@d is but uses up a lot of space.|pg||
nt|boedhy: 3NT now in the right hand and with a @h lead...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime feeling pleased with himself no doubt .. although clear to balance there is risk but the opponents take the push|pg||
nt|the saint: Both black suits now frozen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: espen wouldn't have bid 3h if vul!!|pg||
nt|steshome:  But he is vul?  Oh you mean he didn't see the vulnerabililty on the board?|pg||
nt|paulg:  part of the decision on bidding 3@h is dependent on how freely you raise with three-card support|pg||
nt|ady: assume the double by Carrol was really pass|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: I thought the @S2 might be suit preference for a club, but now it makes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: when  pard is weak u want to paly in 41s when he is stong it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|chilloncan: (2) when he sees that trumps are 3-0, he should turn to clubs. giving W two chances to discard means E is extremely unlikely to get the defense wrong if he wins ace on second ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: round. better to hope for E to have 4 clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: no need use up any space had e opened 2d|pg||
nt|lestergold: all roads lead to 41s east cannot take his partner out|pg||

nt|ady: wonder what the final contract is    6@S wont make   6@D   can make|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  This was the first board of the event for Short/Walker, so they were also quick out of the blocks|pg||

nt|delberto:  is !NT natural ?|pg||
nt|delberto:  1NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: yes double heart finesse is the odds play and both wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mike you didnt say why e pssed first in hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h should be 4 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: much better than playing a@h and then guessibng on next round but today |pg||
nt|boedhy: and south will not lead a @h now... |pg||
nt|lestergold: because he had 4 hearts and was disciplined|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: 3@S bid in OR   by south  after north transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|arobson:  5@C made at the other table so 5 imps (ish)|pg||
nt|arobson:  Scotland are having a very good weekend...|pg||
nt|arobson:  I think winning the second weekend but perhaps with a tad too much to make up|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: Rosen opened 1@S  in OR  and after transfer at the 2 level South broke with 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: old fashioned idea not to preemopt in 1 major when you hold 4 in other in front of pard |pg||
nt|uttam: misguess dias and spades! |pg||
nt|chilloncan: was 2N forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: What was 3@h ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I had a discussion with avide Bird on this subject a few years ago and he doesnt agree at all about that mickey mouse 2nd suit|pg||
nt|yke:  I think it was forcing, it's modern bridge to play 2NT as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: David|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south might have risked a double of 4@h depending on what that means|pg||
nt|delberto:  well...4S has been reached anyway|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: This looks like more imps to Ireland|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said its an old fashioned view and a lor of controversy about it|pg||
nt|arobson:  What would you bid over 2@H Peter?|pg||
nt|delberto:  he does not want ot have run out of trumos in the dummy whilst having a losing heart|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: me, when i hold a 6-card suit headed by KQ i bid it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Agree with u Yke|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if 1S was natural then a NF 2N would seem an odd choice. or maybe they take the view that 8 tricks in NT vs. 9 in spades is not going to hurt you all that often when W has a ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one-bid hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: but it seems the likely explanation u were seeking|pg||
nt|uttam: well spade prob solved on lead, now play twice dias to dummy, ruff one h|pg||
nt|ady: had east not opened  possible the salm might fail  on the club and heart lay   west might overruff 3rd club|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|delberto:  meanwhile he doesn't want to sustain a ruff unnecessarily|pg||
nt|peachy: good duck to maintain control|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: i knew what u would say and i knew i would disagree|pg||
nt|boedhy: bidding looks ok. But maybe because of the double he will get the @h right??|pg||
nt|uttam: or guess the dias, lose a h club and dia= all roads lead to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yke:  you can also include strong hands with fit or semi GF clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chilloncan: you heard it here, folks: if we play 2N as NF, apparently we are prehistoric:):)|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think prehistoric,  2N shows 18-19, responder is allowed to make judgments|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that means NF|pg||
nt|rodal f: For better player at earth it have been standard since start 1990. I was late out.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yke:  a specator told me 2NT was 4 cards spade support|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|uttam: looks 11 now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: i would not say you were wrong but it is true that p[ard will never believe that you have 4 hearts on those hands where the winning result is to play in a 4/4 hearft fit|pg||
nt|uttam: w d ace coming down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ugly choice but probably 2NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: and if declarer  could get a full count and finesse the @D it makes|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: every bidding principle propostition has a counter argument|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: yeah like 4 to the j opposite 4 to the Q nuttin|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|dburn: not much, I guess, and chancy to double 4@h as North - but you gotta do it|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: heart instead of diam from N would prob worried declarer more|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chilloncan: i will start playing it as forcing then, so that i can become a better player|pg||
nt|arobson:  David Greenwood chose 3@C but I like Peter's 2NT. You can play "system on" ec|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yke:  finesse to the safe hand, carefull declarer play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yke:  a bit unlucky spades are 4-1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Opener 1@S - 2NT=4@S.     1@S can be 5HP so 2NT?    My last there.|pg||

pc|d8|nt|delberto:  and KH|pg||

nt|lestergold: sure john but there are hands wher the problem of quality doesnt matter because partner has the high heart cards|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|boedhy: @d 3... discard...not going for the double @h finesse|pg||

pc|d8|nt|lestergold: well here lay down 7 as cards lie but is six even a good contract it needs spades breaking and hearts not 4/2 with offside k etc|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: but north will|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh....|pg||
nt|dburn: crikey|pg||
nt|arobson:  Wow, drama|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 6@c now|pg||
nt|dburn: now if South bids six clubs, it won't be obvious for West to lead a spade|pg||
nt|arobson:  Hogg will surely bid 6@C and Norman wiull lead S!A...|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i am a great advocate on these auctions for laying dowhn the A|pg||
nt|arobson:  Me too.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  big lead decision now for the Camrose trophy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: odd-looking spade, that|pg||
nt|arobson:  Gosh, can that really be right?|pg||
nt|lestergold: chances of A@s lead conceding then contract are much less than chyances for finding its the only way to beat it|pg||
nt|arobson:  Agreed|pg||

nt|chick: another chance for big imps NS, but too late to do much good|pg||
nt|the saint: It was. So. The difference came from opener's rebid. 4C or 3N?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3NT is lazy when you miss slam, practical when you don't|pg||
nt|the saint: 3N looks a practical description to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: APOLOGIES, ONLY SCORES BEING ENTERED AS SIGNAL PROBLEMS IN PLAYING ROOM - WORKING HARD TO FIX THIS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: scores are live|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: this table has finished|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: 1510 restart|pg||
nt|pitiful:  though looks bad for us at the moment, wbu have been great|pg||
nt|delberto:  jack of spdes through and -3 was certain|pg||
nt|delberto:  well played|pg||
nt|delberto:  6C was bid in the open room|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|yke:  is this the last board?|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are now on the last board of the match. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Terry, in extremely difficult circumstance. Great Job! |pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators David Edwin, Anne Symons, Sarah Teshome and Alan Shillitoe for their wit and perceptive comments. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Sandra Claridge (Bridge Great Britain) together with Alan Jones and the Welsh Bridge Union for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We will be back tomorrow morning at 10:00 GMT, 11:00 Paris, 05:00 New York and 10:00 Berwick-upon-Tweed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: 7 mins left luxury|pg||
nt|arobson:  Thin game for N-S, missed by WBU at other table|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and as david good for the game for wales to win especially in wales|pg||
nt|pitiful:  said|pg||
nt|peachy: Last  hand here, it has been a pleasure spending time with you kibs and Derek|pg||
nt|delberto:  yes thank you :)|pg||
nt|delberto:  what will 2S doubled cost ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chilloncan: i think so but not sure|pg||
nt|arobson:  If South shows majors, Nortyh will bid game (huge cards)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: should do|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can make 4@H  |pg||
nt|delberto:  how are you? not seen you for a very long time :)|pg||
nt|delberto:  sory pvt|pg||
nt|delberto:  well that will be that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzd: lots of writing between Byrne and Hanlon|pg||
nt|delberto:  so WBU wioll gain here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  This will be a very heartening start to the weekend for the Scottish team, who were under par in January|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  in fact down  defence can take 1 club and 2 spades   and a 3rd spade promtes a trump ttrick|pg||
nt|pitiful:  might make 2@s opposite your balance Andrew|pg||
nt|delberto:  I think that ENgland will pick up on a copuple of the boards yet to be played in the opne room|pg||
nt|delberto:  but WBU should hold on to win the match...well played|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: perhaps they should have played bridge instead of golf|pg||
nt|ady: also as pointed out had north led a diamond last hand   south could win and switch to K@C   and ruff out the club discard     also a low club lead would do   but that inot going to ...|pg||
nt|ady: happen|pg||
nt|ady: could not understand the auction or play    4@SX   makes with an overtrick   and 5@D   should make   and 6  if not defended properly|pg||
nt|ady: what was the double of 5@D?|pg||
nt|arobson:  Okay small solace for England, they will end the set 33 imps down|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: This looks like a normal 4@h, but both finesses wrong and 2 Aces to lose|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, and a great big thank you to our excellent operator, Frederic Delforge :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S on double-dummy for EW|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bravo Frederic:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyn: Thanks all Last hand see you soon|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is likely that you have a fit in clubs, so I think 4@c is well judged|pg||
nt|steshome:  This really isn't going well for England fans|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: 14 was 1NT +1 by E|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|boedhy: so maybe some 5 imps for begijntje but still BOB a very handsome lead. Think they will win it...|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that might be all right if he doesn't lead a heart, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: tough decisions for the captains before the final set|pg||
nt|pitiful:  see yu all later|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  2@d is game forcing checkback|pg||
nt|dburn: ...he won't not lead a heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: That was seemingly the obvious lead, but again it will make life very esy for the declarer.|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer won't play quickly - he has to worry about his third club|pg||
nt|dburn: and about conceding a heart ruff if he doesn't draw trumps|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is a better contract. the clue is that E-W have almost all the quacks|pg||
nt|wendle: AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg:  the scottish way is always to show hearts before spades when responding to checkback|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime can't be thinking of going on - another network glitch?|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be thinking of supporting diamonds?|pg||
nt|the saint: MAybe he is|pg||
nt|galadriel: we are about to be booted......|pg||
nt|steshome:  What was the 3@d bid all about?|pg||
pc|sA|mc|12|nt|idc: Yes, and their auction did give them a chance to reach it|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Terry, in extremely difficult circumstances. Great Job! |pg||
nt|galadriel: Maybe he thinks E has shown a slam try with @D?|pg||
nt|ady: both sides opted for a part score|pg||
nt|peachy: Congrats to the winners as well as all teams, well done|pg||
nt|delberto:  So WBU look to have done their compatriots a big favour !|pg||
nt|delberto:  we shall see|pg||
nt|peachy: thx all, bye|pg||
nt|delberto:  thanks again :)|pg||
