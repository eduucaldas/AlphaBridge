pc|cT|pg||
nt|greerm: yes, forgot that, 1D did show @H and 1@H then shows exactly 3@H|pg||
nt|greerm: so 1@S not 4th suit in this sequence|pg||

nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||

nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||

pc|dT|nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||

pc|c6|nt|athene: it is supposed to be fairly safe to reverse on this sort of hand|pg||
