nt|brolucius: I was asked why the double did not show hearts and this was my explanation.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  i know it is tradional to double with say 5-7 and bid with 8+ but it often comes unstuck when pre-empted|pg||
mb|2S!|an|Limit with 3!Hs|mb|4S|nt|pitiful:  sorry i thought you said double has to be used|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Whatever range a double shows, you are liable to pre-emption over it.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  my point was it doesn't have to be|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: What system of responses do you prefer?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|pitiful:  absolutely so double should not be a range, more a description of your pattern imo|pg||
nt|pitiful:  anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is commonly played as a three-card raise of hearts. You can bid 2NT with a 4-card raise.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry for that rant|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this looks 1 down|pg||
nt|brolucius: Every commentator is allowed two rants per session, so you are still OK.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes and 5 imps out|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h would probably go down so maybe not so great|pg||
nt|brolucius: As you see, we now have comparisons. If you put your cursor over the Closed Room result (top left) you can see the other auction.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bell and Byrne judged well not to sacrifice in 4@S. |pg||
nt|pitiful:  ah yes, just been pointed out that 4@h was 2 down in other room|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry for being so dozy|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: I think most people would have bid 4@S on the West cards, at this table. It is the sort of bid that does create pressure on North.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome Conelia and Frank|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and our operator, Frederic|pg||
nt|mcarroll: operator, are you sure of the bidding? Tom does not usually open a 3 card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: hands don't match those in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: just noticed when dummy went down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah that explains lots :)|pg||

nt|dagold: Good afternoon All|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Cornelia u welcomed lady.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Evening all :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Micheal sitting East and Padraig West of the brothers|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: west had a serious problem too strong for 3@c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So it is Precision versus Blue Club at this table|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as we can see 41s a very sensible contract unfortunately not today|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9 tricks on top and now a real horror|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: 6-0 breaks not the way to spend sunday mornin|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: why did s not double - cant be takeout|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if 3nt not bid no way are bthey bidding 4nt kloen|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: had south passed with his pile of garbage bidding liekly woujld have been 2@d cue by west 2@s by east 3@c by west 3n by East|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story......|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: await developments before jumping in|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: 9 0f hearts coudl hardly cost|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Very odd, Micheal thought the double showed C+D as 1D meant nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: all leading to a "challenging" contract|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: well i do not want to encourage too many raises with 3 to the J and out|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story is that putting a spoke in often works|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes backfires also|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not wait and see what opps do and then clobber bem|pg||
nt|lestergold: because what opps would have done here was ti get to laydown 3N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine playing in game in the opps weak suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed laydown 4N|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: might prove costly declarer could do with 5 heart tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: playing low on heart lead would work if south held Ten or Jack without the 8 it is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: ie setting up finesse position on next round but that would involve a guess- and north has led a heart in spite of the bid on his left|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence of course may well find it difficult not to give declarer a 9th  trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|lestergold: not obvious but best for defence to take 1d and return it|pg||
nt|lestergold: very tricky hand communcations not great for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jim Patrick|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hello there|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult for defence too south is worried about entry for the A@c in due course not easy to see that the 7@d is that entry eventually|pg||

nt|pitiful:  anyway a good start for England|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  3@c looks normal to me|pg||

nt|dagold: Nice lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
nt|dagold: even a heart lead won't beat this as the spade is right|pg||
mc|9|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  South doubles to show that he had a very good 2NT bid, North has nowhere to go|pg||

nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||

mb|2C|nt|pitiful:  slightly|pg||

nt|brolucius: As always. |pg||
nt|dburn: looks like another triumph for support doubles|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|dburn: East had to bid something he couldn't make, due to this fine convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: East rebids 2@H to let partner know that he holds only four spades.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Amazing that so MANY players are foolish enough to play such an awful convention, David. Has the total reached 90% yet?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south didn't double 2@h as he was worried north might pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT is the Unusual Notrump, showing diamonds as well as the bid clubs.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  north wouldn't have been worried|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||

nt|galadriel: Possible gain there for England, if played by West hand|pg||
nt|galadriel: on a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: a lot play like that but they do it well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: n;x can make 4@S|pg||

nt|ady: n/s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: minus 2 becoming a habit|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: is it all artificial then|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u bid suits that u havent got to show what u have got it does make it difficult for opps|pg||

nt|rodal f: But how commond by other variants u know better Yke.|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Think we may be in for a bumpy ride|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: because their bids often become ambiguous is double for takeouit or showing the suit thats been bid etc....|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Hello et Bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|steshome:  I am confident that England can bid this game |pg||
nt|paulg:  this would be a good time for Matheson to bid 2@d ...|pg||
nt|ady: there is a complication with 4@S     |pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Oh my - North is going to struggle to get his spades across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and put a Pass card on Sime's side of the bidding tray for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell is going to bid 2@H this time|pg||
nt|steshome:  And North will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: if north plays 4@S   and east leads J@D    west will have to duck|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  it does not seem to matter where the Camrose is held, there are often connection problems in the first session ... very frustrating for the vugraph operators|pg||
nt|steshome:  Nice vulnerable save from the Scots|pg||
nt|paulg:  good pressure bidding|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: I agree with problems|pg||
nt|steshome:  So easy to find|pg||
nt|paulg:  Byrne definitely thinking he has an RHO, LHO and CHO at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: if east leads a club or heart should north play 4@S   dont think it can be made|pg||
nt|the saint: There are no screens in the Camrose - am I right?|pg||
nt|steshome:  He might've done better to rebid 2@S at his second turn|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might hve to bid bid 6@s to end all confusion|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: screens in use|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: sort of mixture of  Walsh, martens, carrot and ekrons|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But you have the vital intermediates in the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said i would open it for that reason|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|the saint: Ah OK, makes this hand easier for the players.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  it's not a save is it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes it is :)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: it is now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it would not surprise me if Bell is still thinking|pg||
nt|steshome:  Not sure about the 4@h bid - seems a bit previous - horrible hand to play now|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be made if playing carefull as 9@S comes down   so can plat spades from the top and later discard a diamond on a heart   lose 2 spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@H sounded like he has longer hearts to me. 2@H seemed more descriptive. Partner was still in the game.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i still prefer my initial 2@h over 1@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  5@d looks cold on any lead, declarer just established the hearts|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye|pg||
nt|the saint: I would be surprised if they didn't have that agreement.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: doesnt that 7 make it difficult fo s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not that it matters|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we stuck or something|pg||
nt|steshome:  Connection problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes sorry but connection crashing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have gone beyond 3NT which makes because the @H finesse an 3-3 brek produces 4 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|s2|nt|uttam: y i think ,now a days most would open 2s w/west hand|pg||

nt|pitiful:  1@h here was 11-13 with 2/3 @h|pg||

nt|yke:  probably 5@C now|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@C is give-up|pg||
nt|the saint: A plus position for England - who probably need it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: opposite a strong NT, this could easily be a slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and as for smaller swings, pass is also the best way to achiever that too. for example, on that hand the auction would normally go 1D-P-1N-P-P, and NOW  he can reopen for the ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: majors, without having to worry about going to the 3 level. then NS go plus in 2H or on defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 4h and a little bit of work|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand here 9 tops in 3n available but 4@h can be defeated by trump lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: except for the fact n has two natural leads|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: presumably 3C is forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not that often Cornelia. Give my for Yke.|pg||
nt|yke:  probaby lebensohl, so 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C now is more than minimum|pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, make E's @DK into the @HK and 6@C makes|pg||
nt|chilloncan: from W perspective, they could have a grand, without E even having a maximum|pg||
nt|chilloncan: AJT   AK   Txxxx   Axx|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: just catching up, be back live with board 26|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: modern technology is great, when it works|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Marshall the first to comment it. We others ......... talk abough other things.|pg||
nt|dagold: can they find 5@c. even 6 has play but not today|pg||
nt|dagold: with the awful diamond break|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: specs think 4@h will make on any lead because of the faviourable club break|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: losing 2c and a d|pg||
nt|yke:  hamman, don't play me for the perfect hand, I never have it|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: well certaonly no probs on any other lead|pg||
nt|steshome:  Easy 3NT|pg||
nt|the saint: It is now.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Erichsen needs to avoid the heart lead to break this name .. not realistic to expect that|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: on 3s 4d was a good bid,if east wanted to hear heart cue from west|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chick: true, yke, but there are a LOT of hands E could hold that would make 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no d ruff now|pg||
nt|lestergold: grand slam try seeimng if pard can cue k@h|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Looks like @SQ with no king|pg||
nt|yke:  misunderstanding? of was den donder very conservative, he it not a very timid player|pg||
nt|chick: it's equally true,  don't play me for the worst hand, I never have it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is why i dont play with hamman....seriously, the point is not that we shd bid a grand, but that  if a PERFECT hand makes a GRAND good, then a less than perfect hand might ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: easily have a SMALL slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: club guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: 5d ask trump q|pg||
nt|uttam: 6s says i have trump q ,but no side k|pg||
nt|lestergold: well what does 3@s show cant be a 5 spades to the umph unless he has a lot of high cards elsewhere|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|jcomyn: too late|pg||
nt|lestergold: trying to shut stable door after horse has bolted|pg||
nt|dagold: no idea what any of this means but this may make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yke:  on this hand, 5@C is not a very good contract, |pg||
pc|h9|nt|dagold: best is to win this and play the diamond K|pg||
nt|dagold: he must win and play the diamond K|pg||
nt|dagold: if he wins and tries for a club ruff declarer makes easily|pg||
nt|dagold: by ruffing 1 heart|pg||
nt|dagold: and drawing two trumps to play winning clubs|pg||
nt|dagold: considering a duck|pg||
nt|dagold: to get a diamond through|pg||
nt|dagold: very difficult defence|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|ady: no complications here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|galadriel: Scotland stayed out of the 6@H for a swing in|pg||

nt|pitiful:  well maybe west should have shown @c's at his first turn|pg||
nt|dburn: quite possibly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|pitiful:  i am sure east did not make 4@s at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: this result seems unlikely|pg||
nt|brolucius: As Support Doubles are so ridiculous, David, you must find it an impenetrable mystery why so many of the world top pairs use them.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  even david might have doubled as north|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  maybe it was a support double thing|pg||
nt|dburn: although it is true that East-West have seven spades, so I suppose they might play in them at the four level|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pitiful:  i much prefer 3@c as north|pg||
nt|dburn: but I suspect that our poor operators, who are struggling valiantly with poor connections, have erred in entering the result from the other table|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: Even the overbid of 4@C (if 3@C is not available) might be considered better than a unilateral 2@S.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Playing with the same trump suit in both rooms does not normally get a plus score.|pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn: I am told that South actually played 4@h at the other table|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h minus 1 at other table|pg||

nt|chilloncan: 5C is an extremely practical contract. chances of a trump lead are small, and even then a squeeze is likely|pg||
nt|dagold: good contract but failinf|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: h v clubs|pg||
nt|2hplus4: If partner has a king he shows it over ask|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shall I give up or shall WE try to give them?|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Another swing in, you meant|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: it needs to be specific heart k so would 5@h show that|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: but east could have bid 4d cue,on 3s to hear 4h cue from p, then bid 4nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|2hplus4: Depends on their agreements|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|yke:  you only have a squeeze on a trump conitnuation at trick two, not after a club lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: 3nt now i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: this should drift down 1|pg||
mb|4S|nt|2hplus4: Even @DK is likely to be enough |pg||
nt|chick: I'm told the XX showed hearts|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well my remark was that 5C is a good practical contract. i would far rather be hoping for good news in 5C than playi ng 4C|pg||
nt|chilloncan: especially when i know the opponent holding my cards in the other room will be trying to pick up 40 IMPs in a very short time|pg||
nt|yke:  yes, stopping in 4@C on a dime sounds too impractical for me|pg||
nt|ady: defence need a diamond switch quickly or this may slip through|pg||
nt|ady: north likely to win and switch to J@D|pg||
nt|ady: Scotland  have built up a big lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: well well|pg||
nt|ady: it appears on the movie   2 hearts made  110|pg||
nt|ady: may be another swing for Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzd: geting dangerous here|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|galadriel: Everything behaving nicely for declarer here|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Current standings after 1st weekend on left at : http://www.scottishbridge.co.uk/|pg||

mc|10|nt|boedhy: But now I think he made a dubious call|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|an|Puppet|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|Force|nt|brolucius: Normally such a low scoreline would suggest good tight bridge, but although the bridge has been OK it is more a case of lack of swing potential in the deals.|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: I think so too - but it's possible opener has a weak NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d is a transfer response showing 4+@h|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT likely to make n/s   but not liikely to be bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm pretty sure the double is takeout of hearts|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|boedhy: probably went 1 off...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: passing with a good 6-bagger dosnt appeal to me at all|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   may be reached   and could make if west fails to lead diamonds early  so that east can ruff and return a spade|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@H shows 3 hearts in a balanced hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: interesting hand 4@s losing 3 trump tricks makes 3n a struggle|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont know if my comments about the slam hand came through before i was disconnected, so i will repeat them now: S did not play to best advantage. attacking hearts first was ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plausible, but:  (1) he should lead small from dummy instead of the king, just in case he can slip past the Ax. But more importantly...........|pg||

mb|p|nt|uttam: wow|pg||

nt|paulg:  England finally on the board in this set with a part-score swing on 27|pg||

nt|boedhy: 3NT now in the right hand and with a @h lead...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime feeling pleased with himself no doubt .. although clear to balance there is risk but the opponents take the push|pg||
nt|the saint: Both black suits now frozen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: espen wouldn't have bid 3h if vul!!|pg||
nt|steshome:  But he is vul?  Oh you mean he didn't see the vulnerabililty on the board?|pg||
nt|paulg:  part of the decision on bidding 3@h is dependent on how freely you raise with three-card support|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: I thought the @S2 might be suit preference for a club, but now it makes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: when  pard is weak u want to paly in 41s when he is stong it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|chilloncan: (2) when he sees that trumps are 3-0, he should turn to clubs. giving W two chances to discard means E is extremely unlikely to get the defense wrong if he wins ace on second ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: round. better to hope for E to have 4 clubs|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 2@D is 5+Hearts, invitational or better|pg||
nt|brolucius: I do not have the E/W c-card but it seems that 2@D is a transfer response. 2@S then says that he has no tolerance for hearts and extra length in spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many people play these transfer responses over a double. It is less common when the second hand has passed.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  e-w have to decide what west bids whrn 5@s and 1@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: East diagnoses a mis-fit and stops low - a bold decision. You would not expect East to do that at the other table.|pg||

nt|brolucius: The problem is that 3@C is usually played as forcing to game. So, he had no convenient limit bid.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: well here lay down 7 as cards lie but is six even a good contract it needs spades breaking and hearts not 4/2 with offside k etc|pg||

nt|yke:  5hearts plus 4spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  So the Scottish pair did well to bid the slam straight out of the blocks|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d game forcing checkback|pg||
nt|dagold: or even 3N and make it on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|boedhy: yes very good pair this As I said before they play in dutch competitions. We have something called topcircuit. And there they are close to making the final 16 which is very good|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a slam which needs cards to behave reasoably kindly as hand falls apart when they don't|pg||
nt|ady: this a potential swing for England    looks as though 4@H can be defeated on a spade lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be defeated on a spade lead if North had more spades|pg||
