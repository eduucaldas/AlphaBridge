nt|copeyj: First comparison here, England played 3NT-1|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|copeyj: the contract can't be made on AK and another @h I don't think|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|idc: In the other room, SOuth opened 3NT - normally a solid minor but in 3rd seat it can vary quite a bit|pg||
nt|idc: as you can see!|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: assume 3@D natural and invitational|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't think he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: I think 3NT was just put in by VG operator to catch up|pg||
nt|dburn: I expect the operator hadn't quite caught up with things at that stage|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome David - you suspect the operator was just catcghing up?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|idc: True, North probably opened|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|dburn: well, the play appears to have been @hA led and a claim for down one, which would be a trifle pessimisitc at that stage (though accurate enough as it turned out)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can claim |pg||
nt|idc: South's 3@d here was natural, IG, which I assume means inviting game|pg||

nt|ewj: X or 2NT here?|pg||
nt|ewj: I would double for sure|pg||

nt|mdgraham: sry, priv|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|dburn: seems sensible to double again|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: do we all bid 3@H there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ewj: Expect he wished he'd bid 2NT first time around now but yeh, what else can he do|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: or at least i do whatever i need to do to bid @H|pg||
nt|dburn: I should think so - partner is supposed to have hearts, and we could easily have a game|pg||
nt|copeyj: some people may play lebensohl here|pg||
nt|copeyj: but you have to bid, esp with 4 low @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: Score is in for board 14 which was missed due to Connection problems|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes Leb gets the weakness over|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|dburn: maybe, but it might not get your suit over - say you bid 2NT and the next guy bids 4@s, are you supposed to bid 5@h?|pg||
nt|copeyj: can ruff now for down 2 i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: @H to partner, another @C ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is spears thinking or has the vugraph gone down?|pg||
nt|idc: Right - I thought pitching may still lead to -2, but South in danger of endplays|pg||

pc|sK|pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|copeyj: Jeff Aker points out that had north ruffed, crossed with @H, and taken another ruff, he needed to play a @D to break up a red suit squeeze. Not so hard to work out I guess for the ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: defence though|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d7|pc|h3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: This type of situation is a real partnership harmony tester:|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is nasty for south, any discard sets up a trick for declarer|pg||
nt|idc: Both know that SOuth is suffering because North didn't ruff the club|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree |pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
nt|lestergold: Engel refused to be sunject to indignity of endplay!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  South doubles to show that he had a very good 2NT bid, North has nowhere to go|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Ns time?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: no matter, E saved them|pg||

nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||

nt|steshome:  Hi all|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d5|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: therer isa lot of thism about these days|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not start with a high heart?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: seems u were dealt that to lead but as it happens 2 off whatever|pg||
nt|paulg:  Most of the cards are marked for Matheson, so he will be planning how to endplay South to minimise his losses|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||
nt|jcomyn: honestrly i dont see the point|pg||
nt|lestergold: often tho achieves right siding contracts|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi mike and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ruud|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i know about right siding but why not protect the Ck and those queens|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d7|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i wasnt referring to this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards for all pairs are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c7|nt|steshome:  South is Norman Selway btw|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East is John Matheson|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Impletion|pg||
nt|idc: 14-16 might be a good 1NT range to reach it, unlikely otherwise|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: a new word to me  David|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: in effect, North at the other table passed a weak no trump opening, which showed lack of regard for tens, nines and eights|pg||
nt|idc: My partner used to use it all the time - just to annoy me I suspect|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|dburn: and North here has shown similar contemps for good cards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont blame him, everytime i raise on 10  3nt goes down|pg||
nt|idc: Another very slight factor in favour of continuing is the possibility of there still being a 4-4 spade fit|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|idc: Though if 1NT denied 4 spades, David's point about the intermediates is still valid|pg||
nt|copeyj: where transfer responses to 1@C might gain - E/W for example would have had a decent shot of bidding the @S game with their methods|pg||

nt|chick: 5@C could have made on the good lie of the cards, but more than likely EW would have sac'd at 5@D, so not much difference|pg||
nt|chick: 5@DX-2  = a few imps|pg||
nt|yke:  I was in a partnership with steven den donder a few years ago, We played in holland in the "meesterklasse" |pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice card fit EW|pg||
nt|yke:  he is a very creative player with a tendency to overbid|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|lestergold: bridge is a very young game and new bidding ideas are being tested every day|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oh dont be so modest|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yke:  I think they are the favorites in this final|pg||
nt|rodal f: So system for EW is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as Donder and u Yke?|pg||
nt|yke:  I;m not sure|pg||
nt|chick: E probably has a 2-suiter bid available, but would you use it Vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  ofcourse you would, I think now 2@H means hearts an a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: vul and nice 11HP now.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yke:  ah ok, 2NT means hearts + clubs, they play multi defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: That was hard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT with 1@c always promising at least 3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yke:  I'm informed by a specatator that 2NT means a strong two suiter with a minor|pg||
nt|steshome:  Thin spade game missed - likely to be missed at the other table|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Uttam Gupta|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems a normal way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and good eve all|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: aand now the polish club|pg||
pc|s3|nt|2hplus4: Hi there|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Uttam welcome|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and ty|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s seems normal contract |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 3@H=invit for 4 in @D or @H since a M and a MIN?|pg||
nt|yke:  he could have overcalled 2@H which would be 5 hearts + 4+ minor|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Y. Capp|pg||
nt|yke:  so he was thinking if he could afford to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|steshome:  West eschewed leading clubs|pg||
nt|galadriel: @C opener steering Sime away from his 5 carder lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||

mb|3H|nt|galadriel: Think we may be in for a bumpy ride|pg||

nt|steshome:  I am confident that England can bid this game |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
mb|5D|nt|paulg:  it does not seem to matter where the Camrose is held, there are often connection problems in the first session ... very frustrating for the vugraph operators|pg||

nt|paulg:  and holding an ace that should not be difficult|pg||
nt|steshome:  Undisciplined|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think Iain will lead a spade|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: my point is why not explore the possibility of 6d and stop in 5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: 5 can go off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not safe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whov was it said clubs disappeared 10 years ago and diamonds are on the way out.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love unsafe contracts if there is a smell of a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think this combined 26 count with 8 card @d fit and the rest of thehand misfitting is one to explore for slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: however caution i.e. un derbidding would be rewarded today|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a viable opinion, but again it goes back to the main goal of preempting. if we are doing it mainly to get in the opponentss' way, then a wider range is BETTER than a narrow ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: range -- we will get to do it more often, and when they opops play the contract they will have a harder time reading the layout|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: i dont think it makes even double dummy|pg||
nt|uttam: qx aqjxx kxx xxx , bidding will likely go the same way?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May go for 1  of 2 finesses. Or to discard @C on @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so worst scenario needing 2 out of 3 finesses i think this was a normal slam to bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|uttam: of course all north will bid the slam ,after they hear south open 1h|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u when east ruffs in on the third round of @ds there is still play left in the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can play on clubs|pg||

nt|lestergold: well maybe it can be made after all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With K@S falling he may make this|pg||
nt|uttam: depends on trick 1|pg||
nt|yke:  it's generally a good idea not to let your opponents play at the one level in a suit, unless you suspect they have a better fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT or X there. What give ure pard best freedom?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nt feels as a order and a X ure pard give the advice|pg||
nt|yke:  ith such a flat hand, i would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as Terence Reese always said, the more narrowly a preempter's hand is defined, the less effective a weapon it is  ("a dull swrod" was his phrase)|pg||
nt|chick: The idea of not let opps play at the 1 level depends a bit on the auction, I think.    1@D P P ?   is not the same situation as   1@D P 1@H P 1@S P P ?|pg||

nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|yke:  you only have a squeeze on a trump conitnuation at trick two, not after a club lead|pg||

nt|chilloncan: especially when i know the opponent holding my cards in the other room will be trying to pick up 40 IMPs in a very short time|pg||

nt|steshome:  I'm not sure opening is on my radar with that West hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|the saint: If that is the case and dec is playing something like a 6-0 fit. You might get game in 100s anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: could have bid 2s now has to bid 3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: well with west's hand all tops elsewhere but single spade i would bid 41s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s|pg||
nt|boedhy: dont know what 3@d is but uses up a lot of space.|pg||
nt|boedhy: 3NT now in the right hand and with a @h lead...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime feeling pleased with himself no doubt .. although clear to balance there is risk but the opponents take the push|pg||
nt|the saint: Both black suits now frozen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: espen wouldn't have bid 3h if vul!!|pg||
nt|steshome:  But he is vul?  Oh you mean he didn't see the vulnerabililty on the board?|pg||
nt|paulg:  part of the decision on bidding 3@h is dependent on how freely you raise with three-card support|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: when  pard is weak u want to paly in 41s when he is stong it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|chilloncan: (2) when he sees that trumps are 3-0, he should turn to clubs. giving W two chances to discard means E is extremely unlikely to get the defense wrong if he wins ace on second ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: round. better to hope for E to have 4 clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no need use up any space had e opened 2d|pg||
nt|lestergold: all roads lead to 41s east cannot take his partner out|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|boedhy: not easy te see he has to take this... well donw|pg||
nt|the saint: If he reads this right, he can throw EW in to open up the blacks|pg||
nt|the saint: Down 4 seems a little harsh mind you|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: and the e hand now a dead duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: from East's angle pard may have running 9 tricks in minors etc and void spade so its up to West|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|copeyj: re-hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: Right we are under way with the right cards|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|idc: And we have an exciting looking hand to start off with|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: Murdoch has a monster - opposite not very much he can make a grand slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: We  begin with 15 & 16 in this room, then will get comparisons from other table from Bds 1 onwards|pg||
nt|copeyj: Was 5NT pick a slam do we think?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: Understandable to reach 6@c, but in that contract dummy is pretty short of entries|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect that is right about 5NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: anyone for rkcb for @S?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what was 5NT i wonder|pg||
nt|idc: 6@s would perhaps be a little easier to play, if not all that better in theory|pg||
nt|copeyj: 7@S Ian|pg||
nt|ewj: 7@S only beaten by a @C lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 7N is against the wall|pg||
nt|copeyj: in fact|pg||
nt|dburn: pick a sla, I imagine - 6@s could have been better than 6@c|pg||
nt|idc: ok, i guess single @sJ is ok, so grand just about worth reaching|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt like to play this one|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|idc: For sure I'd rather be in 7@s than 6@c|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ewj: Surely the obvious thing to do is two cash @S and two top clubs and hope?|pg||

nt|idc: So at least N-S have avoided the ignominy of going down in small when grand making in other strain|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: too difficult to reach a grand|pg||

mb|1C|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|rodal f: All on but 12 is hard|pg||
nt|chick: 2 boards to go, doesn't look hopeful for Begijntje|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yke:  a boring 4H 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|idc: Welcome everyone to the last round of the English Lady Milne trials|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chilloncan: no, though they could easily gain a game swing on the last one|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here lay down 7 as cards lie but is six even a good contract it needs spades breaking and hearts not 4/2 with offside k etc|pg||
nt|paulg:  This was probably the first board of the match at the other table|pg||
mc|13|nt|jcomyn: this is not a bad slam and they didnt even try in the open room|pg||
nt|uttam: 3nt no chance on d lead|pg||
nt|yke:  3@S is smolen, GF to make sure the strong hand plays the contract|pg||
nt|yke:  5hearts plus 4spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  So the Scottish pair did well to bid the slam straight out of the blocks|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|idc: There's a promising looking website for the weekend at: http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: about to see a transfer auction here for E/W,. 1@C = any weak NT or Natural, 1@S = 5@D4M GF or various weak minor hands|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|copeyj: 1N from West showing weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@S from East showing 5@D4@S FG|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-14|mb|p|mb|2S|an|5!D 4!S (i think)|nt|idc: One thing I can't find there are the scores after the first weekend, so look for those at: http://www.scottishbridge.co.uk/|pg||

nt|chick: another chance for big imps NS, but too late to do much good|pg||
nt|the saint: It was. So. The difference came from opener's rebid. 4C or 3N?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3NT is lazy when you miss slam, practical when you don't|pg||
nt|the saint: 3N looks a practical description to me.|pg||

nt|chilloncan: 4S on double-dummy for EW|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bravo Frederic:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyn: Thanks all Last hand see you soon|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is likely that you have a fit in clubs, so I think 4@c is well judged|pg||
nt|steshome:  This really isn't going well for England fans|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: 14 was 1NT +1 by E|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|boedhy: so maybe some 5 imps for begijntje but still BOB a very handsome lead. Think they will win it...|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@d is game forcing checkback|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  3N is a better contract. the clue is that E-W have almost all the quacks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the scottish way is always to show hearts before spades when responding to checkback|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime can't be thinking of going on - another network glitch?|pg||

nt|steshome:  What was the 3@d bid all about?|pg||

nt|paulg:  We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Terry, in extremely difficult circumstances. Great Job! |pg||
nt|galadriel: Maybe he thinks E has shown a slam try with @D?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chilloncan: trump lead would have been best -- and in my view clearly indicated -- but contract still failing|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Anne Symons, Sarah Teshome and Alan Shillitoe for their wit and perceptive comments. |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb:  quacks, specs, are queens and jacks|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps East felt there was no way to suggest @c weakness, having had in their system, to open the suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Sandra Claridge (Bridge Great Britain) together with Alan Jones and the Welsh Bridge Union for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We will be back in 35 minutes for the second half of this match.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Thanks all - and to specs for chat :)|pg||
