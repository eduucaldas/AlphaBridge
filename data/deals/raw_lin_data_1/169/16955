nt|ady: Ireland could have saved for -300 here   so a decent board for England  |pg||
nt|pitiful:  nice play from norman|pg||
nt|pitiful:  going down if he ruffs david|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c6|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: as pointed out, the same diamond position means that EW can make 6@D, but that is a rather poor contract|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  if it starts 1@d-1@s, will East bid 1NT or X?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW hav balance of power|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  3N by E or 4H both have good chances|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  neither!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|yorkbeach:  anyone agree with 2@d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  reaching 4@h now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: I would prefer to show the double @S stop, but dbl showing 4@H =would be second choice|pg||
mb|d|nt|pdjourdain:  South might bid 3S at this vul making it tougher to find the H fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North thinks that all he needs his @hJ-x-x for a set|pg||
nt|greerm: this might be nice for the good guys :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not expecting the @s void|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Note spade leads make it natural for declarer to lay down HA|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: now has to get the @H right and no real reason to|pg||
pc|hK|nt|greerm: might get it right now :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Suddenly the double looks better (until that lead)!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with trumps 2-2, it is easy to ruff a @c in dummy|pg||
nt|greerm: @D 2-2 helps too|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|greerm: North had a difficult lead, but I would have expected @S since all look dangerous but partner had supported @S|pg||
mc|11|nt|yorkbeach:  East's failure to bid 1NT and South's failure to bid 3@s convinced North that the spades were falletr round the table|pg||
nt|greerm: or maybe a trump|pg||

mb|1D|nt|pitiful:  last board here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: yes    5 unlcuky    spade lead   clubs 3-0   and east doubleton diamond   so in fact Ireland did well to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: good job, thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Hi Anto, it's Laura but I can't talk because I'm BBO op|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: now waht does North do?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yorkbeach:  strange choice by East in both rooms|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, E supported diamonds at his first turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Once bitten ...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I thought choice was 1Nt or X|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree, but that did make things easier for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: goes for it :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H now? or 3@S? or something else?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pitiful:  3n a real shot from david|pg||
nt|ady: thin 3NT    will not make|pg||
nt|pitiful:  upgraded his pips |pg||
nt|pitiful:  might now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what is @s 8 lead from|pg||
nt|ady: yes    if he gets this right|pg||
nt|ady: would be a lucky swing |pg||
nt|pitiful:  this will be a big board in the march|pg||
nt|pitiful:  match|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: might go down 2 trying heart finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: Hope you all enjoyed this set!   :)     Thanks to BBO for making this VUgraph available to us.  Even poor souls in South Africa can attend now!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|h8|nt|pitiful:  might make if no @c switch|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|mc|8|nt|xenya: that was quick -- it seems 3N could be made by squeezing N|pg||
