mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the defence have to organize to cash everything and then east plays the fourth card in either minor to promote the @SJ|pg||
nt|athene: ok, in 2@S, the sixth defensive trick is a bit more important|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer might just tackle spades from hand anyway giving himself two losers in the suit without any need for heroics from the defence|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:  Welcome to second half of match|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Other table starts with Boards 30-32 so no results here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Denning-Shields play Precision so 1D meant 1 nothing!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats the irish spelling of michael|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: only making game bypASSED|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Brussels|pg||
nt|rodal f: With Wald nr 4 might a full table:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Conelia and Frank|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and our operator, Frederic|pg||
nt|mcarroll: operator, are you sure of the bidding? Tom does not usually open a 3 card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: hands don't match those in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: just noticed when dummy went down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah that explains lots :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: its being checked out now|pg||
nt|dagold: Good afternoon All|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Cornelia u welcomed lady.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Evening all :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Micheal sitting East and Padraig West of the brothers|pg||
nt|ady: this can go down 2 with a trump promotion|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: west had a serious problem too strong for 3@c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So it is Precision versus Blue Club at this table|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as we can see 41s a very sensible contract unfortunately not today|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9 tricks on top and now a real horror|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: 6-0 breaks not the way to spend sunday mornin|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: why did s not double - cant be takeout|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if 3nt not bid no way are bthey bidding 4nt kloen|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: had south passed with his pile of garbage bidding liekly woujld have been 2@d cue by west 2@s by east 3@c by west 3n by East|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story......|pg||
nt|ady: defence needs to cash 4 minor suit winners  and exit with a diamond    then 4th diamond will promote J@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: await developments before jumping in|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: 9 0f hearts coudl hardly cost|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Very odd, Micheal thought the double showed C+D as 1D meant nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: all leading to a "challenging" contract|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: well i do not want to encourage too many raises with 3 to the J and out|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story is that putting a spoke in often works|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes backfires also|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not wait and see what opps do and then clobber bem|pg||
nt|lestergold: because what opps would have done here was ti get to laydown 3N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine playing in game in the opps weak suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed laydown 4N|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: might prove costly declarer could do with 5 heart tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: playing low on heart lead would work if south held Ten or Jack without the 8 it is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: ie setting up finesse position on next round but that would involve a guess- and north has led a heart in spite of the bid on his left|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence of course may well find it difficult not to give declarer a 9th  trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|lestergold: not obvious but best for defence to take 1d and return it|pg||
nt|lestergold: very tricky hand communcations not great for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jim Patrick|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hello there|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult for defence too south is worried about entry for the A@c in due course not easy to see that the 7@d is that entry eventually|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: hi jim|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: or they could do the same playing a 3rd and 4th club|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|mikeirl: Hi all :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yke Smit|pg||

nt|athene: given the vulnerability|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: but if you don't double opps sometimes they get too frisky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|dburn: one more seven-card fit|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer has so many winners that even 6-0 trumps won't hurt him|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
nt|lestergold: Engel refused to be sunject to indignity of endplay!|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello all!|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back everyone .. i guess we've missed 17 as the connection settled down|pg||
nt|dagold: Nice lead|pg||
nt|ady: last tricks not shown   but down 2   so 2 trump tricks were lost|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@h might steal it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
nt|dburn: this might not play all that well|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
nt|dagold: even a heart lead won't beat this as the spade is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes connection problems here keeps crashing|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  South doubles to show that he had a very good 2NT bid, North has nowhere to go|pg||
nt|ady: Caroll decided on a penalty  rather than try 3NT  |pg||
nt|ady: this will cost plenty|pg||
nt|dburn: very sensible, even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: w does not expect pard to make this|pg||
pc|hA|nt|steshome:  Evening|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ns time?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: no matter, E saved them|pg||
nt|dburn: if the defenders can force declarer to play clubs himself, this looks down about five|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts we assume|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mmm interesting|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S always need to have a semi inside.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hi all|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime has an absolute HIROSHIMA!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|steshome:  Potential loss for England on board 17|pg||
nt|steshome:  Sad to say|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S on    difficult to reach|pg||
nt|ady: will do well to get out for 800|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it isn't easy to defend perfectly in this kind of situation|pg||
nt|ady: do not want to over do shortening declarer |pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: therer isa lot of thism about these days|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not start with a high heart?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|the saint: Can be difficult to get across hands with thatmany HCP|pg||
nt|galadriel: good shot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: seems u were dealt that to lead but as it happens 2 off whatever|pg||
nt|paulg:  Most of the cards are marked for Matheson, so he will be planning how to endplay South to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|the saint: That is one way. Was 2NT in that sequence 25+ or a specific range?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|steshome:  Ah A downside of Kokish|pg||
nt|dburn: now, for example, South may have to play a trump or blow a trick, and that's difficult|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||
nt|jcomyn: honestrly i dont see the point|pg||
nt|lestergold: often tho achieves right siding contracts|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi mike and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ruud|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i know about right siding but why not protect the Ck and those queens|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pdjourdain:  Denning has four spades to cash so Micheal looking ahead|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  If scores remain as now Eng & Rep lead on 117 with Wales on 116|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: light opening  helps EW keep Wales out of a making 3NT|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well i wasnt referring to this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards for all pairs are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|steshome:  South is Norman Selway btw|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|paulg:  and East is John Matheson|pg||
nt|ady: good slam|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: but othe odds are that the opening bidder is the stronger hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|the saint: With all the bangers and a solid 9 card fit, the hand was pulling extra. Some risk of missing grand, but could that be bid with confidence if it were there?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

nt|dagold: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mikeirl: would be better if the table didn't keep closing :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: bridge is a very young game and new bidding ideas are being tested every day|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: oh dont be so modest|pg||
nt|dagold: and would expect east to bid 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yke:  I think they are the favorites in this final|pg||
nt|rodal f: So system for EW is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as Donder and u Yke?|pg||
nt|yke:  I;m not sure|pg||
nt|chick: E probably has a 2-suiter bid available, but would you use it Vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, that looks reasonable alright|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yke:  ofcourse you would, I think now 2@H means hearts an a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: vul and nice 11HP now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w should reach game   but if 3NT may well go down|pg||
nt|dagold: assume north opened 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  ah ok, 2NT means hearts + clubs, they play multi defence|pg||
nt|steshome:  I love North's double|pg||
nt|ady: was as expected   800|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: That was hard.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT with 1@c always promising at least 3|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has a chance   but can go down to a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dagold: cleary this isn't right specs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yke:  I'm informed by a specatator that 2NT means a strong two suiter with a minor|pg||
nt|steshome:  Thin spade game missed - likely to be missed at the other table|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Uttam Gupta|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems a normal way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and good eve all|pg||
nt|ady: no game making if defence right with 26 hcp|pg||
pc|dA|nt|steshome:  No game makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W has a lead problem|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: aand now the polish club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 3NT by W would have been better|pg||
pc|d3|nt|2hplus4: Hi there|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Uttam welcome|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and ty|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s seems normal contract |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 3@H=invit for 4 in @D or @H since a M and a MIN?|pg||
nt|yke:  he could have overcalled 2@H which would be 5 hearts + 4+ minor|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Capp|pg||
nt|yke:  so he was thinking if he could afford to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|steshome:  Seriously though chaps, don't you think that doubling on the North hand is winning bridge?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If he finds the @S switch the contract goes down|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, the Italians seem to think so|pg||
nt|mcarroll: otherwise the @Hs can be set up for @S discards|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|galadriel: and who would argue with them :)|pg||
nt|ady: declarer will play on diamonds   and likely play low from west  to cater for sing. ace with north|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good morning all|pg||
nt|ady: should just lose 2 more tricks  1 heart and 1 spade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|steshome:  West eschewed leading clubs|pg||
nt|galadriel: @C opener steering Sime away from his 5 carder lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||
nt|the saint: Byrne (North) is forever telling the U20s to double on those hands. Playable in 3 suits. |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  i'd prefer the double with an extra diamond and one less club|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wrong - not enough entries|pg||

nt|dagold: Good evening all|pg||
nt|copeyj: hi David|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: south doesn't feel like getting his feet wet here with 2@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: Good result from Jones/Rosen next door here - although 4@S is highly likely to make in practise too|pg||
nt|dagold: there is a chance of beating 4@s here on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly, after they have got the positive response in, there is a lot less to be gained from intervention|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dagold: on winning the first heart south plays a club and declarer must guess|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: @D lead coming I am sure|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in theory that gives the defence a chance but declarer would be likely to go right, anyway?|pg||
nt|copeyj: (famous last words)|pg||
nt|athene: and it's a tough defence to find|pg||
nt|dagold: why?|pg||
nt|athene: well just on the basis that south is less likely to lead from the king|pg||
nt|dagold: normal defence|pg||
nt|copeyj: Agree - what else is south supposed to do when he gets in?|pg||
nt|dagold: he will have no choice but to play a club whatever he holds|pg||
nt|dagold: looks 50/50 to me|pg||
nt|athene: well, we might get to see it all happen|pg||
pc|d6|nt|copeyj: he will get count in @D from Espen|pg||
nt|dagold: only inference is that he knows diamond suit and heart king and might view south might have bid with the club K too|pg||

nt|dagold: sure was suggesting the only inference he might have|pg||

nt|copeyj: Agree|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||

mb|3N|nt|galadriel: Think we may be in for a bumpy ride|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: because their bids often become ambiguous is double for takeouit or showing the suit thats been bid etc....|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Hello et Bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|steshome:  I am confident that England can bid this game |pg||
nt|paulg:  this would be a good time for Matheson to bid 2@d ...|pg||
nt|ady: there is a complication with 4@S     |pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Oh my - North is going to struggle to get his spades across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and put a Pass card on Sime's side of the bidding tray for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell is going to bid 2@H this time|pg||
nt|steshome:  And North will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: if north plays 4@S   and east leads J@D    west will have to duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 9 top tricks|pg||

pc|dT|nt|paulg:  it does not seem to matter where the Camrose is held, there are often connection problems in the first session ... very frustrating for the vugraph operators|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZZD: I agree with problems|pg||
nt|steshome:  So easy to find|pg||
nt|paulg:  Byrne definitely thinking he has an RHO, LHO and CHO at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: if east leads a club or heart should north play 4@S   dont think it can be made|pg||
nt|the saint: There are no screens in the Camrose - am I right?|pg||
nt|steshome:  He might've done better to rebid 2@S at his second turn|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZZD: it is now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it would not surprise me if Bell is still thinking|pg||
nt|steshome:  Not sure about the 4@h bid - seems a bit previous - horrible hand to play now|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be made if playing carefull as 9@S comes down   so can plat spades from the top and later discard a diamond on a heart   lose 2 spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@H sounded like he has longer hearts to me. 2@H seemed more descriptive. Partner was still in the game.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i still prefer my initial 2@h over 1@H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  5@d looks cold on any lead, declarer just established the hearts|pg||

nt|steshome:  Connection problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes sorry but connection crashing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have gone beyond 3NT which makes because the @H finesse an 3-3 brek produces 4 tricks|pg||

nt|athene: but the only 8-card fit they had was a minor! what's a pair to do?|pg||
nt|dagold: and 3@d may not be a great spot facing a singleton|pg||
nt|dagold: double as t/o would be nice but it is penalty for them|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table, North's 3@d explicitly showed six diamonds and three hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and less than a strong club|pg||
nt|dagold: useful|pg||
nt|athene: many strong clubbers use a 2nt rebid to show that hand|pg||
nt|athene: but either way, when you are limited, it's easier|pg||
nt|dburn: most of them use 2NT to show six diamonds without three hearts|pg||

mb|d|nt|jcomyn: another trensfer i assume|pg||

nt|jcomyn: whov was it said clubs disappeared 10 years ago and diamonds are on the way out.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love unsafe contracts if there is a smell of a slam|pg||

nt|lestergold: however caution i.e. un derbidding would be rewarded today|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a viable opinion, but again it goes back to the main goal of preempting. if we are doing it mainly to get in the opponentss' way, then a wider range is BETTER than a narrow ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: range -- we will get to do it more often, and when they opops play the contract they will have a harder time reading the layout|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: i dont think it makes even double dummy|pg||
nt|uttam: qx aqjxx kxx xxx , bidding will likely go the same way?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May go for 1  of 2 finesses. Or to discard @C on @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so worst scenario needing 2 out of 3 finesses i think this was a normal slam to bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|uttam: of course all north will bid the slam ,after they hear south open 1h|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u when east ruffs in on the third round of @ds there is still play left in the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can play on clubs|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I think he'll discard @C and go for cross ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and at least one club will take care of a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe it can be made after all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With K@S falling he may make this|pg||
nt|uttam: depends on trick 1|pg||
nt|yke:  it's generally a good idea not to let your opponents play at the one level in a suit, unless you suspect they have a better fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT or X there. What give ure pard best freedom?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nt feels as a order and a X ure pard give the advice|pg||

nt|chilloncan: as Terence Reese always said, the more narrowly a preempter's hand is defined, the less effective a weapon it is  ("a dull swrod" was his phrase)|pg||
nt|chick: The idea of not let opps play at the 1 level depends a bit on the auction, I think.    1@D P P ?   is not the same situation as   1@D P 1@H P 1@S P P ?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: now is critical point|pg||
nt|chilloncan: true, chick, but the original comment said "unless you may think they have a better fit", so the second of your sequences would not really apply to the scope of that remark as they ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: have bid 3 suits.|pg||
nt|yke:  well actualy 2 suits, since 1@C can be short|pg||
nt|chick: still different is    P P 1@D P 1@H P P ?|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  xxx xxx xxxx xxx|pg||
nt|athene: jump to 3nt can show that sort of hand if you have some other sequence available with a real monster balanced|pg||

nt|copeyj: Peter's comment of the xxx xxx xxxx xxx hand was meant for me i think - suggesting W shld bid 3N over 1@D as he can make game opposite a yarboro|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|dburn: and by the sound of it, some that I might not wish to see|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: oh well, they got there anyway|pg||
nt|dagold: I have played alot in America and haven't seen that|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|copeyj: whether it was forcing or not|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sQ|mc|10|nt|dburn: that 1@d was not limited as to shape - partner could have six or seven cards in a major|pg||

nt|2hplus4: I would overcall as West|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT   for e/w|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: north needs to find out if south has K@d basically even then 6@c may be a punt|pg||
nt|uttam: normal 4h contract here for n/s|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't want to defend all day|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|chilloncan: does the panel all brebid 1N as S?|pg||
nt|yke:  on this hand, you can make 6@S, but it's not a good contract|pg||
nt|chilloncan: rebid|pg||
nt|chick: yes|pg||
nt|yke:  but its not easy to avoid once North knows his partner has 3spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: well, N has pretty bad spade quality. he is going to need some very chunky trumps from S, and S ought to realize he does not have them.|pg||
nt|chick: I don't raise with only 3, although some people do.   Not if there is a better choice, and here 1N is better|pg||
nt|dagold: A vry agressive double |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzd: S lead simplifies this|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|chilloncan: and it should be relatively easy to get S to focus on spades as the big question mark|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been many hands by a lot quest "how to handle it" I love those but go for the specs from beginners and up. All with.|pg||

nt|chilloncan: a very reasonable criterion|pg||

nt|lestergold: well if theyb reached this sciebtifically its impressive|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|s5|nt|chick: so 4@S is obviously a shutdown, and rightfully bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  N/S bid the spade game on 20 in the other room.  Likely loss for England :(|pg||
nt|ady: cue bid their way to the 5 level      still not too high|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 15 tricks on a non Spade lead|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 10 red suit tricks available   so only 2 club tricks needed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chilloncan: one can organize rebids over 2N so that minimums can be included with an economical bid. but it requires a lot of memory for the system|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and back to the auld 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: not single dummy it won't|pg||
nt|rodal f: S try at least. 2@D=major|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: a need for conservatism on part of e/w but i think a heart barrage will propel them to indiscretion|pg||

nt|2hplus4: 4@S automatic with E|pg||
mb|6H|nt|uttam: ask p ,to do some thing intelligently|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a less memory intensive version has cheap rebids showing doubtful trump quality, as that is one of the primary  issues for slam in a 53 fit|pg||
nt|ady: North contesting a 2nd time|pg||
nt|ady: south wont be too happy|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but that D9 is useful|pg||
nt|uttam: east can contribute in defence only|pg||

nt|paulg:  Sime feeling pleased with himself no doubt .. although clear to balance there is risk but the opponents take the push|pg||
nt|the saint: Both black suits now frozen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: espen wouldn't have bid 3h if vul!!|pg||
nt|steshome:  But he is vul?  Oh you mean he didn't see the vulnerabililty on the board?|pg||
nt|paulg:  part of the decision on bidding 3@h is dependent on how freely you raise with three-card support|pg||
nt|ady: assume the double by Carrol was really pass|pg||

nt|chilloncan: (2) when he sees that trumps are 3-0, he should turn to clubs. giving W two chances to discard means E is extremely unlikely to get the defense wrong if he wins ace on second ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: round. better to hope for E to have 4 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no need use up any space had e opened 2d|pg||

mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it can be awkward when the Multi-er's partner has his own major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you have to have good agreements so partner doesn't think you are making pass/correct bids|pg||

nt|athene: even if they have some scheme for responder to show his own major normally, it's easy to get mixed up after intervention|pg||
nt|athene: but really if you are going to play a multi, you should know what your bids mean after someone doubles|pg||
nt|athene: it's not as though that is a freakishly rare start to an auction|pg||

nt|athene: some people play that 2@D X 2@H is pass or correct but specifically shows some spade support|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what it is about this match - both sides seem to have signed a pact to play in as many 7-card trump fits as possible|pg||
nt|athene: so that if fourth chair bids 3minor, partner can compete with spades|pg||
nt|athene: after 2@D pass 2@H, responder might or might not have spades, and a big fit can be lost|pg||
