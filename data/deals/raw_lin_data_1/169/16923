mb|p|nt|kit: maybe they can't show this shape that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose  West was going with the KISS principle (keep it simple).  Unless East is off-shape, then hearts is the longest (or equal longest) fit|pg||
nt|kit: or maybe can't launch into RKC after that start|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, it's true that spades might be the spot, if East has something like Ax in hearts, and 4 spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, often happens - if you can get in early, you escape.  But later, the opponents know too much|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Meanwhile, declarer is going to have a very delicate decision at trick 1, I predict|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 3@H an attempted transfer|pg||
nt|kit: only on a club lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that's quite a 3@C bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I'm guess they play transfer responses so 1@s shows diamonds or maybe a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: actually, that same source said Jacob's 1@D opening on previous board should have been 5+ :(|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nigel_k:  Having denied a heart suit, South can bid 2@h to show a stopper|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a cunning plan Baldrick, so cunning you could put a tail on it and call it a weasel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of opening 4 card majors  Holland expects 4+@C from Brunner, but still|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: and now, The Larch, I mean the lurch to 5@D, bypassing the sensible 3N|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In 3NT there are nine tricks after conceding a diamond|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Here declarer needs to avoid two club losers|pg||
nt|jbgood: quite natural - apart from S's game invite - that is a toughy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some might treat South's @S length as 4  then Stayman rather than Transfer   [or PASS]|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul, down 50  try for game seems very reasonable|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 3 NT may just be a tad too high|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  There is no squeeze possibility so just have to choose between playing West for KQ doubleton and Q10 doubleton|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Neither of which works obviously|pg||
