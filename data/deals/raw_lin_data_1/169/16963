nt|pitiful:  i quite like south's name|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  rex has high standards for weak 2's|pg||

nt|cameron_1: Hi all good morning|pg||

nt|pitiful:  good morning|pg||
nt|dagold: Good afternoon Everyone|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: light double from south   with only 3 hearts|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how good is 6@s on say a trump lead|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 losers but I am not sure there are 9 winners|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pitiful:  assume opps have not bid|pg||
nt|ady: only 1 top loser in spades   but with spades 4-1  difficulties at the slam level|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cameron_1: i wonder what the real auction was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would not want to bid a slam single dummy|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: 3@c would have been close, perhaps struggling on a forcing game in spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pitiful:  good duck by Norman?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: doesnt matter what he does does it?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H makes double dummy -- but it's a tall order|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: just drop the @HQ and guess clubs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dagold: seems to be  atrick short|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: S could have doubled 3@H, showing a good hand, but the final contract would have been the same|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|yorkbeach:  4@d doubled down more|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yorkbeach:  North is too flat to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|greerm: an imaginative 4@D bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  will East share the joke?|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: not sure how many tricks e/w can make in @D?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yorkbeach:  imaginative lead|pg||

nt|greerm: looking for a @H ruff|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|greerm: will know that east has no @H now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  are the entries present for a double squeeze to make all 13?|pg||
nt|greerm: if he cashes trump, i think can make the lot on a double squeeze|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|ady: seems only 11 after all|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sensiblle result for e-w|pg||
nt|ady: looked like 12   maybe play not as it was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but are we sure not 12 operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Gold and Sid Ismail|pg||
nt|newmoon: hello all  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 off is not that bad considering |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|dagold: Hi everyone! (again)|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not --  depending on defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cameron_1: @d looser in end game I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d doesn't look like an acol 2|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Sid|pg||
mb|d|nt|dagold: I would bid on Souths hand I must admit|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I just saw Scotland bid this to 6@S via Kokish relay |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are putting in contracts and leading and claim|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT  for n/s   no reall problems|pg||
nt|newmoon: me 2|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 3N -- whether E preempts or not|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dagold: could make a game facing the right weak notrump type|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hT|nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||
nt|newmoon: plse stay tuned - we have a problem|pg||
nt|newmoon: will he make it tho?  has to hook @C10 after 2@Hs|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  less successful with the 6-0 break|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  no X from West?|pg||
nt|greerm: N/S obviously don't play weak jump shifts, else N has clear 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: not this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  weak notrumpers rarely play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for anderson to bid, not suit no points |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  who wants to premept when partner has opened?|pg||
nt|greerm: lots like to bid when it is their turn Julian|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you can bid without jumping|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suppose it means that if North bids 1@s and then 2@s partner knows you have quite a good hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|d8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  and you can play 1@s and then 3@s as forcing|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|copeyj: good morning all|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||

nt|pitiful:  morning captain|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|xenya: E will overcall now?|pg||
nt|xenya: holding 4 hearts i mean|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: back to real time|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down quite a few on accurate defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  fooled us all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: a heart lead beats 3NT --but no chance of finding it |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|newmoon: Open Room started with the last 2 boards.  They have comparfisons... we don't|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: very nicely done |pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: that was not what i meant by accurate defence|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally EW are just a bit short of 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: no frills on this one from Norman|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|garnetts: but nine tricks are available not that I can count |pg||
nt|sybarra: we in a claim?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think we are going off line again |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: EW needed to engineer a spade ruff to beat it by several tricks, probably 3 |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: at an early stage|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|xenya: the spade switch by W looks odd -- and so does declarer's decision to finesse -- surely E was marked with the 10|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|mc|5|nt|xenya: he would have made 2@S if he had gone up with the king -- plying for either 3-3 in trumps or singleton 10 |pg||

nt|pitiful:  3@d is not textbook|pg||
nt|copeyj: I reckon Bell will overcall with the west hand next door, but we will see|pg||
nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an obvious defence perhaps|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was not suggesting i follow the rules|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it was not meant as a critisism|pg||
nt|copeyj: I know :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 5@h now|pg||
nt|copeyj: I find 3@D quite scary, but I am applying for my bus pass in 12 months time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you would be more at home in senior bridge simon|pg||
nt|cameron_1: bezerk might be a better word|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
pc|hT|nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|s9|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: i have some difficulty counting the undertricks here |pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, a severe blow |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dagold: good play by Norman although Espens carding showed a doubleton|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: -3 as a spectator suggests? |pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: but landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|dagold: no 9 on the second round|pg||
pc|d5|nt|garnetts: must admit I would not have led a spade |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|newmoon: now the @C gets ruffed|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen and Norman know this is  a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|h7|nt|xenya: or 4?|pg||

nt|newmoon: bd 13:  13 imps to N.I. when 3NT makes @DA, 4@Cs and 4@Hs|pg||
nt|newmoon: interesting misfit here|pg||
nt|newmoon: u open 1@H, David?|pg||
nt|xenya: so the gadget has worked nicely|pg||
nt|xenya: it seems EW were not quite sure about the combined strength of their hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: interesting hand since 4@S seems better than 3NT--but no way to bid it I think|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2@d multi|pg||
nt|ady: club guess |pg||
nt|dagold: or one of these constructive 2@h|pg||
nt|dagold: is fine|pg||
nt|dagold: as Espen has done|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib said:  "or one of these constructive 2@h"|pg||
mb|1N|nt|april7: EW might reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 1@s....|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
mb|r!|nt|garnetts: looking for an adverse save |pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white saves not often best|pg||
nt|garnetts: loses a couple of imps|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if I like the 2NT bid or not |pg||
nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: with short majors|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: you very seldom get a good score if opps.play at 1 level|pg||
nt|dagold: some Kibs do not like the side 4cM|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: my shpellingg iss garbage these dayss|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|newmoon: still, -2 not too bad|pg||
nt|dagold: here for example the handwill not play so well facing many hands with 4-card spade support|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E is to blame here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dagold: probably need 5 spades opposite|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S was OK i think, but not 3N|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||

pc|s9|nt|ady: guessed    potential swing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
mc|7|nt|pitiful:  well q@h lead sort of helped the guess|pg||

nt|newmoon: oh, ok David.   enjoy the shopping|pg||
nt|dagold: :-)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't believe that |pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@s could be competing for a partial it seems to me, to force e would have to bid 2nt or above.|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: thx :)|pg||
nt|xenya: N didn't throw a spade of course|pg||

mb|2S|mb|2N!|nt|newmoon: South never passes, playing Junior bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|xenya: pass is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt looks like minors, others might use it as a xfer to 3@c (lebensohl-ish).|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The response makes the xfer more likely.|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully E didn't intend it as the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: hi Mike|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is an IMP event|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's 4@D is "pick-a-major" - he can't underwrite game, but any kind of fit will produce a reasonable play|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're probably joining somewhere in the middle of this tournement|pg||
nt|xenya: he did not|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|xenya: still a misunderstanding?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|newmoon: even 4@S was ok here, as it happens|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@H I meant|pg||
mb|4D|nt|newmoon: playing check-back, 3@D would deny 4@H AND 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  BBO|pg||
pc|s2|nt|newmoon: then show 3@S before 4@H, in their way|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: got  10 now    probably thats all|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|yuval10: he wanted to bid game quickly and avoid intervention, he figured out slam against a passed hand Partner will be tough |pg||

nt|newmoon: interesting 3NT here for n/s|pg||

nt|santyclz: Transferring into that @d suit isn't for everyone.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C!|nt|garnetts: potential for EW to get overboard if West opens |pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: not the time to beak the transfer with 4@Hs|pg||
