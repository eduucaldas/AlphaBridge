mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: It will be interesting to see what Del Monte chooses in a similar scenario|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What often happens here is that players only see the Red|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: assessing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: By "Red" of course, I mean the vulnerability.  So many people have a pathological fear of missing a vulnerable game|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Loathsome double|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: could well do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Why would you double?  Are your clubs that good?  If declarer is on lead to 3NT and chooses a non-club, would you be unhappy?  (Looking at your other 3 suits)|pg||

nt|bjacobs: That really was hari-kari by West, and it's hard to see this match going the distance|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the second of four 12 board quarters?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: in theory|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What I'm really annoyed about, is that I really wanted to see how Ish treated his hand, and now I'll never know|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kibitzer wittily said I had found out:  he bid 2@C natural!|pg||
nt|henryb:  sure you do. he treated his hand as good enough to play an eight trick game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he didn't transfer|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: planning play - still here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He must be planning the overtrick, because it seems reasonably clear that he is going to take 5 clubs and (at least) one in each side-suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  are we trying for overtricks?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he was possibly going to bid 2@S invite over the response i'm told|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That seems likely, in which case Ish also has the pathological fear of the missed vul game|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: question about discarding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because, to be honest, this featurely 7 count is not enough|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: featureless|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: exactly my thoughts|pg||
nt|henryb:  or possibly passophobia|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like that.  I'd like to think that I would transfer and pass when partner doesn't super-accept|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: But hey, Ish is a far superior player to me.  It's all perhaps about the psychology: the pressure you put opps under when you bid these rotten games|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   but yesterday was told might also include 4=4=4=1|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the lead inhibiting 1@S respnse?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nigel_k:  I'm guess they play transfer responses so 1@s shows diamonds or maybe a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: actually, that same source said Jacob's 1@D opening on previous board should have been 5+ :(|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nigel_k:  Having denied a heart suit, South can bid 2@h to show a stopper|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a cunning plan Baldrick, so cunning you could put a tail on it and call it a weasel|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|nigel_k:  This contract is more like a turnip|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: and now, The Larch, I mean the lurch to 5@D, bypassing the sensible 3N|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In 3NT there are nine tricks after conceding a diamond|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Here declarer needs to avoid two club losers|pg||
nt|jbgood: quite natural - apart from S's game invite - that is a toughy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some might treat South's @S length as 4  then Stayman rather than Transfer   [or PASS]|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: vul, down 50  try for game seems very reasonable|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 3 NT may just be a tad too high|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  There is no squeeze possibility so just have to choose between playing West for KQ doubleton and Q10 doubleton|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: time passes...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Neither of which works obviously|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: time flies? you cannot, they move too quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well i would have Passed 1N so talking about height of 3N may be unfair|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: S doesnt have an invite hand in mho - spade honor(s) might have told me otherwise|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: i once kibitzed a postmortem held by world champs -- conclusion was that one opp held 12 and the other 14 -- sure enough, they went back to the board and discovered it was fouled|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|nigel_k:  The defence can promote a trump trick with three rounds of hearts|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: Holland 2@H tends to deny 4-card support|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|nigel_k:  If South leads a low heart declarer can pitch a club loser|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But if this is ruffed and overruffed, declarer can draw trumps but only has nine tricks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer has three losing clubs and a losing heart and only three discards on the diamonds as they break 5-2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: reverse the dummy, no losing H and 1 club?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think he has to lose one trump no matter what he does on this trick|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry folks -- just noticed we had 3 commentators in the other room and none here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  it was Invitational, but could be passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  But I'm not sure that Qxx of spades in North was less likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Reid-Jacob bid 6@D on  1  so that will be 10 for Noble|pg||
nt|jbgood: so it was N who didnt think his cards were good enough(?)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 1@H only promises 4|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right Jon -- the @H fillers and ruffing value were good, but unclear about value of minor suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems 3|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 3@D would have been a reasonable hedge instead of 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  South has an opening bid regardless but maybe North would have acted over the double with a better hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: we're a small group here -- if there's anything special you'd like to discuss, just holler|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Probably not though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 imps down but nearly a good plus|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: Hirst still leads other match after 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but far from automatic|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@d - if not showing 6 @ds.. still think 4@h a good shot with a small xx in spades and good reds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the flip-side  Brunner's 3@C seems aggressive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as does 4@S|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Specs are suggesting Lebensohl, but even with Lebensohl, a 3@C bid is merely constructive ... not consistent with North's monster|pg||

nt|bjacobs: But you have to think it through over the multi|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North perhaps couldn't think of a forcing bid, but there is one ... it is 3@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North should either have bid 3@D or 3NT (probably he cannot pass 2@D doubled, because West's pass probably showed diamonds)|pg||
