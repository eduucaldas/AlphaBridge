nt|mcarroll: It helps if your agreement is that the anchor suit has to have a decent honour structure - unlike some Jxxxxx I have seen opened|pg||

nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 to start out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry having trouble finding the right boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Sorry about that, have the right boards now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1NT expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: The profile for our excellent viewgraph operator gives Denis Dobrin from Russia|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A quiet pass by E, would have a reasonable 1NT rebid after opening 1 of a minor.  Meanwhile, choice of openings perhaps for S, either @S or NT.  Likely @S with a small side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: doubleton.  Some like to have three of the other major to open 1NT with a five-card major; the thinking is that they can still land in the better fit if pd has five of the other ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: major.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also conceivable some E could 1@D and rebid 2@C over 1@S but that seems a bit much.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: contract is |pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is nasty--NS likely to make nine tricks on a spade lead--4@S a phantom |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have been led up the garden path again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry had to get a mouse will get contract in a min|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sounds like the contract may be 3@S - obv not on a 3@S opening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: think it is|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S will fail by one or two and EW will post the plus on this 20-20 hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: shame I've never been to russia!|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry have lost the bidding though|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its OK final contract 2@S |pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
nt|garnetts: straight in and North probably should double --minimum and not wanting to bid 5@H |pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close run thing though...|pg||
nt|garnetts: when a spade is led it will pay south to duck |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: director has been called|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 2@D showed 5@S and 4@H according to the system|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the famous words of Barry Crane, "God dealt you A-K so you wouldn't have a lead problem."|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here no other choice.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: ...but 6 spades may be tricky|pg||
nt|idc: we'll try to get you names as we can - starts of matches are often rushed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..it looks to have handling probs, but the diamond ace is right..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psridhar: when they bid slam on long suits it is often a 'tempo' game, so u make attacking leads|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is a no play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: the contract is really 6C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not surprised-W suggested 6C enroute to 6N ...and E imagined his pd has a 5 bagger-lack of unnderstdg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, hoped the original @C wasn't short, alas it was|pg||
nt|garnetts: You might make 4@H double dummy --more likely going at least one off|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wilkinsona: ..and certainly dont want to ship any defensive tricks here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North must have opened surely|pg||

mb|d|nt|garnetts: If that is 14-16 OK---not in my view if it is 12-14 |pg||

nt|idc: You can get other info from the event site at:  http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/|pg||
mb|r|nt|cuttysark:  Connection problems here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes I suppose its asking a lot to read the stiif ace|pg||
nt|dagold: slam surprisingly reasonable too with only 29 and 1-5 card suit. No waistage I guess|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kiwibridge: Sri Lanka have just tossed a wicket to Canada by contriving a run out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  easy for us :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard high card vaues and a decent suit make 1@H look better |pg||
nt|garnetts: yes the 10@C offers a slight extra chance too |pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks, Denis|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do we like 3@C?  |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Similar trump suit to the previous board|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Do you agree with pass ?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no, but seems to work this time|pg||
nt|dagold: A little suprised as Noramn is usually very sharp in these type of situations|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: this will end the auction|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that 2 heart bid ... well north is between bids, a hand often seen|pg||
nt|garnetts: my thoughts entirely |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I like to raise partner - keeps them sweet|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: just making|pg||
nt|psridhar: all cards lying badly for declarer|pg||
nt|dagold: not saying double was clear by any means but it is his style|pg||
nt|idc: An example of the Welsh pair's system - 1NT in 3rd seat 15-17, 12-14 otherwise|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona: this may be a good slam.... to stay out of|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, cruel if N-S bid it given the way the morning has started, so I'm rooting for them to stop in 5@s|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double game swing board 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 2@H should carry preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: With a spade & club to lose, declarer may well take two heart finesses and go down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: personally i dont think it is obvious for N to seek 4H. one alternative would be 1N-3N. a compromise would be to bid 4S if S shows spades, and bid 3N otherwise|pg||
nt|idc: A club lead from West may have helped South avoid a loser in that suit, so this @d instead is better for the defence|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure...i think S can organize the play to put the defense in a bad spot|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, West may have problems finding a safe lead later|pg||
nt|chilloncan: exactly|pg||
nt|idc: say declarer wins in hand, @d to dummy & takes a @h finesse - tough for West|pg||
nt|chilloncan: normal play is to let the D ride around and then force out spade ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are several options both early and late but i think S should eventually prevail|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, if the club finesse wins later on, he'll be looking to set up a pitch for the 3rd club, so avoiding a loser there|pg||
nt|idc: He doesn't know that the @c finesse won't win of course|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: but @s break shd help|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In spite of slamy suggestions from a spec, WBU settle for game|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT for the black suits here - would not be everyone's choice but reasonable and has N shown this @D holding? |pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h was going to make|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|idc: that will do also!|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  Indeed it should - my partners igore my signals also|pg||
pc|c9|nt|spil: probably drifting 1 off|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dagold: so this is a good save |pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: I am quite suprised Norman let that go--he wouldn't at money bridge.  4@S is a daft bid ---partner can double again then bid it |pg||
nt|dagold: would have been 800 if doubled|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|spil: perhaps 2...but 3@C was likely to make so no disaster|pg||
nt|idc: not a bad line for declarer, but it had the side effect of leavign West an easy exit in @d|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|idc: Apropos of nothing, I noticed an advert for Ryanair in yesterday's newspaper which I liked|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am suprised that he dropped the Q@H offside on board 1--admtitedly the lead was not best|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  something wrong with flags or names here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Goodman -Thomas are Wales not WBU and defintely not Irish|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|nt|cuttysark:  Still having connection problems - this looks a very tricky gamw|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|idc: and now he has an exit in @s|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dagold: that is why I like 1@s to show 5|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North has stoppers in both minors|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  at the moment the WBU are 28 up against England|pg||

nt|garnetts: looks like a quick two off  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: quick?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think X = @c + @h|pg||
mb|5C|nt|psridhar: without that opening EW may well have overshot to slam and gone down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: my thoughts also|pg||
nt|psridhar: With E undervaluing his @s queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Julian, it seems that it is the player names that are wrong - the right names for Irelad/WBU are in the Open room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Operator probably has not had time to set up here|pg||
nt|idc: 1 & 2 flat, 3 IMPs to N.I. on Bd 3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is dangerous but i like 3H better than 2H, esp if NS are playing support doubles. 3H puts the pressure on and increases chances of scoring a black queen (or two)) on defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: I see Murdoch/Spears also got to the bad 6@h on Bd 4, so a flat board in one down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it appears that the usual connection prob have scuppered the comparisons|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S playing any system is obligatory |pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland also went down in 6 hearts on 4, a contract off on the diamond hook|pg||
nt|dburn: might raise to a bit more than 2@h, mind|pg||
nt|lestergold: he seems to have made a name for himself already in the bridge world not only for playing bit for other services towards the game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South had too little and the wrong shape to reopen with a X|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|dburn: still, no one is going to bid a sla,|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, even playing 4-card heart as they do|pg||
nt|dburn: or even a slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree David--we have a problem with three Davids here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: no biddingt sequence here|pg||
nt|lestergold: however normal contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: was putting in scores|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a @d lead would have been more succesful|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: I am told that Bell hails from Reading School which was also the alma mater for my son David|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idc: At this early stage in the Round 2 matches, England are 11 up on N.I., and Wales down by similar amount to the Republic|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 1 diamond must be hearts|pg||
nt|idc: so very tight at the top|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Aggressive opening bids sometimes backfire when partner has a fair hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@s was hasty too. I play it as a bit weaker than that. Cuebidding then 4@s to show a real hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: transfer responces, it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: Next year they should hold it in North Korea bound to be better internet :) |pg||
nt|jcwla: W declining to show @D's right away without extras, now 3NT showing the @D values if not the length.  A quiet pass by E but recognizing the lack of a great fit.|pg||
nt|idc: In the other matches Scotland 1 up v Ireland,  WBU 6 up v England|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure about that 4S call. couldnt E have been angling for 3N? admittedly after the double W doesnt want to bid 3N, but he could bid 3H or else pass, whichever sequence would ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: show heart concentration|pg||
nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  reverse count|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South may yet be getting a @d ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark:  Score currently 21-2: Scotland took the weak"@H on board 3 3 down; but then played 2@H -4 when Walker made 3@C|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well with all the computers & laptops pluged into the hotel system it bound to crash|pg||
nt|garnetts: That seems a mighty odd lead holding AQ stiff in hearts --but nothing looks great |pg||
nt|jcwla: If they bid and make slam against you here, not your day.|pg||
nt|idc: The old fashioned way was that with only 4 spades, East had to make a try with 2NT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: this can make if decl playes trumps for one loser-what is the % play here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: running the @c jack works when W has KQX|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cashing A is 1 loser also|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ace works when E has stiff K / Q-other combos , both work / or dont|pg||
nt|dagold: for me 4@s is 6 spades and a semi punt typically|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: misscore on board 3 was altered|pg||
nt|idc: and all new suits confirmed 5+ spades|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|wilkinsona: ...this time there seems to be 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  might North redbl to secure a diamond lead? |pg||
nt|garnetts: yes--a lazy bid |pg||
nt|idc: That was a bit cumbersome, so there are conventions around these days where East can make enquiries about the West hand|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|h6|nt|dburn: still, slam might not make if East-West do not give away too much in the bidding|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|idc: no solution wll work 100% of the time mind you|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  low @s may tempt a finesse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psridhar: KQX is 2 combos, k/q stiff also 2 combos..|pg||
nt|idc: Only 3 obvious losers for East but hard to see a 10th trick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: nice wd|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: not much to choose from|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|idc: the fact that SOuth would be overruffing hearts will kill a crossruff line, which may be best try|pg||

nt|idc: Has SOuth got @sQ stuck behind the 6?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he was correct to duck the first round|pg||
nt|idc: meant that as a joke but these things do happen|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|garnetts: It was a pretty awful overcall --|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: this is a dull hand not going to produce any swing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec says difficult club switch was needed|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Declarer going well|pg||

nt|garnetts: so it seems |pg||

nt|garnetts: its just too tempting isn't it |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: it's getting too hard now|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: cards lying well for 4@h here|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Scotland have gained an overtrick imp to make the score 21-3|pg||
nt|dagold: Wales have picked up 10 more on boards 5 and 6|pg||
nt|idc: 2@c is any single suited overcall|pg||
nt|chilloncan: both 3N and 4S have chances|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the Wales EW bid an optimistic 3NT on 5 to flatten that board|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland down in 6 spades on 5 OR|pg||
nt|chilloncan: better from E side|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: North has a chance of shutting out the clubs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wilkinsona: well, I doubted the Denis myself, but thats what it says, perhaps you can clarify|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not see why you say that|pg||
nt|lestergold: although in 3N the @ds only provide 2 trciks against best defence, the other suits can provide the other 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Conservative 3@H   ---I know I will risk sounding boring--Kokish said many years ago when you have five card support for partner bid game |pg||
nt|dagold: England played the wrong partscore on 6 after intervention from Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought he would pass--but these days 1@C is often short --so TOD of 1H |pg||
nt|dagold: EW can make 3@s so 4@h may be bid as a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: should get to game now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  close whether to bid @s or NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Bergen Raise?|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: never worked for me, dropped in favour of mini splinters|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as we expected, points to WBU|pg||
nt|spil: another 6 imps for Scotland when they made 3@D here and also 3@S in Open room...|pg||
nt|jcwla: The W hand worth significantly less than on its face: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Q92+J84+AK8+KQ32 |pg||
pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: and thats a well judged bid by west|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N, the likely contract, may well go down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  facing a passed hand South takes the cauitios view|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: well i think 3N will be found|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dagold: Espen trying to show best possible passed hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club lead likely|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dagold: I suppose he has it. Or maybe he could have a void heart for a 10/10|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dagold: this makes the defence easy|pg||
nt|garnetts: lets hope Espen doesn't cash his partner's K@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wilkinsona: North should bid 4 here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again WBU in a contract that gives the defenders a chance|pg||
nt|garnetts: I didn't think Conservatives were popular in Scotland |pg||
nt|dagold: Why would he?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: on second thoughts you may be rIGHT|pg||
nt|idc: this would be no problem without the bad spade break|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: his hand surely a max for not finding a neg double|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but west needs to play low..|pg||
nt|henryb:  the defense would seem to have 2@h, 2 Aces, and either a @s or a second @d trick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if NS lead 3/5, the 2D call -- which was sort of pointless in my view, as you know they can outbid you -- may give the show away in spades if E plays along discovery lines|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: yup, good auction from N-S|pg||

nt|lestergold: altho may go off evenc without heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  and very possible if played by West, as N really cant hope to get his club suit going|pg||
nt|idc: the @c5 may be revealing - lowest so if not singleton, South has length|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the @C won 6 imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chilloncan: has 3 to be precise|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idc: South might have gone to 4@h himself over 2@h but 3@h was fine|pg||
nt|idc: It's a 3 1/2 @h bid really, but so few bidding boxes have that card in them :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Ace needed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: yes heart switch is good enuf of course because declarer has too many cards to knowck out|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Scotland had lots of luck on board 21 - they made 3@D in one room and 3@S in the other: both contracts can be beaten|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: S wont have five on this auction or defense|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: actually has to establish tricks in 4 suits none of which run|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: I see Bd 6, the favourable vul sac here, was flat, but huge 15 IMP gain for Wales on Bd 7|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  They think they are making a comeback (Conservaties, not the Scottish Bridge Team)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|psridhar: swingy bd alright|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of times now N has not pushed the level early in the auction - either matter of system or style.|pg||

nt|garnetts: 2NT to show garbage |pg||
nt|dagold: I don't like that as he only has 1 place to play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psridhar: this is about to go D1|pg||
nt|psridhar: now was 4@s making?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  2@C has several meanings, and 2N showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|psridhar: couple of guesses involved in 4@s..|pg||
nt|psridhar: but favoourite to make -once the @h ace is seen with W, the opener shd hv @c ace, so 4@s rates to make|pg||
nt|dagold: partner has to have 4 hearts|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|psridhar: hence we hv to assess this 5@d as a good save by the leaders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: accurate defense required to secure 500 |pg||

pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: well, I had though the auction over|pg||
nt|dagold: for me this sequence shows a good 3@h bid|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Bit of a lunge by East|pg||
nt|dagold: but perhaps it was lebensohl for them|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has shown values with the doubel so leaves it to partner |pg||
nt|dagold: it really shouldn't be leb here|pg||

nt|dburn: indeed - 3@s would likely have made had anyone bid it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: each of the last 3 boards could be a swing|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: very long indeed and thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec suggest 4 spades was a slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: last 3 bds here|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  A frozen moment in time|pg||
nt|garnetts: a weak two with two aces --a hanging offence |pg||
nt|chilloncan: and 2 of them to NI|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wilkinsona: if so somewhat optomistic|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@s a make or 4@c|pg||
nt|dagold: some play 4@c as clubs and spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks to me that East will make 3N although "Deep Finesse" would not think so|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  WBU are 31 up against England|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Murdoch got @c suit wrong on Bd 6, so -3 in 3NT instead of making, more IMPs to WBU|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well NS may sac in 5 clubs now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so Engalnd have about 9 boards in which to pick up neraly 60 IMPs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: very close -and interesting 4@h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we do thank Chen our great operator and the CTCBA for bring you this broadcast|pg||
nt|psridhar: a play or defense problem -classical|pg||
nt|dagold: good stop|pg||
nt|idc: Will be interesting to see if West accepts the later invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: as 4@s down on club lead|pg||
nt|dagold: can still be beaten|pg||
nt|dagold: needs to get two ruffs|pg||
nt|idc: only a minimum 15 but what a 15 count|pg||
nt|chilloncan: automatic to do so i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: undo|pg||
nt|dagold: one with a diamond entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: pre empt in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: so theory is, one of the players forgot the system|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2@c shows @d, and S leads a @d, then maybe they will beat 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: sI cam  see hazards here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: Padman thanks for your great commentary|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I dont go along with norths bid Im afraid, with a double fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with you Tony--cramp them for space--get them at the five level |pg||
nt|dagold: one with a heart underlead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks like a maximum|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the Welsh are hoping for some nice flat 1NT contracts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: if declarer guesses trumps he can make with a throw in on N|pg||
nt|psridhar: Thanks Gary , you have been very educative too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a great pleasure being with you and thanks all our great spectators for your feedback |pg||
nt|psridhar: first he shd ruff a club -as a matter of technique, here it is essential too|pg||
nt|psridhar: after @c ruff, run @h jack, @h to king, @s to king, run trumps for the throw in = is the double dummy line, can it work ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6 @h tricks + 2 @s tricks +1 @c =9 and the throw in for 10th =yes double dummy line works|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 @cs 2 @hs 2 @ds and 2@s doesnt add to 9|pg||
nt|idc: 5-card suit, good intermediates|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 4-0 trump break is only a mild irritation here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chilloncan: amazing, wd|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|idc: That was 5-card Stayman, so 2@h was continuing the search for a fit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: more likely route to NT partial would be 1N all pass|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, I might pass that East hand - at matchpoints for sure, at teams it is close|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Ire 161; Eng 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: south has bid 2 suits, you have support, "raise"|pg||
nt|henryb:  Operator, could you see what 2@c meant?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: yes @D,s|pg||
nt|idc: well, porobably would pass at teams|pg||
nt|idc: wouldn't i meant|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NV|pg||
nt|idc: I used to pass but these days I'm a paper tiger|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the thing is, you are so barren outside of hearts that even if you find a heart fit you probably do not have game|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: yes, and points outside hearts are 2 Jacks, not brialliant|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: it went down other tbl...:)|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: J.Chung has been spot-on thus far..|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the lead of the spade 10 may have givin away the position in a key suit....|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: does anyone know where the scores can be seen?  |pg||
pc|c8|nt|chilloncan: you have 9 LTC and opener will have 6-7, hence IF you have a fit you still dont rate tpo have a game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  North will be in deep trouble, and declarer can guess the spades, Mike|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has done|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: the problem in runnning the @h jack is N made a TAKE-OUT double of 1@h|pg||
nt|dagold: link through the ebu website|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should be an overtrick now|pg||
mc|11|nt|psridhar: so, declarer's misguess is reasonable|pg||
nt|spil: 3@H going 1 off and NS making 3@D exactly so not much in it|pg||

nt|spil: not too many swings about so far|pg||
nt|henryb:  South did not listen and lead a @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|chilloncan: they will gain IMPs on 6, but not because they played a partial:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: tbf they are playing a strong club system so 1D 1S 2S is a weak way to raise 1S to 2S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  23 was costly for Wales as expected|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|jcwla: A very light game could come home here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland also made the close game on 24|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am SOOOOOO sorry Ian, i thought you said board SIX, my bad|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Daniel, a good point|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Wales need only 1 more IMP at the moment to move into 24-6 territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: bad heart break for NS here|pg||
nt|idc: I think N-S play 1M - 2M as a sound, full value raise to two (maybe 7-9 or so), hence the alert last hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  Deep Finesse, a double dummy analyst, would assume a @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  huge fit each way|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4Nt any two suits?|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: yep, common American style|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks, denis|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i mixed up your 6 & 8:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  One hurdle jumped - several to go :)|pg||
nt|spil: yes but perhaps unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  treating as 3 suited|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h ruff defeats 6@c|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: actually i often wonder why people so often do not lead their partner's suit especially whene a heart lead here was more or less guaranteed to give a trick|pg||
mb|5S|nt|cuttysark:   murdoch is resting|pg||
nt|garnetts: did they just put a ringer in--Walker is now back |pg||
nt|garnetts: Thanks a lot folks--I have to go shortly--been interesting    |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Walker avoids a give away double|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: you were right David|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N has a problem due to the diamond blocakge. Declarer may need to run the T on the first round|pg||
nt|dagold: then he will have to guess the clubs|pg||
nt|dagold: could be interesting|pg||
mb|6C|nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: bye for now |pg||
nt|henryb:  why? couldn't partner have the @hQ instead of the @sK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: could do but my partners never do they alwayswin these post moprtems when i dont lead their suit|pg||
nt|idc: A strong club pair are limited to about 15 when they open 1@d, so can freely distinguish between 14/15 maximums and bad 11-13 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Declarer can still pick up the trumps, and I'm not sure leading @d would help the defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  and rightly so|pg||
nt|chilloncan: confess that at these colours i would surely open 1S as E in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|idc: The hands are both pretty flat and don't mesh tpogether very well, so plenty of potential losers in 4@h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well one of them has just vanished|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: East allowed to play 2 hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: if declarer plays the Q@d the suit is blocked if Espen takes the first one|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: that 3@h was unwarranted in my opinion|pg||
nt|psridhar: Liu made a take out X, his pd passed 2@s he had no reason to overrule that|pg||
nt|idc: on a bad day you could lose 3@d, a @c and a @s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E had tough lead. can make a case for eevery suit. perhaps when that is so, trump is best idea|pg||
nt|idc: now draw trumps and ... perhaps try to set up a @c for a @d pitch|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the idea is this: should i lead a trump or not? if i don't i have to decide which sidesuit to lead and i will only be right about once in three times. if it is right toi lead a ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: trump and i do so i am right all of those times|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I must admit I would just bid 3NT on the South tickets |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Agreed - the 5-3 fit is not always best|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep. but 4 hearts ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: while the opps chalk up the imps...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  actually the ruff might not beat 6@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has to bid on when South does not X 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@c might make after all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West has doubled for a ruff as expected|pg||
pc|s3|nt|spil: Natural lead but not slaying declarer, as they say :)|pg||
nt|dagold: not now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East has not read it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark:  I take it you would have competed, Alex?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: yes, good play by South|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: Surprising stop - hard to judge in the bidding that it will make exactly 9 tricks and not go for 500.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: but it is only 5 imps to the Yeh cause, with a large deficit now|pg||
nt|henryb:  and they never say nice lead when you don't and you turn out to be right|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wilkinsona: sorry good play by North i meant|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dagold: but Norman figured count was paramount I guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: they say lucky lead but u shoudl have led my suit....|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ultimately the odds are about even, but if i lead a trump and it is wrong there is far less rue...i still would have had to guess right. so the trump is better for psychological ...|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well done|pg||
nt|idc: Sensible - they have about 30 mins for 4 boards, not terrible but worth getting on with it|pg||
nt|dagold: good result for Wales|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually on that hand the @d lead was especially marked because south also held likely double stop in clubs sp he kn ew declarer was likely tobe under pressure|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|spil: perhaps a trump lead might have rendered the play a little more tricky (in 4) |pg||
nt|lestergold: in close no trump contracts moral is to let declarr do his own work lead safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: may be an overtrick imp to Wei|pg||

nt|garnetts: obvious 4@S --likely 11 tricks |pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|idc: a 1@s response is fewer spades, kind of like a normal focring NT hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wilkinsona: this looks a well judged contact by NS|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, though playing normal methods I'd expect 1@h - 1@s - 2@s  - that North hand is fine to raise with|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark:  Must be tempting for West to move on|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, I hate to say it, but that North hand looks like a stong NT to me|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: wait a minute it can|pg||
nt|idc: I used to play with a much older player, though still a very good one, you usually said..|pg||
nt|idc: when his partner led a trump, "do you have a licence to do that partner?"|pg||
nt|idc: You quickly learned only to do it when right (i like to pretend I did at least)|pg||
nt|idc: West doubling to suggest a lead of dummy's first bif suit|pg||
nt|idc: He's half right - it's a good lead for the defence but sadly 3NT will make anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: ..so relieved to here 4 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry cant discard two losers on one long @d|pg||
nt|idc: because declarer is likely to be taking a @c finesse into the danger East hand, he won't want to rise with @sA at trick one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: I wondered if West might consider a switch to a low @h at trick 2, but North's bidding should incline him to an honour|pg||
nt|idc: since North will be short in majors|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho isnt soth endplayable?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: Like the q@H now and then the ace of trumps --that should ensure enough tricks|pg||
nt|idc: Scary hand for Gary Jones to play, but no realistic alternative to @c finesse I think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|spil: well if W goes slamming the @H is winning (Hurray) ... but the trumps are disappointing (:()|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psridhar: we can see all cards-win ace, king and jack of @h =11 tricks, but that is double dummy. more normal is to take the failing @h finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  South about to be disappointed when his ace is ruffed|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales are now just 2 IMPs away from 25-5|pg||

nt|garnetts: but it is foolproof  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|spil: so Goldilocks contract...not too much...not too little...just right|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|psridhar: trciky play but ace and 10 of @s hiding the queen has small chance of success, but this shd not win |pg||

nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||

nt|idc: not to mention a possible overtrick!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|spil: in other room south opened so hard for them to miss, but should get to it here too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Back - and I'm sure Scotland will have no trouble matching the contract.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  26 HCP should reach game|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wilkinsona: north finds the double...|pg||
nt|idc: Swings in both directions on Bds 9-12, but Welsh lead beginning to grow to decent size|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: surprised south didnt bid 4 spades... will it work?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I think 4@H is -1|pg||
nt|henryb:  takes a @c lead to beat 6@s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|idc: A potential gain for Wales here - 6@c doesn't need a commentator to point out its flaws|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: South too strong for 1NT but CC suggests a 1@d opening is possible with their methods|pg||
nt|dagold: I play this double as t/o |pg||
nt|idc: so I won't|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: identical auctions in both rooms to end a marathon like match a loong one|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry for truancy, problem in kitchen|pg||
nt|wendle: As it stands (unofficial) Wales 164; England 160; Ireland 158; Scotland 156; WBU 152; NI 108. Next update at start of Stanza 2|pg||
nt|idc: The 2@c raise was inverted, promising 10+ points|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: with trumps 3-3 this shd make in comfort|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Needs to finesse diamonds - would you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will not be too excited about his @d hloding opp tyhe spliter|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: spec says JM has to play this very well|pg||
nt|dagold: and give up on the high card double|pg||
nt|dburn: takeout of what?|pg||
nt|dagold: higher ranking suits|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 4432|pg||
nt|lestergold: calls for an attack in the unbid suit indeed he has|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this holds it to 4 only|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: This is now foolproof too |pg||
nt|dagold: or 4315|pg||
nt|dagold: 4405 |pg||
nt|dagold: major oreintated|pg||
nt|dagold: 4414|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East should have bid more in my view|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  England are closing the gap on the WBU but only slightly|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|cuttysark:  The Scottish west also led a heart. Yeugh!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 12 tricks is a lot though|pg||
nt|dagold: 1h-1n-p-p- double=spades|pg||
nt|chilloncan: curious that S did not pass the double at these colors|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dagold: higher ranking suits being the emphasis|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  N expects short @h in dummy, hence the trump lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: thx and bye all |pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  I do not like splintering with three small in the side suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|spil: not sure why N didn't bid 4@D|pg||
nt|dagold: the strong balanced hand is rare and partner tends to be broke|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think yhere was clearcut |pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: South settles for 3NT, though perhaps 2 sdades doubled occured to him...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not N's finest hour here and 11 big ones to Wales.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|cuttysark:  he did not find the spade switch either - might put delclarer off the heart finessse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark:  Has been pointed out that ducking a heart will get a complete picture of the distribution|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Or maybe not quite complete, but a clear indication to finesse|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d6|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|dburn: good idea - mind you, when you have opened what might be a two-card suit, you could also play double as "I really have clubs"|pg||

nt|henryb:  slow going at the other table|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S ought to have been thinking that if W had heart queen 3N could easily fail, and if H queen is with E then that increases size of penalty |pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: so thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@C can make --but very agressive |pg||
nt|dagold: probably the same auction here|pg||
nt|idc: And when South didn't pass the dbl at those colours, perhaps North could have read him for unblanced hand, and corrected to safer 5@c|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona: last hand for now, but play in this close match continues after a short break|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chilloncan: good idea but i prefer 4C, keeping slam in the picture|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: nobody bidding clubs yet|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NI have a good result to come on 32|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I do not like 2@H--prefer 3@C by a lot |pg||
nt|dagold: same result likely |pg||
mb|d|nt|spil: seems to have made the wrong response if asking in @C ... but moving sharply along :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@C a cuebid for @H's - not a new place for us to play after N has opened 2@C and shown primary @H's.|pg||
nt|dburn: fortunately for the defenders, South's diamonds are better than his clubs|pg||
nt|idc: E-W mounting quite a barrage here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks to our operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: sorry board 16 too, Im a bit early|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, consevative 2 spade bid works for WBU|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems you can start with a double|pg||
nt|garnetts: if North leads a heart this will not make |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  But then you might lose a major suit  fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like double either strikes me that 3@C and then 4@H if thats what I need to bid get this hand over |pg||
nt|spil: absolutely...3@S may be natural but the 4 level should be a cue|pg||
nt|dagold: Wales need to get this right|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, rather random|pg||
nt|chilloncan: at these colours there is much to be said for a 4D overcall instead of 3D. that totally obliterates their bidding space and they may easily miss a slam|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS finding @s fit now|pg||
mb|p|nt|wendle: open room of match 5c will remain open to announce official result (also on www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: the inevitable|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  how about @SK lead :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it gets the hand over|pg||
nt|garnetts: that works too and so does a club |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  So 6 cards beat it and 7 let it make |pg||
nt|garnetts: anything but a Johannisburg sparkler |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  curious decision to leave in X|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psridhar: weak NT opg is popular inn this part of the world|pg||

pc|d3|nt|lestergold: 3N no problem but 4@s may not be so easy|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Byrne must have been warned here that the support wasonly 3 cards|pg||
nt|idc: should be -3 though, so no big gain for Irish|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could be 3 off with perfect defence|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: leads wrong major a chance|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chilloncan: well, it is a barrage of sorts, but i think 4D is the pressure call|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idc: This reminds me of Board 5 - slam is a good contract, cards lie badly, and WBU avoid it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: as confession time, I am afraid I would have found the 3 spade  bid Sime did in the or|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: interesting hedre that south had a choice of leading frm either unbid suit and here the lead from the K may not have been optimal|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d ruff coming|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psridhar: will take @C finesse and go 2 off|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: and this hand looks like being a big result for WBU|pg||
nt|idc: Given East found an agressive raise to 5 level (which I like) maybe West worried that he go too high after a 4@d preempt by him|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: lead from unsupported homoyrs in general from K i think is the riskiest of all|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was a good trade her a @d loser being riffed from the long truimp holding|pg||

pc|c2|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to have to break the @h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: stiff ace in NT contracts is not as valuable as other aces are-cannot hold up ! here if only declarer could have held up @h 2 rounds...|pg||

pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe, but 5D is the normal level to raise a preempt to. it takes out 4N and leaves 5 lvel open to opps, so it is the perfect plateau|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|idc: A good comeback from WBU after they were 24-0 down early in the set|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a bid of interest from south|pg||
nt|idc: this is only approaching the half-way point of course, 2nd half begins in 30 mins|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  not sure i like east's double - more than half his points in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also like a bid here like 1NT  to get things stirred up--been known to try 2@H too |pg||
nt|henryb:  would you respond to 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: That's when it's time to crawl back in bed and pull the covers up - or if you're Ireland go straight to Monte Carlo.|pg||
nt|dburn: that won't happen on this bidding - if North leads a club, of course|pg||
nt|dagold: the 3@d bid is likely to make the defence easy if Goodman leads a club|pg||
nt|chilloncan: great result for wales vs endgland|pg||
nt|chilloncan: england LOL|pg||
nt|chilloncan: freudian slip?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona: If this is a single suited major, trouble on its way..|pg||
nt|idc: IMHO, the 2@d bid shows 2 things:|pg||
nt|idc: spades and another suit|pg||
nt|idc: and that South has forgotten they aren't playing matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if they can get to 3 clubs, not so bad..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the vulnerability is favourable but I still don't like the overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, this is the last board here.  Big thanks to Denis, to BBO's great and tireless Roland Wald, and to Stephen Peterkin and Liz McGowan.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: So thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double stirred thing up too it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: dbl is a poor bid might as well pass or bid 1NT --if you must|pg||
nt|idc: I love it!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|idc: I guess 3@c is -3 probably?   as long as the defence lead trumps to prevent 2 spade ruffs in North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and to specs for their comments|pg||
nt|spil: I guess trump promotion available here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: My thanks also to Michael Rosenberg for his analytic comments (and corrections), much appreciated.|pg||
nt|spil: A@S K@S A@C and spade through to give W a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When South removes the dbl of 2@d to 2@s, North knows the second suit is clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4 card drury i suppose|pg||
nt|idc: Start a new craze - how about Germ many|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: might just be an UCB?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kiwibridge: N having bid his hand bids again|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H is not my idea of a bid on Jxxx--why not 5@D  --perhaps he plays the cards better |pg||
nt|dburn: and after 4@h, I guess he might lead one|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h may have been 'last train'|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yep. may have though 5 diamonds as encouraging|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  May have thought it was the least encouraging noise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  now has to take a good view in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
nt|dagold: so this should go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think so because on most rebids i can bidm clubs to play and i do not mind 2 spades contract as i have ruffing vlaue and bullet|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes sorry didnt see the opening bod, too busy thinking up puns|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT down 3 by Wales in Open room not good, but looks like 10 tricks there in @s for N-S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chilloncan: another freudian slip|pg||
nt|idc: not that will get to game of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hope you will be with us later.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be more afraid of partner's strong rebids propelling us too high than his weak rebids|pg||
nt|lestergold: weid also be afraid of missing a game when pard has a maxi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will need @S lead + ruff to beat 6@c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'd be afraid of getting much too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: id also be reluctasnt to let oppd find ared suit comntract as well|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
nt|garnetts: haven't got a lot of sympathy --there are two entries vai a club ruff|pg||
nt|chilloncan: most would double initially with N hand i think|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he gets off play with a diamond--should  east get the hearts right?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades beats it if hook is on|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Well he could hardly lead a spade away from his ace...|pg||
nt|garnetts: It depends if East thinks North knows the heart position|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|psridhar: need to tap E hand off a trump now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean Liz--he could cash the ace of spades and ace of clubs if South had Qxx|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think the club intermnediates swing the balance for me its not likely to be a disaster p-laying as high level club contract|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|dagold: Wales have played very well in this set|pg||
nt|dagold: only 1 error|pg||
nt|dagold: in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: in letting through 4@h|pg||
nt|dagold: England have their work cut out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks all - see you shortly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idc: Now the dummy (with singleton spade) and declarer's line, are also screaming "trump lead"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence going well, back to trumps now..|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  i understand, but it is ever so obvious to declarer|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|psridhar: a @h ruff was needed|pg||
nt|psridhar: now may be 2 late|pg||
mc|12|pg||
