nt|yo_yo: chance for an England gain here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  scotland more likely|pg||
nt|idc: Roland, if you stop bidding so much and ending up doubled, you'll get more practise leading|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: oh dear yes|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|an|alert|nt|dburn: not likely to end in 3NT now, at least|pg||
nt|idc: This was the first board in other room, and our Operator wasn't able to fill in details of bidding or play|pg||
nt|Walddk6: That spade stopper is a tad shaky opposite a void|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: unless Short decides to bid it now, I suppose, but...|pg||
nt|idc: But 3NT wasn't the best spot for N-S; any number of clubs up to 6 is better|pg||
nt|idc: and 6@c is better in isolation than 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose he might even be contemplating defending 3@s doubled|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Well, England's only hope is that the Scots bid 6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or maybe 3@s doubled|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am sure south will bid on now|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - Scotland will gain now, just a question of how many|pg||
nt|yo_yo: south will hardly bid slam now but it's tempting|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Maybe 4@S now|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am sure you would just bid slam at the table Roland|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but this would be a good slam for you|pg||
nt|Walddk6: No, new strategy as of March 2011. I only bid the slams that make|pg||
nt|idc: that 4@s seems clear, and North now has extras for his 4@c action|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I claim no copyright|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Add it to your CC if you like|pg||
nt|idc: he may not consider them sufficient for 6@c, but it is close|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  well i would describe 6@c as imaginative with his red suit holdings|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how could short imagine a slam would make?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pitiful:  4N would be enough for me|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he has one trick and no ruffing values|pg||
nt|idc: well, @h finesse would do it most days|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Could Walker also have @HQ and not open 2@C I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk6: hardly|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if you think 4N should be blackwood i suggest you are forced to play a duplicate with Roland|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|idc: If my @hT was @hQ, I think I'd open 1@c - too likely to get preempted|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|pc|c4|nt|pitiful:  a lucky escape for England|pg||

nt|dburn: is he really playing it like this?|pg||
nt|idc: But having said all that, I'd really like to have a red Q instead of just the @hJ for the jump to slam|pg||

nt|dburn: if so, that's a pretty lucky escape for Scotland - why did he not take the heart finesse?|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: I missed a trick but those were his cards when i caught up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|yo_yo: one of 2 finesses here for slam|pg||
nt|pitiful:  good spot in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|Negative|mb|p|mb|2N|an|25+|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: It's a little better than one of two finesses, too good for me|pg||
mb|3H!|an|!Ss|nt|dburn: forthright bidding by West at the other table, but practical enough|pg||
nt|idc: Tosh has quite reasonably suggested that North needed two out of @hQ, @dK, @cK, and with that holding North should bid 5@c earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|an|xfer Break|mb|p|nt|idc: which would make 4@s the overbid - he has almost convinced me|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not me|pg||
mb|4D!|an|Cue|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  he had a bid below 5@c to show slam interest|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Some play 4@H as retransfer when lopener breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk6: opener even|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT  is the interesting bid|pg||
nt|idc: does wrongsiding this matter, as they both did?  Probably not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: They play Kokish, modified somewhat|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
nt|lestergold: Engel refused to be sunject to indignity of endplay!|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello all!|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back everyone .. i guess we've missed 17 as the connection settled down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  South doubles to show that he had a very good 2NT bid, North has nowhere to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Evening|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Ns time?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: no matter, E saved them|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts we assume|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mmm interesting|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S always need to have a semi inside.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hi all|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime has an absolute HIROSHIMA!|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Potential loss for England on board 17|pg||
nt|steshome:  Sad to say|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S on    difficult to reach|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: therer isa lot of thism about these days|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not start with a high heart?|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Can be difficult to get across hands with thatmany HCP|pg||
nt|galadriel: good shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: seems u were dealt that to lead but as it happens 2 off whatever|pg||
nt|paulg:  Most of the cards are marked for Matheson, so he will be planning how to endplay South to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|the saint: That is one way. Was 2NT in that sequence 25+ or a specific range?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|steshome:  Ah A downside of Kokish|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||
nt|jcomyn: honestrly i dont see the point|pg||
nt|lestergold: often tho achieves right siding contracts|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi mike and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ruud|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i know about right siding but why not protect the Ck and those queens|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well i wasnt referring to this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards for all pairs are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|steshome:  South is Norman Selway btw|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|paulg:  and East is John Matheson|pg||
nt|ady: good slam|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: but othe odds are that the opening bidder is the stronger hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|the saint: With all the bangers and a solid 9 card fit, the hand was pulling extra. Some risk of missing grand, but could that be bid with confidence if it were there?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|an|4!Ss|mb|p|mb|1S!|an|11-14 bal 2+ !Ss|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: 3NT will probably make with West as declarer|pg||
nt|idc: Looks like E-W 1@d is always unbalanced, unless 18-19|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|pitiful:  1@h=4=@s|pg||
nt|idc: so they open 11-14 balanced like this with 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  1@s=balanced 2/3@s|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|pitiful:  i assume|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: No swing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: A bit random but with North on lead the contract had more chances of success|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|idc: North may put in the @hT - he has all the entries so confusing South for now not an issue|pg||

nt|chick: 5@C could have made on the good lie of the cards, but more than likely EW would have sac'd at 5@D, so not much difference|pg||
nt|chick: 5@DX-2  = a few imps|pg||
nt|yke:  I was in a partnership with steven den donder a few years ago, We played in holland in the "meesterklasse" |pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice card fit EW|pg||
nt|yke:  he is a very creative player with a tendency to overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: bridge is a very young game and new bidding ideas are being tested every day|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: oh dont be so modest|pg||
mb|d|nt|yke:  I think they are the favorites in this final|pg||
nt|rodal f: So system for EW is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as Donder and u Yke?|pg||
nt|yke:  I;m not sure|pg||
nt|chick: E probably has a 2-suiter bid available, but would you use it Vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yke:  ofcourse you would, I think now 2@H means hearts an a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: vul and nice 11HP now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w should reach game   but if 3NT may well go down|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yke:  ah ok, 2NT means hearts + clubs, they play multi defence|pg||
nt|steshome:  I love North's double|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: That was hard.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|paulg:  both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT with 1@c always promising at least 3|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has a chance   but can go down to a diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  I'm informed by a specatator that 2NT means a strong two suiter with a minor|pg||
nt|steshome:  Thin spade game missed - likely to be missed at the other table|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Uttam Gupta|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems a normal way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and good eve all|pg||
nt|ady: no game making if defence right with 26 hcp|pg||
mb|3N|nt|steshome:  No game makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: aand now the polish club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 3NT by W would have been better|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Hi there|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Uttam welcome|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and ty|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s seems normal contract |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 3@H=invit for 4 in @D or @H since a M and a MIN?|pg||
nt|yke:  he could have overcalled 2@H which would be 5 hearts + 4+ minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y. Capp|pg||
nt|yke:  so he was thinking if he could afford to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|steshome:  Seriously though chaps, don't you think that doubling on the North hand is winning bridge?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, the Italians seem to think so|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|galadriel: and who would argue with them :)|pg||
nt|ady: declarer will play on diamonds   and likely play low from west  to cater for sing. ace with north|pg||
pc|c6|nt|steshome:  West eschewed leading clubs|pg||
nt|galadriel: @C opener steering Sime away from his 5 carder lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||
nt|the saint: Byrne (North) is forever telling the U20s to double on those hands. Playable in 3 suits. |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  i'd prefer the double with an extra diamond and one less club|pg||

nt|idc: Walker has a surprisingly good hand on this auction but I expect that happens to E-W opponents all the time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: walker might suspect a littly psyche |pg||

nt|idc: The transfer 1@d from East gave South a problem - is 1@h natural when East has transferred to the suit?|pg||
nt|dburn: the defence can't cut him off from dummy's heart winner before West's trumps are drawn|pg||

nt|ady: n/s|pg||
mb|d|an|4+hearts|nt|jcomyn: is it all artificial then|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u bid suits that u havent got to show what u have got it does make it difficult for opps|pg||

nt|rodal f: But how commond by other variants u know better Yke.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|galadriel: Think we may be in for a bumpy ride|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: because their bids often become ambiguous is double for takeouit or showing the suit thats been bid etc....|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Hello et Bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|steshome:  I am confident that England can bid this game |pg||
nt|paulg:  this would be a good time for Matheson to bid 2@d ...|pg||
nt|ady: there is a complication with 4@S     |pg||
mb|2D|nt|steshome:  Oh my - North is going to struggle to get his spades across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and put a Pass card on Sime's side of the bidding tray for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell is going to bid 2@H this time|pg||
nt|steshome:  And North will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: if north plays 4@S   and east leads J@D    west will have to duck|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it does not seem to matter where the Camrose is held, there are often connection problems in the first session ... very frustrating for the vugraph operators|pg||
nt|steshome:  Nice vulnerable save from the Scots|pg||
nt|paulg:  good pressure bidding|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: I agree with problems|pg||
nt|steshome:  So easy to find|pg||
nt|paulg:  Byrne definitely thinking he has an RHO, LHO and CHO at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: if east leads a club or heart should north play 4@S   dont think it can be made|pg||
nt|the saint: There are no screens in the Camrose - am I right?|pg||
nt|steshome:  He might've done better to rebid 2@S at his second turn|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZZD: it is now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it would not surprise me if Bell is still thinking|pg||
nt|steshome:  Not sure about the 4@h bid - seems a bit previous - horrible hand to play now|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be made if playing carefull as 9@S comes down   so can plat spades from the top and later discard a diamond on a heart   lose 2 spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@H sounded like he has longer hearts to me. 2@H seemed more descriptive. Partner was still in the game.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i still prefer my initial 2@h over 1@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  5@d looks cold on any lead, declarer just established the hearts|pg||

nt|ady: 9 on a club lead    3 clubs   2 diamonds     4 major suit tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|2hplus4: Perhaps he should have opened 2NT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||

nt|steshome:  Declarer doesn't know he has 3 clubs though|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17 flat    3NT -1  at this table    6@C-1 in open room|pg||
nt|steshome:  Extraordinary|pg||
nt|ady: if south avoids the club lead  3NT might fail    could lead a spade|pg||
nt|steshome:  Partner is marked with 5+ hearts though|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|uttam: 2s pass was speculation|pg||
nt|the saint: I don't think it is remotely close with that suit quality|pg||
nt|steshome:  Is it a problem on a 5-2-2-4?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson will always opened 1@s when holding clubs too, so he can use Gazzilli|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah yes, easier if playing G|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson knows that Selway only has five hearts for his overcall, so will have most of the remaining points|pg||
nt|the saint: If matheson ruffs this, a 4th round of @H will establish South's trump length. Might do well to discard @D here.|pg||
nt|the saint: Especially if as Paul suggests he can work out AQ are offside|pg||
nt|steshome:  Interesting link to a commentary from Liz McGowan provided by a spec event:http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/the-camrose-trophy-2011-by-liz-mcgowan.html|pg||

nt|chilloncan: do it may be only a small loss (or a gain) against a game they can bid and make|pg||

nt|lestergold: 5 can go off|pg||

nt|jcomyn: whov was it said clubs disappeared 10 years ago and diamonds are on the way out.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love unsafe contracts if there is a smell of a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think this combined 26 count with 8 card @d fit and the rest of thehand misfitting is one to explore for slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: however caution i.e. un derbidding would be rewarded today|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a viable opinion, but again it goes back to the main goal of preempting. if we are doing it mainly to get in the opponentss' way, then a wider range is BETTER than a narrow ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: range -- we will get to do it more often, and when they opops play the contract they will have a harder time reading the layout|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: i dont think it makes even double dummy|pg||
nt|uttam: qx aqjxx kxx xxx , bidding will likely go the same way?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May go for 1  of 2 finesses. Or to discard @C on @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so worst scenario needing 2 out of 3 finesses i think this was a normal slam to bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|uttam: of course all north will bid the slam ,after they hear south open 1h|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u when east ruffs in on the third round of @ds there is still play left in the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can play on clubs|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes and at least one club will take care of a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe it can be made after all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With K@S falling he may make this|pg||
nt|uttam: depends on trick 1|pg||
nt|yke:  it's generally a good idea not to let your opponents play at the one level in a suit, unless you suspect they have a better fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT or X there. What give ure pard best freedom?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nt feels as a order and a X ure pard give the advice|pg||
nt|yke:  ith such a flat hand, i would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as Terence Reese always said, the more narrowly a preempter's hand is defined, the less effective a weapon it is  ("a dull swrod" was his phrase)|pg||
nt|chick: The idea of not let opps play at the 1 level depends a bit on the auction, I think.    1@D P P ?   is not the same situation as   1@D P 1@H P 1@S P P ?|pg||

nt|idc: But then I'd be agreeing with you and ... oh, all right|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I bid 1NT, just like they do when playing bridge|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  he knows they have an 8 card fit|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|idc: That reminds me of David's earlier comment: South dbld 2@h and then he dbld 2@s, in case North hadn't seen the first one|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Restart tomorrow at 12.00 GMT, 11.00 CET|pg||
nt|idc: This time, North may not have seen the first one.|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 10.00 GMT rather, sorry|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@s was exciting|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: well, now he had just noticed the first dbl, and has caught up|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Strange, 3 followed by 4|pg||
nt|Walddk6: He knows nothing more after 3@S than he did after double|pg||
nt|dburn: not without chances, this|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: has north a weak NT and just bid game  on his own?|pg||
nt|idc: The logic is that N-S can defend 2@s, or play 4@h, which seems to leave out some other options|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: West liable to be squeezed in the black suits|pg||
nt|dburn: and I'm not sure there's much he can do about it|pg||

nt|chilloncan: same N hand with one less club, and nine tricks are the limit, and 3N still a very possible call at the score|pg||
nt|rodal f: At non vul might. At vul no|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think Sime would have bid 2@d if Matheson had passed|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|the saint: Double isn't on my radar with that West hand|pg||
mb|d!|an|D or good hand|nt|galadriel: I think so too - but it's possible opener has a weak NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d is a transfer response showing 4+@h|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT likely to make n/s   but not liikely to be bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm pretty sure the double is takeout of hearts|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|boedhy: probably went 1 off...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: passing with a good 6-bagger dosnt appeal to me at all|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   may be reached   and could make if west fails to lead diamonds early  so that east can ruff and return a spade|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@H shows 3 hearts in a balanced hand|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|lestergold: interesting hand 4@s losing 3 trump tricks makes 3n a struggle|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont know if my comments about the slam hand came through before i was disconnected, so i will repeat them now: S did not play to best advantage. attacking hearts first was ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plausible, but:  (1) he should lead small from dummy instead of the king, just in case he can slip past the Ax. But more importantly...........|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|uttam: wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  right Anne ... you have to look at South first and see how nervous he looks|pg||
nt|steshome:  I'm not sure opening is on my radar with that West hand|pg||
nt|ady: little chance now for 4@H from north side    diamond  or even spade lead good enough|pg||
nt|paulg:  England finally on the board in this set with a part-score swing on 27|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|the saint: If that is the case and dec is playing something like a 6-0 fit. You might get game in 100s anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: could have bid 2s now has to bid 3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: n/s  stopped in 3@H    but that looks like down 1 |pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: well with west's hand all tops elsewhere but single spade i would bid 41s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s|pg||
nt|boedhy: dont know what 3@d is but uses up a lot of space.|pg||
nt|boedhy: 3NT now in the right hand and with a @h lead...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime feeling pleased with himself no doubt .. although clear to balance there is risk but the opponents take the push|pg||
nt|the saint: Both black suits now frozen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: espen wouldn't have bid 3h if vul!!|pg||
nt|steshome:  But he is vul?  Oh you mean he didn't see the vulnerabililty on the board?|pg||
nt|paulg:  part of the decision on bidding 3@h is dependent on how freely you raise with three-card support|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: when  pard is weak u want to paly in 41s when he is stong it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|chilloncan: (2) when he sees that trumps are 3-0, he should turn to clubs. giving W two chances to discard means E is extremely unlikely to get the defense wrong if he wins ace on second ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: round. better to hope for E to have 4 clubs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: no need use up any space had e opened 2d|pg||
nt|lestergold: all roads lead to 41s east cannot take his partner out|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boedhy: not easy te see he has to take this... well donw|pg||

pc|hA|pc|s6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: defence wrong    now west can be squeezed with K@S   and K@C|pg||

nt|jcomyn: I had a discussion with avide Bird on this subject a few years ago and he doesnt agree at all about that mickey mouse 2nd suit|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

mb|4H|nt|pitiful:  4@h is likely spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: If you saw him looking smug since, that will explain it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  unhappy more likely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can they find a @C lead?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @c ace more likely|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: hmmm  6  is difficult to read|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Tough defence|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: On bidding West unlikely to have @d length, so lead not from shortage|pg||
nt|Walddk6: @CK does not look obvious, does it?|pg||
nt|idc: could be KT6 I guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: could be disastrous|pg||

nt|lestergold: wec could argue about these matters like the ancient rabbis in the talmud|pg||
nt|yke:  sorry about that :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: np;|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: All on but 12 is hard|pg||
nt|chick: 2 boards to go, doesn't look hopeful for Begijntje|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yke:  a boring 4H 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|idc: Welcome everyone to the last round of the English Lady Milne trials|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: no, though they could easily gain a game swing on the last one|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: well here lay down 7 as cards lie but is six even a good contract it needs spades breaking and hearts not 4/2 with offside k etc|pg||
nt|paulg:  This was probably the first board of the match at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is not a bad slam and they didnt even try in the open room|pg||
nt|uttam: 3nt no chance on d lead|pg||
nt|yke:  3@S is smolen, GF to make sure the strong hand plays the contract|pg||
nt|yke:  5hearts plus 4spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  So the Scottish pair did well to bid the slam straight out of the blocks|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d game forcing checkback|pg||
mb|4H|nt|boedhy: yes very good pair this As I said before they play in dutch competitions. We have something called topcircuit. And there they are close to making the final 16 which is very good|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a slam which needs cards to behave reasoably kindly as hand falls apart when they don't|pg||
nt|ady: this a potential swing for England    looks as though 4@H can be defeated on a spade lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be defeated on a spade lead if North had more spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Results can be found at: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i would not be surprised to see EW bid slam in the other room, knowing they need a lucky swing|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|idc: Though round 16 results are still to be posted|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kind cautious though|pg||
nt|uttam: as  cards are , cant stop dec bringing home 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: slam is not totally hopeless|pg||
nt|paulg:  rare for the defence to complain about the 5-1 break|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yke:  4@H is minimum, with a maximum he would have bid 4@C|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|chilloncan: well it is cold, but a priori it is terrible|pg||

nt|chick: another chance for big imps NS, but too late to do much good|pg||
nt|the saint: It was. So. The difference came from opener's rebid. 4C or 3N?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3NT is lazy when you miss slam, practical when you don't|pg||
nt|the saint: 3N looks a practical description to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  is this the last board?|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are now on the last board of the match. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Terry, in extremely difficult circumstance. Great Job! |pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators David Edwin, Anne Symons, Sarah Teshome and Alan Shillitoe for their wit and perceptive comments. |pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Sandra Claridge (Bridge Great Britain) together with Alan Jones and the Welsh Bridge Union for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We will be back tomorrow morning at 10:00 GMT, 11:00 Paris, 05:00 New York and 10:00 Berwick-upon-Tweed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i think so but not sure|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  This will be a very heartening start to the weekend for the Scottish team, who were under par in January|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: perhaps they should have played bridge instead of golf|pg||
nt|ady: also as pointed out had north led a diamond last hand   south could win and switch to K@C   and ruff out the club discard     also a low club lead would do   but that inot going to ...|pg||
nt|ady: happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: This looks like a normal 4@h, but both finesses wrong and 2 Aces to lose|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, and a great big thank you to our excellent operator, Frederic Delforge :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S on double-dummy for EW|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bravo Frederic:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyn: Thanks all Last hand see you soon|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is likely that you have a fit in clubs, so I think 4@c is well judged|pg||
nt|steshome:  This really isn't going well for England fans|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: 14 was 1NT +1 by E|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|boedhy: so maybe some 5 imps for begijntje but still BOB a very handsome lead. Think they will win it...|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is game forcing checkback|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  3N is a better contract. the clue is that E-W have almost all the quacks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  the scottish way is always to show hearts before spades when responding to checkback|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime can't be thinking of going on - another network glitch?|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be thinking of supporting diamonds?|pg||
nt|the saint: MAybe he is|pg||
nt|galadriel: we are about to be booted......|pg||
nt|steshome:  What was the 3@d bid all about?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, and their auction did give them a chance to reach it|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Terry, in extremely difficult circumstances. Great Job! |pg||
nt|galadriel: Maybe he thinks E has shown a slam try with @D?|pg||
nt|ady: both sides opted for a part score|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chilloncan: trump lead would have been best -- and in my view clearly indicated -- but contract still failing|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h5|nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Anne Symons, Sarah Teshome and Alan Shillitoe for their wit and perceptive comments. |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  quacks, specs, are queens and jacks|pg||
