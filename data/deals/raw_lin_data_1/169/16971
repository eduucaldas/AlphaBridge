nt|pitiful:  a potentially good result for Wales|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: players are all playing much faster than previous matches !|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: even if N held Q10X in trumps i dont think they cd beat this|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|brolucius: North could hold only a maximum of 2 trumps after the 5-card spade opening.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  this is the way e-w show a 3 card limit raise|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|brolucius: Remote, as in 'way past that mountain range over there'.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@s looks a little high on e-w cards but everything lying favourably for declarer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  only chance might be for south to switch to @d then duck first @s|pg||
nt|copeyj: don't you have a trump guess on a @D switch now Peter?|pg||

nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 to start out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry having trouble finding the right boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Sorry about that, have the right boards now|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: The profile for our excellent viewgraph operator gives Denis Dobrin from Russia|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: A quiet pass by E, would have a reasonable 1NT rebid after opening 1 of a minor.  Meanwhile, choice of openings perhaps for S, either @S or NT.  Likely @S with a small side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: doubleton.  Some like to have three of the other major to open 1NT with a five-card major; the thinking is that they can still land in the better fit if pd has five of the other ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: major.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also conceivable some E could 1@D and rebid 2@C over 1@S but that seems a bit much.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: contract is |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is nasty--NS likely to make nine tricks on a spade lead--4@S a phantom |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have been led up the garden path again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry had to get a mouse will get contract in a min|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sounds like the contract may be 3@S - obv not on a 3@S opening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: think it is|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S will fail by one or two and EW will post the plus on this 20-20 hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: shame I've never been to russia!|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry have lost the bidding though|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its OK final contract 2@S |pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
nt|garnetts: straight in and North probably should double --minimum and not wanting to bid 5@H |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close run thing though...|pg||
nt|garnetts: when a spade is led it will pay south to duck |pg||
mc|9|nt|jcwla: In the famous words of Barry Crane, "God dealt you A-K so you wouldn't have a lead problem."|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here no other choice.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  4@s looks a possible spot|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: According to that scoring table, Scotland has played England but England has not played Scotland. Curious!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psridhar: sitting over K(Q) with AX it is tough to duck the King first round ; so trump guess was resolved ; perhaps if lho ducks , you can, as declarer , rule out AX on LHO !|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|brolucius: Many play that the cue-bid shows 3-card spade support and 2NT shows 4-card support.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: But they have, and sadly for England, Scotland won 24-6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  might stop in 3 if west gets cute|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i like west's actions|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. I spent 20 years overbidding hands with only three-card support.|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 3@s is no easy task but yes well bid by W|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5@s + 2@d + 2@c = easy 9 now |pg||
nt|brolucius: It is fashional to sneer at double-honour leads, but in truth South had a poor selection of leads available.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  martin hoping to get in with K@s so leads @d King and then hopes to find an entry|pg||
nt|psridhar: if declarer can guess @h as well he can come to 10 even|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: as spec point out with no x and trump lead declarer has handling problems|pg||
nt|garnetts: that was frankly dreadful |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Hello everybody. Is that score correct??|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: Since we are the Closed room, we began 3 boards ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: A strong NT from Spears|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 0-0 you mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: NS have 650|pg||
nt|psridhar: xcellent save that 6H ...gains against a Vul game even, let alone the making slam |pg||
nt|psridhar: 6@c shd make?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  No:) 590|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|kiwibridge: oh yes indeed|pg||
nt|idc: but at this rate, they will cacth us up|pg||
nt|garnetts: Afraid so Liz|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure was..|pg||
nt|jcwla: E electing to put max pressure on here and not an easy call for N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: undo..?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|cuttysark:  i shall not ask for details|pg||
nt|garnetts: They had to work at it though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: has got Mr Carlisle into great form straight away|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lots of possible landing spots after this start.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Good practical bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well 2 clubs must be majors so NS take a strange view ang play in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Well I was as polite as I could be :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: Well 3NT is a good spot and 4@S needs a lot of play |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That won't do a lot of damage |pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: but NS here are far from finding their @c fit|pg||
nt|jcwla: S will go quietly with this aceless wonder and the @D's to the right.  A solid spot here for N/S.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: well there it is 650|pg||
nt|psridhar: wonder why N didnt bid his clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this lead clarifies thinks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Will bid 6 if promise to make this lead.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wilkinsona: does not rate to make, with 2 spades ok and 1N going off|pg||
nt|garnetts: laydown anyway |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|idc: I see mousing over the hands produces Short/Walker E-W, and Tower/Richards N-S|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcwla: And to have @S's break.  Meanwhile, sneak attack not where it's at here.  |pg||

nt|brolucius: Goodman psyched a 1NT response at the other table, so was more-or-less forced to pass the 2@H (transfer).|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not unheard of in his case|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: If he went to 2@S (a better contract), he expected South to bid again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S shows a sound club raise.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pitiful:  e-w can make 4@c so no big deal|pg||
nt|psridhar: even W introduced a diversion on CR when he didnt overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 4@c coming now|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East may be nervous of bidding 4@C. No, he has done.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: with 5 card support for Vul 2 lev O/C he need not worry about penalty X |pg||
nt|pitiful:  well 3@s would have made in practice i guess|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|psridhar: X a part score i mean|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Yes, 4@C was well judged. He did know of 10 trumps for E/W but those double honors in the majors are sometimes better in defence.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  no choice but to finesse|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||

nt|psridhar: "if only people bid what they have and not what they dont....."  Late Kaplan :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello Liz|pg||
nt|jcwla: Michael Rosenberg notes 6 makes on any lead so my bad there.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: be that as it may, Yeh just inched 4 Imps closer|pg||
nt|garnetts: didn't fancy 3@D then :) |pg||
mb|1N!|an|semi forcing|nt|kiwibridge: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: I suspect many would overcall 2@c on west non-vul but few would vul|pg||
mb|2H!|an|6!S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@H a @S bid and the double to show @H's - presumably higher level choices available to one or both sides.|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not mind 1NT on the North hand --I think 2@C at red is too rich |pg||
nt|dagold: 2@h a transfer|pg||
nt|dagold: showing 6+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Both EW rightly conclude bidding is dangerous--|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sad to admit, thik I would have tried 2 spades with East|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Goodman has decided to get off the bus|pg||
nt|dagold: had he completed the transfer suspect he would have heard 3N next|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: 3@H is making|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark:  best to stop quickly on a misfit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: as is 4@C :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I might under an assumed name |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: and this contract looks in danger too |pg||
nt|dagold: This looks close but probably 1 down|pg||
nt|dagold: due to the bad red suit breaks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: 5@c is not a hopeless contract, needs defense to shift to @h before winning @d ace|pg||
nt|idc: I think 2@c is natural but alerted since game forcing|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS heading overboard...|pg||
nt|idc: and 4@d a shortage showing splinter of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland compete to 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|idc: North does have some extras after 4@h, and at least they have managed to stop below six|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which has a chance|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  south trying to signal for a heart: declarer has to play him for stiff ace|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west best to play ace and another trump it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: does not want to concede a ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is that not an assumed name you are using?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like the first four tricks in the round suits and two @S to follow in time - but let's see.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: if west had taken the ace of spade a trump promotion would have led to an axtra undertrick |pg||
pc|sT|pc|d2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: j@H sorts this |pg||
nt|dagold: even down 2 I think as declarer will lose 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: On a heart switch that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: east asking lots of questions about the methods|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: but they found the defense and beat it, so the leaders get ahead further|pg||
nt|idc: normally you'd say a 6-0 @c split was awful, but here it is a lot better than 5-1, when they might suffer a ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: enough undertricks as it is...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure I wouldn't have led a heart from Dummy at trick three|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  That did not go well :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: And EW dropped a trick|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sort of mystifying why W didn't cash the @C tricks before, think would have been down.|pg||
nt|dagold: Tempting to respond 1N to keep the opponents out (or find hearts)|pg||

nt|dagold: at favourable it is too tempting|pg||
nt|dagold: I confess i would respond|pg||

nt|dagold: slam making here but won't be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: NS will reach 3N..unless they decide to nail W now |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: interesting opening from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: If that is 14-16 OK---not in my view if it is 12-14 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky for south though|pg||
nt|garnetts: agreed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cuttysark:  Connection problems here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes I suppose its asking a lot to read the stiif ace|pg||
nt|dagold: slam surprisingly reasonable too with only 29 and 1-5 card suit. No waistage I guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: Sri Lanka have just tossed a wicket to Canada by contriving a run out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  easy for us :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard high card vaues and a decent suit make 1@H look better |pg||
nt|garnetts: yes the 10@C offers a slight extra chance too |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks, Denis|pg||

nt|garnetts: 4@H making here|pg||
nt|dagold: 6 imps to them|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: with both major suit hooks wrong...|pg||
nt|idc: a good slam this time but both major Kings wrong|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really a great 4@S --so they got their reward|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: Do you agree with pass ?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no, but seems to work this time|pg||
nt|dagold: A little suprised as Noramn is usually very sharp in these type of situations|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: this will end the auction|pg||

pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: double game swing board 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 2@H should carry preference overtones|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: but @s break shd help|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In spite of slamy suggestions from a spec, WBU settle for game|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT for the black suits here - would not be everyone's choice but reasonable and has N shown this @D holding? |pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h was going to make|pg||

pc|cT|nt|dagold: so this is a good save |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am quite suprised Norman let that go--he wouldn't at money bridge.  4@S is a daft bid ---partner can double again then bid it |pg||
nt|dagold: would have been 800 if doubled|pg||
pc|hA|nt|spil: perhaps 2...but 3@C was likely to make so no disaster|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|dagold: I like that cheeky 1@h opener at love all and as dealer|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: I see Murdoch/Spears also got to the bad 6@h on Bd 4, so a flat board in one down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it appears that the usual connection prob have scuppered the comparisons|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S playing any system is obligatory |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland also went down in 6 hearts on 4, a contract off on the diamond hook|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|idc: At this early stage in the Round 2 matches, England are 11 up on N.I., and Wales down by similar amount to the Republic|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 1 diamond must be hearts|pg||
nt|idc: so very tight at the top|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Aggressive opening bids sometimes backfire when partner has a fair hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@s was hasty too. I play it as a bit weaker than that. Cuebidding then 4@s to show a real hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: transfer responces, it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: Next year they should hold it in North Korea bound to be better internet :) |pg||
nt|jcwla: W declining to show @D's right away without extras, now 3NT showing the @D values if not the length.  A quiet pass by E but recognizing the lack of a great fit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark:  Score currently 21-2: Scotland took the weak"@H on board 3 3 down; but then played 2@H -4 when Walker made 3@C|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well with all the computers & laptops pluged into the hotel system it bound to crash|pg||
nt|garnetts: That seems a mighty odd lead holding AQ stiff in hearts --but nothing looks great |pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|psridhar: this can make if decl playes trumps for one loser-what is the % play here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: running the @c jack works when W has KQX|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cashing A is 1 loser also|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ace works when E has stiff K / Q-other combos , both work / or dont|pg||
nt|dagold: for me 4@s is 6 spades and a semi punt typically|pg||

mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: North has a chance of shutting out the clubs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wilkinsona: well, I doubted the Denis myself, but thats what it says, perhaps you can clarify|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: Conservative 3@H   ---I know I will risk sounding boring--Kokish said many years ago when you have five card support for partner bid game |pg||
nt|dagold: England played the wrong partscore on 6 after intervention from Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought he would pass--but these days 1@C is often short --so TOD of 1H |pg||
nt|dagold: EW can make 3@s so 4@h may be bid as a save|pg||

pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: North should bid 4 here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again WBU in a contract that gives the defenders a chance|pg||

nt|dagold: Why would he?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this will go to 4 spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: the @s9 is actually a stop with this spade layout, but not obvious to him|pg||

nt|dagold: dble-p-3h-3s-p-p|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: not unreasonable to pass, just a bit scary|pg||

nt|garnetts: 2NT to show garbage |pg||
nt|dagold: I don't like that as he only has 1 place to play|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psridhar: this is about to go D1|pg||
nt|psridhar: now was 4@s making?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  2@C has several meanings, and 2N showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: couple of guesses involved in 4@s..|pg||
nt|psridhar: but favoourite to make -once the @h ace is seen with W, the opener shd hv @c ace, so 4@s rates to make|pg||
nt|dagold: partner has to have 4 hearts|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: hence we hv to assess this 5@d as a good save by the leaders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: accurate defense required to secure 500 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Sudden change of personality by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, I had though the auction over|pg||
nt|dagold: for me this sequence shows a good 3@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Bit of a lunge by East|pg||
nt|dagold: but perhaps it was lebensohl for them|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has shown values with the doubel so leaves it to partner |pg||
nt|dagold: it really shouldn't be leb here|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|psridhar: stiff ace in NT contracts is not as valuable as other aces are-cannot hold up ! here if only declarer could have held up @h 2 rounds...|pg||

nt|pitiful:  e-w play precision|pg||
nt|pitiful:  n-s a modern from of 5 card majors|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|psridhar: here is a weak NT hand with 5 @s and W opens 1@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT Jacoby, to show a strong four-card raise of the major.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pitiful:  usually good to bid over 2N raise if possible at favourable vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: so clearly no weak NT opening with 5 card major|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, it is with the strong 1NT that it is usually favoured.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you could imagine some souths overcalling 3@c with an understanding partner|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3@d is non-std response to jacoby 2nt , wonder if it means a bal min|pg||
nt|brolucius: Understanding partners are in short supply.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pitiful:  well east might have just raised to 4@s given their system|pg||
nt|copeyj: good morning all|pg||
nt|pitiful:  no David, I am sure that is just your experience :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: if S is 'selfish' in taking his ruff he can beat this|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|pitiful:  good morning captain|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is my partners' experience.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pitiful:  oh dear|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psridhar: S had to guess if his partner held a promotable trump OR @d ace |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: i cant see how a promotable trump with out Dia ace wd help|pg||
nt|brolucius: Promotion unlikely, it would seem, with the trumps in the dummy.|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Last hand now...|pg||
nt|spil: On board 24 N Ireland managed to bid and make 7@D...only needed 3-3 trump fit and the opposition forgetting to cash A@S|pg||
nt|dagold: here England let through 4@s|pg||
nt|dagold: so a chance for a big swing to Wales|pg||
mb|1S|nt|spil: *trump break|pg||
nt|dagold: on a club lead, south tried to give north a promotion rather than playing for his own ruff in diamonds|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwibridge: probably a flat board anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now I see NO merir in this VUL opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: merit|pg||
nt|psridhar: bidding here doesnt seem consistent with cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: West  got a bit carried away next door |pg||
mb|4D|nt|wilkinsona: Last board, so looks like a good win for WBU|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: A good comeback from WBU after they were 24-0 down early in the set|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a bid of interest from south|pg||
nt|idc: this is only approaching the half-way point of course, 2nd half begins in 30 mins|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  not sure i like east's double - more than half his points in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also like a bid here like 1NT  to get things stirred up--been known to try 2@H too |pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcwla: That's when it's time to crawl back in bed and pull the covers up - or if you're Ireland go straight to Monte Carlo.|pg||
nt|dburn: that won't happen on this bidding - if North leads a club, of course|pg||
nt|dagold: the 3@d bid is likely to make the defence easy if Goodman leads a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: If this is a single suited major, trouble on its way..|pg||
nt|idc: IMHO, the 2@d bid shows 2 things:|pg||
nt|idc: spades and another suit|pg||
nt|idc: and that South has forgotten they aren't playing matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if they can get to 3 clubs, not so bad..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the vulnerability is favourable but I still don't like the overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, this is the last board here.  Big thanks to Denis, to BBO's great and tireless Roland Wald, and to Stephen Peterkin and Liz McGowan.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wilkinsona: So thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double stirred thing up too it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: dbl is a poor bid might as well pass or bid 1NT --if you must|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I guess 3@c is -3 probably?   as long as the defence lead trumps to prevent 2 spade ruffs in North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and to specs for their comments|pg||
nt|spil: I guess trump promotion available here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: My thanks also to Michael Rosenberg for his analytic comments (and corrections), much appreciated.|pg||
nt|spil: A@S K@S A@C and spade through to give W a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When South removes the dbl of 2@d to 2@s, North knows the second suit is clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: N having bid his hand bids again|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H is not my idea of a bid on Jxxx--why not 5@D  --perhaps he plays the cards better |pg||
nt|dburn: and after 4@h, I guess he might lead one|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h may have been 'last train'|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: yep. may have though 5 diamonds as encouraging|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  May have thought it was the least encouraging noise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  now has to take a good view in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
nt|dagold: so this should go down|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hope you will be with us later.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: agree|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
nt|garnetts: haven't got a lot of sympathy --there are two entries vai a club ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he gets off play with a diamond--should  east get the hearts right?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades beats it if hook is on|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Well he could hardly lead a spade away from his ace...|pg||
nt|garnetts: It depends if East thinks North knows the heart position|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|psridhar: need to tap E hand off a trump now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean Liz--he could cash the ace of spades and ace of clubs if South had Qxx|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sA|mc|9|nt|dagold: Wales have played very well in this set|pg||
nt|dagold: only 1 error|pg||
nt|dagold: in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: in letting through 4@h|pg||
nt|dagold: England have their work cut out|pg||
