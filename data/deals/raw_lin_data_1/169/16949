mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Welcome Stephen|pg||
nt|spil: Hi Ian|pg||
nt|idc: I used to play this style, where opener rebids 1NT even if he has 4 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I play this style|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: I prefer it, since you get to show your hand type early (balanced or not)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Better to show shape|pg||
nt|idc: but on hands like these, you do miss the spade fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then you know 1@S is an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, you may miss a partial in a major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: but if responder is strong enough to at least invite, you won't|pg||
nt|idc: declarer can set up 3@s, 2@h & 1@d easily enough, but the 7th trick will be hard to find|pg||

mb|1N|nt|spil: 2@H not where you might expect to play...|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|idc: South showed @h and a minor over East's 1NT, so North bid his hearts|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|spil: is 2@C not both Majors ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: We are both wrong, though you were closer - 2@c in other room was diamonds, or both majors|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: Yes, I prefer Matheson's evaluation - 2@d here showed a 6+card major overcall|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: as spec point out with no x and trump lead declarer has handling problems|pg||
mb|1N|nt|idc: Since we are the Closed room, we began 3 boards ahead of the other table|pg||

nt|psridhar: wonder why N didnt bid his clubs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona: does not rate to make, with 2 spades ok and 1N going off|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: as is 4@C :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 5@c is not a hopeless contract, needs defense to shift to @h before winning @d ace|pg||
nt|idc: I think 2@c is natural but alerted since game forcing|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: NS heading overboard...|pg||
nt|idc: and 4@d a shortage showing splinter of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland compete to 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|idc: North does have some extras after 4@h, and at least they have managed to stop below six|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which has a chance|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  south trying to signal for a heart: declarer has to play him for stiff ace|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|psridhar: but they found the defense and beat it, so the leaders get ahead further|pg||

mb|2S|mb|4C|nt|idc: E-W taking advantage of the favourable vulnerability to preempt very high|pg||
nt|spil: 4@H or 4@S probably not much better than 3NT anyway ...|pg||
nt|idc: true, maybe just a little|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: North had a difficult bid - he's a little too good for a simple 4@s perhaps, but getting to the 5-level could be dangerous|pg||
nt|spil: 2@C overcall a little horrible perhaps...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|spil: has the merit of being space-consuming |pg||
nt|idc: Yes, without that it would have nothing going for it|pg||
nt|spil: nevertheless has worked well here as 5@S not straightforward|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer has a trump to lose, and possibly a heart, and some work|pg||
nt|idc: ruffing clubs in dummy seems to hard given lack of entries to South hand, so perhaps the diamonds need set up|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||

nt|psridhar: but favoourite to make -once the @h ace is seen with W, the opener shd hv @c ace, so 4@s rates to make|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3@d is d1|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|idc: a 1@s response is fewer spades, kind of like a normal focring NT hand|pg||

nt|psridhar: bidding here doesnt seem consistent with cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Last board, so looks like a good win for WBU|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: A good comeback from WBU after they were 24-0 down early in the set|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a bid of interest from south|pg||
nt|idc: this is only approaching the half-way point of course, 2nd half begins in 30 mins|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|wilkinsona: If this is a single suited major, trouble on its way..|pg||
nt|idc: IMHO, the 2@d bid shows 2 things:|pg||
nt|idc: spades and another suit|pg||
nt|idc: and that South has forgotten they aren't playing matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if they can get to 3 clubs, not so bad..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the vulnerability is favourable but I still don't like the overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: So thanks to all in Wales|pg||
mb|3S|nt|idc: I guess 3@c is -3 probably?   as long as the defence lead trumps to prevent 2 spade ruffs in North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and to specs for their comments|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When South removes the dbl of 2@d to 2@s, North knows the second suit is clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: N having bid his hand bids again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hope you will be with us later.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: agree|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c6|pc|d9|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|idc: Now the dummy (with singleton spade) and declarer's line, are also screaming "trump lead"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence going well, back to trumps now..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: a @h ruff was needed|pg||
nt|psridhar: now may be 2 late|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pg||
mc|10|nt|psridhar: now decl can ruff the @h, play @c king and ruff with @s J, back to hand with a trump and play @c as trump substitutes thru S|pg||
