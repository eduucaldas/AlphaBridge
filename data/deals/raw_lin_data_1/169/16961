nt|paulg:  Short encouraged diamonds here to prevent partner switching to a heart and leading away from his heart honour|pg||

nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 to start out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: The profile for our excellent viewgraph operator gives Denis Dobrin from Russia|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A quiet pass by E, would have a reasonable 1NT rebid after opening 1 of a minor.  Meanwhile, choice of openings perhaps for S, either @S or NT.  Likely @S with a small side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: doubleton.  Some like to have three of the other major to open 1NT with a five-card major; the thinking is that they can still land in the better fit if pd has five of the other ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: major.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also conceivable some E could 1@D and rebid 2@C over 1@S but that seems a bit much.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: contract is |pg||
mb|3S|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is nasty--NS likely to make nine tricks on a spade lead--4@S a phantom |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have been led up the garden path again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry had to get a mouse will get contract in a min|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sounds like the contract may be 3@S - obv not on a 3@S opening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: think it is|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S will fail by one or two and EW will post the plus on this 20-20 hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: shame I've never been to russia!|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
nt|garnetts: straight in and North probably should double --minimum and not wanting to bid 5@H |pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close run thing though...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the famous words of Barry Crane, "God dealt you A-K so you wouldn't have a lead problem."|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here no other choice.|pg||
mc|7|nt|wilkinsona: ...but 6 spades may be tricky|pg||
nt|idc: we'll try to get you names as we can - starts of matches are often rushed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..it looks to have handling probs, but the diamond ace is right..|pg||

nt|garnetts: that was frankly dreadful |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Hello everybody. Is that score correct??|pg||
mb|3D|nt|idc: Since we are the Closed room, we began 3 boards ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: A strong NT from Spears|pg||

nt|garnetts: They had to work at it though|pg||

nt|jcwla: Lots of possible landing spots after this start.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark:  Good practical bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|wilkinsona: well 2 clubs must be majors so NS take a strange view ang play in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Well I was as polite as I could be :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That won't do a lot of damage |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but NS here are far from finding their @c fit|pg||

pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: well there it is 650|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: this lead clarifies thinks|pg||

pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: does not rate to make, with 2 spades ok and 1N going off|pg||
nt|garnetts: laydown anyway |pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: I see mousing over the hands produces Short/Walker E-W, and Tower/Richards N-S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: And to have @S's break.  Meanwhile, sneak attack not where it's at here.  |pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|psridhar: be that as it may, Yeh just inched 4 Imps closer|pg||
nt|garnetts: didn't fancy 3@D then :) |pg||
mb|1H!|nt|kiwibridge: yep|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@H a @S bid and the double to show @H's - presumably higher level choices available to one or both sides.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|garnetts: Both EW rightly conclude bidding is dangerous--|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sad to admit, thik I would have tried 2 spades with East|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: 3@H is making|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  best to stop quickly on a misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: as is 4@C :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I might under an assumed name |pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|psridhar: 5@c is not a hopeless contract, needs defense to shift to @h before winning @d ace|pg||
nt|idc: I think 2@c is natural but alerted since game forcing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS heading overboard...|pg||
nt|idc: and 4@d a shortage showing splinter of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland compete to 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|idc: North does have some extras after 4@h, and at least they have managed to stop below six|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which has a chance|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  south trying to signal for a heart: declarer has to play him for stiff ace|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west best to play ace and another trump it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: does not want to concede a ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is that not an assumed name you are using?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like the first four tricks in the round suits and two @S to follow in time - but let's see.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: if west had taken the ace of spade a trump promotion would have led to an axtra undertrick |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psridhar: but they found the defense and beat it, so the leaders get ahead further|pg||
nt|idc: normally you'd say a 6-0 @c split was awful, but here it is a lot better than 5-1, when they might suffer a ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wilkinsona: enough undertricks as it is...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but may be a problem nevertheless|pg||

pc|hT|nt|idc: did he have time to set up spades Tony?  too late now|pg||

pc|dT|nt|psridhar: couple of guesses involved in 4@s..|pg||
nt|psridhar: but favoourite to make -once the @h ace is seen with W, the opener shd hv @c ace, so 4@s rates to make|pg||

mb|2D|nt|wilkinsona: surprised south didnt bid 4 spades... will it work?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I think 4@H is -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|idc: South too strong for 1NT but CC suggests a 1@d opening is possible with their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: identical auctions in both rooms to end a marathon like match a loong one|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psridhar: with trumps 3-3 this shd make in comfort|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Needs to finesse diamonds - would you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: spec says JM has to play this very well|pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: This is now foolproof too |pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  The Scottish west also led a heart. Yeugh!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 12 tricks is a lot though|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: thx and bye all |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|spil: not sure why N didn't bid 4@D|pg||
mb|5H|nt|spil: not sure what 5@H is...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: South settles for 3NT, though perhaps 2 sdades doubled occured to him...|pg||

mb|p|nt|spil: seems to have made the wrong response if asking in @C ... but moving sharply along :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@C a cuebid for @H's - not a new place for us to play after N has opened 2@C and shown primary @H's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks to our operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: sorry board 16 too, Im a bit early|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, consevative 2 spade bid works for WBU|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems you can start with a double|pg||
nt|garnetts: if North leads a heart this will not make |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  But then you might lose a major suit  fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like double either strikes me that 3@C and then 4@H if thats what I need to bid get this hand over |pg||
nt|spil: absolutely...3@S may be natural but the 4 level should be a cue|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: the inevitable|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  how about @SK lead :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it gets the hand over|pg||
nt|garnetts: that works too and so does a club |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  So 6 cards beat it and 7 let it make |pg||
nt|garnetts: anything but a Johannisburg sparkler |pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: weak NT opg is popular inn this part of the world|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 suits to beat it, one to let it make|pg||
nt|garnetts: might not get the clubs right |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Oh well, opportunity knocked|pg||

nt|paulg:  Sometimes you look at a hand and just see problems .. here it needs precise defence to beat 4@h and it would likely be doubled|pg||
nt|lauri:  BY EAST?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  and then North opens a grotty multi 2@d to change everything|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D weak teo in major or strong variants|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Will Short double 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if he does then Walker will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  After the @sA lead and continuation, then Short must cash the @cA before trying to give the spade ruff|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Last hand now...|pg||
nt|spil: On board 24 N Ireland managed to bid and make 7@D...only needed 3-3 trump fit and the opposition forgetting to cash A@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|spil: *trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: probably a flat board anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now I see NO merir in this VUL opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: merit|pg||
nt|psridhar: bidding here doesnt seem consistent with cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: West  got a bit carried away next door |pg||
mb|1C|nt|wilkinsona: Last board, so looks like a good win for WBU|pg||
mb|4H|nt|idc: A good comeback from WBU after they were 24-0 down early in the set|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a bid of interest from south|pg||
nt|idc: this is only approaching the half-way point of course, 2nd half begins in 30 mins|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  not sure i like east's double - more than half his points in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also like a bid here like 1NT  to get things stirred up--been known to try 2@H too |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: That's when it's time to crawl back in bed and pull the covers up - or if you're Ireland go straight to Monte Carlo.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: If this is a single suited major, trouble on its way..|pg||
nt|idc: IMHO, the 2@d bid shows 2 things:|pg||
nt|idc: spades and another suit|pg||
nt|idc: and that South has forgotten they aren't playing matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if they can get to 3 clubs, not so bad..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the vulnerability is favourable but I still don't like the overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, this is the last board here.  Big thanks to Denis, to BBO's great and tireless Roland Wald, and to Stephen Peterkin and Liz McGowan.|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: So thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double stirred thing up too it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: dbl is a poor bid might as well pass or bid 1NT --if you must|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I guess 3@c is -3 probably?   as long as the defence lead trumps to prevent 2 spade ruffs in North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and to specs for their comments|pg||
nt|spil: I guess trump promotion available here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: My thanks also to Michael Rosenberg for his analytic comments (and corrections), much appreciated.|pg||
nt|spil: A@S K@S A@C and spade through to give W a trump trick|pg||
mb|4N|nt|idc: When South removes the dbl of 2@d to 2@s, North knows the second suit is clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: N having bid his hand bids again|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H is not my idea of a bid on Jxxx--why not 5@D  --perhaps he plays the cards better |pg||
mb|5C|nt|wilkinsona: yep. may have though 5 diamonds as encouraging|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  May have thought it was the least encouraging noise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  now has to take a good view in hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hope you will be with us later.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
pc|h8|nt|idc: agree|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
nt|garnetts: haven't got a lot of sympathy --there are two entries vai a club ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he gets off play with a diamond--should  east get the hearts right?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades beats it if hook is on|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Well he could hardly lead a spade away from his ace...|pg||
nt|garnetts: It depends if East thinks North knows the heart position|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|psridhar: need to tap E hand off a trump now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean Liz--he could cash the ace of spades and ace of clubs if South had Qxx|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|idc: Now the dummy (with singleton spade) and declarer's line, are also screaming "trump lead"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence going well, back to trumps now..|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  i understand, but it is ever so obvious to declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: a @h ruff was needed|pg||
nt|psridhar: now may be 2 late|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|psridhar: now decl can ruff the @h, play @c king and ruff with @s J, back to hand with a trump and play @c as trump substitutes thru S|pg||
nt|idc: still time|pg||
