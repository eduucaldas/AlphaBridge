nt|delberto:  but 3S makes for EW|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but not the greatest contract in the world with a spade lead|pg||
nt|delberto:  it's EW hand|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|3S|nt|dburn: some players can bid such as 2NT with South to show a very weak club raise - "don't bid game with a balanced 19, partner"|pg||
nt|jwit: North will have to try 3NT now|pg||
nt|delberto:  he will hope that partner has the king of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: someone might double him if he did|pg||
nt|dburn: and a runout to 4@c won't do that well|pg||
nt|delberto:  you mean Neil !|pg||
nt|jwit: He has to play partner for the Kxxxx of clubs and another card|pg||
mb|p|nt|delberto:  he has avoided trouble !|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|delberto:  a weak NT 3rd in hand is a very dangerous weapon|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
nt|lestergold: Engel refused to be sunject to indignity of endplay!|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello all!|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back everyone .. i guess we've missed 17 as the connection settled down|pg||
nt|dagold: Nice lead|pg||
nt|ady: last tricks not shown   but down 2   so 2 trump tricks were lost|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andrew Robson and Martin Carroll|pg||
nt|arobson:  Hello all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@h might steal it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
nt|arobson:  The vulnerability will probably see NS try 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
nt|dburn: this might not play all that well|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
nt|dagold: even a heart lead won't beat this as the spade is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes connection problems here keeps crashing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  South doubles to show that he had a very good 2NT bid, North has nowhere to go|pg||
nt|ady: Caroll decided on a penalty  rather than try 3NT  |pg||
nt|ady: this will cost plenty|pg||
nt|dburn: very sensible, even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: w does not expect pard to make this|pg||
mb|d|nt|steshome:  Evening|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: This room will have severe connection problems|pg||
nt|arobson:  Although 2@H dbeled no fun for EW|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Ns time?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare may have difficulty developing his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mcarroll: declarer|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: no matter, E saved them|pg||
nt|dburn: if the defenders can force declarer to play clubs himself, this looks down about five|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts we assume|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mmm interesting|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S always need to have a semi inside.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hi all|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime has an absolute HIROSHIMA!|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Potential loss for England on board 17|pg||
nt|steshome:  Sad to say|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S on    difficult to reach|pg||
nt|ady: will do well to get out for 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, it isn't easy to defend perfectly in this kind of situation|pg||
nt|ady: do not want to over do shortening declarer |pg||
nt|arobson:  N will lead @H7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: therer isa lot of thism about these days|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not start with a high heart?|pg||
nt|arobson:  My guess is five tricks after twice as many minutes...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|the saint: Can be difficult to get across hands with thatmany HCP|pg||
nt|galadriel: good shot|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: seems u were dealt that to lead but as it happens 2 off whatever|pg||
nt|paulg:  Most of the cards are marked for Matheson, so he will be planning how to endplay South to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|the saint: That is one way. Was 2NT in that sequence 25+ or a specific range?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But now may duck second Heart to set up the King|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If he plays Diamonds he has enough of a count to place S with a doubleton Heart|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|steshome:  Ah A downside of Kokish|pg||
nt|dburn: now, for example, South may have to play a trump or blow a trick, and that's difficult|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||
nt|jcomyn: honestrly i dont see the point|pg||
nt|lestergold: often tho achieves right siding contracts|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi mike and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ruud|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i know about right siding but why not protect the Ck and those queens|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pdjourdain:  Denning has four spades to cash so Micheal looking ahead|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  If scores remain as now Eng & Rep lead on 117 with Wales on 116|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: light opening  helps EW keep Wales out of a making 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: well i wasnt referring to this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards for all pairs are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|steshome:  South is Norman Selway btw|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe a bit quicker but the same number of tricks I guess|pg||
nt|arobson:  I think it will boild down to a 2-card ending with Nortth on play holding @DA8 having to give declarer @DK. Let's see.|pg||
nt|arobson:  A lot of imponderable for young Mancunian Mike Bell; my guess is a trump.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: trump continuation?|pg||
nt|arobson:  He may be worried that his partner will be endplayed and may switch to a club, but I think trump better|pg||
nt|arobson:  N-S have done well to double EW given the vulnerability and that neither N-S have four trumps|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|paulg:  and East is John Matheson|pg||
nt|ady: good slam|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|arobson:  Okay, worried about the endplay. But I think N-S will struggle to get more than eight tricks now.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: but othe odds are that the opening bidder is the stronger hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|the saint: With all the bangers and a solid 9 card fit, the hand was pulling extra. Some risk of missing grand, but could that be bid with confidence if it were there?|pg||
nt|arobson:  S best tumping this and leading a trump through|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|arobson:  Well done South|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

pc|sA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and scarcely mattered on this hand|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|paulg:  one down looks a normal result, although N/S may get too high if they found their heart fit|pg||
nt|steshome:  Looks normal to me|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think its the only reason why modern bidding theorists like these things|pg||

nt|chick: 5@C could have made on the good lie of the cards, but more than likely EW would have sac'd at 5@D, so not much difference|pg||

nt|yke:  I was in a partnership with steven den donder a few years ago, We played in holland in the "meesterklasse" |pg||

mb|1H|nt|lestergold: bridge is a very young game and new bidding ideas are being tested every day|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: oh dont be so modest|pg||
nt|dagold: and would expect east to bid 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  I think they are the favorites in this final|pg||
nt|rodal f: So system for EW is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as Donder and u Yke?|pg||
nt|yke:  I;m not sure|pg||
nt|chick: E probably has a 2-suiter bid available, but would you use it Vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, that looks reasonable alright|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  ofcourse you would, I think now 2@H means hearts an a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: vul and nice 11HP now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w should reach game   but if 3NT may well go down|pg||
nt|dagold: assume north opened 2@h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yke:  ah ok, 2NT means hearts + clubs, they play multi defence|pg||
nt|steshome:  I love North's double|pg||
nt|ady: was as expected   800|pg||
nt|arobson:  Interesting non-transfer by the experienced Welsh East|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: That was hard.|pg||
nt|arobson:  Playing Weak Notrump Acol it would be South in 1NT (after opening it)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good decision on this particular lie of the cards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT with 1@c always promising at least 3|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has a chance   but can go down to a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dagold: cleary this isn't right specs|pg||
nt|arobson:  Many would lead a higher heart with N|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yke:  I'm informed by a specatator that 2NT means a strong two suiter with a minor|pg||
nt|steshome:  Thin spade game missed - likely to be missed at the other table|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Uttam Gupta|pg||
nt|arobson:  Bell does well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems a normal way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and good eve all|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Uttam welcome|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and ty|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s seems normal contract |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 3@H=invit for 4 in @D or @H since a M and a MIN?|pg||
nt|yke:  he could have overcalled 2@H which would be 5 hearts + 4+ minor|pg||
nt|arobson:  Better than in India this morning (the Ian)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Y. Capp|pg||
nt|yke:  so he was thinking if he could afford to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|steshome:  Seriously though chaps, don't you think that doubling on the North hand is winning bridge?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If he finds the @S switch the contract goes down|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, the Italians seem to think so|pg||
nt|mcarroll: otherwise the @Hs can be set up for @S discards|pg||
pc|cA|nt|galadriel: and who would argue with them :)|pg||
nt|ady: declarer will play on diamonds   and likely play low from west  to cater for sing. ace with north|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good morning all|pg||
nt|ady: should just lose 2 more tricks  1 heart and 1 spade|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Hi all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|steshome:  West eschewed leading clubs|pg||
nt|galadriel: @C opener steering Sime away from his 5 carder lead|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||
nt|the saint: Byrne (North) is forever telling the U20s to double on those hands. Playable in 3 suits. |pg||
nt|arobson:  Very good decision here by East to pass 1NT; 1NT will make whereas 2@S stood no chance|pg||

nt|ady: n/s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: minus 2 becoming a habit|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Two trumps and a singleton - I suppose a reasonable rasie|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: is it all artificial then|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u bid suits that u havent got to show what u have got it does make it difficult for opps|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I'd open W hand with 2@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: But how commond by other variants u know better Yke.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another strong club opening|pg||
mb|1S|nt|galadriel: Think we may be in for a bumpy ride|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: because their bids often become ambiguous is double for takeouit or showing the suit thats been bid etc....|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Hello et Bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|steshome:  I am confident that England can bid this game |pg||
nt|paulg:  this would be a good time for Matheson to bid 2@d ...|pg||
nt|ady: there is a complication with 4@S     |pg||
mb|1N|nt|steshome:  Oh my - North is going to struggle to get his spades across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and put a Pass card on Sime's side of the bidding tray for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell is going to bid 2@H this time|pg||
nt|steshome:  And North will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: if north plays 4@S   and east leads J@D    west will have to duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|ady: has chosen the unbeatable  contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it does not seem to matter where the Camrose is held, there are often connection problems in the first session ... very frustrating for the vugraph operators|pg||
nt|steshome:  Nice vulnerable save from the Scots|pg||
nt|paulg:  good pressure bidding|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: I agree with problems|pg||
nt|steshome:  So easy to find|pg||
nt|paulg:  Byrne definitely thinking he has an RHO, LHO and CHO at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: if east leads a club or heart should north play 4@S   dont think it can be made|pg||
nt|the saint: There are no screens in the Camrose - am I right?|pg||
nt|steshome:  He might've done better to rebid 2@S at his second turn|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might hve to bid bid 6@s to end all confusion|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: screens in use|pg||
nt|ady: now 10|pg||
nt|mcarroll: indeed |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: sort of mixture of  Walsh, martens, carrot and ekrons|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But you have the vital intermediates in the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said i would open it for that reason|pg||
nt|pitiful:  east has the shape for 2@c but give weight to his @h honours|pg||
nt|arobson:  What happened on the previous deal, how did 1NT go down?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry was still basking in football|pg||
nt|pitiful:  wasn't watching|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and smiling now I presume|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: they made 8 tricks i did it wrong!|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am syre Andrew would lead @s Jack here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sure|pg||
pc|h7|nt|the saint: Ah OK, makes this hand easier for the players.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Twelve tricks with the clubs behaving. 1Nt showing 18-20|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1@S control showing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  it's not a save is it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes it is :)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: it is now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it would not surprise me if Bell is still thinking|pg||
nt|steshome:  Not sure about the 4@h bid - seems a bit previous - horrible hand to play now|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be made if playing carefull as 9@S comes down   so can plat spades from the top and later discard a diamond on a heart   lose 2 spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@H sounded like he has longer hearts to me. 2@H seemed more descriptive. Partner was still in the game.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i still prefer my initial 2@h over 1@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  5@d looks cold on any lead, declarer just established the hearts|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye|pg||
nt|the saint: I would be surprised if they didn't have that agreement.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doesnt that 7 make it difficult fo s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not that it matters|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we stuck or something|pg||
nt|steshome:  Connection problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes sorry but connection crashing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have gone beyond 3NT which makes because the @H finesse an 3-3 brek produces 4 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|uttam: y i think ,now a days most would open 2s w/west hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: jT empty i wouldnt|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Board 3 can easily be corrected in MOVIE but must be done by the operator. I don't have a remote control (although I wish I had)|pg||
nt|arobson:  Overtricks here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Code is 1NW+1|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|nt|ady: 4@S  interesting    might well be the contract OR    as they lay  will likely make as defence cannot profitably attack clubs    and west has a useful holding in hearts combined ...|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fluff: l|pg||

nt|delberto:  with an overtrick |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: Norht-South may have done well to avoid their heart fit at the other table|pg||
nt|jwit: Indeed|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: since on fairly normal play, 4@h might well not make|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: Declarer might still make 4H.  Can lay down A of trumps and then lead up to Q10, but not clear that will happen|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: well, West will be endplayed more or less every time it's his turn|pg||
nt|delberto:  although West might be end-lplayed even if declarer losees 2 trump tricks|pg||

nt|yke:  and also bid 2@H after 1@S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: me too, it is not a close decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: you will have to wait. I've not done this before!|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3N looks easiest spot here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chick: I can't see bidding over 1@D vul with 3 queens, but after the balance, I might try 2@H (because I have the doubleton spade as backup)|pg||
nt|the saint: Apparently they definitely have that agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: another trensfer i assume|pg||
nt|chilloncan: multi or weak 2 with 7 card suit is highly controversial. personally i loathe the idea, but many successful players will do it freely according to their judgment. one such case is ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 7222 and/or vul. personal decision|pg||
nt|dagold: doubt this is right either|pg||
nt|Walddk5: pass pass  1NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  i expect West is going to bid 2@s after East's reopening double|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: red hence 2h|pg||
nt|arobson:  Is that right? Do N-S play Mini Notrump at Red?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  don't you Andrew?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w will reach a thin game once east opens|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pitiful:  i don't agree witht he 3NT bid|pg||
nt|arobson:  Well done North; not clear to obviate Sam Stayman's convention|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ideally you want to be able to find the 4-4 fit and other partner a choice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: 2@h was going for probably 800|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Prefer 1@H. Still chances of game opp passed partner|pg||
nt|chick: I'm with you, Marshall, weak 2 bids and weak 3 bids are much more different than just the one extra trump|pg||
nt|galadriel: The old problem of whether to open 1 of major or 1NT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: Bergen raise presumably, 4+ trumps and 10-11?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: shrug of shoulders from E|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes good bergin|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Not sure how good it is|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 2@H worked well here|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Interesting action by Towers. Holding a five card suit doesn't want to play against the room|pg||
nt|arobson:  I am with Peter. having two majors increases the chance of finding a fit so the downside of information-giving to 3NT is less|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: seems to assume 1C is not clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we'll be here until tomorrow at this rate|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: 2N was asking, and 3@C showed a poor weak 2 bid in hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: wonder if any point in steyin here|pg||
nt|uttam: but i think east had one more bid|pg||
nt|ady: might get a club lead|pg||
nt|ady: that helps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: connections still awful - will be having problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: I really need a drink!|pg||
nt|ady: 9 on a club lead    3 clubs   2 diamonds     4 major suit tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps he should have opened 2NT|pg||
nt|arobson:  I think he may lead another club - East could have @C1097. And declarer just may go wrong?...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk5: Wales has 3 IMPs more than shown on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that shift will not kill declarer|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: not only 19 but extras for all 4 bullets and 5 card suit |pg||
nt|steshome:  Declarer doesn't know he has 3 clubs though|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17 flat    3NT -1  at this table    6@C-1 in open room|pg||
nt|steshome:  Extraordinary|pg||
nt|ady: if south avoids the club lead  3NT might fail    could lead a spade|pg||
nt|steshome:  Partner is marked with 5+ hearts though|pg||
nt|Walddk5: as board 3 yields 3 IMPs when corrected|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|uttam: 2s pass was speculation|pg||
nt|the saint: I don't think it is remotely close with that suit quality|pg||
nt|steshome:  Is it a problem on a 5-2-2-4?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson will always opened 1@s when holding clubs too, so he can use Gazzilli|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah yes, easier if playing G|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson knows that Selway only has five hearts for his overcall, so will have most of the remaining points|pg||
nt|the saint: If matheson ruffs this, a 4th round of @H will establish South's trump length. Might do well to discard @D here.|pg||
nt|the saint: Especially if as Paul suggests he can work out AQ are offside|pg||
nt|steshome:  Interesting link to a commentary from Liz McGowan provided by a spec event:http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/the-camrose-trophy-2011-by-liz-mcgowan.html|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may discard as there is little hope of avoiding two diamond losers when South has AQ, with no real endplay prospects|pg||
pc|s2|nt|2hplus4: and 150 honoyrs. Not to be sniffed at|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course for money players like me its anathma not to play in no trumps|pg||
nt|arobson:  He will likely emerge with nine tricks via three diamonds and two in each other suit|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Sorry 6 IMPs even|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 120+100|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yke:  I don;t mind opening multi with a bad 7 card suit, the hand is simply not strong enough for 3@H|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|arobson:  Claim|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|chick: 3@H openings are typically weaker than 2@H openings|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yke:  but only vulnerable|pg||
pc|s9|nt|arobson:  Ireland an wles have both made reasonable strats so this very much a three-way fight|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: of course, vul, you have to be cautious|pg||

mb|3D|nt|delberto:  I guess thatSouth will end up bidding 5C|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - 4@s made without much in the way of values, but even if East-West bid it here, they won't play it|pg||
nt|jwit: Not only that but NS even have a reasonable dive in 5C|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|dburn: still, 5@c has quite a lot of losers|pg||

nt|vugraphzzd: I'll correct scores shortly -|pg||
mb|d|nt|chilloncan: for me, it is about the GOALS of preemption, which is to get in the opponents' way. that means a 3H bid is more effective than 2H. you aren't that likely to end in 3HX, and if you ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: do it may be only a small loss (or a gain) against a game they can bid and make|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: exactly :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not for me why hide the d suit|pg||
nt|uttam: bad break, has to be well conducted|pg||
nt|yke:  if you open 3@H with hands like this, and also with a KQJxxxx plus a king, 3@H will be to wide ranged|pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: might as well duck this as not clear what to do had he won it|pg||

nt|lestergold: 5@d not so easy but possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why struggle for an 11 trick contract here|pg||

nt|lestergold: any strong pair would bid slam here|pg||
nt|uttam: 4d deny cl cue|pg||
nt|lestergold: north knows that sam likely to depend on a finesse at worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: sorry about all this - network problems|pg||

nt|paulg:  easier if Bell had not doubled, in this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: board 5 6S-1 S|pg||
nt|arobson:  If The Vul E-W think they can make 4@S all Souths cards tell him they will make. He might even take a unilateral save, could easily be diown two which is eight imps.|pg||

nt|paulg:  this is not the worst slam in the world, just needing the diamonds to come in|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H  transfer response  showing spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzzd: tried deceptive spade play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  Sime just has to avoid a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: shrug of shoulders 6H|pg||
nt|paulg:  and holding an ace that should not be difficult|pg||
nt|steshome:  Undisciplined|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think Iain will lead a spade|pg||
nt|dagold: did he really duck the second club?|pg||
nt|dagold: hard to believe|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if north had overcalled 2@c it would have likely continued 3@d fit, 5@c to west|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my point is why not explore the possibility of 6d and stop in 5|pg||
nt|arobson:  Yes, intersting. I think West would have looked @HAK and the defnsive spade @SA and doubled. Not easy though.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: 5 can go off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not safe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whov was it said clubs disappeared 10 years ago and diamonds are on the way out.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love unsafe contracts if there is a smell of a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think this combined 26 count with 8 card @d fit and the rest of thehand misfitting is one to explore for slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: however caution i.e. un derbidding would be rewarded today|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a viable opinion, but again it goes back to the main goal of preempting. if we are doing it mainly to get in the opponentss' way, then a wider range is BETTER than a narrow ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: range -- we will get to do it more often, and when they opops play the contract they will have a harder time reading the layout|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: i dont think it makes even double dummy|pg||
nt|uttam: qx aqjxx kxx xxx , bidding will likely go the same way?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May go for 1  of 2 finesses. Or to discard @C on @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so worst scenario needing 2 out of 3 finesses i think this was a normal slam to bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|uttam: of course all north will bid the slam ,after they hear south open 1h|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u when east ruffs in on the third round of @ds there is still play left in the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can play on clubs|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I think he'll discard @C and go for cross ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and at least one club will take care of a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe it can be made after all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With K@S falling he may make this|pg||
nt|uttam: depends on trick 1|pg||
nt|yke:  it's generally a good idea not to let your opponents play at the one level in a suit, unless you suspect they have a better fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT or X there. What give ure pard best freedom?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nt feels as a order and a X ure pard give the advice|pg||
nt|yke:  ith such a flat hand, i would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as Terence Reese always said, the more narrowly a preempter's hand is defined, the less effective a weapon it is  ("a dull swrod" was his phrase)|pg||
nt|chick: The idea of not let opps play at the 1 level depends a bit on the auction, I think.    1@D P P ?   is not the same situation as   1@D P 1@H P 1@S P P ?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  he might have worried about 650 v 300|pg||
nt|arobson:  Yes. Declarer is worried about 4-1 hearts given North's double of 1@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: X for me. Free my pard to say his/here meaning.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: in any case club lead defeats 5@d as you cannt ruff spade losers without running into adverse club  ruff|pg||
nt|arobson:  I like this heart to @HA and diamond.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: boy bridge would be a very dull game if we only played in safe contracts|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: now is critical point|pg||
nt|chilloncan: true, chick, but the original comment said "unless you may think they have a better fit", so the second of your sequences would not really apply to the scope of that remark as they ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: have bid 3 suits.|pg||
nt|yke:  well actualy 2 suits, since 1@C can be short|pg||
nt|chick: still different is    P P 1@D P 1@H P P ?|pg||
nt|steshome:  Diamond lead easy to avoid IMO - he's looking at what must surely be the only missing ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  the @c2 will tell Matheson the club situation, which will relieve some stress|pg||
nt|the saint: Any reason to get this right?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|delberto:  no particular reason tobid it tho|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but very tough to bid, though North has made a big 3C bid on that suit|pg||
nt|delberto:  well..4H is an encouraging noise|pg||
nt|jwit: And he sure loves the 4H bid, but surely, the quality of his club suit will slow him down|pg||
nt|dburn: although this might give them a shot|pg||
nt|delberto:  opener has to have his points somewhere...and they are not in spades or hearts (on the bidding)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, his partner ought to have something for 4@h, and it isn't hearts or spades, and it's at most @dAQ - maybe that club suit is not so much of a worry|pg||
nt|jwit: He would love to bid 4S now, if he didn't fear that was offering a place to play|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dburn: he could do worse than just bid six clubs - he won't make seven after partner didn't bid over 2@h, but...|pg||

nt|ppiglett: Very - club switch from N|pg||
nt|petergill: NS are topping the datums so far this weekend in the Camrose. |pg||
nt|arobson:  repeated club leads.. (spec points out)|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: reaching it is another matter|pg||

nt|2hplus4: I would overcall as West|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 3NT   for e/w|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ppiglett: They topped the Datum for the Europeans after Day 3 as well. They are playing very well at the moment. However the Captain didn't want to put them in against England yesterday ...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: evening?|pg||
mb|p!|nt|lestergold: north needs to find out if south has K@d basically even then 6@c may be a punt|pg||
nt|uttam: normal 4h contract here for n/s|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't want to defend all day|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: does the panel all brebid 1N as S?|pg||
nt|yke:  on this hand, you can make 6@S, but it's not a good contract|pg||
nt|chilloncan: rebid|pg||
nt|chick: yes|pg||
nt|yke:  but its not easy to avoid once North knows his partner has 3spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|ppiglett: 2S - a club transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: well, N has pretty bad spade quality. he is going to need some very chunky trumps from S, and S ought to realize he does not have them.|pg||
nt|chick: I don't raise with only 3, although some people do.   Not if there is a better choice, and here 1N is better|pg||
nt|dagold: A vry agressive double |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzzd: S lead simplifies this|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|petergill: With @DQJx dropping, 3@C should make fairly easily. |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: and it should be relatively easy to get S to focus on spades as the big question mark|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been many hands by a lot quest "how to handle it" I love those but go for the specs from beginners and up. All with.|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H is a relay to 2@S, showing 5+|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2N looks like 2 place to play|pg||
nt|arobson:  Could be the dreaded down in 3NT with slam cold|pg||
nt|pitiful:  though some might bid 2@s especcially if playing support doubles|pg||
nt|arobson:  I wonder if they are having a misunderstanding. If 2NT is two places to play then N shd bid 3@H not 3NT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i like 3@h by north assuming they are on same wavelength with regards 2N|pg||
nt|pitiful:  beat me to it|pg||
nt|arobson:  Auction on previous board was as predicted to 5@C dbled|pg||
nt|arobson:  South may be thinking @@If I do bid, what do I bid@@|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S may make another effort|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|yke:  I raise with a 3 card when I have a wirthless doubleton|pg||
nt|arobson:  But facing a partner who reopened with Dbl with 3Nt how can it be right to pass 3NT?|pg||
nt|arobson:  Well done|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|paulg:  Selway might have considered 3@c over the double, but all routes seem to lead to 4@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Later in the play, North could try a minor diversion of dropping a diamond honour on @DA if he wants to. |pg||
nt|arobson:  Now they may reach 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  worthless|pg||
nt|arobson:  Huge decision from South, though he may have been thinking @@what do I bid@@ not @@Do I bid@@|pg||
mb|5C|nt|chilloncan: a very reasonable criterion|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyn: Sorry all seems we have bad connection :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3@d i believe did show a @d stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if theyb reached this sciebtifically its impressive|pg||
nt|lestergold: although i think most red bloodded bridge players would bid 6@c with north's hand alm,ost regardless|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats wha\t i am saying|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi all back hope the laptop stays on..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and s could have HQ|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Play to ruff hearts and lose two trumps and two hearts.|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS switch to trumps, East needs to set up the long @d while he still has an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: The trumps swtiih looks ugly looking only at the North and West cards, but we can see it is an OK thing to do|pg||
nt|petergill: switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Current scores are found by scrolling down at http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Camrose-best-current5.pdf|pg||

nt|petergill: Same bidding at other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Padraig is doing well to give this a very long think|pg||
nt|petergill: The club switch from AJx into Kxx is almost impossible to find, without (like us) looking at all 52 cards - then declarer needs to play @D before dummy's last entry is gone|pg||
nt|petergill: and on @DA, North might play a @d honour to try to confuse declarer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Not so sure Peter. North knows that E is 1-4-2-6 and wants to ruff hearts. It is therefor attractive, playing E not to hold the A of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Privat chatroom Cornelia and Yke? Or me to find mine?|pg||
nt|rodal f: WE ARE HERE TO HELP SPECS!!!|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 2N showed 5 spades and slam interest|pg||
nt|ppiglett: And therefore need to play trumps not to beat the contract|pg||
nt|petergill: Low club in case partner has bare queen?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pitiful:  still slam is nothing great|pg||

nt|ady: cue bid their way to the 5 level      still not too high|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell wondering about 6@c?|pg||

nt|2hplus4: 4@S automatic with E|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: ask p ,to do some thing intelligently|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a less memory intensive version has cheap rebids showing doubtful trump quality, as that is one of the primary  issues for slam in a 53 fit|pg||
nt|ady: North contesting a 2nd time|pg||
nt|ady: south wont be too happy|pg||
nt|dagold: I like the 1@s opener but here it is leading to a minus score|pg||
nt|petergill: Given that the 4@h bid at equal vulnerability makes partner likely to have singleton or void @h, yes, four and three quarters, you're right.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Known singleton/void H. Therefore with Kxxx, x, Axxx, Axxx - 6 is a good shot. |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont agree witgh north's 4@h with thse hands i like to bid 3@hs and give opps space to do the wromg thing|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: yes but that D9 is useful|pg||
nt|uttam: east can contribute in defence only|pg||

pc|s4|nt|rodal f: And take ure -1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: "enterprising" is a word straight from the BBO VuGraph Commentator's Manual|pg||
nt|chick: anyone know the right way to play the heart suit?|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you think 5@s would be reasonable by South over 4@H?|pg||
nt|arobson:  Mature from South|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: not everyone would raise to 4@H with west hand   would normally expect more than 2 card support|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boedhy: offcourse he can now make it by finessing in @d but he doesnt have a count yet|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|2hplus4: No He has 3 trumps and 3 tricks All cards should be working for @S|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@d looks like it is making for East-West on this hand|pg||

nt|mcarroll: yes - room for slippage|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: presumably the double shoows values why panic and bid 4@s at these colours take a safe penalty|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: your points i daresay|pg||
nt|boedhy: funny now he has. South has 4@s 2@h (form the bidding) and probably 4@c....|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|boedhy: so odds are on finessing in @d|pg||
nt|arobson:  Needs to switch to clubs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: if u are making 4@s what is happening to 4@h?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chilloncan: it is true that NS are badly in need of a swing, but you are more likely to get a BIGGER swing by passing. you certainly dont have a game after P has passed, but what you might ...|pg||

nt|ppiglett: Not a good choice or contract with such a bad hand I'm afraid. This Banzai 10's and 9's enticing S to open a 15-17 Nt. |pg||
nt|pitiful:  if 2@s is a weak jump overcall i am obviously playing the wrong game|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ady: this should not be too taxing for Neil|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, but perhaps South's 1NT at this suitable vulnerability in 3rd seat was partly to try to "preempt" EW out of any spade contract?|pg||
nt|petergill: EW make 3@S (I think), so minus some 50's in 3NT is no disaster|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yes fair point |pg||
nt|petergill: Even 4@d might make if the defence doesn't switch to @d in time|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: South did not convert to 4@H as he knew that, opposite a passed hand with all his queens and jacks, 4@h must have too many losers, but the 9 trick game might fluke making|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

nt|yke:  on this hand, 5@C is not a very good contract, |pg||

nt|ady: neither Irish player had anything sensible to bid   even at that level   |pg||
nt|mcarroll: I wonder is there a tank or another crash?|pg||
nt|ady: more likely the crash    been happening regularly yesterday and to-day    usually it seems at the closed table|pg||
nt|arobson:  I think a club not a diamond from dummy was better|pg||
nt|arobson:  Another heart from S and this will lilkely go down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dagold: best is to win this and play the diamond K|pg||
nt|dagold: he must win and play the diamond K|pg||
nt|dagold: if he wins and tries for a club ruff declarer makes easily|pg||
nt|dagold: by ruffing 1 heart|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|delberto:  1D ?|pg||

nt|dburn: no idea|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: possibly 1@d denies a five-card major, or some such|pg||
nt|delberto:  it now seems to say that it showed hearts|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jwit: Might make with a diamond lead.  Anything else, probably comes up a trick short|pg||
nt|delberto:  a diamond lead will help in that suit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|delberto:  and there is no certain entry to West for the third round|pg||
nt|dburn: board 9 was flat when South gave Salisbury enough help in the bidding to guess the spades|pg||
nt|dburn: and board 10 was another swing to WBU|pg||
nt|delberto:  so if declarer plays clubs form the top...he should prevail|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

nt|jwit: Spades are safe, clubs are not|pg||
nt|delberto:  and on this layout..he could have claimed|pg||
nt|dburn: ...the spades aren't guessable by declarer, and the clubs aren't negotiable|pg||

nt|galadriel: Yes, when you have so many HCP, partner may not re-open|pg||
nt|paulg:  I was thinking that you could be missing slam .. more of a concern at a reversed vulnerability|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy: he must duck this...|pg||

nt|vugraphzzd: It's driving me crazy. Need several bacardis at this stage|pg||
nt|petergill: Previous board: On spade exit, it's reasonable for North to assume @SK is offside, as otherwise spade to North's !Jx might backfire if North has Jx, xxx, Kxxxxx, xx or similar|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: I think so too - but it's possible opener has a weak NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d is a transfer response showing 4+@h|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT likely to make n/s   but not liikely to be bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm pretty sure the double is takeout of hearts|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|boedhy: probably went 1 off...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: passing with a good 6-bagger dosnt appeal to me at all|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   may be reached   and could make if west fails to lead diamonds early  so that east can ruff and return a spade|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@H shows 3 hearts in a balanced hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ppiglett: absolutely. But bluff and double bluff at play.|pg||
nt|petergill: When the Buffett Cup was in Wales, there were similar connection problems from the hotel in a different part of Wales. |pg||
nt|petergill: Exciting quick bidding to a decent contract, but 4-2 breaks in both minors make the play very hard. |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I mean 4-2 and 5-1|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Win the diamond Ace , play a spade to the A and finesse the eight if diamonds? might make!|pg||
nt|petergill: When @DQ drops, perhaps (double dummy? @D6 can be run (9th trick), and perhaps a 10th trick might emerge out of thin air? |pg||
nt|petergill: East would pitch a @h (not @D) on 3rd trump, as he can see the @d's in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: If clubs are led twice from dummy, East has to withhold @CA both times|pg||
nt|petergill: West has to, I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not easy, after this unrevealing bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: interesting hand 4@s losing 3 trump tricks makes 3n a struggle|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont know if my comments about the slam hand came through before i was disconnected, so i will repeat them now: S did not play to best advantage. attacking hearts first was ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plausible, but:  (1) he should lead small from dummy instead of the king, just in case he can slip past the Ax. But more importantly...........|pg||
nt|arobson:  Look at play at other table, declarer might have made 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzd: 20 mins left|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  right Anne ... you have to look at South first and see how nervous he looks|pg||
nt|steshome:  I'm not sure opening is on my radar with that West hand|pg||
nt|ady: little chance now for 4@H from north side    diamond  or even spade lead good enough|pg||
nt|paulg:  England finally on the board in this set with a part-score swing on 27|pg||
pc|h9|nt|arobson:  Club finesse...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|the saint: If that is the case and dec is playing something like a 6-0 fit. You might get game in 100s anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: poor double  opposite a pre-empt      seems not the auction though|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  can be made |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could have bid 2s now has to bid 3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: n/s  stopped in 3@H    but that looks like down 1 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well with west's hand all tops elsewhere but single spade i would bid 41s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s|pg||
nt|boedhy: dont know what 3@d is but uses up a lot of space.|pg||
nt|boedhy: 3NT now in the right hand and with a @h lead...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime feeling pleased with himself no doubt .. although clear to balance there is risk but the opponents take the push|pg||
nt|the saint: Both black suits now frozen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: espen wouldn't have bid 3h if vul!!|pg||
nt|steshome:  But he is vul?  Oh you mean he didn't see the vulnerabililty on the board?|pg||
nt|paulg:  part of the decision on bidding 3@h is dependent on how freely you raise with three-card support|pg||
nt|ady: assume the double by Carrol was really pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: I thought the @S2 might be suit preference for a club, but now it makes|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: when  pard is weak u want to paly in 41s when he is stong it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|chilloncan: (2) when he sees that trumps are 3-0, he should turn to clubs. giving W two chances to discard means E is extremely unlikely to get the defense wrong if he wins ace on second ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: round. better to hope for E to have 4 clubs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: no need use up any space had e opened 2d|pg||
nt|lestergold: all roads lead to 41s east cannot take his partner out|pg||

mb|2H|nt|paulg:  Good slam reached by Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  This was the first board of the event for Short/Walker, so they were also quick out of the blocks|pg||
nt|arobson:  Tricky hand to bid, Ireland bid 6@C (that was the bad news for Ireland). The good news...they made it (on a non-heart lead)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south has an awkward choice over 2@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  No-one from Scotland will recognise them from that comment|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: slam hand was a 22-IMP swing. making -- as declarer should have -- would win 11 instead of losing 11.  then the margin would only have been about 20 with enough boards to play to ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: give hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: 6@s close here..|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: guess the h|pg||
nt|arobson:  I would never have considered pass. Wd choose between dbl, 2NT and...2@S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  would you have passed as north?|pg||
nt|arobson:  I think South has been very supine here|pg||
nt|wendle: As it stands (unofficial) Wales 162; England 160; Ireland 158; Scotland; 156; WBU 152; NI 110|pg||
nt|arobson:  The lack of a fourth spade is major worry for North though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: yes double heart finesse is the odds play and both wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mike you didnt say why e pssed first in hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h should be 4 down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: much better than playing a@h and then guessibng on next round but today |pg||
nt|boedhy: and south will not lead a @h now... |pg||
nt|lestergold: because he had 4 hearts and was disciplined|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: 3@S bid in OR   by south  after north transfer|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|arobson:  5@C made at the other table so 5 imps (ish)|pg||
nt|arobson:  Scotland are having a very good weekend...|pg||
nt|arobson:  I think winning the second weekend but perhaps with a tad too much to make up|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: Rosen opened 1@S  in OR  and after transfer at the 2 level South broke with 2@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: old fashioned idea not to preemopt in 1 major when you hold 4 in other in front of pard |pg||
nt|uttam: misguess dias and spades! |pg||
nt|chilloncan: was 2N forcing?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|boedhy: What was 3@h ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I had a discussion with avide Bird on this subject a few years ago and he doesnt agree at all about that mickey mouse 2nd suit|pg||
nt|yke:  I think it was forcing, it's modern bridge to play 2NT as forcing|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: David|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south might have risked a double of 4@h depending on what that means|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: This looks like more imps to Ireland|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  North-South in both rooms have done well on this board, never easy when your opponents open|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said its an old fashioned view and a lor of controversy about it|pg||
nt|arobson:  What would you bid over 2@H Peter?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: me, when i hold a 6-card suit headed by KQ i bid it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Agree with u Yke|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if 1S was natural then a NF 2N would seem an odd choice. or maybe they take the view that 8 tricks in NT vs. 9 in spades is not going to hurt you all that often when W has a ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one-bid hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: but it seems the likely explanation u were seeking|pg||
nt|uttam: well spade prob solved on lead, now play twice dias to dummy, ruff one h|pg||
nt|ady: had east not opened  possible the salm might fail  on the club and heart lay   west might overruff 3rd club|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: i knew what u would say and i knew i would disagree|pg||
nt|boedhy: bidding looks ok. But maybe because of the double he will get the @h right??|pg||
nt|uttam: or guess the dias, lose a h club and dia= all roads lead to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yke:  you can also include strong hands with fit or semi GF clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: you heard it here, folks: if we play 2N as NF, apparently we are prehistoric:):)|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think prehistoric,  2N shows 18-19, responder is allowed to make judgments|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that means NF|pg||
nt|rodal f: For better player at earth it have been standard since start 1990. I was late out.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yke:  a specator told me 2NT was 4 cards spade support|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|uttam: looks 11 now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: i would not say you were wrong but it is true that p[ard will never believe that you have 4 hearts on those hands where the winning result is to play in a 4/4 hearft fit|pg||
nt|uttam: w d ace coming down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ugly choice but probably 2NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: and if declarer  could get a full count and finesse the @D it makes|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: every bidding principle propostition has a counter argument|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: yeah like 4 to the j opposite 4 to the Q nuttin|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c7|nt|dburn: not much, I guess, and chancy to double 4@h as North - but you gotta do it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chilloncan: i will start playing it as forcing then, so that i can become a better player|pg||
nt|arobson:  David Greenwood chose 3@C but I like Peter's 2NT. You can play "system on" ec|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yke:  finesse to the safe hand, carefull declarer play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yke:  a bit unlucky spades are 4-1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Opener 1@S - 2NT=4@S.     1@S can be 5HP so 2NT?    My last there.|pg||
nt|arobson:  etc|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pitiful:  don't really mind most actions|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not cleear to me|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: 2@s not ridiculous, if you must bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pitiful:  no|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i agree|pg||
nt|arobson:  NOt clear but I must say you have to use a card that isn't green at some point don't you?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am not a fan of pass|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|dburn: you never are, Peter|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: and if u pass he wont believe you hold KQ to six|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure john but there are hands wher the problem of quality doesnt matter because partner has the high heart cards|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|boedhy: @d 3... discard...not going for the double @h finesse|pg||
nt|yke:  but he can still make it if he discard the acoe of clubs, but that's impossible to find|pg||
nt|pitiful:  never seem to catch up|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cJ|nt|chilloncan: was just writing the same thing:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pitiful:  if 2NT is double i can always run to 3@c to increase the penalty|pg||
mc|7|nt|jcomyn: as u said there are all sorts of opinions on this one|pg||
nt|wendle: As it stands (unofficial) Wales 164; England 160; Ireland 158; Scotland 156; WBU 152; NI 108. Next update at start of Stanza 2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, both North and South had marginal decisions and both took losing actions - no real blame except to East-West|pg||
pg||

nt|jwit: 4 of either major makes here, though hearts is better|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|delberto:  this looks like a fairly routine major suit game|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they can give England some trouble here, they may yet be instrumental in bringing the Camrose to Wales|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: Well, they're off to a good start on the first two boards, reaching the par spots|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rodal f: All on but 12 is hard|pg||
nt|chick: 2 boards to go, doesn't look hopeful for Begijntje|pg||
nt|dburn: who have, I should say, played very well throughout this series|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i have been impressed with what i have seen|pg||
nt|arobson:  yes|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|yke:  a boring 4H 11 tricks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dagold: a chance for some imps for England if they can find 5@c and make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzd: tmid 3H|pg||
nt|ady: Ireland got 10 on hand 18  making 4@H     in OR  the Irish played in 4@D   down 3  undoubled|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzzd: should be quick anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: patriotism aside (which is probably where it should be), it would be great for Wales finally to win this thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Welcome everyone to the last round of the English Lady Milne trials|pg||
nt|ady: good swing for england|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: no, though they could easily gain a game swing on the last one|pg||
nt|pitiful:  shold be 1 imp, small mercies for England|pg||
nt|pitiful:  should|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East really did bid 4@h England could score more than 1 IMP|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what about the cricket this am then |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well here lay down 7 as cards lie but is six even a good contract it needs spades breaking and hearts not 4/2 with offside k etc|pg||
nt|paulg:  This was probably the first board of the match at the other table|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: this is not a bad slam and they didnt even try in the open room|pg||
nt|uttam: 3nt no chance on d lead|pg||
nt|yke:  3@S is smolen, GF to make sure the strong hand plays the contract|pg||
nt|yke:  5hearts plus 4spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  So the Scottish pair did well to bid the slam straight out of the blocks|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d game forcing checkback|pg||
nt|dagold: or even 3N and make it on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|boedhy: yes very good pair this As I said before they play in dutch competitions. We have something called topcircuit. And there they are close to making the final 16 which is very good|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a slam which needs cards to behave reasoably kindly as hand falls apart when they don't|pg||
nt|ady: this a potential swing for England    looks as though 4@H can be defeated on a spade lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be defeated on a spade lead if North had more spades|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|idc: Results can be found at: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j|pg||
nt|dagold: I guess Bell will offer 3N now|pg||
nt|dburn: England in dire straits as usual, rescued by bowlers suddenly remembering what to do - could this be an omen?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but I would like to see Wales win but not at our expense|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chilloncan: i would not be surprised to see EW bid slam in the other room, knowing they need a lucky swing|pg||
nt|dagold: Hanlon needs to stay off the diamond lead although declarer may missguess clubs(unlikely)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|idc: Though round 16 results are still to be posted|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they have a good solid team|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: kind cautious though|pg||
nt|uttam: as  cards are , cant stop dec bringing home 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: slam is not totally hopeless|pg||
nt|paulg:  rare for the defence to complain about the 5-1 break|pg||
nt|dagold: so now if he plays clubs in standard fashion he will make|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dagold: danger is that he decides south might be longer in clubs due to less diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: last Spring Fours was an all-Welsh final with some very tough teams in the field|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yke:  4@H is minimum, with a maximum he would have bid 4@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dagold: moment of truth|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well it is cold, but a priori it is terrible|pg||
nt|chick: oops, result is in, 4@H+2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: in the other room|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dagold: I don't balme him|pg||

nt|delberto:  yes..very alert|pg||
nt|dburn: you might make a game here, though it's not a great contract|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: although when West opens the bidding, it's not so bad|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jwit: I like Dbl with the North hand, even with the bad distribution.  You have support for any suit, and it will be a lot more difficult to back in later.|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: and I suppose they may reach it now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: since South might just bid it|pg||
nt|delberto:  maybe south will raise to 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|delberto:  and that will be that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|delberto:  I htink that's normal|pg||
nt|dburn: normal conservatism rather than normal aggression, I guess|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, 4S looks pretty reasonable with the opening bid by West, but stopping in 3 is not unreasonable.|pg||

nt|pitiful:  said|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|chilloncan: i think so but not sure|pg||
nt|arobson:  If South shows majors, Nortyh will bid game (huge cards)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: should do|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: can make 4@H  |pg||
nt|delberto:  how are you? not seen you for a very long time :)|pg||
nt|delberto:  sory pvt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzd: lots of writing between Byrne and Hanlon|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  This will be a very heartening start to the weekend for the Scottish team, who were under par in January|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  in fact down  defence can take 1 club and 2 spades   and a 3rd spade promtes a trump ttrick|pg||
nt|pitiful:  might make 2@s opposite your balance Andrew|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: perhaps they should have played bridge instead of golf|pg||
nt|ady: also as pointed out had north led a diamond last hand   south could win and switch to K@C   and ruff out the club discard     also a low club lead would do   but that inot going to ...|pg||
nt|ady: happen|pg||
nt|ady: could not understand the auction or play    4@SX   makes with an overtrick   and 5@D   should make   and 6  if not defended properly|pg||
nt|ady: what was the double of 5@D?|pg||
nt|arobson:  Okay small solace for England, they will end the set 33 imps down|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idc: This looks like a normal 4@h, but both finesses wrong and 2 Aces to lose|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, and a great big thank you to our excellent operator, Frederic Delforge :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S on double-dummy for EW|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bravo Frederic:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyn: Thanks all Last hand see you soon|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is likely that you have a fit in clubs, so I think 4@c is well judged|pg||

nt|vugraphzzd: 14 was 1NT +1 by E|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|boedhy: so maybe some 5 imps for begijntje but still BOB a very handsome lead. Think they will win it...|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that might be all right if he doesn't lead a heart, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: tough decisions for the captains before the final set|pg||
nt|pitiful:  see yu all later|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  2@d is game forcing checkback|pg||
nt|dburn: ...he won't not lead a heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: That was seemingly the obvious lead, but again it will make life very esy for the declarer.|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer won't play quickly - he has to worry about his third club|pg||
nt|dburn: and about conceding a heart ruff if he doesn't draw trumps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  3N is a better contract. the clue is that E-W have almost all the quacks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  the scottish way is always to show hearts before spades when responding to checkback|pg||

nt|galadriel: Maybe he thinks E has shown a slam try with @D?|pg||
nt|ady: both sides opted for a part score|pg||

nt|dburn: so the last 16 boards will have been a waste of time|pg||
nt|brolucius: It as entirely possible that South held only one trump for his jump to 3@S. Declarer has chosen a line that might overcome that distribution.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|paulg:  For a change the Scots travelled down yesterday and I think they've played better for it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that likely for South to be 4=2=1=6, because that splits clubs strangely - still, it was possible|pg||
nt|dburn: although with that shape, South would probably have bid four spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4-3-1-5?|pg||
