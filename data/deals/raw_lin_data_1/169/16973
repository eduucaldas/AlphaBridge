pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: Two aces missing.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong-handed, yes, but will still make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  needs both @s ace and @d ace in place tho:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|d7|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|luffe12:  normal attitude on preemts - do not have a major side suit!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|luffe12:  both sides play Reley Precision - but the result on this board is poor|pg||

nt|bjacobs: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: good morning|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: they're talking system|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: we'll start in a few minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: we are missing a Blakset-Røn convention card.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: it's coming up|pg||
nt|pelu: I have :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fine !|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but Jens Auken doesnt :)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS: 5 card major , better minor - 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: Peter, which is the base of system of the pairs ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: They start without...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|an|4+!s|nt|bridge_one: 1N forcing one round|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: welcome everyone|pg||
mb|2C|nt|nigel_k:  6@h is a pretty good contract and the trumps can be safety played for one loser|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair slam here, that won't make ... will East splinter?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: NO ! so no 2/1 - 1N=4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Røn and blakset play 1@c nat or 15-19bal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course forcing the same|pg||
nt|pelu: EW: weak or strong 1@C - 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Christiansen and Auken play a natural based system|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|nigel_k:  However a diamond lead and continuation will create a second trump loser|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can't see a safety play in trumps - I think 6@H will fail|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2N pass  means to play  natural|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|skaftij: Måske en kravpas situation som de spiller det?|pg||
nt|pelu: the fiendly @h-position =  play for 2NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need also a friendly position of @C|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: Very efficient by E/W ... just bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: should be push board... but will he win it?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|pelu: der er lang vej til 9 stik hvis han ikke løser ruderne|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps one diamond ruff here, then @HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: 12 "safe tricks" if @h is 3-2, so i dont think he'll make it.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he makes it, it will be misplayed ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but 4-1 in konows hand is maybe a good possibility after the preempt in 2@d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Life is full of possibilities, but you can't go playing for a 4-1 break and going down against all the 3-2 breaks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think what he would really like to do is find a play that makes the contract on all the 3-2 breaks, and also if South has singleton 10 or K of hearts|pg||
pc|sK|nt|skaftij: KA har vel vist 12-14, 3NT vild satsning|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: But one diamond ruff and @HQ it was (picking up at least singleton 10 of hearts with South)|pg||

nt|jbgood: people tend to ignore that when they have hearts... with spades another matter. However, some play a convention that gives you an opportunity to show a long minor and 4 of a major|pg||
nt|luffe12:   :o)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|luffe12:  Anyway Team Schou will need some tailwind in this session to pick up the deficit|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Hello Dennis and Leif|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Last session - lets see, what they can do about it|pg||
nt|luffe12:  hi Roland / Dennis|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|luffe12:  better go to 6@h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  assume 3@h is 4h + longer minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzww: 3H shows 4 card H and asks partner to choose between 3 NT and 4H|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hello all sry was away and wlc guys|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: 3NN=  er koden|pg||
nt|luffe12:  As 4H is a looser here - 3NT seems a good shot|pg||
nt|luffe12:  well judged by Gregers / Michael|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H a good play or I am imagining.:)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  even 7 on the layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True 6 would be fine.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Not exactly a flying starter at  1 for Schou|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Appearantly Nielsen - Boesgaard got further overboard than here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1 turned out to be a nightmare on both tables. OR playing 7@H, with two aces missing.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Even a club back in with HJ will not defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|luffe12:  = well done guys|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jbgood: a very good play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: by E|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: Have you seen the bidding in the OR for this board?:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kerasidis: nice double|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|jbgood: securing a @d trick before going after the hearts|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Natural - E bid 2NT i 2. round - 3S - 3NT - 6H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow and now the play, makes alright, cards placement friendly.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  The lead takes away a vital entry - Hagen can play on Spades or Diamonds|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Both lines will work |pg||
nt|rnmalik: @Hs are 3/2 which is a big plus. |pg||
nt|luffe12:  :o)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  No line will work if Hearts are 4-1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|luffe12:  Will not make the long & winding road easier :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzww: jeg taster det lige ind når der er en pause, der var sket en fejl|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|luffe12:  Yes not enough entries for the defense to create 5 tricks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Nice play|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: sorry, seems like i missclicked C10 instead of 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: so south still has C10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  no problem Peter|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|luffe12:  It's fine that we have slowed down here - means that the scoring will be updated all the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: yes, however, carrying on like this will lead to a lot of penalty points|pg||
nt|luffe12:  We are falling behind with 3 boards|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@D would be more easy to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: the spade lead made it difficult|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: hi Joao|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|pelu: slem? ok - men 6@H i Syd - den sættes kun hvis Vest underspiller klør-farven og får en @d trumfning|pg||
nt|skaftij: I lukket rum spillede Askgaard lydigt @d ud efter Lightner D|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pelu: X or 1NT in West - I prefer 1NT - I show my type of hand and HCP|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H with 3 cards (better maj) when weak it is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: there is no way Christiansen can find out that Auken does NOT have an opening hand. Therefore 1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: of course he does|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but not fit for spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: East just knew he was going to see a small diamond from partner|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Partners are like that|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: good morning|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that's the 8th trick|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: So far West has bid a failing slam, and found the lead to give away 2NT.  And IMO, he's yet to make a mistake|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - didnt fancy leading away from his KJs. Dont blame him|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1N overcall by west more effective that double|pg||
nt|pelu: but 1@H is a winner: 3 @H-tricks, 2@S, 1@C and 1@D|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@h + 3@S + 1+1 in minor for defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: vulnerable could pass at 1@H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: 8xxxx, after double by west, isn't sufficient to reopen|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|pelu: in B1 - where Auken had to fight for 8 tricks, Fredin-Nielsson in 3NT|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: normally better to play 3N that 2N - there are very few the hands where you make 2N and not 3|pg||

mb|1D|nt|luffe12:  HC Nielsen in OR is having his 60th birthsday tomorrow - and a day off - I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: 2 @c 5+@C 11-15?|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: yes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  another one coming up :o)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 7 on @H lead, as was done in the OR.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  what a monster|pg||
nt|kerasidis: will he try to secrifice in 6 spades?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes endeed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|luffe12:  Hagen might consider CA at 7 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: & cant be bid, play 6 and make 7.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: nice bids|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|kerasidis: ups|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jbgood: lots of artificial bids - will they lead to 6@c or 6 NT?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Mikkel & Jacob play Reley Precision|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldnt resists of 7 either|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|luffe12:  As long as they keep bidding!|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jbgood: en exhausting system, but according to a kind kib S has shown his exact f\distribution by now|pg||
nt|luffe12:  6C seems to be the nicest contract, as it is by North |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|andreasw:  Easy play here:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: a small point in the play is not to play the heart ten, but lead low twice from dummy|pg||
nt|jbgood: for the overtrick - unless E leads a @d|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: not a challenger|pg||

nt|sharkey: I suspect the lead will be the same OR as well if defending a NT contract|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If a strong NT, S will open 1@d though|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: NS play strong @c system|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont exp that they can stop before 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S seam normal here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|skaftij: Hmm|pg||
mb|p!|an|not 3!h|nt|skaftij: 1@C kan være 3 kortsfarve|pg||
nt|pelu: ved HC om 5@C er naturlig?|pg||
nt|skaftij: Hvordan opfatter HC 5@c?|pg||
nt|skaftij: Usædvanligt meldeforløb|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass probably denies 3@h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, write now in alert|pg||
nt|pelu: would u - in red - overcall 2@D??|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jfaria:  now what from N?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: West will be grateful that he hasn't given away imps, at last|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And this is a tense play problem - You might have to find the @DQ here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's difficult for declarer to neutralize the clubs by holding up, because then he risks a heart shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: If he misses @DQ likely down I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, maybe you should hold up a club - they are usually continued, and then you can finesse into East's hand, and it doesn't matter so much if it loses|pg||
nt|jfaria:  easy with 3@d |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D overcall possible bec AQx @H (very good after 1@H in North) - so it is usefull to give the lead against 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - agree|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't bid 3@D in west with bal hands and wothout top H in @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: On the other hand, long clubs with West implies long diamonds with East - this is a really difficult problem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by North means interesting hand (probably no GF)|pg||
nt|pelu: u exp - for sure - 6 card @D - for me 3@D ok - but problem with 2@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to compete with @D isn't a great idea after open and bid by opps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@D vuln is dangerous and not take great obiectives|pg||
nt|jfaria:  They did stop @s to get in...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: looks like 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: for -2 imps if they find 4@s in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need a top H in @D to entry - same cards with Kxx in @D instead J10x was sufficient (and nobody would dbl!)|pg||
nt|pelu: but has to play small @S from A to get 2 @H-tricks for defense|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: for his X N sh have @SK so small @S now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nigel_k:  I agree, hold up then finessing into East is safe whether clubs are 5-2 or 4-3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jfaria:  nice|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|nigel_k:  So can fall back on heart ace onside if the diamond is wrong|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, not entirely Nigel, because if the @HA is off-side, you still only have 8 tricks if the diamond finesse loses|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right counterplay|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|skaftij: Pudsigt ligespil|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: what about J@C by north instead 3 ? (to call @S)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: So declarer did really want to find a winning guess in diamonds ... I sympathize |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Right so you need either @dQ or @hA onside and the alternative needs @dQ with the short clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|sharkey: if he assumed long @C with W shud still finesse against W|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: in Op S (Nilsson) open 1@D - so no overcall :)|pg||
mc|7|nt|pelu: they are in 4@s|pg||
pg||

nt|jbgood: will they bid slam?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be a flat 6@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: NS can make 4@H, good @H guess requied.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|jbgood: the common method to get prd to show his major is xx, or as here, where 3@h is pass or correct|pg||
nt|luffe12:  another game on small values|pg||
nt|luffe12:  underlines the importance of 9-10 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  Nice action from E-W here making it hard to get to slam|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 4 loosers|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: yes - S has to do it all himself|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: ... more or less|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: 2@h would be 6-cards 10-13 in EW system therefore 1@H|pg||

nt|sharkey: North is really shut out here |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't really like 5@C, because it tends to put partner under a lot of pressure if he has a good hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5@c should not be based on a lot of high cards so I think North really has to pass|pg||

mb|1N!|an|5-12|nt|pelu: OR now playing board 13 - we are way too slow here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  But I agree it makes it hard for partner|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: if 6@c is right with konows hand, then Hagen shouldnt bid 5@c!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's another way of putting it|pg||

pc|c4|nt|nigel_k:  West cannot switch to a trump after winning @sA so may not need the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nigel_k:  But if W plays low, East can lead a trump|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't like this line at all ... just the sort of setup where West's doubleton @CQ gets promoted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Much prefer the "draw trumps and claim" approach here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's not like the defence is going to allow him to ruff a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: blakset must duck to make it hard and even then its all up to the @d finesse. Or am I wrong?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks about right ... but South is playing for West to misdefend.  His line only helps if West started with @SAQJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Meanwhile, how do you like East winning a spade at some point and pumping through a high heart?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With clubs 3-1 this line needs the diamond finesse and @sA onside just like playing trumps from the top does|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yep|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And as Bill says, it risks going down with clubs 2-2|pg||

nt|jbgood: or was 2@hy forcing?|pg||

pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: He's got the 4-4 in the blacks .. can he get the red suit shape?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  North is going to discover South's exact shape which makes it easy to choose 6@d|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And South is limited to 14 so grand is unlikely but QJxx xx AQx Axxx is possible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  I think declarer has to rely on 3-2 trumps. He can't play another @d now (assuming N ducks) because of the uppercut possibility|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
