nt|bjacobs: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: good morning|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: they're talking system|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: we'll start in a few minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: we are missing a Blakset-Røn convention card.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: it's coming up|pg||
nt|pelu: I have :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fine !|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but Jens Auken doesnt :)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS: 5 card major , better minor - 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s not you - a bad keyboard. I have one too:)|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, maybe we should divide the comments (only kidding) ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: welcome back|pg||
nt|duschek: Thank you - hello :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Here we go again, wellcome all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: in this room we have Sweden vs Denmark|pg||
nt|duschek: Also in the commentators' room :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Fredin and Nilsson playing natural with a twist of Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: And Bjarnarson Askgaard playing presicion @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Peter, which is the base of system of the pairs ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: They start without...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Yes, also within the commentators if Ralf has turned up.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: 1N forcing one round|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|stigw: A partscore in Di N/S I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in the old days Dbl for penalty|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jacob Duschek|pg||
nt|duschek: Hello!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Jacob|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi Jacob.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nigel_k:  6@h is a pretty good contract and the trumps can be safety played for one loser|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair slam here, that won't make ... will East splinter?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: NO ! so no 2/1 - 1N=4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Røn and blakset play 1@c nat or 15-19bal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course forcing the same|pg||
nt|pelu: EW: weak or strong 1@C - 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Christiansen and Auken play a natural based system|pg||
mb|2C|nt|stigw: I hope that 2 cl is nonforcing - yes.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nigel_k:  However a diamond lead and continuation will create a second trump loser|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can't see a safety play in trumps - I think 6@H will fail|pg||
nt|stigw: Not so dull as it might seem !|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you mean Fredins improvisation:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: yes Ralf :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|duschek: 2@C should definitely be non-forcing when everybody bids|pg||
nt|duschek: I am not sure whether a Swedish pair plays it as forcing or non-forcing if South passes|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, ypu are right, but not otherwise as I play from an unpassed hand.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4D|nt|bridge_one: 2N pass  means to play  natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij: Måske en kravpas situation som de spiller det?|pg||
nt|pelu: the fiendly @h-position =  play for 2NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need also a friendly position of @C|pg||
nt|duschek: North has shown a 4-card diamond suit and denied a balanced hand, as an opening 1NT would show 12-15, and all 16+ hands open 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzwu: askgaard has @d109|pg||
pc|hK|nt|duschek: An unusual auction indeed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzwu: but will bjarnarson read the position?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Very efficient by E/W ... just bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: should be push board... but will he win it?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu: der er lang vej til 9 stik hvis han ikke løser ruderne|pg||
nt|stigw: As North/South probably makes 4 sp, this should be OK for Blakset, even if 3 down was possible.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps one diamond ruff here, then @HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: 12 "safe tricks" if @h is 3-2, so i dont think he'll make it.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he makes it, it will be misplayed ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but 4-1 in konows hand is maybe a good possibility after the preempt in 2@d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Life is full of possibilities, but you can't go playing for a 4-1 break and going down against all the 3-2 breaks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think what he would really like to do is find a play that makes the contract on all the 3-2 breaks, and also if South has singleton 10 or K of hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|skaftij: KA har vel vist 12-14, 3NT vild satsning|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|stigw: Now 1 down at most.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: @sJ is trelde shift for @h return... will s believe it?|pg||
nt|duschek: Or rather Lavinthal?|pg||
nt|stigw: He will be 1 down even without h-shift I think.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: true stig|pg||
pc|h9|nt|stigw: He will probably make 8-9 tricks I guess.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|skaftij: Nyd det |pg||
nt|duschek: Seems to be 9 - East has three high cards which he will make, and that will be it|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dT|nt|skaftij: av|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: man har vel sine 9|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe 4 sp is not makeable on best defence, but stille I guess a + for Blakset here. Mistæke not to clear the last trumph.|pg||
mc|8|nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||

nt|jbgood: people tend to ignore that when they have hearts... with spades another matter. However, some play a convention that gives you an opportunity to show a long minor and 4 of a major|pg||
nt|luffe12:   :o)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|luffe12:  Anyway Team Schou will need some tailwind in this session to pick up the deficit|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|Walddk4: Hello Dennis and Leif|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Last session - lets see, what they can do about it|pg||
nt|luffe12:  hi Roland / Dennis|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  better go to 6@h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  assume 3@h is 4h + longer minor|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzww: 3H shows 4 card H and asks partner to choose between 3 NT and 4H|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hello all sry was away and wlc guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 3NN=  er koden|pg||
nt|luffe12:  As 4H is a looser here - 3NT seems a good shot|pg||
nt|luffe12:  well judged by Gregers / Michael|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H a good play or I am imagining.:)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  even 7 on the layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True 6 would be fine.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Not exactly a flying starter at  1 for Schou|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Appearantly Nielsen - Boesgaard got further overboard than here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1 turned out to be a nightmare on both tables. OR playing 7@H, with two aces missing.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|luffe12:  Even a club back in with HJ will not defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|luffe12:  = well done guys|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|jbgood: a very good play|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice double|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|jbgood: securing a @d trick before going after the hearts|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Natural - E bid 2NT i 2. round - 3S - 3NT - 6H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow and now the play, makes alright, cards placement friendly.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  The lead takes away a vital entry - Hagen can play on Spades or Diamonds|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Both lines will work |pg||
nt|rnmalik: @Hs are 3/2 which is a big plus. |pg||
nt|luffe12:  :o)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  No line will work if Hearts are 4-1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@D would be more easy to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: the spade lead made it difficult|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Nilsson dodged a bullet by passing 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: new board|pg||
nt|duschek: Welcome :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: did fredin forget to draw trumps?|pg||
nt|stigw: 2 down instead of 1 down - still unpredictable.|pg||
nt|ritong: interesting to notice fredin is not quite awake|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: hi Joao|pg||
mb|d|nt|duschek: I wonder where this one will end|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|pelu: slem? ok - men 6@H i Syd - den sættes kun hvis Vest underspiller klør-farven og får en @d trumfning|pg||
nt|skaftij: I lukket rum spillede Askgaard lydigt @d ud efter Lightner D|pg||
nt|stigw: Really wild boards it seems. Another 4 sp N/S, but sacrifice at the 5-level for E/W possible.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: 5@h doubled is my guess...|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@h pass 1 NT would be ok  when doubled, perhaps 3@h is more obstructive|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|ritong: unless 1NT has a deep conventional sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Difficult for N/S now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: It is always nice when you can describe your hand in one bid as Fredin was able to here|pg||
nt|duschek: I am pretty sure that 1NT shows a weakish raise - we saw it in the previous section with 3-card support and appr. 6 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: is this askgaard going over board?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pelu: X or 1NT in West - I prefer 1NT - I show my type of hand and HCP|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H with 3 cards (better maj) when weak it is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: there is no way Christiansen can find out that Auken does NOT have an opening hand. Therefore 1@s|pg||
nt|duschek: North felt he had a stopper|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|vugraphzwu: of course he does|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but not fit for spades|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, that was a deep blow, 2 down.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like -2|pg||
nt|duschek: However, 2@S makes easily, so down two is inexpensive|pg||
nt|duschek: 2@H that is|pg||
nt|stigw: 2-3 imps for Blakset may be.|pg||
nt|duschek: In the open room we may get an auction such as 1@H by West, 1NT by North|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Nilsson doesnt know its down two no matter what|pg||
nt|duschek: What would you bid on the 1st round holding North's cards?|pg||
nt|stigw: One of our spectators has observed, that 4 sp could be defeated by underleading all the heart honours at trick 1 !|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: East just knew he was going to see a small diamond from partner|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Partners are like that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: so down 2?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would try 2NT|pg||
nt|stigw: Now at least 1 down, but I dont think Nilsson will find the underlead !!!|pg||
nt|duschek: There was a similar defence yesterday against a 5@H contract. However, it only held declarer to 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes ew can take 9 tricks i @h|pg||
nt|stigw: Safe !|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: good morning|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that's the 8th trick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: So far West has bid a failing slam, and found the lead to give away 2NT.  And IMO, he's yet to make a mistake|pg||
nt|stigw: It doent matter what Nilsson does, but he doent know trhat of course.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim and next|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: yes - didnt fancy leading away from his KJs. Dont blame him|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1N overcall by west more effective that double|pg||
nt|pelu: but 1@H is a winner: 3 @H-tricks, 2@S, 1@C and 1@D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stigw: And nevertheless I think, that finding the di-shift would have been impossible even for Fredin.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@h + 3@S + 1+1 in minor for defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: vulnerable could pass at 1@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: 8xxxx, after double by west, isn't sufficient to reopen|pg||
nt|duschek: When you hold the trick with the @H9, finding the diamond shift seems easy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d9|pg||
mc|10|nt|stigw: No, he found it immediately. You can never predict anything with him around.|pg||
nt|duschek: But underleading the @HAKQJ when partner has doubled 5@S would be crazy|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzww: yes|pg||

nt|kerasidis: will he try to secrifice in 6 spades?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes endeed|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kerasidis: ups|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbgood: lots of artificial bids - will they lead to 6@c or 6 NT?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Mikkel & Jacob play Reley Precision|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldnt resists of 7 either|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|luffe12:  As long as they keep bidding!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: en exhausting system, but according to a kind kib S has shown his exact f\distribution by now|pg||
nt|luffe12:  6C seems to be the nicest contract, as it is by North |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|andreasw:  Easy play here:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: a small point in the play is not to play the heart ten, but lead low twice from dummy|pg||

nt|sharkey: I suspect the lead will be the same OR as well if defending a NT contract|pg||
nt|stigw: Good claim.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on N|pg||
mb|2C|an|precision|nt|duschek: 6@C I believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: 6@c is good|pg||
nt|stigw: I agree with your analysis Jacob.|pg||
nt|duschek: Yet another distributional hand with lots of possibilities for both sides + the commentators to go wrong|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nigel_k:  If a strong NT, S will open 1@d though|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: NS play strong @c system|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont exp that they can stop before 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S seam normal here|pg||
nt|stigw: Looks 3 nt N/S, but 6 cl is a winner I think.|pg||
nt|stigw: The boards are really going wild in this session I must say.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|skaftij: Hmm|pg||
nt|stigw: 5 sp E/W, but they midgt end up in 6 perhaps.|pg||
nt|duschek: Off two key cards, I think they can handle it|pg||
nt|stigw: Diamons not good as trumph-suit here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: they won't end up there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S must be thinking where are the @s|pg||
nt|stigw: 5 cl from South, what then Fredin ?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|skaftij: 1@C kan være 3 kortsfarve|pg||
nt|pelu: ved HC om 5@C er naturlig?|pg||
nt|skaftij: Hvordan opfatter HC 5@c?|pg||
nt|skaftij: Usædvanligt meldeforløb|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass probably denies 3@h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, write now in alert|pg||
nt|pelu: would u - in red - overcall 2@D??|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: you must guess @c though|pg||
nt|duschek: The defence will lose their spade trick if they attack hearts, vice versa|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Stig:)|pg||
nt|duschek: Interesting - both sides have a good major suit fit, and so far both sides have found a dubious minor suit fit|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jfaria:  now what from N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West will be grateful that he hasn't given away imps, at last|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And this is a tense play problem - You might have to find the @DQ here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's difficult for declarer to neutralize the clubs by holding up, because then he risks a heart shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: If he misses @DQ likely down I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, maybe you should hold up a club - they are usually continued, and then you can finesse into East's hand, and it doesn't matter so much if it loses|pg||
nt|jfaria:  easy with 3@d |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D overcall possible bec AQx @H (very good after 1@H in North) - so it is usefull to give the lead against 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: can you make 6@c on a @h-lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: North has initiated a relay sequence. 2NT shows a minimum|pg||
nt|stigw: But in South's hand a heart lead might still defeat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! @s will go away|pg||
nt|stigw: 6 cl I mean.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: yes - agree|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't bid 3@D in west with bal hands and wothout top H in @D|pg||
nt|duschek: But declarer may be short of an entry for the discard|pg||
nt|stigw: Exactly, Should be in Norths's hand.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On N 6@c looks good|pg||
nt|duschek: If North asks with 3@C, South will show his exact distribution, and North will probably sign off|pg||
nt|duschek: Or maybe not... let's wait and see|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, I guess they remain in 3 NT.|pg||
nt|stigw: Now easy 4 Sp I thougt, but no - Fredin always surprises me.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: On the other hand, long clubs with West implies long diamonds with East - this is a really difficult problem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by North means interesting hand (probably no GF)|pg||
nt|pelu: u exp - for sure - 6 card @D - for me 3@D ok - but problem with 2@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to compete with @D isn't a great idea after open and bid by opps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@D vuln is dangerous and not take great obiectives|pg||
nt|jfaria:  They did stop @s to get in...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: looks like 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: for -2 imps if they find 4@s in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need a top H in @D to entry - same cards with Kxx in @D instead J10x was sufficient (and nobody would dbl!)|pg||
nt|pelu: but has to play small @S from A to get 2 @H-tricks for defense|pg||
nt|ritong:  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d will go down, but 5@s is OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: he's not happy now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: but @sA and trumph queen missing etc. so not a good slam |pg||
nt|duschek: North hopes for a 3@D response, which would show a 6-card suit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|stigw: This should be a minus for Blakset now.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|duschek: 3@S shows a 1435|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: for his X N sh have @SK so small @S now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  I agree, hold up then finessing into East is safe whether clubs are 5-2 or 4-3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jfaria:  nice|pg||
nt|duschek: The auction on board 1 in the open room was interesting (where Fredin bid 2@C non-forcing and Konow made an overtrick in 2@D)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|stigw: OK bidding (and guessing from our side !).|pg||
nt|duschek: 1@D-(1@H)-double, which showed a 5-card spade suit. Jacob Røn passed it out for penalties with his @HQJ10x and collected two undertricks - 300 and 5 imps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  So can fall back on heart ace onside if the diamond is wrong|pg||
nt|duschek: Opener passing a negative double (or what you would call it this time) is a rare occurrence|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Well, not entirely Nigel, because if the @HA is off-side, you still only have 8 tricks if the diamond finesse loses|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right counterplay|pg||
pc|sK|nt|duschek: on the 1 level|pg||
pc|sA|nt|skaftij: Pudsigt ligespil|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: another claim for 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: what about J@C by north instead 3 ? (to call @S)|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: askgaard ducked not imagining fredin having AQxxx|pg||
nt|ritong: since i do not believe my eyes, i m just checking|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You have to somehow weigh up the "two chance" option of one of the red cards with West, against the a-priori odds that East has @DQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not a calculation you will find in any text book|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|stigw: Good start for Blakset in the open room - it becomes more and more close.|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: why not 1@c in north?|pg||
nt|stigw: Incredible, I must withdraw my comments, but phew !!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if Konow miss the title on this board he will not sleep good tonoight:)|pg||
nt|duschek: 15 so-so HCP, a clear 1@S opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: im not the expert ;)|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe they got some red-wine in the dinner pause - no, they have postponed the dinner till after the match ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: opening a (presumed) strong @c does not offer nice control|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, being supermax allows for enthuiastic bidding later on|pg||
nt|ritong: if any|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: :)|pg||
nt|duschek: At any rate I would never upgrade this hand to 16|pg||
nt|stigw: It certainly looks as if Blakset has got "the upper hand".|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: had it been 1@c with AQJxx, Qxx, x, AQxx?|pg||
nt|ritong: ditto|pg||
nt|duschek: I don't think so - those are just 15 good HCP, which are shown perfectly with a 1@S opening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: ok|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jfaria:  tuff to avoid 3 nt|pg||
nt|duschek: North must be careful though|pg||
nt|stigw: Can and should be defeated.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: will it be easy if fredin goes up with the ace and then returns a low club?|pg||
nt|stigw: + 8 in board 1 despite Fredin throwing away an extra undertrick.|pg||
nt|duschek: Opening 1@C you must apply the brakes for the remainder of the auction. Opening 1@S you can continue showing your hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: 2@H generic GF (only points ? )|pg||
nt|pelu: 11+12 and no tricks - + bad stopper = not at good game :(|pg||
nt|jfaria:  if natural as they r bidding must be inv +|pg||
nt|jfaria:  after 2 nt from N , no reason to stop... flipping a coin maybe |pg||
nt|bridge_one: however in team match at high level all play game with 25 hcp in the line|pg||

pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: What if West was void?|pg||
nt|stigw: On board 3 it takes a lot of courage from Fredin to underlead in Sp, instad of hoping for KJ bar with South. Still I dont understand the outcome of that.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hT|nt|ritong: or not|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s6|nt|ritong: or yes|pg||

nt|stigw: Well done N/S.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He wants to ruff a club anyway|pg||
nt|duschek: Perhaps South's pass denied holding a heart honour - then North had no choice but to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|duschek: Otherwise I agree with you, Stig|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|duschek: A point in North's defence is that West's 5-card spade suit remained unmentioned during the auction. Shouldn't South hold the @SKQ doubleton?|pg||

nt|bridge_one: sry, 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: 2@h would be 6-cards 10-13 in EW system therefore 1@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Intermediate jump overcalls|pg||
mb|1S|nt|martmom: test|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This looks like a winning contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just about the only winning contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: North is really shut out here |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't really like 5@C, because it tends to put partner under a lot of pressure if he has a good hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5@c should not be based on a lot of high cards so I think North really has to pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4 @H seam the contract, but the table isn't easy to understand|pg||
nt|duschek: Askgaard played 2@S on the 4-3 fit on board 2, not 2@H on the 6-1 fit. He managed 9 tricks for a loss of 2 imps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: OR now playing board 13 - we are way too slow here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  But I agree it makes it hard for partner|pg||
nt|duschek: successful test|pg||
nt|ritong: worked|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, let's not argue with success.  And 5@C was perhaps a reasonable choice anyway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As you point out - it shouldn't be stuffed with high cards, and I suppose it isn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: if 6@c is right with konows hand, then Hagen shouldnt bid 5@c!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's another way of putting it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wrong this time when @C don't break.... :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, South needs 2 of 3 good things to happen|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he gets his 2|pg||
nt|duschek: Board 3 was a push at 3NT making 12 tricks. Neither pair tried 6@C|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 nt probably the best game here, but is down on a club lead and ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: i think something special has to happen for konow to win this match...|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|stigw: This wont be a dance on roses, but as E/W maybe can make 3 nt, - 200-300 wont hurt as much.|pg||
nt|ritong: 12 boards left, no?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: i just don't feel table prescense|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jfaria:  "1h 4@h |pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@h*|pg||
nt|duschek: E/W play 5-card major, so 1NT is probably an attempt to show a weakish 3-card raise|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: and you won't get away from Fredin alive without it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but lets see 12 boards as you say|pg||
pc|sT|nt|duschek: I am not sure about 2NT - on those cards it looks like a natural bid|pg||
nt|stigw: I dont think that will make on the actual lie of the cards.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: coffee-hand - bach|pg||
nt|duschek: There seems to be a loser in each suit for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe it was Game-forcing ?|pg||
nt|stigw: I agree that it certainly looks Blakset at present, but still 12 boards remaining. A turnaround-board is neede for Konow.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jfaria:  N would prefer to be declarer but with the aces position all ok|pg||
nt|pelu: back in 2min :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West cannot switch to a trump after winning @sA so may not need the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|stigw: And it wont be this one I assume.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: no this doesnt look like a big board|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nigel_k:  But if W plays low, East can lead a trump|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't like this line at all ... just the sort of setup where West's doubleton @CQ gets promoted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Much prefer the "draw trumps and claim" approach here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's not like the defence is going to allow him to ruff a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: blakset must duck to make it hard and even then its all up to the @d finesse. Or am I wrong?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks about right ... but South is playing for West to misdefend.  His line only helps if West started with @SAQJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Meanwhile, how do you like East winning a spade at some point and pumping through a high heart?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With clubs 3-1 this line needs the diamond finesse and @sA onside just like playing trumps from the top does|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yep|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And as Bill says, it risks going down with clubs 2-2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|stigw: + 3 for Blakset on board 2, and Konow still has to survive both 3 and 4 + this one.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|jfaria:  nothing wrong can happen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, seam a safe hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stigw: 2 NT I mean can be played af GF with 2 Cl as only an invitational hand.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if you play trumps from the top and they divide, now you can take the diamond finesse in some safety|pg||
pc|h5|nt|duschek: Their convention card gives no hint, unfortunately|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: squeeze fo 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|stigw: Right guesses both in Sp and Hearts are needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! S can keep @d and N @h|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stigw: And even that is impossible I think - H 10 covered and what then ?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, nothing could go wrong on this layout, so 600 it is|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stigw: If it is a sweepstake, I'll give 2 to 1 for gamblers on Konow (even if I havent seen the first 2 boards from the open room).|pg||

nt|duschek: Sorry, misread the score sheet - board 5 has not yet been completed in the open room|pg||
nt|duschek: 2@H shows 10-13 HCP, so a very constructive opening|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but could have been 13 ....|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bridge_one: 3@S or 4 @S ?|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, Fredin is unpredictable, but if a turn-around was in fact taking place, it is only "a small one".|pg||

nt|pelu: 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: drumroll.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: 14 no sgl, probably pass|pg||

mb|d|nt|jfaria:  good decision by Auken|pg||
nt|jfaria:  still thinking on board 4 maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: for once fredin is reasonable, and still he s contested in his decisions  poor peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pelu: fint så forklar lige 2@S - jeg mener den kræver 2ut med minimum og eller 4-farver fra neden?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like 2@C = majors (multi-landy)|pg||
nt|sharkey: may go down with trump leads|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the layout demonstrates why this is better than 2@D for the majors (Capp) - South could ask North to bid his better major|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: N/S play good/bad multi here 2@c being majors 2@d being a weak major and 2M being "strong" major|pg||
nt|duschek: 4@S made on board 4 in the open room as Jacob Røn led the @HA, probably tempted by Lars Blakset's raise of his overcall|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and probably because of the @h-support from S|pg||
nt|stigw: Rønn started H Ace because he got H support in the bidding !|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3 @c viser max |pg||

mb|p|nt|stigw: Dont like the double here, better 3 nt.|pg||
nt|duschek: I was just about to propose 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|duschek: Not a natural bid after having been content at 3@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jfaria:  think he would bid 4 if vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: @d 10 now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: J@D strong lavinthal |pg||
nt|stigw: Sorry I repeat your excellent comments !!!|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: and even if pard mistakes it, well, you have arguments to offer|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: Good play by East - preserving his @HQ which will be the entry for the third trump play|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: good lead and good play. Well done Jacob|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lars shudnt think too much here - just continue pd's good start|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: let's see if Blakset "get's it"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, it's not critical, because if he does play a minor, that will promote the entry for the trump play.  But it does seem right to just continue trumps|pg||
nt|duschek: Using that convention, you could raise to show a heart honour, or redouble to show a raise without a heart honour - or maybe it's the other way round, I have forgotten that :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: being left in 3NT, i mean|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stigw: Yes, it would be good to have a convention there, but perhaps RDBL is needed to show something different. May be Hagens pass is the best move.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: now close to 10|pg||
nt|pelu: very close|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must get @s right|pg||
nt|pelu: safe for 9 to play @s to king|pg||
nt|jfaria:  since Blakset failed to play @d he can misguess @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Is Auken wondering how to win if Røn has 3@s now?|pg||
nt|pelu: not in 3@s|pg||
nt|duschek: Using the redouble to show a doubleton honour in partner's suit has gained a following|pg||
nt|duschek: Some use the 1NT response conventionally to help showing or denying that vital honour card|pg||
nt|stigw: Good Jacob, wheter taken natural (impossible) or for the minors (of course), it would have been ok. Not that 4 cl isnt a normal end station on these cards, but 1 down I guess.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jfaria:  y|pg||
nt|pelu: itys a pseudo prob - @SK 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: is it worth it to risk -1 for an overtrick?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  right|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: This is tough though|pg||
nt|pelu: need to discard a @h-loser|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzwu: @S + @c skvis?|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|snorris: kan ikke nå at dukke 2 gange|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was not at all easy to duck that second heart, but it was necessary.  Otherwise, North's @H6 will be the 8th trick|pg||
nt|jfaria:  better slow and right ..|pg||
pc|h5|nt|skaftij: næppe nu|pg||

pc|c2|nt|duschek: So there are lots of options available. The point is that you do not need the RD and the 1NT bid in their traditional meaning that much, with the strength evenly distributed ...|pg||
nt|duschek: between the two sides|pg||

nt|luffe12:  Hi Harmon|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: right - and some even as "pick a minor, prd" - lots of methods around:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Since if you bid pard doesn't have to worry about whether you responded on 8 hcp or 3.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|luffe12:  but its on the right side now - so a D lead will not "ultim" declarer|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

mb|1S|nt|snorris: 4 i Major  her|pg||
mb|2H|nt|skaftij: en hård 4@h når nieren mangler|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, but that was very lucky or unlucky, whatever you prefer Ralf.|pg||
mb|d|nt|jfaria:  still Auken must thought the Q was onside at 99% :) but he played safe|pg||
nt|duschek: Board 5 was the expected push at down one; however, Askgaard tried it at 3NT after 1@C-1@D-1@S-2@H, where 1@C was strong, and 2@H showed 5-7 with 3-card support|pg||
nt|stigw: - 100 a small + for N/S perhaps.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: ja|pg||
nt|snorris: men de kommer i den|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 12 for 12 - no maj fit - 3N for sure :)|pg||
nt|duschek: Askgaard/Bjarnarson open almost all hands with 10 HCP and a 5-card major, so this one is not even close to passing in their style|pg||
mb|2S|nt|skaftij: Nej|pg||
nt|snorris: tror jeg...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: going DOWN|pg||
nt|pelu: but why use time here - u are late - and only 9 or 10 tricks???|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 11 HCP it may be, but that is no takeout double in my opinion|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than pass from N?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Another point may be that N may not have lead @H at 2. trick if holding Qxxx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|stigw: Poor N/S here I'm afraid. The cards arnt helpfull to them, unless Nilsson should go berserk.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: 99% - 2 singletons in W?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he ignores the @d position|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2N with 12 because sgl in @H|pg||
nt|stigw: Not much wrong with 3 cl I think.|pg||
nt|duschek: Fredin goes for the throat!|pg||
nt|stigw: Dangerous to double, but probably 1 down.|pg||
nt|stigw: Or ?|pg||
nt|duschek: Perhaps West will be squeezed from the majors in the end position?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: a special situation where you double lebensohl knowing that the suit is @c|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, and the Di 10 coming down in round 3.|pg||
nt|stigw: Cl, cl and clubs shoulg vive at least 1 down.|pg||

pc|s6|nt|vugraphzwu: konow saw Røns trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: now he wants to do the same|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And you know, it's not a bad idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's even more indicated here, where you can expect West to be something like 3-2 in the majors, given the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: yes here you might lead away from Jxx or Qxx. Cause trump lead is looking good|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: @s2 is explained as "maybe" lavinthal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N easy to predict|pg||
nt|jfaria:  and Ron made a vuln preempt|pg||
nt|pelu: is 2NT the correct bid - I would prefer 3@D = 4-1-4-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: not everyone plays that as natural, peter :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with QJ doubleton in @D easy to make|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: @C-lead best - but diff to find af the 1@C opening - proved to be 4-5 card suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2N better because need to becames the declarer ...|pg||

pc|s9|pg||

nt|snorris: ikke længere|pg||
nt|pelu: nu blev den meget bedre :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: only if partner has a trump bigger than the 6 - doesnt look like it, but he did|pg||
pc|d5|nt|duschek: Now no club for the nine, please :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Sensational lead I must say, but still not laydown by any means.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: 9@D to know anything about the layout|pg||
nt|stigw: Still declarer cannot be sure on the cl-suit.|pg||

nt|stigw: Should get it right for only 1 down.|pg||

nt|duschek: Blakset lost last year's final by 2 imps, so they may assign some importance to 1 imp|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 ut ser fornuftig ud|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead...|pg||
nt|stigw: Fredin isnt interested in Major-suit contracts when he has an even distribution.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: I don't see much upside in coming in with that West hand with a passed partner.  At best you might make a partscore, and the risks are obvious|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|sharkey: agree - and 5332 not adding anything to the hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct to play NT in opposite hands at ACES|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree and you have a good lead against 1NT. Also it is easy for opponents to double after they have opened 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: again 1@S = 4. suit or naturel - why not 2@S to desribe the hand?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the "passive" lead doesnt help declarer a lot|pg||
pc|hT|nt|skaftij: Det spiller man også i lukket rum|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best lead, but there are at least 9 tricks on any lead|pg||
nt|ritong: the cases where this goes down and 4@s is cold are compensated with all the times opponents will not find the right defense, starting with opening lead, when given zero info|pg||
nt|duschek: Could easily be the wrong decision though, but as we know, Fredin does not always opt for the theoretical auction|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: Still if he somehow makes this, we will have to bow to his judgment|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 3@D so no loss if only off 1|pg||
nt|duschek: I am not sure about their style. Askgaard/Bjarnarson open almost all hands with 10 HCP except if balanced with no 5-card major, so for them this would probably be a 1@D bid. For me ...|pg||
nt|duschek: not, but it is a question of style|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: @dK wd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6@D need to find 6@D in west, but must play the chance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 7@D|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think this is some kind of agreement as we saw on board 7, but may ve wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: yes its the 2. time 4.suit ops 4-4-4-1 and NT-bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need a endgame play to make 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably starting with 9@H from dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 10 tricks on a crossruff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: I assume 2 NT Lebensohl - thus S knows N has @D|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|duschek: On this hand it is only a question of overtricks though|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: i spil 8 blev der X ved 3 ud af 4 borde - og alle kom i 4@h over 3@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: 9 tricks will impress me now|pg||

nt|bridge_one: to play @D 3/3 is a chance (not high probably)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: in that case better to take K@D and play small @D for H second|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D 9@H my line preferred|pg||
nt|pelu: that only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K@D probably second|pg||
nt|jfaria:  or with Q..|pg||
nt|pelu: East would have maded it easyer for pd discarding a @d |pg||
nt|bridge_one: for this reason A@D - after )@H or small @D|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry @s|pg||
nt|jfaria:  W must play @h now?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guessing Q@C second make 9 tricks also now|pg||
nt|pelu: OR also on board 9 (but have played board 13-14-15-16)!|pg||
nt|stigw: Board 8 was nonvul., so 1 imp it should cost (not necessarily if they were vul.).|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|bridge_one: 1N 13/15 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: or some conventional variante|pg||
mb|3H|nt|duschek: 1@C=16+ with any distribution. 1@D=5-7 with any distribution. So now they should know how high, but where?|pg||
nt|duschek: A bad hand for the law of total tricks - N/S make 3@H, E/W make just 2@C with 9 and 10 trumps respectively|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: isnt it possible to make 10???|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: nice 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  we r late but still think that a @h from Ron in previous board would sink the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to play in @h is better for E/W - guessing all make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stigw: Board 8 turned out to be a winner for Konow, so the dropped overtrick might after all not mean anything.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|ritong: completely possible|pg||
nt|duschek: I can only make 9 - that's why we lost yesterday :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, best for E/W to selle out, as the cards are extremely favourable for N/S.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: I think I see a lead :)|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, Røn languishing in 4@H on the 4-3 fit and E/W immediately forcing the long trump hand with club leads|pg||
nt|duschek: Down three eventually|pg||
nt|stigw: Impossible to understand for me.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 here as well as in 4@s|pg||
nt|duschek: Difficult auction, but I cannot really see passing 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: how would this go on 3x @c?|pg||
nt|stigw: Must be a misunderstanding, even if it might not be an expensive one.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if @d are 3-3 N can make but must play on 4-2|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sharkey: not what you "saw" Bill?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: trump?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, what were the odds, given the previous deals?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They should have noticed a pattern by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: all in favour|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A trump not so good on the last hand probably|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I agree with the non-trump lead here, because the spade suit feels threatening to South.  So attack in a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: S doesnt know E is weak with @c :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Having the East hand concealed is going to make the defence much harder|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead looks good for defence - no reason for declarer to guess the layout|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right - it looks like he has the invitational hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: still not an easy contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has to guess the club layout, and I don't see why he should|pg||
nt|duschek: I think Hagen simply fears a doubleton or singleton spade in North, but then, if North might have a 2-3-5-3, he might also have a 3-3-4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: 4@h is a much easier contract than 3@h|pg||
nt|stigw: He might very well end up with 10 tricks, no matter what the defence does.|pg||
nt|stigw: Another imp for Blakset on board 9. It more and more looks like a "home-run".|pg||
nt|ralfwil: everything is well placed for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, simply play a club to the jack to establish a discard|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|stigw: Repeted Cl-leads might turn this into a night-mare.|pg||

nt|stigw: No, only 1 down now.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But he has already overcome one hurdle - not going in @HA there|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: And when declarer pitched from dummy, he donated a second undertrick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All South has to do here is count ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6304 is marked|pg||

nt|bjacobs: hmm|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, that could be ugly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The revoke is not established, so he can take that card back, but I'm not sure what happens next|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think it is still a penalty card - but winning @hA and leading @dQ is good enough to beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: it is a penalty card. I think Hagen feels quite sick to his stomach now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On board 6, the brilliant defence was not duplicated at the other table so a 4 imp swing|pg||

nt|bjacobs: So he goes off into 4 minor, and down you go|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Sweden not happy|pg||
nt|stigw: The defence not the best, as They might have put it down 2 (so a possible "swing" for Konow).|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: board 10 and 11 can be a swing|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: efter udspil i sort mod 4@s får man flere chancer for at finde skiftet til @d|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|duschek: 4 clubs, 2 spades, 2 diamonds and 1 heart at the least|pg||
nt|stigw: And super continuation, now its difficult.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: He's got the 4-4 in the blacks .. can he get the red suit shape?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nigel_k:  North is going to discover South's exact shape which makes it easy to choose 6@d|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And South is limited to 14 so grand is unlikely but QJxx xx AQx Axxx is possible|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer has to rely on 3-2 trumps. He can't play another @d now (assuming N ducks) because of the uppercut possibility|pg||

nt|snorris: ligner et sving til HC|pg||

pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Well they really are into the high science here|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: looks like 12 "easy" tricks here|pg||

nt|stigw: No, he has 9 tricks withou any finesses I see.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  6NT does have squeeze chances or you could get a trick on the lead|pg||

nt|duschek: Hello Ole|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: Personally, I would give up on trying to describe it, and start with a pass|pg||
nt|oleberg: man havde doblet en 14-16NT hvilket viste en enfarvet minor|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a squeeze against W in 4@h? |pg||
nt|oleberg: Sorry private|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nigel_k:  Precision 2@c followed by 3@h is actually quite descriptive as it happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: 3@h or 4@h now?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud open 1@C - but don't like it....|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would pass also|pg||
nt|jfaria:  oops was hoping 4 1nt by S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even if @sAQ is winners, so use one of them to ruff a @d if possible|pg||
nt|duschek: 3@S is invitational with a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|duschek: 2@C-2@S is less constructive|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: It's a lottery really.  The only wrong answer is one made with conviction|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: There's a cute but tricky defence to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: East had a chance to axe 3@H with !VAJ9 behind...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: double from røn would have been a good raise... will konow save them?|pg||
nt|sharkey: *@CAJ9|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Matias|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: no|pg||
nt|stigw: Might be difficult to make this.|pg||
nt|duschek: No beautiful 2@C opener, but 1@H showing a 5 card suit is impossible, and 1@D is probably too much of an experiment|pg||
nt|stigw: If not impossible.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! discard a @h on @dQ and 3 rounds of @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: just the bid N was looking for :)|pg||

nt|duschek: "Can there be a spade canapé?"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|Walddk4: 9-7 so far in this set. A combination of excellent bridge and rather dull boards|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: I think it´s important to have different bids for support in partners suit. Offensive and defensive. 3- or 4-card support|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: 2@S ville ikke være mit umiddelbare valg her|pg||
nt|duschek: I agree - there is a huge difference between playing 5-3 and 5-4 fits|pg||

nt|stigw: On board 12 it was Fredin's devilish double of 1 di, that made the swing possible, I think.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|stigw: Excellent played. Worthy winners I'll call the Blakset team even with 2 boards to go.|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: agree Stig. I think Fredin Nilsson have a very good score|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: congratulations for Blakset team|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Did well to reach this game|pg||
nt|jfaria:  rutine 3 nt|pg||
nt|stigw: Should be down at leat 1 here.|pg||
nt|duschek: Identical auctions at both tables|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 10 or 11 tricks in 4@H - bidding is the challenge as Bill points out|pg||
nt|henryb:  boring!|pg||
nt|stigw: The possible sacrfice in 5 cl can be a little expensive with a H lead from South, but that didnt turn out.|pg||
nt|duschek: Very likely a push board|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: This seems a normal auction, to be honest, yet it's just a perfect fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: so now its almost even|pg||
nt|henryb:  as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and so is 16 presumably|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Velkommen tilbage|pg||
nt|skaftij: tak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S vurderede rigtigt ved kun at melde 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Man kunne let komme i 4|pg||
nt|duschek: Konow's lead neither showed nor denied the king|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: same lead in open room|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 @S at second trick|pg||
nt|pelu: and after normal play - communication problems he will find @CQ|pg||
nt|duschek: So we can congratulate the Blakset team - the match was level after 3 sets, but everything went one way in the 4th|pg||
nt|stigw: Nothing dramatical in the last 2 boards I'm convinced, so Blakset's team is the secure winner this time.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Til gengæld kan man ikke sætte 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: men så risikerer man at presse øv i 5@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR East raised - not sure that's profitable in the long run|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: i think 2@h was 5-5 in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: and with a limited partner (strong club system) 3@h is ok i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: still not sure I wud raise....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duck the lead, @H and after 10 @S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|skaftij: Næppe hvis man følger 2-3-4 reglen |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|skaftij: Jo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now finesse in @C (@H are protect)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so better take first round in @H|pg||
nt|duschek: He can claim now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|duschek: Fredin got it right nonetheless, but the defence may get it back via a crossruff|pg||

pc|h5|nt|skaftij: Godt selskab|pg||
pc|h8|nt|nigel_k:  And there is a possible pickup on 13|pg||
nt|duschek: Bjarnarson made an overtrick in 3NT on board 14, so Blakset will enter the final section with a 6 imp lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! Last board and Blakset are well deserved winners (with swedish teammates:))|pg||
