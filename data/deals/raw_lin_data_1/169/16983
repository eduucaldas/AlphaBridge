mb|p|nt|luffe12:  Hi again|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: hi|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: tak|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: hello|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: Two aces missing.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong-handed, yes, but will still make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  needs both @s ace and @d ace in place tho:)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|luffe12:  normal attitude on preemts - do not have a major side suit!|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|luffe12:  both sides play Reley Precision - but the result on this board is poor|pg||

nt|bjacobs: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: good morning|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: they're talking system|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: we'll start in a few minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: we are missing a Blakset-Røn convention card.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: it's coming up|pg||
nt|pelu: I have :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fine !|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but Jens Auken doesnt :)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS: 5 card major , better minor - 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s not you - a bad keyboard. I have one too:)|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, maybe we should divide the comments (only kidding) ?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: Peter, which is the base of system of the pairs ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: They start without...|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: 1N forcing one round|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzwu: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|stigw: A partscore in Di N/S I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in the old days Dbl for penalty|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jacob Duschek|pg||
nt|duschek: Hello!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Jacob|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi Jacob.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  6@h is a pretty good contract and the trumps can be safety played for one loser|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair slam here, that won't make ... will East splinter?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: NO ! so no 2/1 - 1N=4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Røn and blakset play 1@c nat or 15-19bal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course forcing the same|pg||
nt|pelu: EW: weak or strong 1@C - 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Christiansen and Auken play a natural based system|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: I hope that 2 cl is nonforcing - yes.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nigel_k:  However a diamond lead and continuation will create a second trump loser|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can't see a safety play in trumps - I think 6@H will fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 2@C should definitely be non-forcing when everybody bids|pg||
nt|duschek: I am not sure whether a Swedish pair plays it as forcing or non-forcing if South passes|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, ypu are right, but not otherwise as I play from an unpassed hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2N pass  means to play  natural|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|skaftij: Måske en kravpas situation som de spiller det?|pg||
nt|pelu: the fiendly @h-position =  play for 2NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need also a friendly position of @C|pg||
nt|duschek: North has shown a 4-card diamond suit and denied a balanced hand, as an opening 1NT would show 12-15, and all 16+ hands open 1@C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Very efficient by E/W ... just bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: should be push board... but will he win it?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|pelu: der er lang vej til 9 stik hvis han ikke løser ruderne|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps one diamond ruff here, then @HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: 12 "safe tricks" if @h is 3-2, so i dont think he'll make it.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he makes it, it will be misplayed ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but 4-1 in konows hand is maybe a good possibility after the preempt in 2@d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Life is full of possibilities, but you can't go playing for a 4-1 break and going down against all the 3-2 breaks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think what he would really like to do is find a play that makes the contract on all the 3-2 breaks, and also if South has singleton 10 or K of hearts|pg||
pc|dT|nt|skaftij: KA har vel vist 12-14, 3NT vild satsning|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|stigw: He will probably make 8-9 tricks I guess.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|skaftij: Nyd det |pg||
nt|duschek: Seems to be 9 - East has three high cards which he will make, and that will be it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|skaftij: av|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: man har vel sine 9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|skaftij: jo|pg||
mc|9|nt|bjacobs: But one diamond ruff and @HQ it was (picking up at least singleton 10 of hearts with South)|pg||
pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4SK43H84DJT62C9742,SJ82HAQJ763D8CA85,SA76HT952DAKQ4CKJ,SQT95HKD9753CQT63|sv|n|nt|andreasw:  6@h can make here:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: people tend to ignore that when they have hearts... with spades another matter. However, some play a convention that gives you an opportunity to show a long minor and 4 of a major|pg||
nt|luffe12:   :o)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  Anyway Team Schou will need some tailwind in this session to pick up the deficit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: Hello Dennis and Leif|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Last session - lets see, what they can do about it|pg||
nt|luffe12:  hi Roland / Dennis|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|luffe12:  better go to 6@h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  assume 3@h is 4h + longer minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzww: 3H shows 4 card H and asks partner to choose between 3 NT and 4H|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hello all sry was away and wlc guys|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: 3NN=  er koden|pg||
nt|luffe12:  As 4H is a looser here - 3NT seems a good shot|pg||
nt|luffe12:  well judged by Gregers / Michael|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H a good play or I am imagining.:)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  even 7 on the layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True 6 would be fine.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Not exactly a flying starter at  1 for Schou|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Appearantly Nielsen - Boesgaard got further overboard than here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1 turned out to be a nightmare on both tables. OR playing 7@H, with two aces missing.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Even a club back in with HJ will not defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|luffe12:  = well done guys|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: a very good play|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: by E|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: Have you seen the bidding in the OR for this board?:)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kerasidis: nice double|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|jbgood: securing a @d trick before going after the hearts|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Natural - E bid 2NT i 2. round - 3S - 3NT - 6H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow and now the play, makes alright, cards placement friendly.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  The lead takes away a vital entry - Hagen can play on Spades or Diamonds|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Both lines will work |pg||
nt|rnmalik: @Hs are 3/2 which is a big plus. |pg||
nt|luffe12:  :o)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  No line will work if Hearts are 4-1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|luffe12:  Will not make the long & winding road easier :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzww: jeg taster det lige ind når der er en pause, der var sket en fejl|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|luffe12:  Yes not enough entries for the defense to create 5 tricks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Nice play|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: sorry, seems like i missclicked C10 instead of 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: so south still has C10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  no problem Peter|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|luffe12:  It's fine that we have slowed down here - means that the scoring will be updated all the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: yes, however, carrying on like this will lead to a lot of penalty points|pg||
nt|luffe12:  We are falling behind with 3 boards|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@D would be more easy to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: the spade lead made it difficult|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Nilsson dodged a bullet by passing 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: new board|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: hi Joao|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an|10-13 6-card suit|nt|pelu: slem? ok - men 6@H i Syd - den sættes kun hvis Vest underspiller klør-farven og får en @d trumfning|pg||
nt|skaftij: I lukket rum spillede Askgaard lydigt @d ud efter Lightner D|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stigw: Difficult for N/S now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: It is always nice when you can describe your hand in one bid as Fredin was able to here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: X or 1NT in West - I prefer 1NT - I show my type of hand and HCP|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H with 3 cards (better maj) when weak it is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: there is no way Christiansen can find out that Auken does NOT have an opening hand. Therefore 1@s|pg||
nt|duschek: North felt he had a stopper|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: of course he does|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but not fit for spades|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, that was a deep blow, 2 down.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like -2|pg||
nt|duschek: However, 2@S makes easily, so down two is inexpensive|pg||
nt|duschek: 2@H that is|pg||
nt|stigw: 2-3 imps for Blakset may be.|pg||
nt|duschek: In the open room we may get an auction such as 1@H by West, 1NT by North|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Nilsson doesnt know its down two no matter what|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: East just knew he was going to see a small diamond from partner|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Partners are like that|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes ew can take 9 tricks i @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: good morning|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that's the 8th trick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: So far West has bid a failing slam, and found the lead to give away 2NT.  And IMO, he's yet to make a mistake|pg||
nt|stigw: It doent matter what Nilsson does, but he doent know trhat of course.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim and next|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|luffe12:  HC Nielsen in OR is having his 60th birthsday tomorrow - and a day off - I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: 2 @c 5+@C 11-15?|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: yes|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  another one coming up :o)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 7 on @H lead, as was done in the OR.|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  what a monster|pg||
nt|kerasidis: will he try to secrifice in 6 spades?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes endeed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|luffe12:  Hagen might consider CA at 7 |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: & cant be bid, play 6 and make 7.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: nice bids|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: ups|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: lots of artificial bids - will they lead to 6@c or 6 NT?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Mikkel & Jacob play Reley Precision|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldnt resists of 7 either|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|luffe12:  As long as they keep bidding!|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jbgood: en exhausting system, but according to a kind kib S has shown his exact f\distribution by now|pg||
nt|luffe12:  6C seems to be the nicest contract, as it is by North |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|andreasw:  Easy play here:)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jbgood: a small point in the play is not to play the heart ten, but lead low twice from dummy|pg||
nt|jbgood: for the overtrick - unless E leads a @d|pg||

nt|sharkey: I suspect the lead will be the same OR as well if defending a NT contract|pg||
nt|stigw: Good claim.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on N|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|duschek: 6@C I believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: 6@c is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If a strong NT, S will open 1@d though|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: NS play strong @c system|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont exp that they can stop before 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S seam normal here|pg||
nt|stigw: Looks 3 nt N/S, but 6 cl is a winner I think.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|skaftij: Hmm|pg||
mb|2H|nt|skaftij: 1@C kan være 3 kortsfarve|pg||
nt|pelu: ved HC om 5@C er naturlig?|pg||
nt|skaftij: Hvordan opfatter HC 5@c?|pg||
nt|skaftij: Usædvanligt meldeforløb|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass probably denies 3@h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, write now in alert|pg||
nt|pelu: would u - in red - overcall 2@D??|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: you must guess @c though|pg||
nt|duschek: The defence will lose their spade trick if they attack hearts, vice versa|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  now what from N?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|bjacobs: West will be grateful that he hasn't given away imps, at last|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And this is a tense play problem - You might have to find the @DQ here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's difficult for declarer to neutralize the clubs by holding up, because then he risks a heart shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: If he misses @DQ likely down I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, maybe you should hold up a club - they are usually continued, and then you can finesse into East's hand, and it doesn't matter so much if it loses|pg||
nt|jfaria:  easy with 3@d |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D overcall possible bec AQx @H (very good after 1@H in North) - so it is usefull to give the lead against 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: can you make 6@c on a @h-lead?|pg||
mb|2N!|an|10-12hcp|nt|duschek: North has initiated a relay sequence. 2NT shows a minimum|pg||
nt|stigw: But in South's hand a heart lead might still defeat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! @s will go away|pg||
nt|stigw: 6 cl I mean.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - agree|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't bid 3@D in west with bal hands and wothout top H in @D|pg||
nt|duschek: But declarer may be short of an entry for the discard|pg||
nt|stigw: Exactly, Should be in Norths's hand.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On N 6@c looks good|pg||
nt|duschek: If North asks with 3@C, South will show his exact distribution, and North will probably sign off|pg||
nt|duschek: Or maybe not... let's wait and see|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, I guess they remain in 3 NT.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bjacobs: On the other hand, long clubs with West implies long diamonds with East - this is a really difficult problem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by North means interesting hand (probably no GF)|pg||
nt|pelu: u exp - for sure - 6 card @D - for me 3@D ok - but problem with 2@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to compete with @D isn't a great idea after open and bid by opps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@D vuln is dangerous and not take great obiectives|pg||
nt|jfaria:  They did stop @s to get in...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: looks like 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: for -2 imps if they find 4@s in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need a top H in @D to entry - same cards with Kxx in @D instead J10x was sufficient (and nobody would dbl!)|pg||
nt|pelu: but has to play small @S from A to get 2 @H-tricks for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but @sA and trumph queen missing etc. so not a good slam |pg||
nt|duschek: North hopes for a 3@D response, which would show a 6-card suit|pg||
mb|3S!|an|1-4-3-5|mb|d|nt|duschek: 3@S shows a 1435|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: for his X N sh have @SK so small @S now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  I agree, hold up then finessing into East is safe whether clubs are 5-2 or 4-3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jfaria:  nice|pg||
nt|duschek: The auction on board 1 in the open room was interesting (where Fredin bid 2@C non-forcing and Konow made an overtrick in 2@D)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|stigw: OK bidding (and guessing from our side !).|pg||
nt|duschek: 1@D-(1@H)-double, which showed a 5-card spade suit. Jacob Røn passed it out for penalties with his @HQJ10x and collected two undertricks - 300 and 5 imps|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  So can fall back on heart ace onside if the diamond is wrong|pg||
nt|duschek: Opener passing a negative double (or what you would call it this time) is a rare occurrence|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, not entirely Nigel, because if the @HA is off-side, you still only have 8 tricks if the diamond finesse loses|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right counterplay|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|duschek: on the 1 level|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skaftij: Pudsigt ligespil|pg||

nt|jbgood: will they bid slam?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be a flat 6@s?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rnmalik: NS can make 4@H, good @H guess requied.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d!|mb|2H|nt|jbgood: the common method to get prd to show his major is xx, or as here, where 3@h is pass or correct|pg||
nt|luffe12:  another game on small values|pg||
nt|luffe12:  underlines the importance of 9-10 trumps|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andreasw:  Nice action from E-W here making it hard to get to slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: yes - S has to do it all himself|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: ... more or less|pg||

nt|bridge_one: sry, 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzwu: 2@h would be 6-cards 10-13 in EW system therefore 1@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Intermediate jump overcalls|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|bjacobs: This looks like a winning contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just about the only winning contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: North is really shut out here |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't really like 5@C, because it tends to put partner under a lot of pressure if he has a good hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5@c should not be based on a lot of high cards so I think North really has to pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4 @H seam the contract, but the table isn't easy to understand|pg||
nt|duschek: Askgaard played 2@S on the 4-3 fit on board 2, not 2@H on the 6-1 fit. He managed 9 tricks for a loss of 2 imps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: OR now playing board 13 - we are way too slow here|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|nigel_k:  But I agree it makes it hard for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, let's not argue with success.  And 5@C was perhaps a reasonable choice anyway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As you point out - it shouldn't be stuffed with high cards, and I suppose it isn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: if 6@c is right with konows hand, then Hagen shouldnt bid 5@c!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's another way of putting it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wrong this time when @C don't break.... :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, South needs 2 of 3 good things to happen|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he gets his 2|pg||
nt|duschek: Board 3 was a push at 3NT making 12 tricks. Neither pair tried 6@C|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 nt probably the best game here, but is down on a club lead and ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jfaria:  "1h 4@h |pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@h*|pg||
nt|duschek: E/W play 5-card major, so 1NT is probably an attempt to show a weakish 3-card raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|duschek: I am not sure about 2NT - on those cards it looks like a natural bid|pg||
nt|stigw: I dont think that will make on the actual lie of the cards.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: coffee-hand - bach|pg||
nt|duschek: There seems to be a loser in each suit for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe it was Game-forcing ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jfaria:  N would prefer to be declarer but with the aces position all ok|pg||
nt|pelu: back in 2min :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nigel_k:  West cannot switch to a trump after winning @sA so may not need the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But if W plays low, East can lead a trump|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't like this line at all ... just the sort of setup where West's doubleton @CQ gets promoted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Much prefer the "draw trumps and claim" approach here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's not like the defence is going to allow him to ruff a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: blakset must duck to make it hard and even then its all up to the @d finesse. Or am I wrong?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks about right ... but South is playing for West to misdefend.  His line only helps if West started with @SAQJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Meanwhile, how do you like East winning a spade at some point and pumping through a high heart?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With clubs 3-1 this line needs the diamond finesse and @sA onside just like playing trumps from the top does|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yep|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And as Bill says, it risks going down with clubs 2-2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jfaria:  nothing wrong can happen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, seam a safe hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|stigw: 2 NT I mean can be played af GF with 2 Cl as only an invitational hand.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: But if you play trumps from the top and they divide, now you can take the diamond finesse in some safety|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|duschek: Their convention card gives no hint, unfortunately|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: squeeze fo 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|stigw: Right guesses both in Sp and Hearts are needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! S can keep @d and N @h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|stigw: And even that is impossible I think - H 10 covered and what then ?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: fint så forklar lige 2@S - jeg mener den kræver 2ut med minimum og eller 4-farver fra neden?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like 2@C = majors (multi-landy)|pg||
nt|sharkey: may go down with trump leads|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the layout demonstrates why this is better than 2@D for the majors (Capp) - South could ask North to bid his better major|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: N/S play good/bad multi here 2@c being majors 2@d being a weak major and 2M being "strong" major|pg||
nt|duschek: 4@S made on board 4 in the open room as Jacob Røn led the @HA, probably tempted by Lars Blakset's raise of his overcall|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and probably because of the @h-support from S|pg||
nt|stigw: Rønn started H Ace because he got H support in the bidding !|pg||

nt|stigw: Sorry I repeat your excellent comments !!!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good play by East - preserving his @HQ which will be the entry for the third trump play|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: good lead and good play. Well done Jacob|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lars shudnt think too much here - just continue pd's good start|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: let's see if Blakset "get's it"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, it's not critical, because if he does play a minor, that will promote the entry for the trump play.  But it does seem right to just continue trumps|pg||
nt|duschek: Using that convention, you could raise to show a heart honour, or redouble to show a raise without a heart honour - or maybe it's the other way round, I have forgotten that :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|stigw: Yes, it would be good to have a convention there, but perhaps RDBL is needed to show something different. May be Hagens pass is the best move.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: now close to 10|pg||
nt|pelu: very close|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must get @s right|pg||
nt|pelu: safe for 9 to play @s to king|pg||
nt|jfaria:  since Blakset failed to play @d he can misguess @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Is Auken wondering how to win if Røn has 3@s now?|pg||
nt|pelu: not in 3@s|pg||
nt|duschek: Using the redouble to show a doubleton honour in partner's suit has gained a following|pg||
nt|duschek: Some use the 1NT response conventionally to help showing or denying that vital honour card|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|jfaria:  y|pg||

nt|bridge_one: correct to play NT in opposite hands at ACES|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nigel_k:  I agree and you have a good lead against 1NT. Also it is easy for opponents to double after they have opened 1NT|pg||

nt|duschek: I am not sure about their style. Askgaard/Bjarnarson open almost all hands with 10 HCP except if balanced with no 5-card major, so for them this would probably be a 1@D bid. For me ...|pg||
nt|duschek: not, but it is a question of style|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|pelu: @dK wd|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|bridge_one: 1N 13/15 i think|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|an|take out|nt|duschek: 1@C=16+ with any distribution. 1@D=5-7 with any distribution. So now they should know how high, but where?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: nice 2nt|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jfaria:  we r late but still think that a @h from Ron in previous board would sink the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to play in @h is better for E/W - guessing all make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stigw: Board 8 turned out to be a winner for Konow, so the dropped overtrick might after all not mean anything.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stigw: No, it was + 7 imps anyway !|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: I think I see a lead :)|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, Røn languishing in 4@H on the 4-3 fit and E/W immediately forcing the long trump hand with club leads|pg||
nt|duschek: Down three eventually|pg||
nt|stigw: Impossible to understand for me.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 here as well as in 4@s|pg||
nt|duschek: Difficult auction, but I cannot really see passing 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: how would this go on 3x @c?|pg||
nt|stigw: Must be a misunderstanding, even if it might not be an expensive one.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if @d are 3-3 N can make but must play on 4-2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: not what you "saw" Bill?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: trump?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, what were the odds, given the previous deals?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They should have noticed a pattern by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: all in favour|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A trump not so good on the last hand probably|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I agree with the non-trump lead here, because the spade suit feels threatening to South.  So attack in a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: S doesnt know E is weak with @c :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Having the East hand concealed is going to make the defence much harder|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead looks good for defence - no reason for declarer to guess the layout|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right - it looks like he has the invitational hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: still not an easy contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has to guess the club layout, and I don't see why he should|pg||
nt|duschek: I think Hagen simply fears a doubleton or singleton spade in North, but then, if North might have a 2-3-5-3, he might also have a 3-3-4-3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|stigw: Repeted Cl-leads might turn this into a night-mare.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If the defence don't lead trumps at all he may still make seven trump tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this board shows a weakness with strong 1@c opening|pg||

pc|c7|pc|d4|pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|stigw: If he tries to make it by going to hand in Sp to lead di, it will be more down.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: but now spade spade spade?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: South has to defend carefully|pg||
nt|stigw: No, only 1 down now.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: But he has already overcome one hurdle - not going in @HA there|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: And when declarer pitched from dummy, he donated a second undertrick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All South has to do here is count ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6304 is marked|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: after a lot of consideration hagen played the @dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: now were waiting for a director|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hmm|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, that could be ugly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The revoke is not established, so he can take that card back, but I'm not sure what happens next|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think it is still a penalty card - but winning @hA and leading @dQ is good enough to beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: it is a penalty card. I think Hagen feels quite sick to his stomach now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On board 6, the brilliant defence was not duplicated at the other table so a 4 imp swing|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe during this time he can do some counting and work out all four hands|pg||
mc|8|nt|duschek: Board 9 was a push at 4@S making|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|2D|nt|stigw: Close to 6 cl, and 3 nt doesnt look appetizing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Major preempt with good @H suit and lousy @S???|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sQ is normal, but @hJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Bad guessing by North, and it looks like +140 is now -50|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps there was just too great a difference between the two suits for South to try this gadget|pg||
nt|sharkey: on a good day makes 4....|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence would need two spade ruffs to beat 3@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D conservative|pg||
nt|duschek: North might also consider 3@H, which in their system simply shows a 4-card suit and asks partner to choose between 3NT and 4@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|stigw: If you find H J doubleton or trippleton, you dont need to find the sp Q.|pg||
nt|duschek: The idea is that after Stayman, if N/S end up in 3NT everybody gets to know whether opener has four spades when it is only of interest to the defenders|pg||
nt|ralfwil: correct Stig|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Had anyone of you bid 3@d as E?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to cut space in opps bidding|pg||
nt|duschek: Certainly 3@D should be considered|pg||
nt|stigw: If Fredin passes.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jfaria:  again vuln may have help to decide... |pg||

nt|bridge_one: K in one second :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|duschek: An expected 6 imps to Blakset for playing 3@S instead of 3@D on the previous board|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: experience|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: He's got the 4-4 in the blacks .. can he get the red suit shape?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  North is going to discover South's exact shape which makes it easy to choose 6@d|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And South is limited to 14 so grand is unlikely but QJxx xx AQx Axxx is possible|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer has to rely on 3-2 trumps. He can't play another @d now (assuming N ducks) because of the uppercut possibility|pg||

pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Well they really are into the high science here|pg||

pc|sK|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  6NT does have squeeze chances or you could get a trick on the lead|pg||

mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: Personally, I would give up on trying to describe it, and start with a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Precision 2@c followed by 3@h is actually quite descriptive as it happens|pg||

pc|h9|nt|luffe12:  he need to take one more now!|pg||
nt|luffe12:  otherwise the defense can make 2 spade-tricks, if they dare do!|pg||
nt|jbgood: first a club ruff, then a spade finesse, and ....|pg||
nt|luffe12:  correct Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: but and a third spade, lose 2 hearts and 1 diamond only|pg||
nt|jbgood: not a third spade ... E can have a heart ruff if he wants to|pg||
nt|luffe12:  maybe best line to play a Diamond now|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: Gregers just went out to get something while HC is still in thinking|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  when @c are 5-2 and @s 2-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: slem "kan" vindes her|pg||

nt|snorris: ja|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S raise in @H, probably 3 cards (2N for 4 cards)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl or 3@S by N ?|pg||
nt|duschek: "Can there be a spade canapé?"|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: 9-7 so far in this set. A combination of excellent bridge and rather dull boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pelu: 2@S ville ikke være mit umiddelbare valg her|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Konow are on the board - picked up 12 IMPs on Bd 10|pg||

nt|skaftij: Tak for i aften, ses i morgen|pg||

nt|jfaria:  the bridge is no doubt excellent :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Both 3 nt and 4 sp will make, so at last a "breather".|pg||
nt|duschek: A kibitzer tells me that this is the way to show a balanced hand too strong for an opening bid of 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks after a red lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: North (sac) and South (jauken) often to be seen in the JEC match on Mondays|pg||
nt|pelu: only @H back keep it to 10 tricks|pg||

pc|hK|pg||

nt|snorris: hehe|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  a trump back will probably (hedging) hold this to 4|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|stigw: They do play a normal 15-17 nt, dont they Ralf ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not quite sure, but think so|pg||
nt|duschek: The convention card says "14+ - 17"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|skaftij: Jeg må smutte, I gør det jo glimrende :-)|pg||
nt|pelu: hjerter til trumf - 2x@D - @D til trumf @H til trumf og kun 2 sorte tabere|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|pelu: only 1 swing-board : 5IMP - 2NT making and 3NT down 1 !|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||

nt|stigw: On board 12 it was Fredin's devilish double of 1 di, that made the swing possible, I think.|pg||

nt|duschek: Identical auctions at both tables|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||

nt|duschek: Konow's lead neither showed nor denied the king|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: same lead in open room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: 10 @S at second trick|pg||
nt|pelu: and after normal play - communication problems he will find @CQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Til gengæld kan man ikke sætte 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: men så risikerer man at presse øv i 5@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR East raised - not sure that's profitable in the long run|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: i think 2@h was 5-5 in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: and with a limited partner (strong club system) 3@h is ok i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: still not sure I wud raise....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duck the lead, @H and after 10 @S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|skaftij: Næppe hvis man følger 2-3-4 reglen |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|skaftij: Jo|pg||

pc|hT|pc|s2|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|hA|nt|skaftij: Godt selskab|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nigel_k:  And there is a possible pickup on 13|pg||
nt|duschek: Bjarnarson made an overtrick in 3NT on board 14, so Blakset will enter the final section with a 6 imp lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: og de er endda på hjemmebane|pg||
