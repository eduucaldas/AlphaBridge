nt|yorkbeach:  cannot believe the pass|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  East is not interested facing a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  NS may need the club ruff to beat 4@h|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  but EW will not be bidding it|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|yorkbeach:  found the club ruff no problem|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  with the EW clubs 4-4, NS can take their ruff knowing there are no discards coming|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  declarer may have to pick the @hQ now to make 3@h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  possible clue is that with @hQxxx South might have tried a forcing game rather than looking for a ruff|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another clue is South's pass over 1@h|pg||
nt|danmac: well south passed 1H and must have at least 4@S to bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South must have 5@s as North did not bid them|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  with 5@s and 5 points, South might well have bid 1@s over 1@h|pg||

nt|danmac: but u agree unlikely to pass|pg||
