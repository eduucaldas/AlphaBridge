mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|idc: For the first time we have a result from the Closed room, and it isn't a bad looking one to Welsh eyes|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Walker ducked his @dA twice in the other room if the play record is to be believed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i wonder how 4@S came home|pg||
nt|athene: ah right |pg||
nt|idc: They play reverse distribution signals, so North gave correct count|pg||
nt|danmac: you can make this double dummy, but I think in practise you will go down|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps, as the late great Hugh Kelsey used to say, a cow flew by and distracted him|pg||

nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: The profile for our excellent viewgraph operator gives Denis Dobrin from Russia|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N!|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is nasty--NS likely to make nine tricks on a spade lead--4@S a phantom |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have been led up the garden path again|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: shame I've never been to russia!|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
nt|garnetts: straight in and North probably should double --minimum and not wanting to bid 5@H |pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close run thing though...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: ...but 6 spades may be tricky|pg||
nt|idc: we'll try to get you names as we can - starts of matches are often rushed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..it looks to have handling probs, but the diamond ace is right..|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psridhar: when they bid slam on long suits it is often a 'tempo' game, so u make attacking leads|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is a no play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: the contract is really 6C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not surprised-W suggested 6C enroute to 6N ...and E imagined his pd has a 5 bagger-lack of unnderstdg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, hoped the original @C wasn't short, alas it was|pg||
nt|garnetts: You might make 4@H double dummy --more likely going at least one off|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: ..and certainly dont want to ship any defensive tricks here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: mast play 2NT as 4 card support...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: well, I certainly dont like the double|pg||
nt|idc: It'll mean your commentators will be impartial - since we don't know which direction the countries are sitting!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: that can only help declarer..|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: and this lead also...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great cost to either side just no gain here|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, a big decision for poor South to have to take this early in the morning|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|idc: I can barely put my slippers on the right way round, leading to a doubled slam way beyond me|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and that it shipped it seems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wilkinsona: This is an easy make now after south's giveaway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: since i dont know the names, i can criticize the players freely for once..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess Scotland are E-W, took me ages to work that out|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East still has a choice but knows the club ace is with south..|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: as spec point out with no x and trump lead declarer has handling problems|pg||
nt|garnetts: that was frankly dreadful |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Hello everybody. Is that score correct??|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Since we are the Closed room, we began 3 boards ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: A strong NT from Spears|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 0-0 you mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: NS have 650|pg||

nt|psridhar: wonder why N didnt bid his clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this lead clarifies thinks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: does not rate to make, with 2 spades ok and 1N going off|pg||
nt|garnetts: laydown anyway |pg||

nt|danmac: 3@H feels a bit much|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|garnetts: Both EW rightly conclude bidding is dangerous--|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: 3@H is making|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  best to stop quickly on a misfit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: as is 4@C :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I might under an assumed name |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5@c is not a hopeless contract, needs defense to shift to @h before winning @d ace|pg||
nt|idc: I think 2@c is natural but alerted since game forcing|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|wilkinsona: NS heading overboard...|pg||
nt|idc: and 4@d a shortage showing splinter of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland compete to 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: North does have some extras after 4@h, and at least they have managed to stop below six|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which has a chance|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  south trying to signal for a heart: declarer has to play him for stiff ace|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west best to play ace and another trump it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: does not want to concede a ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is that not an assumed name you are using?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: if west had taken the ace of spade a trump promotion would have led to an axtra undertrick |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|psridhar: but they found the defense and beat it, so the leaders get ahead further|pg||
nt|idc: normally you'd say a 6-0 @c split was awful, but here it is a lot better than 5-1, when they might suffer a ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: enough undertricks as it is...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: ...but may be a problem nevertheless|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW closer to 2 hearts than NS|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|idc: did he have time to set up spades Tony?  too late now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might still do it with AK and another club |pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|idc: The dbl shows support - 3 cards in spades|pg||
nt|danmac: 2@H doesn't look like a nice contract|pg||
nt|idc: North wouldn't agree|pg||
nt|athene: south will surely do something over 2@H here|pg||
nt|athene: like double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|danmac: apperently not|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he is worried that if he doubles his partner will have no option but to leave it in, and it might make|pg||
nt|athene: he could have tried 2nt perhaps, if they play that as unusual|pg||
nt|athene: if he really doesn't want to risk 2@HX tick|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|dT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: this is true :) but south doesn't know his partner has quite so many heart tricks|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  That did not go well :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: And EW dropped a trick|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzzb: board 3 was -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: NS will reach 3N..unless they decide to nail W now |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: interesting opening from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: If that is 14-16 OK---not in my view if it is 12-14 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky for south though|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cuttysark:  Connection problems here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes I suppose its asking a lot to read the stiif ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Sri Lanka have just tossed a wicket to Canada by contriving a run out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  easy for us :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard high card vaues and a decent suit make 1@H look better |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks, Denis|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do we like 3@C?  |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Similar trump suit to the previous board|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: it also breaks 3-3 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont really see he has a choice, I am not waiting for a heart lead vs 1NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: if S can finesse @d based on the Vul bidding by W......this will make overtricks|pg||

nt|idc: I should say, we don't get running scores on website, just updates at the end of each session|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: east has an interesting decision over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: double, 2@H and 3@c are all possible|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a suit that isn't strong|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: with a strong and shapely hand you are supposed to start bidding your suits right away|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I have been relegated to the Closed Room - good luck all |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: with real game values I'd start with 3@c I think; with his actual hand I prefer 2@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: Our loss Liz|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: i would treat that east hand as a game force i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in which case perhaps 3@C then hearts is right, but it's easy to see that getting very high very quickly|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: The trouble with a negative double is (a) partner might just pass and (b) you haven't started to get your extreme shape across|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he just loses the sixth club here - a reasonable view, similar to opening it 1@H rather than 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead you just have to bring in the clubs|pg||
nt|idc: You may be right in your evaluation Bill, and I may just be remembering the 5-4-3-1 10 counts E-W were opeing last match|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|idc: I see we have another new leader: the Irish are just ahead of England, with Wales dropping to 3rd|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|athene: easy for west to imagine his partner won't have much wasted in spades now|pg||
nt|idc: I expect West will bid 4@h, and N-S will defend|pg||
nt|idc: though the vulnerability will tempt them to sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: west might well try a slam|pg||
nt|danmac: well the west hand's pretty good on the auction, might try for more than game?|pg||
nt|athene: can he combine pick-a-slam with grand slam tries?|pg||
nt|idc: That's a point|pg||
nt|athene: start off with 4@S and then fiddle around|pg||
nt|idc: Do you think there is a case for East passing, or bidding 1NT first time?|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say i like 1nt|pg||
nt|idc: with so much of his hand in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|danmac: might have tried a NT|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Dan|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's playable for 1nt there not to deny 4 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you can always back into hearts if need be|pg||
nt|danmac: I don't think you can pass|pg||
mb|5N|nt|athene: the only time you lose out is if you bid 1nt with hearts and partner refuses to believe you can have them, so doesn't investigate|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: even if 1nt was going to lose hearts it might be best - it does get the overall hand across so much better than double|pg||
mb|p|nt|danmac: 5N was an unfortunate choice|pg||
nt|idc: Sime hs decided he couldn't combine exploring best strain with a try for slam, so has just made the decision himself|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|idc: A good comeback from WBU after they were 24-0 down early in the set|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a bid of interest from south|pg||
nt|idc: this is only approaching the half-way point of course, 2nd half begins in 30 mins|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  not sure i like east's double - more than half his points in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also like a bid here like 1NT  to get things stirred up--been known to try 2@H too |pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: If this is a single suited major, trouble on its way..|pg||
nt|idc: IMHO, the 2@d bid shows 2 things:|pg||
nt|idc: spades and another suit|pg||
nt|idc: and that South has forgotten they aren't playing matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if they can get to 3 clubs, not so bad..|pg||

mb|5H|nt|wilkinsona: So thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double stirred thing up too it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: dbl is a poor bid might as well pass or bid 1NT --if you must|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I guess 3@c is -3 probably?   as long as the defence lead trumps to prevent 2 spade ruffs in North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and to specs for their comments|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When South removes the dbl of 2@d to 2@s, North knows the second suit is clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: N having bid his hand bids again|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H is not my idea of a bid on Jxxx--why not 5@D  --perhaps he plays the cards better |pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: yep. may have though 5 diamonds as encouraging|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  May have thought it was the least encouraging noise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  now has to take a good view in hearts|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hope you will be with us later.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: agree|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
nt|garnetts: haven't got a lot of sympathy --there are two entries vai a club ruff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he gets off play with a diamond--should  east get the hearts right?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades beats it if hook is on|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Well he could hardly lead a spade away from his ace...|pg||
nt|garnetts: It depends if East thinks North knows the heart position|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|idc: Now the dummy (with singleton spade) and declarer's line, are also screaming "trump lead"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence going well, back to trumps now..|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  i understand, but it is ever so obvious to declarer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: a @h ruff was needed|pg||
