nt|dagold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|dagold: Good afternoon patrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: 6@c or 6@s possible here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dagold: both excellent|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dagold: I would make a positive on that|pg||
nt|dagold: now the bidding is at th 3-level and East hasn't yet named a suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: he probably needs better suit for a positive resp.|pg||
nt|dagold: yes possibly but if you can't make a positive on that it gets very difficult|pg||
nt|gracelin: But I don't really like these strict requirement.  Yes, this hand is a positive to me over partner's 2C opening. |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dagold: 2@c-2@s-3@c-3@h, much much better|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess 4C by East now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, please put an initial before Jones in both seats. One is G and the other one D     (Gary and Dafydd, father and son)|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, I think he has to|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tha nk you|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|gracelin: and forget about spades when West didn't bid over 3H|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|dagold: Dafydd and Gary won the spring fours last year (with Denning and Shields) |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: one of Englands very best events|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: West might have gone on. The King of clubs opposite is a slam|pg||
nt|dagold: can bid rkcb facing 4@c if playing 3014|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, East must have something useful to move over 3NT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|dagold: so a chance for England here|pg||
nt|gracelin: also, East might bid something else than 5C, He might Cue 4S as a last train since spade control is not a issue after the 3NT bid.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|mc|12|nt|dagold: 2@c-2@s-3@c-3@h-3!N-4@c and slam is easily reached|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, so I will ut the blames 50% to West, 30% to east, and 20% to their system|pg||
nt|dagold: I think west very clearly underbid after 4@c so 50% is generous|pg||
nt|gracelin: true, but West's 3C then 3NT usually is a 10 tricks hand, andEast can see he has two.|pg||
nt|dagold: easy to think you are minimum for the 2@c opener. But facing club support and values the hand is enourmous|pg||
pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|gracelin: 3NT by NS maybe inevitable after south opened|pg||
nt|dagold: yes. 2@d is FG unless followed up with 3@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Before this match England led the field with 136 VP and Wales was third with 129.  Wales can overtake England with a big win here.|pg||

nt|gracelin: presumably|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, another NS 3NT, but easy making here.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dagold: 2N= art FG. One of Espen's favourite conventions|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gracelin: aggressive player might open 2NT with the North hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@c I think may show a 5-card minor|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@d by opener now would ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: he has only 19 but 5-card suit is a plus.|pg||
nt|dagold: yes 2N opener is ok with me|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dagold: like opening 2N whenever possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: Espen is not interesting in the 5 card minor of course|pg||
nt|dagold: he bid 2N in case Norman had 5 hearts|pg||
nt|gracelin: with both J 3rd drop in spade and D, declarer has 11 tricks, but he might not know.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dagold: he has to play his tricks from the top though|pg||
nt|dagold: as a heart switch might be beating him|pg||

mb|1C|nt|dagold: still a chance of a swing here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|gracelin: not sure which game contract is better for EW, 4S or 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dagold: if they wrongside 4@s it can go down|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dagold: on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: neither game is cold. It does look normal to play 4@s with a 4-4 fit and each hand having different doubletons|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, the cards are less friendly in 4S, but at least they rightsided the declarer.|pg||
nt|dagold: careful play required|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: HA and H after winning DQ ?|pg||
nt|dagold: espen didn't have an easylead so he decides to attack|pg||
nt|dagold: yes I like that |pg||
nt|gracelin: on the bidding, Diamond is north's natural lead, though he could also consider a trump.|pg||
nt|dagold: was close for him with the known bad spade break but he didnt want to lead either of their suits or his singleton trump|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dagold: singleton trump is the alternative yes. Close|pg||
nt|gracelin: even if it picks partner's trump honor, the trump lead reduced declarer's ruffing power.|pg||
nt|dagold: yes I do quite like a trump lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: in 4441 trump situation, it's easier to lead one from the long trump holder than the singleton.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dagold: yes since you know from say xxxx that you are not picking anything up|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dagold: sure there are exceptions. Long suit for discards known also|pg||
nt|dagold: or weakness shown in the bidding|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess declarer is still ok here.|pg||
nt|dagold: yes although I would have thought trying for the diamond discard on the heart was a better way to start the hand|pg||

nt|dagold: they may not have methods to get out in clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: true|pg||
nt|dagold: interesting board|pg||
nt|dagold: slam makeable and biddable|pg||
nt|lestergold: First time i have had the pleasure of commentating with young  Byrne in the frame|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dagold: I like that cheeky 1@h opener at love all and as dealer|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I see Murdoch/Spears also got to the bad 6@h on Bd 4, so a flat board in one down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it appears that the usual connection prob have scuppered the comparisons|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S playing any system is obligatory |pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland also went down in 6 hearts on 4, a contract off on the diamond hook|pg||
nt|dburn: might raise to a bit more than 2@h, mind|pg||
nt|lestergold: he seems to have made a name for himself already in the bridge world not only for playing bit for other services towards the game|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|dburn: still, no one is going to bid a sla,|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, even playing 4-card heart as they do|pg||
nt|dburn: or even a slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree David--we have a problem with three Davids here|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: no biddingt sequence here|pg||
nt|lestergold: however normal contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: was putting in scores|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: I am told that Bell hails from Reading School which was also the alma mater for my son David|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idc: At this early stage in the Round 2 matches, England are 11 up on N.I., and Wales down by similar amount to the Republic|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 1 diamond must be hearts|pg||
nt|idc: so very tight at the top|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Aggressive opening bids sometimes backfire when partner has a fair hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@s was hasty too. I play it as a bit weaker than that. Cuebidding then 4@s to show a real hand|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: transfer responces, it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: Next year they should hold it in North Korea bound to be better internet :) |pg||
nt|jcwla: W declining to show @D's right away without extras, now 3NT showing the @D values if not the length.  A quiet pass by E but recognizing the lack of a great fit.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark:  Score currently 21-2: Scotland took the weak"@H on board 3 3 down; but then played 2@H -4 when Walker made 3@C|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well with all the computers & laptops pluged into the hotel system it bound to crash|pg||
nt|garnetts: That seems a mighty odd lead holding AQ stiff in hearts --but nothing looks great |pg||
nt|jcwla: If they bid and make slam against you here, not your day.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|psridhar: this can make if decl playes trumps for one loser-what is the % play here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: running the @c jack works when W has KQX|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cashing A is 1 loser also|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ace works when E has stiff K / Q-other combos , both work / or dont|pg||
nt|dagold: for me 4@s is 6 spades and a semi punt typically|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: misscore on board 3 was altered|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|wilkinsona: ...this time there seems to be 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  might North redbl to secure a diamond lead? |pg||
nt|garnetts: yes--a lazy bid |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|dburn: still, slam might not make if East-West do not give away too much in the bidding|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: KQX is 2 combos, k/q stiff also 2 combos..|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: nice wd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: not much to choose from|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|cuttysark:  Yes, the correction has been made|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: It was a pretty awful overcall --|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: this is a dull hand not going to produce any swing|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec says difficult club switch was needed|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Declarer going well|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, they are going -3 after the manditory 1 spade call|pg||
nt|garnetts: so it seems |pg||
nt|spil: I suppose hearts is the best slam...but nothing terribly wonderful|pg||

nt|dagold: this could be interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dagold: the bad diamond break of course causing the problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|dagold: but spades 3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|gracelin: defenders probable need to attack Heart to establish a 4th round winner there to beat 3NT.|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: so another good result for WBU|pg||
nt|dagold: West would have to duck the club J when it is advanced|pg||
nt|dagold: need to avoid 4@h (or any game here)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Declarer going well - if you bid 'em up you gotta play 'em up|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: it's getting too hard now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psridhar: cards lying well for 4@h here|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Scotland have gained an overtrick imp to make the score 21-3|pg||
nt|dagold: Wales have picked up 10 more on boards 5 and 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland down in 6 spades on 5 OR|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wilkinsona: North has a chance of shutting out the clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, I doubted the Denis myself, but thats what it says, perhaps you can clarify|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not see why you say that|pg||
nt|lestergold: although in 3N the @ds only provide 2 trciks against best defence, the other suits can provide the other 7|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: Conservative 3@H   ---I know I will risk sounding boring--Kokish said many years ago when you have five card support for partner bid game |pg||
nt|dagold: England played the wrong partscore on 6 after intervention from Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought he would pass--but these days 1@C is often short --so TOD of 1H |pg||
nt|dagold: EW can make 3@s so 4@h may be bid as a save|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: Bergen Raise?|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: never worked for me, dropped in favour of mini splinters|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as we expected, points to WBU|pg||
nt|spil: another 6 imps for Scotland when they made 3@D here and also 3@S in Open room...|pg||
nt|jcwla: The W hand worth significantly less than on its face: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Q92+J84+AK8+KQ32 |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: and thats a well judged bid by west|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N, the likely contract, may well go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think 3N will be found|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Espen trying to show best possible passed hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dagold: I suppose he has it. Or maybe he could have a void heart for a 10/10|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dagold: this makes the defence easy|pg||
nt|garnetts: lets hope Espen doesn't cash his partner's K@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: North should bid 4 here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again WBU in a contract that gives the defenders a chance|pg||
nt|garnetts: I didn't think Conservatives were popular in Scotland |pg||
nt|dagold: Why would he?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: on second thoughts you may be rIGHT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wilkinsona: his hand surely a max for not finding a neg double|pg||

pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: the @C won 6 imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|idc: South might have gone to 4@h himself over 2@h but 3@h was fine|pg||
nt|idc: It's a 3 1/2 @h bid really, but so few bidding boxes have that card in them :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Ace needed|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes heart switch is good enuf of course because declarer has too many cards to knowck out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark:  Scotland had lots of luck on board 21 - they made 3@D in one room and 3@S in the other: both contracts can be beaten|pg||

mb|1N|nt|psridhar: Bd 16 is a potential 12 imp gain for Wei, so the gap may be actually 40 imps approx now -with 5 bds to go, seems tough for yeh|pg||
nt|garnetts: If you cannot open 2@D--anyone for 3@D?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I'd open 5@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like NS can make 4@H |pg||
nt|dagold: 4@s would be a good save over 4@h here|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@s just 1 down|pg||
nt|dagold: doubt 4@h will be bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: South has difficult bid over a dbl by North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS plenty of tricks in hearts here|pg||
nt|garnetts: North will have to bid it|pg||
nt|dagold: would be surprised|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very well for declarer here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona: this will go to 4 spades|pg||
nt|spil: not the most exciting set of boards for the last match of the day|pg||
nt|dagold: suspect EW will steal it in 3@s|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: the @s9 is actually a stop with this spade layout, but not obvious to him|pg||
nt|garnetts: Game on a finesse --not so bad--not making either |pg||
nt|dagold: dble-p-3h-3s-p-p|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idc: not unreasonable to pass, just a bit scary|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Or possibly 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Norman will compete with 3@S over £@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wilkinsona: will bid 4 hearts now, nearly worth 3 hearts earlier|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psridhar: swingy bd alright|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of times now N has not pushed the level early in the auction - either matter of system or style.|pg||
nt|dagold: this some kind of scramble I guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT to show garbage |pg||
nt|dagold: I don't like that as he only has 1 place to play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: this is about to go D1|pg||
nt|psridhar: now was 4@s making?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  2@C has several meanings, and 2N showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|psridhar: couple of guesses involved in 4@s..|pg||
nt|psridhar: but favoourite to make -once the @h ace is seen with W, the opener shd hv @c ace, so 4@s rates to make|pg||
nt|dagold: partner has to have 4 hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|psridhar: hence we hv to assess this 5@d as a good save by the leaders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: accurate defense required to secure 500 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Sudden change of personality by south|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: well, I had though the auction over|pg||
nt|dagold: for me this sequence shows a good 3@h bid|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Bit of a lunge by East|pg||
nt|dagold: but perhaps it was lebensohl for them|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has shown values with the doubel so leaves it to partner |pg||
nt|dagold: it really shouldn't be leb here|pg||
nt|dagold: pass of 2@s showed a bad hand already|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: He will feel good after this --likely gain |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: ...no real reason..|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psridhar: the righ gets richer here, perhaps closing out the match, a looong one|pg||
nt|garnetts: I tend to agree this hand is about what partnet might expect|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: and maybe not enough|pg||
nt|idc: yes, and continuing clubs not best - think they needed to cash tricks then get a 3rd round of diamonds from North maybe|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: throw diamond |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: natural heere for declarer to play on diamonds west will duck first diamond but if declarer overtakes he will pin the 9 on secojnd round|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|idc: promote a trump for South|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona: doubtless north reluctant to double with his void, but the bid seems hard to avoid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|garnetts: claim time|pg||
nt|dagold: but they have bought it in 3@h which is actually a fair result for wales|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: he had to overtake hoping for @ds to be 3/3 as there was only one entry to dummy but the 9x doubleton had same effect|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: maybe my trump promotion line was wrong - maybe forcing declarer in @h is the way to -2?   not sure|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|2H|nt|gracelin: Yes, the cards do not lie favorably for declarer n any suit.|pg||
nt|dagold: Byrne played it well on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: declarer need to knock out CA first then either guess spades or endplay north in the end.|pg||
nt|dagold: the Q@c was ducked and he played a LOW @c next then Q@s J@s so took 2@c, 2@h, 2@d and 3@s|pg||

nt|gracelin: I predict declarer will also make here.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|nt|gracelin: low club play is catering to south's having singleton CA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: going about it rather strangely - maybe he was afraid South would have the singleton ace|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he ought to be OK|pg||
nt|gracelin: south is a passed hand, so unlikely to have SK now.|pg||
nt|dagold: can make by guessing the spades as easy as anything else|pg||
nt|gracelin: so play low spade after winning HA, and eventually end play north with 4th round spade seems good.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: very long indeed and thanks all for watching|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: last 3 bds here|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  A frozen moment in time|pg||
nt|garnetts: a weak two with two aces --a hanging offence |pg||
mb|2C|nt|wilkinsona: if so somewhat optomistic|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@s a make or 4@c|pg||
nt|dagold: some play 4@c as clubs and spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks to me that East will make 3N although "Deep Finesse" would not think so|pg||
mb|2N|nt|idc: Murdoch got @c suit wrong on Bd 6, so -3 in 3NT instead of making, more IMPs to WBU|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|wilkinsona: well NS may sac in 5 clubs now|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: very close -and interesting 4@h|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: so theory is, one of the players forgot the system|pg||

nt|garnetts: I agree with you Tony--cramp them for space--get them at the five level |pg||
nt|dagold: one with a heart underlead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psridhar: if declarer guesses trumps he can make with a throw in on N|pg||
nt|psridhar: Thanks Gary , you have been very educative too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a great pleasure being with you and thanks all our great spectators for your feedback |pg||
nt|psridhar: first he shd ruff a club -as a matter of technique, here it is essential too|pg||
nt|psridhar: after @c ruff, run @h jack, @h to king, @s to king, run trumps for the throw in = is the double dummy line, can it work ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6 @h tricks + 2 @s tricks +1 @c =9 and the throw in for 10th =yes double dummy line works|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 @cs 2 @hs 2 @ds and 2@s doesnt add to 9|pg||

pc|s4|nt|garnetts: does anyone know where the scores can be seen?  |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb:  North will be in deep trouble, and declarer can guess the spades, Mike|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: he has done|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: the problem in runnning the @h jack is N made a TAKE-OUT double of 1@h|pg||
nt|dagold: link through the ebu website|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psridhar: so, declarer's misguess is reasonable|pg||

mb|1N|nt|wilkinsona: bad heart break for NS here|pg||
nt|idc: I think N-S play 1M - 2M as a sound, full value raise to two (maybe 7-9 or so), hence the alert last hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Walker avoids a give away double|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: you were right David|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N has a problem due to the diamond blocakge. Declarer may need to run the T on the first round|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||

pc|s4|nt|lestergold: could do but my partners never do they alwayswin these post moprtems when i dont lead their suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: Declarer can still pick up the trumps, and I'm not sure leading @d would help the defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  and rightly so|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East allowed to play 2 hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: if declarer plays the Q@d the suit is blocked if Espen takes the first one|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: that 3@h was unwarranted in my opinion|pg||
nt|psridhar: Liu made a take out X, his pd passed 2@s he had no reason to overrule that|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: I must admit I would just bid 3NT on the South tickets |pg||

pc|h9|nt|garnetts: Like the q@H now and then the ace of trumps --that should ensure enough tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|spil: well if W goes slamming the @H is winning (Hurray) ... but the trumps are disappointing (:()|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: we can see all cards-win ace, king and jack of @h =11 tricks, but that is double dummy. more normal is to take the failing @h finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  South about to be disappointed when his ace is ruffed|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|dagold: making 2 it seems|pg||

pc|d7|nt|garnetts: hmmm   not so sure about that |pg||
nt|garnetts: but it is foolproof  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|spil: so Goldilocks contract...not too much...not too little...just right|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|psridhar: trciky play but ace and 10 of @s hiding the queen has small chance of success, but this shd not win |pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|psridhar: Liu  will ruff and cash out|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
nt|dagold: 6 more to wales on 11 who stopped in 2@s and made 5|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|spil: in other room south opened so hard for them to miss, but should get to it here too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Back - and I'm sure Scotland will have no trouble matching the contract.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|wilkinsona: north finds the double...|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: surprised south didnt bid 4 spades... will it work?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I think 4@H is -1|pg||
nt|henryb:  takes a @c lead to beat 6@s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|idc: South too strong for 1NT but CC suggests a 1@d opening is possible with their methods|pg||
nt|dagold: I play this double as t/o |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: identical auctions in both rooms to end a marathon like match a loong one|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: with trumps 3-3 this shd make in comfort|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Needs to finesse diamonds - would you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will not be too excited about his @d hloding opp tyhe spliter|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: spec says JM has to play this very well|pg||
nt|dagold: and give up on the high card double|pg||
nt|dburn: takeout of what?|pg||
nt|dagold: higher ranking suits|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 4432|pg||
nt|lestergold: calls for an attack in the unbid suit indeed he has|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this holds it to 4 only|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: This is now foolproof too |pg||
nt|dagold: or 4315|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cuttysark:  The Scottish west also led a heart. Yeugh!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 12 tricks is a lot though|pg||
nt|dagold: 1h-1n-p-p- double=spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dagold: higher ranking suits being the emphasis|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: thx and bye all |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not like splintering with three small in the side suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|spil: not sure why N didn't bid 4@D|pg||
nt|dagold: the strong balanced hand is rare and partner tends to be broke|pg||
pc|cT|nt|spil: not sure what 5@H is...|pg||
nt|lestergold: lot of debate about when it is right to lead from unsupported K against suit games|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: I think yhere was clearcut |pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: South settles for 3NT, though perhaps 2 sdades doubled occured to him...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not N's finest hour here and 11 big ones to Wales.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|cuttysark:  he did not find the spade switch either - might put delclarer off the heart finessse|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Has been pointed out that ducking a heart will get a complete picture of the distribution|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Or maybe not quite complete, but a clear indication to finesse|pg||

nt|vugraphzzb: no thought it was asking in @C|pg||
nt|dagold: my double has the same meaing whatever I open which is easy on the memory!|pg||
nt|henryb:  slow going at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona: so thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@C can make --but very agressive |pg||
nt|dagold: probably the same auction here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: last hand for now, but play in this close match continues after a short break|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: nobody bidding clubs yet|pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: I do not like 2@H--prefer 3@C by a lot |pg||
nt|dagold: same result likely |pg||
mb|p|nt|spil: seems to have made the wrong response if asking in @C ... but moving sharply along :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@C a cuebid for @H's - not a new place for us to play after N has opened 2@C and shown primary @H's.|pg||
nt|dburn: fortunately for the defenders, South's diamonds are better than his clubs|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks to our operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: sorry board 16 too, Im a bit early|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, consevative 2 spade bid works for WBU|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems you can start with a double|pg||
nt|garnetts: if North leads a heart this will not make |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  But then you might lose a major suit  fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like double either strikes me that 3@C and then 4@H if thats what I need to bid get this hand over |pg||
nt|spil: absolutely...3@S may be natural but the 4 level should be a cue|pg||
nt|dagold: Wales need to get this right|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, rather random|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the inevitable|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  how about @SK lead :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it gets the hand over|pg||
nt|garnetts: that works too and so does a club |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  So 6 cards beat it and 7 let it make |pg||
nt|garnetts: anything but a Johannisburg sparkler |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: weak NT opg is popular inn this part of the world|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 suits to beat it, one to let it make|pg||
nt|garnetts: might not get the clubs right |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Oh well, opportunity knocked|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N no problem but 4@s may not be so easy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: Byrne must have been warned here that the support wasonly 3 cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: leads wrong major a chance|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|idc: This reminds me of Board 5 - slam is a good contract, cards lie badly, and WBU avoid it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: as confession time, I am afraid I would have found the 3 spade  bid Sime did in the or|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hedre that south had a choice of leading frm either unbid suit and here the lead from the K may not have been optimal|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|psridhar: will take @C finesse and go 2 off|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: and this hand looks like being a big result for WBU|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead from unsupported homoyrs in general from K i think is the riskiest of all|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: that was a good trade her a @d loser being riffed from the long truimp holding|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: a very good deal for declarer|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|idc: Mind you, not easy to reach 6@c with E-W butting in|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|psridhar: stiff ace in NT contracts is not as valuable as other aces are-cannot hold up ! here if only declarer could have held up @h 2 rounds...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|psridhar: N wd hv been squeezed in blacks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: but with Scotland off in 3N why worry?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|s6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  But he should cover the @c9. Either partner has the J or declarer does, in which case you want to force declarer to ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Byrne took full advantage of the Greek gift on the lead|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: absolutely|pg||
pg||
qx|c32|st||md|2S72HQ84DKQJ9754C6,SKJ9865HAK75DA3CJ,SAQTHT9632D8CKQ32,S43HJDT62CAT98754|sv|e|nt|idc: clubs 3-0 offside on last one only thing that prevents 12 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Last hand now...|pg||
nt|spil: On board 24 N Ireland managed to bid and make 7@D...only needed 3-3 trump fit and the opposition forgetting to cash A@S|pg||
nt|dagold: here England let through 4@s|pg||
nt|dagold: so a chance for a big swing to Wales|pg||
nt|henryb:  that was not a Greek gift. It had no poison attached|pg||
nt|lestergold: does this make on  best defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  No hidden warriors in the belly of the horse|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry henry it was a scottish gift|pg||
mb|1S|nt|spil: *trump break|pg||
nt|dagold: on a club lead, south tried to give north a promotion rather than playing for his own ruff in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: probably a flat board anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now I see NO merir in this VUL opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: merit|pg||
nt|psridhar: bidding here doesnt seem consistent with cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: West  got a bit carried away next door |pg||
mb|1N|nt|wilkinsona: Last board, so looks like a good win for WBU|pg||
mb|3D|nt|idc: A good comeback from WBU after they were 24-0 down early in the set|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a bid of interest from south|pg||
nt|idc: this is only approaching the half-way point of course, 2nd half begins in 30 mins|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  not sure i like east's double - more than half his points in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also like a bid here like 1NT  to get things stirred up--been known to try 2@H too |pg||
nt|henryb:  would you respond to 1@s?|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: That's when it's time to crawl back in bed and pull the covers up - or if you're Ireland go straight to Monte Carlo.|pg||
nt|dburn: that won't happen on this bidding - if North leads a club, of course|pg||
nt|dagold: the 3@d bid is likely to make the defence easy if Goodman leads a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: If this is a single suited major, trouble on its way..|pg||
nt|idc: IMHO, the 2@d bid shows 2 things:|pg||
nt|idc: spades and another suit|pg||
nt|idc: and that South has forgotten they aren't playing matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if they can get to 3 clubs, not so bad..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the vulnerability is favourable but I still don't like the overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, this is the last board here.  Big thanks to Denis, to BBO's great and tireless Roland Wald, and to Stephen Peterkin and Liz McGowan.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|wilkinsona: So thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double stirred thing up too it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: dbl is a poor bid might as well pass or bid 1NT --if you must|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I guess 3@c is -3 probably?   as long as the defence lead trumps to prevent 2 spade ruffs in North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and to specs for their comments|pg||
nt|spil: I guess trump promotion available here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: My thanks also to Michael Rosenberg for his analytic comments (and corrections), much appreciated.|pg||
nt|spil: A@S K@S A@C and spade through to give W a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When South removes the dbl of 2@d to 2@s, North knows the second suit is clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: N having bid his hand bids again|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H is not my idea of a bid on Jxxx--why not 5@D  --perhaps he plays the cards better |pg||
nt|dburn: and after 4@h, I guess he might lead one|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h may have been 'last train'|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: yep. may have though 5 diamonds as encouraging|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  May have thought it was the least encouraging noise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  now has to take a good view in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
nt|dagold: so this should go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think so because on most rebids i can bidm clubs to play and i do not mind 2 spades contract as i have ruffing vlaue and bullet|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hope you will be with us later.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be more afraid of partner's strong rebids propelling us too high than his weak rebids|pg||
nt|lestergold: weid also be afraid of missing a game when pard has a maxi|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'd be afraid of getting much too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: id also be reluctasnt to let oppd find ared suit comntract as well|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
nt|garnetts: haven't got a lot of sympathy --there are two entries vai a club ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he gets off play with a diamond--should  east get the hearts right?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades beats it if hook is on|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Well he could hardly lead a spade away from his ace...|pg||
nt|garnetts: It depends if East thinks North knows the heart position|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|psridhar: need to tap E hand off a trump now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean Liz--he could cash the ace of spades and ace of clubs if South had Qxx|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: I think the club intermnediates swing the balance for me its not likely to be a disaster p-laying as high level club contract|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d6|nt|dagold: Wales have played very well in this set|pg||
nt|dagold: only 1 error|pg||
nt|dagold: in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: in letting through 4@h|pg||
nt|dagold: England have their work cut out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks all - see you shortly|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|idc: Now the dummy (with singleton spade) and declarer's line, are also screaming "trump lead"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence going well, back to trumps now..|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  i understand, but it is ever so obvious to declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: a @h ruff was needed|pg||
nt|psridhar: now may be 2 late|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: now decl can ruff the @h, play @c king and ruff with @s J, back to hand with a trump and play @c as trump substitutes thru S|pg||
nt|idc: still time|pg||
nt|spil: a disappointing finish for Scotland but well done to WBU|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  that would be 'never.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  As in this -200?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: as cards are spitting ok neither £@s or 4@c making but Goodman still felt that a double was too risky|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|psridhar: that @d king re entry is working against defense|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c7|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|spil: a sad finish for Scotland...losing 16 imps on the last 3 boards :(|pg||
