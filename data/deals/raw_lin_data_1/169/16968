mb|p|mb|1S|nt|greerm: here we have the first board for comparison|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|ahh: still better than lots off in a phantom |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: hover your mouse over the closed room score to see their bidding|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahh: very heavy 1nt in other room |pg||
nt|ahh: especially with 3 @S cards |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|greerm: and 11 points and all 4 tens, very heavy indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: defence here likely to be @H lead and @D switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 3@C is bergen|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|ahh: we had a seminar in scotland last year where we were critised for being too aggressive on lead |pg||
nt|greerm: 4 tricks fairly straightforward for the defence, 2@H 1D and the trump ace|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|galadriel: This lead may let it home|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahh: so i thought I Sime might start with high @H|pg||
nt|greerm: does anyone know whether SIme MAthieson play attitude or count when defending?|pg||

nt|pitiful:  the english team are going for name changes|pg||

nt|pitiful:  i quite like south's name|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|paulg:  Good morning Alan|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  rex has high standards for weak 2's|pg||
nt|pfbr: what is 2@s?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Hi all good morning|pg||
nt|pfbr: morning all|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW are not really Towers and Richards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: everyone relax,  operator witll catch up shortly |pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: We are on catch up here it seems |pg||
nt|pitiful:  good morning|pg||
nt|dagold: Good afternoon Everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: light double from south   with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd guess sime/matheson|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anderson and Greenwood one of the most experienced pairs in the event|pg||
nt|paulg:  David Greenwood, known as jtr on BBO, is also a frequent vugraph commentator|pg||

nt|ahh: so lesson to be learned   passive leads often the best |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|greerm: wouldn't a @H lead lead to the same result?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahh: south loves his empty suits |pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|greerm: well, 11 opposite 11 worked on the last hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||

nt|ady: seems only 11 after all|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sensiblle result for e-w|pg||
nt|ady: looked like 12   maybe play not as it was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but are we sure not 12 operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Gold and Sid Ismail|pg||
nt|newmoon: hello all  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 off is not that bad considering |pg||
mb|1S|nt|dagold: Hi everyone! (again)|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not --  depending on defence|pg||
mb|2C|nt|2hplus4: Sound opening even though flat and 11 HCP|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cameron_1: @d looser in end game I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d doesn't look like an acol 2|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Sid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @S suit worth more trhan one HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: I would bid on Souths hand I must admit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: I just saw Scotland bid this to 6@S via Kokish relay |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are putting in contracts and leading and claim|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT  for n/s   no reall problems|pg||
nt|newmoon: me 2|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 3N -- whether E preempts or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: could make a game facing the right weak notrump type|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|2hplus4: Tight game missed Declarer perhaps able to endplay S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker has been conservative holding three small clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
pc|s5|nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  short conservative because his opener is minimum and they are non-vulnerable|pg||
pc|d4|nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes W quite conservative|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With S long in @C and @S declarer suspects @H A falling|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  Walker and Short have a tendency to avoid thin games. They are often in the par contract but the trend is to bid these games and challenge the opponents to beat you|pg||
pc|d3|nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||
nt|newmoon: plse stay tuned - we have a problem|pg||
nt|newmoon: will he make it tho?  has to hook @C10 after 2@Hs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: hoping for 3-3 split|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|h8|nt|xenya: and emerge with 11 tricks|pg||

nt|greerm: you scots always have to bring that up :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahh: other room good old fashioned acol sequence |pg||
nt|greerm: anyone love the law of total tricks?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|greerm: @C and @S here|pg||
nt|greerm: N/S can make 9 in @S, E/W 10 in @C ? |pg||
nt|galadriel: Will X her show good hand, and 3@S long @Ss?|pg||
nt|greerm: so 19 total and 18 cards|pg||
mb|d|an|a|nt|ahh: north will not care what it shows |pg||

mb|p|nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal spot here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|xenya: somewhat strange 1N by E|pg||

nt|2hplus4: What kind of 2@S is that?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: and se does not play kokish|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Might go off though Shirley :)  |pg||
nt|copeyj: good morning all|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|pitiful:  north might bid 4@d now|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will no doubt end in a number od hearts|pg||
nt|pitiful:  morning captain|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|xenya: E will overcall now?|pg||
nt|xenya: holding 4 hearts i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: back to real time|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down quite a few on accurate defence|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Doesn't look like an Acol 2 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards available at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|2hplus4: Certainly prevented EW finding @C fit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|pitiful:  fooled us all|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: a heart lead beats 3NT --but no chance of finding it |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: North might even get another chance to lead ace and another heart |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|s9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|newmoon: Open Room started with the last 2 boards.  They have comparfisons... we don't|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|dagold: nice contract to stop in here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|newmoon: more control in @C than in 2@H, yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  West might have considered 3@c|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d2|pc|c8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|2hplus4: Vul v Not with 3 spades?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: very nicely done |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: that was not what i meant by accurate defence|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally EW are just a bit short of 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|ady: no frills on this one from Norman|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|garnetts: but nine tricks are available not that I can count |pg||
nt|sybarra: we in a claim?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think we are going off line again |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: EW needed to engineer a spade ruff to beat it by several tricks, probably 3 |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: at an early stage|pg||
nt|paulg:  back-seat driving, i agree|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|nt|xenya: the spade switch by W looks odd -- and so does declarer's decision to finesse -- surely E was marked with the 10|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: he would have made 2@S if he had gone up with the king -- plying for either 3-3 in trumps or singleton 10 |pg||
nt|xenya: *playing|pg||
nt|2hplus4: West coulkd have tried for a trump promotion by continuing @H|pg||

nt|ahh: 6@D possible|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|galadriel: It's not great though is it?|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think they'll settle for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|greerm: very difficult to find the @D fit after 2NT, so 6NT theeir only chance|pg||
nt|ahh: 2nt is the worst start for big /marginal hands as it eats so much space and nobody has great methods over it |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: and that would be very agressive by North|pg||

nt|pitiful:  3@d is not textbook|pg||
nt|copeyj: I reckon Bell will overcall with the west hand next door, but we will see|pg||
nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an obvious defence perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was not suggesting i follow the rules|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it was not meant as a critisism|pg||
nt|copeyj: I know :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 5@h now|pg||
nt|copeyj: I find 3@D quite scary, but I am applying for my bus pass in 12 months time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you would be more at home in senior bridge simon|pg||
nt|cameron_1: bezerk might be a better word|pg||
mb|2D|nt|2hplus4: Cards lie well for slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
pc|s3|nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
pc|cK|nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard to know if they can have a weak two in 4th, or an immediate two in 4th seat|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: again not an easy hand to handle|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||

nt|xenya: yes :)|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2@S if weak ( and what else could it be?) looks almost perfect|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|newmoon: South never passes, playing Junior bridge|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps a major suit struggle this time?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think EW will bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: pass is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt looks like minors, others might use it as a xfer to 3@c (lebensohl-ish).|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The response makes the xfer more likely.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Transferring into that @d suit isn't for everyone.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: potential for EW to get overboard if West opens |pg||
nt|xenya: i suppse E felt he had to do something|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  4@c, showing the black suits would be best from Short, if they played that|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: Since I would be bid 2@S on much worse than that--with a semi-solid suit I like 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: west has an automatic pass |pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: a lovely lead-directing dble!!|pg||

nt|xenya: meanwile NI reached 7@D on 24 (uggh)|pg||

nt|xenya: 14 imps|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 6 major 5 minor and I don't use Michaels|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@H feels like an overbid |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: how many @d's does 1@d promise?  if it's 3 then how can they know about the "double fit"?|pg||
nt|april7: and all aces, there is even a possibility for 7, but not making|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Ooh-er|pg||
nt|xenya: missing an ace|pg||
nt|paulg:  would you bid 4@c over 3@h?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they've done well as the club lead looks right|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes The opponents seem limited. As it happens so is partner |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|newmoon: @C10 lead here probably better...|pg||
nt|xenya: they gained 14 imps i meant|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|newmoon: contemplating whether to get to dummy and run the @HJ, playing East for 10x|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|april7: not to be understood, the pass by E with this hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|newmoon: what other legitimate chance is there?|pg||

nt|xenya: good double by S|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Could he not read the @C pip for a second ruff?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but we would have been doubled|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, did he think his partner has raised on singleton king of hearts?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must be getting close to time trouble here, with five boards still to play|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3NT likely to make here|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be another multi auction and North will raise 2NT to 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @C lead needed|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Unlikely from W|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence may block the diamonds|pg||

nt|xenya: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: or it may die out on the 1 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h by s?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: but the final contract is probably correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: North has done well to pass--I might well have bid |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even stranger|pg||
nt|paulg:  May be 2@d from West, weak with both majors|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: East might also have just bid 3NT over 2@H unless he is really thinking six might be on |pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  3@c was pass or correct|pg||
mb|3D|nt|newmoon: not the time to beak the transfer with 4@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2N was a @h raise|pg||
nt|newmoon: with 3-4-3-3, deduct a point = he has a minimum|pg||
nt|xenya:  looks like pass is missing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well this is not the real auction of course |pg||
nt|paulg:  no, this is either the wrong auction or wrong board|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: an odd choice with all that black suit cover --heart lead and spade switch beats it |pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  okay, i think this is close except that Soith opened 2@d multi|pg||
