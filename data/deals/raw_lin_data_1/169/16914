nt|yorkbeach:  1cx is like Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hence the rather unusual 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@c is strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Blacks or reds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S that is|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Looks like it, 2@C pass or correct if you have the red suits|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  card says 1x = (x+1)+sound|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: well, one would assume that they could avoid a 4-2 fit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bid 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner can bid at the 3-level you can afford to bypass 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT suggests a more balanced hand than he has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and more in hearts|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with 3 aces and a spade honour, South is certainly accepting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 top tricks as it is but they won't bid the grand|pg||
mb|6C|nt|yorkbeach:  it is quite common to play that 5M is either good trumps but poor controls or bad trumps but good controls - partner hasto work out which|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South is worth 6@H now, not sure that will help though|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North has nothing to cue|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and cannot really bid a grand with one ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which should be no surprise for Denning|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  2@d = game force|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-card majors. Takes me back to the 60's :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW style is that 1M is often a 4-card suit in a hand too weak fo a 14-16 1NT|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I still play 4-card majors|pg||
