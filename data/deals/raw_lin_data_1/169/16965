nt|sybarra: hello Stephen and all |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|toobad: another|pg||
nt|dburn: London buses, these - you wait all day for a slam, then three come along at once|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit of a 5 or 7 deal on a @s lead|pg||
nt|mamos: mmmmm|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but in six you might cash two clubs and play hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  except the doubleton @dQ may come to the rescue|pg||
nt|dburn: perecentages not at all easy to calculate|pg||
nt|mamos: have you got an envelope handy David?|pg||
nt|dburn: though certainly you should not neglect the extra chance in diamonds, so not a "true" five or seven hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must have got the clubs wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|toobad: You seem to have drawn the short straw with your connection Stephen|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|idc: rehi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Temperemental connection...hopefully be fine now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: back to spelling classes...|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks for catching up|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprising, perhaps, in view of weak 2@s opening by South|pg||
nt|toobad: the thing to do, if you are only in 5!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  midly surprised that East did not add on a point for the 10-9 of @h |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: Stephen is our operator, network troubleshooter & parttime commentator|pg||
nt|idc: a man of many talents|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: mmm...|pg||
nt|idc: I see East rather panicked in 3NT last hand, played @d from hand and went one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: play lost in connection error|pg||
nt|mamos: 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|toobad: a quiet pass by west|pg||
nt|mamos: EW seem to have been too passive here|pg||
nt|sybarra: West not a fun hand to lead from |pg||
nt|mamos: and are maybe a bit lucky that game is not making their way|pg||
nt|toobad: d would be good, but prob AS|pg||
nt|mamos: as it happens West  cannot do much harm |pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: W will be endplayed a lot on this hand|pg||
nt|toobad: great start for defence|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: still, no one will bid a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a poor contract|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it does have the merit of nine on top|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: well...it does have 9 top tricks :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  unfortunate :(|pg||
nt|dburn: which is not as poor as some of the 3NTs I have seen|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|idc: we'll see the results of those fiorst two boards at the end of the match|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: someone might have doubled this contract|pg||
nt|toobad: a c now |pg||
nt|jcomyn: hiya - here we have Richard Boyd and hugh gormally fo ireland. Richard works in the cbai office and hugh is the grandson of well known official kay downes.fraid I dont know the ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: english players|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  well counted - getting late!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: from now on, will have comparisons from the other room|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzwq: Sry...Lost the play... was 4HX and was 4 off...|pg||
nt|mamos: both from the  NE Tom from Yorkshire and Chris from Darlington   |pg||
nt|toobad: E should have played the 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Connection seems more stable now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: I've often been in 3NT with 9 top tricks; and sometimes for my side|pg||

nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzn: sry, there seem to be some tech probs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: we ll restart in a couple of minutes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: and a testing board to start|pg||
nt|daman: very much so    EW will surely reach 4@H|pg||
nt|daman: if permitted|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I was wondering what we would bid at the table with the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: blacks v reds and the spades normally win|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid as North?   if anything?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have tried 3/4@S but 4@C looks right to me|pg||
nt|vugraph814: we have had some PC problems - they are playing board 1 - result in a little moment - SORRY|pg||
nt|smoller: Welcome here. This is first part of the playoff for the Danish Team Championships|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Moller and Povl|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and all specs|pg||
nt|smoller: The 4 best teams from 1. division (a round bobin with 12 team) play semis today and final tomorrow|pg||
nt|sommer: the bidding didnt go like this..just short to the final contract. Makeabale with @Clead and 2 ducks..guess 9 tricks are soon coming up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Just in time - hi alla|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: good evening|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|baldfriede: looks as if 3nt was possible here|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk5: Welcome Friede and Uttam|pg||
pg||

nt|idc: Hard to see this one not being flat as well|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will be a long break for dinner. Restart at 20.00 local time, in about 3 hours and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have a lot of high cards but poor shape and two top @d losers|pg||
nt|mamos: bet you didnt expect @d9 to win last trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability is going to make this board less interesting than it might|pg||
nt|dburn: one thing about these players - they have a refreshing attitude towards getting on with the game|pg||
nt|idc: v 4@h North needs to switch to @d at trick 2, continued @c in OR and declarer had 10|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - we should be finished in time to watch the highlights of the 1st world cup game|pg||
nt|toobad: no time penalties!|pg||
nt|toobad: lightening play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does other room result look right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|toobad: sounds good Guthi|pg||
nt|idc: A point of technique on this hand:|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT agrees spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks goofy |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|idc: in 4@s on say trump or @h or @c lead: draw trump, eliminate side suits finishing in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  card also says that 2NT shows slam interest - maybe West thought he was not good enough |pg||
nt|idc: then a @d to Q and claim - South endplayed even if they began with AK @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  true - but most of the time South has dxA-K he will lead one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dA-K|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: seems to think he has now :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|5D|nt|idc: Of course, they might have led one from @dAK, but no reason not to play it properly :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Do not understand this bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|toobad: n might pass this, nope|pg||
nt|mamos: oh its the terrorist 2@c|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yorkbeach:  North will need to switch to a @d at trick two to stop the overtrick|pg||
nt|idc: spotlight on North then...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  results |pg||
pc|cT|nt|idc: Many players go through this stage in their bridge careers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is hoping for a 6th @s but optimistic even then|pg||
nt|idc: Lose patience on potential slam hand and use Blackwood |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have responded 2NT and so not felt the need to take control later|pg||
nt|dburn: chance for Northern Ireland - right defence not all that far-fetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: lebs |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, the 2@c bid left them stuck a little over 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: West is worth no more than a "sound raise " to 4@S  some pairs play 3NT shows this sort of hand as  response to 1M|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: declarer not looking too aghast...|pg||
mc|11|nt|idc: not overtrick - for the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: and it might even stop the contract|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SA532HAK96DK65C64,SJ74HT75DCAKQJ532,ST9HQJ82DAQJ743C8,SKQ86H43DT982CT97|sv|n|nt|daman: he needs to find a singleton KQ of @Ds to make :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not often that is found|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|liv71:  lazy 6S?|pg||
nt|uttam: g eve all|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am not sure why West passed here; he certainly had reasons to upgrade the hand a bit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Bob|pg||
nt|vugraph814: lost track of board 1... sry|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|barbyh: diamonds favorable so 7 could make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@h is makeable but will they reach it?|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: won 11 IMPs    4@H only in the CR|pg||
nt|roswolf: that non classical weak 2 may produce some action|pg||
nt|daman: Laffineur now up by 19|pg||
nt|roswolf: they have momentum|pg||
nt|daman: Clubs were never mentioned in the CR after a multi auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: but never write off team Z|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and also 7nt....|pg||
nt|barbyh: but thats on a finesse|pg||
nt|barbyh: not my first choice|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2nt is strange for me. |pg||
nt|barbyh: wouldnt 3 hts be forcing?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but after 3nt, what will W bid?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w frozen out|pg||
nt|roswolf: but they will do well to avoid a largish minus|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s i mean|pg||
nt|daman: largish must be a British word|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|daman: great stab for a lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: actually scottish because of the ending|pg||
nt|smoller: 1@H is transfer responce, 2@H natural with a strong hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty tempting 6@H I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: if he bids 4hts assuming Bilde has a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: did he take 3@h as a 5-card suit?|pg||
nt|barbyh: advance q bid|pg||
nt|barbyh: in support of hts|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: here comes the tap|pg||
nt|uttam: good 6h for N/S ,  difficult to reach though|pg||
nt|mcphee: splinter in @C would have got them there|pg||
nt|mcphee: west giving them another chance:)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I think West should have interfered early at this vulnerability. 3@c or even 4@c|pg||
nt|uttam: west may push them|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barbyh: maybe asking for ht queen?|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|uttam: 6h can be beaten, underlead club for d ruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: cheap save BIG time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|smoller: Do not believe the running score, there has not been any boards to compare (I guess)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: down 1 only|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure found great cover card is @S|pg||
nt|baldfriede: would you actually underlead @c here?|pg||
nt|uttam: inspired lead? to defeat 6h|pg||
nt|mcphee: against 6 you might try if they splinter in @C|pg||
nt|mcphee: worth the shot|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe East should have played just one @D before @H K|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but I had made a grand slam trial with 5nt = asking for extras|pg||
nt|mcphee: i might not have the guts to do it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: with a 50% chance of the 10 being in opps hand?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Steen Moller|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  With another @C.layaout, he woiuld go down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and welcome to Hans Werge|pg||
nt|smoller: Hello All.. Esp. mr. Werge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I got the message...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the heart finesse right he may try to make his trumps separately|pg||
pc|d6|mc|10|pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SK4HQT98DK9CK9854,SA6HKJ6432DQJ763C,SQJT987532H75D5C7,SHADAT842CAQJT632|sv|e|nt|yorkbeach:  cannot find what 3NT means on their card|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  three rounds of clubs at other table too|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about that @c8 - seemed to be a half-way house between shwoing count and discouraging|pg||
nt|dburn: but a more usual attitude @c5 might have got the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  foul @d split here|pg||
nt|idc: if playing attitude perhaps she thought @cT might have suit preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: sorry, meant reverse attitude|pg||
nt|dburn: if playing attitude, your cards do not have "suit preference overtones" - this isn't Humpty Dumpty bridge|pg||
nt|idc: just discouraging with 5 clearly best if normal attitude|pg||
nt|idc: it is if I say it is!|pg||
nt|toobad: Scotland on a roll|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: real junior start both contracts for the high jump|pg||
nt|toobad: 5d would have been worth a shot there|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|vugraphzwq: E thinking ominously but passes...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: 2@D  = GF|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not even you john|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: OK ...Let's hope connection holds up a little now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  East was probably wondering whether West is showing a hand too good to open 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Stephen - a slight overbid then if GF|pg||
nt|idc: In the other room, SOuth led @s2 v 3NT, and North put in @s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 8 tricks in view (and that is with @h 3-3)|pg||
nt|idc: so the 10 won trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Any thoughts on North's dbl?   I quite like it opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  the right shape certianly|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind it at these colours, but might tip declarer to a line he would not otherwise find|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it's a bidders' game, and North-South certainly play it that way|pg||
nt|mamos: might misplace @SK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: The English EW  are both experienced and perhaps less "excitable" than many JUniors  Id expect a reasonably steady performance from them|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes = declarer needs to duck the 1st @s really|pg||
pc|d9|nt|toobad: should be 2 off |pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: could very well do|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South dozing|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos: Robertson may make this   but even 1 off will be a couple of imps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  double dummy I can see how to make it: knock out the @hA, cash @h/@c winners and exit with 3rd @d|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - declarer wasn't going to run the four, although he would have made some kind of history if he had|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: A guess declarer may be able to put pressure on North, who is holding most of the defensive values|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is leading twice towards the hearts in case North has A-x|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: close to making but 1 off seems right |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to duck a spade to North to keep an entry|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|toobad: if he runs 10c he will make it|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he should have done - four diamonds, three hearts, one of each black suit...|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|idc: All eggs in 3-3 @c split basket, not that I can blame West for that|pg||
nt|idc: hmm, North should have covered that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would have been better to play second heart here|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he needed more time and more entries than he had to set those up|pg||
pc|sJ|mc|9|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SK4HQT98DK9CK9854,SA6HKJ6432DQJ763C,SQJT987532H75D5C7,SHADAT842CAQJT632|sv|e|nt|roswolf: slam on here|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow quite a set of hands here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: some goulash for sure|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcphee: for sure they have some call to show red suits|pg||
nt|uttam: 6d for e/w, good save 6s|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 12-14 in theory|pg||
nt|baldfriede: whaz is the NT range of N/S? 10-12?|pg||
nt|mcphee: in any  case a great number of @S will be bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: lots of 10s, 9s and 8, which is why one may upgrade this. on the other hand - no ace|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But East can make 6@D|pg||
nt|uttam: but east will surely ask west to choose a minor, |pg||
nt|mcphee: bet ya west could also Roland:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: East is a better player, so .....  :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|imp_jan: weer terug gegaan|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: NS don't have a Weak 2@H so 3@H can be unusual....|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult to reach if north raises|pg||
nt|daman: I agree with Jan|pg||
nt|daman: raise|pg||
nt|barbyh: another slam|pg||
mb|4D|mb|5C|mb|d|nt|roswolf: 4@S-  @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: correction: Max carryover after the new rules is 12 imps!..so Pharma didnt get the full half score..but 12|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Slam - if you have good tecknique in the @H-suit - NOT playing the 10|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6@S|pg||

nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|uttam: well------|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: ONLY 5|pg||
nt|daman: does 5@S ask for a @H control?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: not alerted here|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may/should raise - he has shown a yarborough|pg||
nt|daman: ty Lou|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi david|pg||
nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: 5@H would SHOW a @H control so 5@S must be asking for one|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|baldfriede: not what I would have expected. did West take 4@d as natural?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think E might have dbled 4@D and later bid @C, or is that idea all wet?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  They will probably end up in 6 @C, which is much better than 6 NT|pg||
nt|smoller: The notes on the conventioncard dont mention 3@C and 3@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N and S are both bridge-teachers, so I am confident!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|uttam: i think east made his bid very fast|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: will need the diamond finesse   but will no doubt make |pg||
nt|daman: Laffineur pick up anothe 6 IMPs on Board 2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: well that got there |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd2 team Zlost more imps when 3@S went off in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: Fantoni is not a fast player|pg||
nt|daman: this may take a while|pg||
nt|smoller:  is not a good idea when North has that spade holding|pg||
nt|smoller: * 4@H is not....|pg||
nt|sommer: quite easy to take 9 tricks, tho|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: can he make it almost? hmmm|pg||
nt|baldfriede: almost only. 2 trump losers and a @d|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: really needs the @D finesse ruffing it down in 3 looks wrong|pg||
nt|smoller: I am lost, not being a bridge teacher ant more|pg||
nt|smoller: *any more|pg||
pc|h2|nt|smoller: Even 7@C can be made|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|barbyh: he had to have the missing kings|pg||
nt|mcphee: well he might have cashed that A@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: right    I agree|pg||
nt|barbyh: now 7|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|vugraphzzn: seems like it was a missunderstanding|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: 2@s bid should have an A and a K minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: in that case, W was confortable in X 5@c|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|baldfriede: would not have changed a thing. East has no discards|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: no|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when North takes 5 minutes to throw the spade...|pg||
nt|sybarra: did I hear a sigh of relief?|pg||
nt|sybarra: on the score board|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3 contracts 3 going down - enthusiasm a bit misplaced|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S?|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|toobad: a lucky escape|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|toobad: if e bids 2 they will get too high|pg||
nt|idc: In other room West left nothing unbid when they splintered with 3@s|pg||
nt|toobad: a good 3N in the other room|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: no kidding - that would have been Hand of the Year if he'd made it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: they did|pg||

nt|mamos: I ddont blame East --  2@S may keep NS out of the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c and 3NT should both be making|pg||

nt|sommer: slamtime|pg||
nt|mcphee: great hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: hi Hedy|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but hard to bid slam in the defence with small values, so maybe not biddable|pg||
nt|uttam: but enplay does not help,still he will be left with dia to lose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h on NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a @d save is too expensive|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is why had to cash A@H sooner|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: 9 toppers in NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of us would say the @c suit is not good enough for a 2@c bid|pg||
nt|smoller: I litle difficult to bid with a void facing nothing, but the ops bidding may help|pg||
nt|barbyh: 1 trick too much|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|daman: more if @Hs aren't led|pg||
nt|hedyg: @hs get into the picture easily if you play raptor NT|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C now|pg||
nt|sommer: the 2@C bid helps..imo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Disciplined pass from North in first round|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: can make 4@S from here    |pg||
nt|daman: I suspect the hesitation here is with North?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D also can make   but difficult  fortunate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: no Fulvio in the tank|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Fantoni was t/o, do we bid 3@H as E?|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Lou|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: West and South on same side of screen|pg||
nt|daman: right   I knew that|pg||
nt|ady: likely n/s will play 4@S|pg||
nt|sommer: 5 even..Exclusion|pg||
nt|sommer: ..5@H - 6@S?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a 5-card support  I´m not interested to give space for opps to bid, so I think a direct support is better|pg||
nt|barbyh: Is graversen suggesting a save with his 3 d call?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|smoller: Yes, he has decided to bid slam|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like fast 140|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzzn: a 2 imp loss here|pg||

nt|smoller: 5@H = 0 (or 3) keys|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, and if he has 0, it is not in @C:)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: e/w migh have been bidding too much which might have scared n/s into stopping|pg||

nt|sommer: yes..just explaned to the kibz..you knew:)|pg||

nt|sommer: that too, yes|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|smoller: this is going to be a fast one|pg||
nt|smoller: There is no danger in trying the (unsuccesful) spade finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: when S gets out the @S he dumps a @D and ruffs a and then exits in trump for the end play|pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: i understand the reason for raising as north but there was a case for passing imo|pg||

nt|jcomyn: mid-defence i suggest|pg||
nt|toobad: a plus good for the nerves|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mis-defence|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry   I agree but its harder when you are a Junior and on vugraph|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: mid-defence = not too good but not too bad :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm  3NT with two eight card major fits    i dont think the Scots will play 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Looks like NS can make 11 tricks in either major|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT is not exactly ironclad|pg||
nt|mamos: no  4@h seems more likely|pg||
nt|dburn: well, what with the hearts as they are, I guess you'd make it ... still, it is perhaps not the best contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h is hardly laydown either but I prefer that|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well a push is good |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ok but n is a very experienced junior|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh  not a good English result :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|dburn: actually, you don't have an entry to those hearts, so...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you do if South leads a low spade|pg||
nt|dburn: ...maybe South needs to sick in the jack of spades at some point|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|yorkbeach:  put in the @s10 at trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I have done several sessions,  I think the bridge has been excelent |pg||

nt|mamos: is this 15-17 NT|pg||

nt|sommer: 4@H EW can be set here|pg||

mb|p|nt|smoller: On board 1, EW bid 4@H and took the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: chance for leaders here   if they get to 3NT|pg||
nt|smoller: Very discip0lined pass from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: yes, correct in our view|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcphee: a happy landing 3N i suspect|pg||

nt|uttam: y ,but @d are lying well|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||

nt|baldfriede: is North still thinking?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|mamos: wow the hand shave been enormous in this set|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@h looks rather better than 6NT|pg||
nt|dburn: seems odd that the score should be only 7-3 - these boards have had the potential for it to be 47-43|pg||
nt|fifee: hi John|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike Amos, left us to carve the sunday dinner (left us no menu) |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: East had better not fall in love with his hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|toobad: some difference in the speed of this and the Camrose|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  mind you - 12 on top in both thanks to the @dJ|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jcomyn: wont take long to complete the round|pg||
nt|idc: 2@s seems normal, and down one certainly likely if not two|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1@s 1@h 2@d 2@c to lose|pg||
nt|mamos: Becky not prepared to sell out to 2@S|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: s would love to defend s here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  double is presumably a game try|pg||
nt|idc: I like to play that as a game-try dbl, I do hope N-S don't|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: not alerted but presumably a game try|pg||
nt|dburn: why - can they beat three hearts?|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering if it was alerted but remembered that its EBL regs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: why does s not push vul opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: s should be bidding 3c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he knows n is almost certainly void in s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Stephen Peterkin, welcome to you too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: come to that, can they beat four hearts?|pg||
nt|idc: Take your point David but I was worrying that any pair who think South has a game try|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: no doubles alertable in Scotland...|pg||
nt|idc: may also think North has an accept :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not "on top" - suppose East led his singleton spade against 6@h|pg||
nt|idc: even the 3rd best slam, 6@s, should be ok|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the best contract is six hearts by South, but that might be a bit difficult to organise|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead best as cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but West may score a @c ruff to make up the club trick lost on the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: @CQ   is an interesting lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the -2 in OR came when South didn't have trump control to set up a long club trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he may, but this lead may also have lost a tempo - declarer would have problems keeping control on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mamos: (is fearless the code?)|pg||
nt|idc: whereas this lead should give him that, so perhaps -2 for a flat board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: just pesky that spades are 4/1|pg||
nt|toobad: not under enough pressure in 2... 3 would have been more interesting|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: @cQ would have worked better|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: make a lot of tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: played by North, this might be closer to a five or seven deal than the previous candidate|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that West did not double 5@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is trying to work out whether 6@c shows no kings or the @cK?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|idc: good catch - I suspect that he was asleep (understandably given the hour)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 5NT asks for Kings  odd time for \south to be thinking|pg||
nt|toobad: i think they are all just v tired|pg||
nt|toobad: 7 now!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  given how quickly they play, it would have been possible to arrange the schedule for an earlier finish |pg||
nt|dburn: seven? if North believes South's bidding, she should bid at least eight|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: and ew will almost certainly bid 3d|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds plays well for East  -- and a heck of a lot better thaN @s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: not ridiculous to try for game with the South cards - those kings look well placed (though one of them isn't)|pg||
nt|toobad: wow|pg||
nt|mamos: it is exhausting watching Junior bridge emotions fluctuate wildly  brilliance turns to idiocy and then back again in a twinkling  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  anyone who has been following the snooker, it is heading for a last frame decider between Selby and Maguire - not that we want to stop you from watching here :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: THOUGH THIS IS NOT SO GOOD|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East did well to read the lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: East could just have tried to cash top cards because North had to ruff with winners|pg||
nt|toobad: good to see Richard thinking about best defence|pg||
nt|idc: except for 'brilliance' you could be talking about any of my games|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: Well, no UCB 2@d by partner, so it is a little pushy|pg||
nt|dburn: facing three trumps to the queen and clubs headed by A10 or K10, game would have reasonable play|pg||
nt|dburn: so trying for game is only mildly fearless|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  considering what some people overcall on non-vul these days South was hugely better than he might be|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: though in fact trump was best|pg||

nt|idc: Interesting auction by East in OR|pg||
nt|idc: If you have a penalty dbl of 3NT, I think you also have one of 4@c|pg||
nt|mamos: in a way the result does suggest that South was hopelessly over optimistic|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 26 HCP EW figure to reach game|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  @s ruff could beat it even if the @dK were onside|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with the hearts blocked, it looks like declarer can even afford a diamond loser|pg||
nt|idc: I like that: both sides wanted to play in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North-South had been allowed to play 3NT, they would on best defence have achieved an above-par result of minus 600|pg||
nt|dburn: good bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 5@h 2@c 2@d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: yes if the double showed Diamonds quite surprising not to try a little push|pg||
nt|dburn: a good save against the 630 available to their opponents|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  let S know that a @c return is futile|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: must be a joke|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he was like greased lightning compared to normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!|pg||
nt|yuval10: i wonder how did he went down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: This one can go fast. 4@H, 11|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c doesnt preempt anything, i prefer 5@c by S|pg||
nt|yuval10: played small @h towards dummy, to suffer a @c ruff?|pg||
nt|mcphee: as was I|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|daman: Quantin bid 5@C directly in the CR|pg||
nt|sommer: ..wonder, why he didnt...but still easy to get there|pg||
nt|smoller: 1@D = @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so he did!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: the aauction has a different tempo now will west bid slam?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@s not my choice|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@D=@H|pg||
nt|smoller: transfer|pg||
nt|sommer: 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: surely now defend|pg||
nt|jlall: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: this is not a forcing pass situation is it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: cash ing his ace very sound|pg||
nt|daman: habits of a lifetime|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: i d cue with S's hand:)|pg||
nt|wolwerine: 2@D is game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: e/w should reach 3nt here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barbyh: another slam but hard to get to|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@C is gold|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: looks to me Nunes felt obliged to bid|pg||
nt|jlall: 4S is easy here, at most 2 diamonds and a heart to lose if the defense gets them in time|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ady: good swing for the leaders|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: looks like an easy making with 4@d, 2@s, 2@h and 1 @c|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: yes perhaps the decisive blow|pg||
nt|ady: trying to make  down 2|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sommer: yes, what we Danes call x-y sans|pg||
nt|smoller: It wont matter if he took the wrong heart|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer should win with the A here and play @c|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has one more @s's then he can't lose more than 2 of them, together with the K@d and A@c|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: Blakseth won 13 imps after good bidding on board 7.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|barbyh: yes and bd 8 will be a pickup as well|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s was dangerous as South could've find a @c switch and N could've hand the J@c|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  yes thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of flat boards in this set |pg||
nt|dburn: well, lots of no-swing boards|pg||
nt|toobad: there will be some chat about this set in the bar!!|pg||
nt|mamos: though they dont feel flat  in fact bloody bumpy|pg||
nt|dburn: some of them do not really merit the epithet "flat"|pg||
nt|toobad: another imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this is last hand for this set |pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: well done North|pg||
nt|toobad: a little bit of help never goes amiss|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an aul 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Sandra Claridge representing BGB and the SBU (match manager Fiona Abbott)|pg||
nt|idc: Another fun one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I can see that a partnership between Marc Smith and David is not about to happen - Marc loves raising with three|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 11 and 12 have yet to be scored, and Northern Ireland have about 20 IMPs worth of plus positions in those|pg||
nt|idc: Some Easts may feel they are too good for a 3@c rebid, so some will get to a game|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  last board here|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this may temper East's enthusiasm|pg||
nt|idc: Last board today.   Thanks to Stephen Peterkin, our Vugraph operator,|pg||
mb|2C|nt|idc: for allowing us to bring you the vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|toobad: will N bid 2S?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hope EW do not have the misunderstaning about whether this is a fit jump that we saw earlier|pg||
nt|idc: BGB and their representative Sandra Claridge and Fiona Abbott the Match|pg||
nt|mamos: is there a chance of beating  game here?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: and as always, BBO itself and you specs for turning up and putting up with myself & fellow commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: is that forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: no...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Restart in 2 hours and 20 minutes. Should be enough time for dinner|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: 2h reverse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looked routine until 3@c|pg||
nt|mamos: why didnt she just bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|idc: I trust it will also be enough time for the two npcs in this match to return from medical treatment|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  wish I knew|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|idc: but it has made for an exciting match for us watching|pg||
nt|dburn: pity, really. See you in a little while.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I can understand her way of thinking. Two empty suits, she was scared of notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it must be frustrating for the npcs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they see what the piars can do in practice matches but when it comes to the real thing...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are very inexperienced and playing in front of 500+ specs is pressure|pg||
nt|dburn: good grief|pg||
nt|idc: Manager for the Scottish Bridge Union for letting us cover the event.|pg||
nt|idc: And to my fellow commentators, David, Julian and Mike.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E unsure about 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, it might make - South leads a spade, North plays the king, East drops @cQ, etc|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure how they will defeat this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to get to dummy to get the @c wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in short order after this  |pg||
nt|sybarra: :30 am Los Angeles, 9:30 am New York, 15.30 Paris, 2:30 pm London  (scheduled)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Tom's @HK  was certainly helpful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not 1D|pg||
nt|toobad: does it make??|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok Mike what was for lunch?|pg||
nt|fifee: it made in the closed room|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: that 2nt is very dangerous with 2 rags|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|toobad: they've all been taught to bid majors first|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: well, the diamond queen is an entry|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: by whom i would like to know|pg||
pc|c5|nt|toobad: i cannot reveal my sources lol|pg||
nt|idc: True - they should look on it as great experience for future bridge career|pg||
pc|h3|nt|toobad: needs c switch|pg||
pc|cT|nt|toobad: well done|pg||
nt|sybarra: thnk I would have overtaken (by N) and lead a club |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: but East doesn't need it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk5: Thanks all, see you later|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: It's difficult to know what to do for the Welsh Bridge Union  -- there are so few youngsters  -- you know they will be outclassed yet you dont want to  not participate   its not ...|pg||

nt|mcphee: close 1/4 so far|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: now they're in trouble    -36 with 7 boards remaining|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jlall: another pretty boring hand, should be a spade partial for NS, though in the aggressive times in today I could imagine them overreaching to game|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzzn: bet  E wished to open the 1st time he got the chance|pg||
nt|jlall: I think north should just double here, a bad 15 opposite a passed hand vul is pretty dangerous to bid 1N, and he's 4-4 in the majors|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jlall: will be tough to get too high now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|ady: this looks flatish|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: only 1@s?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|sommer: around 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|smoller: Here we have a nice slam in diamonds - not depends on much more than a succesful double finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And 2 NT forcing, naturally|pg||
nt|mcphee: thems a lot of @H with that hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: E fell inlove with his hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe pre-emptive:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: 1@d=@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..maybe just made|pg||
nt|sommer: just made only with @Dlead, I guess|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Much better on Norths hand - always bid NT when you have Dx in a suit!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on the wrong hand.....|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sommer: right:)|pg||
nt|smoller: Maybe 6NT played by North has additional chances|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|wolwerine: And here you have it in two suits...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jlall: I think 1@S is ok, he is definitely maximum but usually if you have a game partner can still bid over it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry for delay|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzyf: 3@H deny 3 cards in @H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Sten and Stig!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes every imp will count now|pg||
nt|ady: they might have brought off a slam with east declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: Michel Bessis leaves|pg||
nt|jlall: i'd like bidding more if he had 5 spades and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|smoller: Hejsa Ralf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt call me Stig - only the W is common|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would have bid 4 in a flash with W hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jlall: and he has done well to stop low on this layout|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wolwerine: But normal to bid 1@S of course|pg||
nt|jbennet: good point. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|sommer: 1NT from N would show 11-14, so thats what he had|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbennet: everybody bids 1 sp.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: Hello Hans. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|jjbrr:  i also like 1@S, but i might be inclined to raise to 2@S originally with the N hand|pg||
nt|smoller: ohhh|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All depends on the trump-suit - and with the @D 9 with A-Q 10, the double finesse will be the way, RÃ¸n makes this slam - I wrote before seein the end of the bidding...|pg||
nt|smoller: 5@D would for many player show 0 or 3 keys (1430)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has he counted the @S King?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks as the only chance is a stiff @dJ on E, but isn´t|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  Or what about the "safe" @D-lead!!!!!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|uttam: but looks like 3@h was some conventional bid, otherwise surely west would have not passed|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D or say good bye|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it does not evn make 3@h this way if S continues @s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: even*|pg||
nt|mcphee: no alert at all|pg||
nt|mcphee: yeah going down 1|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sommer: sort of endplayed on the table now!|pg||
nt|jbennet: but 1 NT is probably the action that would give in average better results.|pg||
nt|sommer: ..must he discard a @S to make?|pg||
nt|smoller: He must guess to throw @S3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: if declarer ducls now he can get 2 ruffs in @d|pg||
nt|baldfriede: ducks*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: or rather 1 in @d and 1 in @s|pg||
nt|uttam: what if S had covered @s10 , west would not have an entry|pg||
nt|baldfriede: opps would provide the entry|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: @H now and -1!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbennet: on this occasion bidding 1sp yealded a minus result. |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jlall: I think that is a style thing, some people prefer to raise to 2S with most hands that have 4 directly as kind of a preempt, the classical style is that that shows extra values and ...|pg||
nt|jlall: a game try opposite a max 1@S though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|nt|hedyg: claim 12|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will go down also after a trumph lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: home now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|jbennet: 1NT bid would most likely have produced a plus score.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jlall: hard to argue with this auction in my opinion, they got to an intelligent contract|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s7|mc|9|nt|smoller: Really Ralf?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What did I hear Graversen say: "Against stronger opponents, I would have lead a @d..."|pg||

nt|idc: It'll be past the players normal bedtime so not sure what to expect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon to all|pg||
nt|toobad: England have 125 and Scotland 89, so Scotland need a maximum victory here to stand any chance of a Junior Camrose win|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like being the decisive match in this year's Junior Camrose|pg||
mb|1C|nt|idc: Heh, I'm remembering the only time I was npc for a Junior Camrose - I think they stayed up a *little* later than this|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: What does a NV 3@C bid look like...|pg||
nt|toobad: which players might that be??|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|sybarra2: hi guys |pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos: rith and Kerri just played a great match against England  bridge of the highest standard  it may be hard to keep that up|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|idc: My lips are sealed, expecially when it comes to how the bar in the college got broken into overnight|pg||
nt|toobad: they have my full confidence|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|mamos: well Scotland have one more match in hand so something like 21-9 or more to Scotland will leave things pretty level|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|mamos: but if England win or hold their own they certainly will be in a strong position|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: they only made 11 in the other room on 8 too........ 12 not easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lucky break in trumps. always 4-1 when i bid this one|pg||
nt|mamos: 2Nt is probably the value bid but West would surely bid game|pg||
nt|toobad: assuming Scotland get 25 from their match in hand|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 4@h is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: West will feel he has some of his hand still to bid but I think you really just have to pass 4@s|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: not sure you shouldnt let pard play 3 nt |pg||
nt|mamos: Diamond leads may leave declarer struggling|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mamos: this should make s!A was oinside  but  the opening lead will make declarer feel more comfortable|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: not to mention sa over the k|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  slightly surprised that West did not open 2NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not that 2NT is a great bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with diamonds 3-2 and the king onside, this has play|pg||
nt|mamos: @DK onside but 4-1 trumps will be too much|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  entry situation dictates ruffing hearts rather than clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer may ruff third heart high and lose a trump trick|pg||
nt|idc: Mind you, I've seen worse slams, if spades were 3-2 it would be making on this layout in @d|pg||
nt|mamos: im a simple soul  i'd have started with top Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  me too|pg||
nt|toobad: me too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|idc: on @cK lead, declarer would have to ruff 2 @c in dummy I think|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  @d back looks best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: expected @DJ there|pg||
pc|h3|nt|toobad: if he finesses 10 d might get hairy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: I have some sympathy with the actual opening lead; it is generally unprofitable to lead the suit in which some opponent has splintered|pg||
nt|idc: both high, so would fail on this @s split|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: declarer in charge I think|pg||
nt|mamos: oops |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: that play shows inexperience|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
mc|11|nt|dburn: mind you, West did open 1@d, so leading that suit may not be a great idea either|pg||
nt|sybarra: think he is still one short|pg||

nt|roswolf: and 6bds left|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 6 boards|pg||
nt|jlall: it is worth noting that 2@D by south in this auction will have longer @D than spades if one is longer, so with 3-3 north would pass, becuase with 5 spades south could comfortably ...|pg||

nt|hawe45:  5 @S, 2 @H, 5 @D and a @C - come om?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another slam....|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ouch final nail in coffin time maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: I am kind of surprised south passed, again it is a more classical style to pass with that hand and certainly fine but not really typical at the top lvels anymore|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  also surprised at the 2@H rebid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: now got worse|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, thats it then|pg||
nt|roswolf: much worse|pg||
nt|daman: turn out the light      the party's over|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, his hearts are quite strong but he is balanced|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  but in this case it works out well|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  i see 1@H was artificial|pg||
nt|jlall: 1N is probably a better contract, but both are easy here|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  so 2@H is his first chance to bid @H naturally, although again i'm surprised they dont play transfers here.|pg||
nt|jbennet: ok.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: x is not necessarily @h. should South bid @s, N will bid 3nt|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: but we havent picked over the entrails yet!|pg||
nt|jlall: i think 1H was natural but promised 8+ and 1D would be 0-7, not sure though|pg||
nt|jlall: do you know raluca?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: yes, and promises at least 4 cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and let Ralf ruff something, itÂ´s a exercise...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|uttam: oh oki|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: agree Hans - nice counting:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I will never be able to understand, why you doÂ´nt open the East-hand with 1 @C - NEVER!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Someone helped me, Ralf|pg||
nt|smoller: You are too oldfashioned Hans|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but I have told my partners that a lead from Jxx and 10xx into the dark is forbidden.....|pg||

nt|mamos: declarer will be happy to get her seven tricks and get under way|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all to Session 4 of the Junior Camrose 2011|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: 1 2 3 or 4 Spades all possible I guess :)|pg||
nt|idc: this was making if declarer hadn't played a round of trumps before @h ruffs, wasn't it?|pg||
nt|toobad: v charitable David|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I thought so|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - it was all over before I'd had a look at the position after trick three|pg||
nt|mamos: certainly had chances  if trumps handled differently|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a better slam this time|pg||
nt|mamos: West knew what he was doing|pg||
nt|toobad: good vision|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll see|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: you should volunteer for coaching John and slow them down dramatically!!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: oh no not overcal;l vul on that garbage|pg||
nt|mamos: good start for Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  we might have another splinter sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: its the style!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: if East plays auto-splinters, that would be a very good description|pg||
nt|toobad: some start ........... first 2 boards|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT looks less likely to let oppo in|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: he wasnever taught that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with his Dad, Jonny Richards is playing them I am sure|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@d trf|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently Morgan does not believe in "any 10" opening |pg||
pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|idc: If that's a weak 2, I doubt I'd do anything but pass as East|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Julian|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Nice Maior he has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Becky must have seen how well the cards lie!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (sorry)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3NT is not a good idea  (even if it makes)|pg||
nt|idc: Naughty step for you Roland if we have any more of those puns|pg||
nt|idc: The cards certainly do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is weak but max is 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wales have a complete dearth of juniors such that they have had to make an U25 side out of their U25s and U20s. Accordingly, no Wales in the Peggy Bayer (U20)|pg||
nt|idc: That explains the enquiry from East then|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not sure whether this pair could play in U20s|pg||
nt|idc: for many Juniors, an 11 count is an average strength 1 opening :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Harris-Richards could play U20s this year|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: I guess West is thinking of coming again, holding 6-4 shape|pg||
nt|idc: looks like both 4@s and 5@d are making too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think it must be a connection problem|pg||
nt|idc: I used to have partners with connection problems - between their bids and their actual hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may have been thinking but not this long|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: 1 @H=3 hts usually|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: Im afraid that Juniors learn from their olders and not betters :)|pg||
nt|toobad: i'm coaching for Lady Milne and one of them overcalled a worse suit than that 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|dburn: is his Dad allowed to play in the Junior Camrose?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  With a full 15 HCP outside of clubs, West should insist on a slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told that I was wrong,  could well be dblton or fewer |pg||
nt|mamos: Pass loks a little odd nonetheless|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: I like East's 3NT  bid  good practical no nonsense bridge |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well i can tell you the irish coach will choke him for doing that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  no but Simon Richards is playing in the WBU team in the Camrose|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder what the 5@s response shows?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E looking puzzled...|pg||
nt|toobad: me too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is a little mystifed as he is looking at the @sQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  West is presumably trying to show extras|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, I expect West has shown the @sQ and East is wondering if two Queens of @s will threaten slam|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|idc: You may have heard the expression "duplication of values" - I guess both E & W having @sQ counts as that|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he was not sure of the percentage play with @sAQ109xx facing @sQxx|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: rehi all|pg||
nt|toobad: confidence shaken after first board, i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think pass did look odd|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|yorkbeach:  West should have done the asking|pg||
nt|idc: expect so; we've all been there|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: wonder what 1 nt would show after 1 @H on that sequence |pg||
nt|mamos: i think dbl  makes it more likely that 1@H shows three cards |pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a reason N didnt bid it|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|toobad: long day |pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: but I expect West just got confused; pity, because then so did East|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: my way is to psyche and then cry|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  ok 8 tricks in NT here for EW. the key is how to find a 9th|pg||
nt|jlall: north will face a very difficult lead problem to begin with|pg||
nt|sommer: hi Søren:).. wonder how;-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: gadgets have been invented for the responder to ask for 5 c majors.|pg||

nt|sommer: np|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbennet: interesting now.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: no miracle this hand      140 in CR a decent score|pg||
nt|jlall: a low heart would work well but it is not attractive when marina shows that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they may well reach 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: now what?..EW have been warned about 3NT here|pg||
nt|jbennet: can they reach 4 sp?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barbyh: club switch and hes down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can be made but not so easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: a very nice dummy declarer will buy here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jlall: on the other hand...nothing is attractive|pg||
nt|smoller: I see among the specs IB Chr. BanK - how is the situation in Qatar?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is it possible for E to show his @s after 2@h?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: 1@C nat 1@D = HEARTS|pg||
nt|jlall: a spade is obviously a disaster but doesn't seem terrible, the only "passive" lead is a club but with rosu showing 5+ of those that is actually dangerous (imagine partner with Qxx ...|pg||
nt|jlall: for instance) and will not accomplish anything|pg||
nt|jlall: ok, good start for the defense!|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  a low @H lead is a great start for NS|pg||
nt|jlall: great lead|pg||
nt|jbennet: laydown.|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is, yes|pg||
nt|smoller: Disciplined pass from South|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|jbennet: 5 d however is decent spot (which is probably were they going to land unless......... |pg||
nt|smoller: well, if they stop?|pg||
nt|jbennet: east 4 sp is a suggestion to play|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Maybe West thinks 4@S was cuebid|pg||
nt|jbennet: if east were interesed in slam, then he have lots of other bids to make.|pg||
nt|wolwerine: But then East should bid 4@D|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, 4@D waiting for a heart cuebid|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 spade should tell west "not interested in slam abut have good spades that can normally stand Hx as support"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: importaht switch now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wolwerine: Souths double got East-West out of 3 NT, but without the double North would lead a club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: as a matter of fact 1@c here was not natural but rather 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer won the first trick rather than ducking because he feared a diamond shift|pg||
nt|jlall: rightly so|pg||
nt|jbennet: would he really??|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jbennet: lead a club?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d8|nt|jlall: he also fears a spade shift attacking dummy's entry|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: I MEANT TO SAY THAT BUT COMPUTER PLAYING UP|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a double finess in @d and W can make. @c ruff is with the @cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @sQ|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|wolwerine: In teams a clublead looks normal|pg||

nt|sommer: agree|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|jlall: smart play by declarer, the hearts are already set up and he doesn't want to play either pointed suit himself, so he lets the opponents cash their hearts and play something for him|pg||

nt|toobad: after 3d a 3h bid would gather a 3s cue and then i think 6h is a good punt, but they knew it was on a hook at best|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless someone just blasts into it |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card does say 1st discard is suit preference|pg||
nt|jtr: Was very tough|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better to have a defensive misunderstanding when only an overtrick is at stake|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: obviously no heart lead in open|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you would guess East led clubs and the defence continued them when in with @DA|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: cards lie very well for EW  here|pg||
nt|toobad: H contract EW and D NS .... competitive auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: I wonder what 3@C is |pg||

pc|d2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraph814: board 12 next|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|roswolf: 44-6 this set for Laffineur|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: can this be axed for blood?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What happened here proves, that you shall not bid 1 @S on the South hand  |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jlall: i imagine declarer will go after hearts and with the queen onside have no trouble making 5|pg||
nt|yuval10: not much here too, declarer will probably lose 2@s and 1 @c|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jjbrr:  agree. not much to this one :) not much EW can do|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow you dont double partials for -1 in teams|pg||
nt|hedyg: far too dangerous , it might make and that would be game|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|hawe45:  By the way - to me, the North-hand is far away from an opening bid - and then 1 @H with 9 8 x x x - OUF!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jjbrr:  the @D lead is a bit scary for S|pg||
nt|sommer: looks like W will make this because, he's sort of forced to go the right way in @D!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jlall: now he has to be concerned that he will misguess diamonds and possibly go down|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|uttam: trick2 i would like to get off by @s play itself|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice pick of move to first base there|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  but as the cards lie he has nothing to worry about, fortunately|pg||
nt|jlall: honestly i do not like the trick one play at all, it seems like you should play the ten so you don't have to guess later|pg||
nt|yuval10: or not |pg||
pc|c9|nt|sommer: ..not any more...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jlall: this is especially true if a low card lead indicates an honor|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|sA|nt|jlall: cashing all the clubs also seems poor, you ruin your transportation|pg||

nt|hedyg: N has a great hand with good spots too opposite 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: how can e/w get a double figure swing !?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think they can bid less than slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s here have fielders choice|pg||
nt|jlall: EW do actually make a game here though it is quite lucky|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  so double dummy it looks like 4@H makes. @h 2-2, @CK onside, @D3-3|pg||
nt|smoller: Why not double now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hard to predict where this is going to end|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sommer: can N make a X for the unbid suits?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sommer: not strong enough|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzyf: Thomas alerted 4NT as minors|pg||
nt|uttam: likely 4s here|pg||
nt|yuval10: W has a great hand now opposite his Partner's bidding|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: ohhhh?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he has a preference!|pg||
nt|hedyg: a slight preference|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  but i think they're better off staying low and going plus in a partscore|pg||
nt|wolwerine: I think they play double shows diamonds|pg||
nt|sommer: now?|pg||
nt|uttam: i would pass on 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzyf: now Thomas said to Fulvio " this is NOT minors!" ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: might end up in a doubled contract i suppose|pg||
nt|sommer: nope|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: might pass and that works too|pg||
nt|uttam: g eve all|pg||
nt|jlall: 2N i view as kind of a bluff, when you have this west hand you can easily imagine the opponents cold for 4S|pg||
nt|sommer: even 4@S had chances!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S-lead -. come on|pg||
nt|uttam: bidding 3@c would show one or two cards more|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jlall: so you might confuse the matter|pg||
nt|jlall: and if your partner has a strong hand, you might make a game|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  3@S i think should score well, probably -1, given the opps should make their contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: do u agree E has a min hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wolwerine: North-South play transfers in this situation. |pg||
nt|sommer: ok, yes|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Not good here , but also a good 3@C by East. |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|roswolf: red card will be applied to any bid from now|pg||
nt|ady: decent slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: i don't know their style, but for me it is defintely not a min hand white|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this gets it off safely|pg||
nt|hedyg: fast lead for Fantoni!|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: 6@c could turn very lucky for e/w, with @s 3/2 and lucky fall of c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|uttam: @CJ dblton|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|uttam: its not easy to make|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think it is going down|pg||
nt|yuval10: especially considering the bidding|pg||
nt|yuval10: that indicated that S ( who's known to have 6 @h's ) is short in @c|pg||
nt|uttam: last 2b to go, anyway they needed swing|pg||
nt|uttam: with minus 15 imps|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|jlall: that would be a real max for me :) thats the great thing about bridge, there are many different winning styles|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would categorize it as medium. The shape isnt good. the suit isn't great. but it hasn't a strong outside feature which lifts it up.|pg||
nt|jlall: my impression of romanians is that they are very aggressive though so I am surprised by that evaluation|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: i dont see how this is a min hand, in any system:)|pg||
nt|jlall: is it possible they play 2D as weak multi and 2M as constructive?|pg||
nt|jlall: some people play that, in which case east is a min|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: at this table we have the old school:)|pg||
nt|sommer: this is one of the good 6's, you like to have a few of|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wolwerine: South would of course have doubled 2@C for take out|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if east had switched to a minor declarer mightget home|pg||
nt|mcphee: make on the squeeze|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: there is no squeeze|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: a push seems likely|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|sommer: well defended!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jjbrr:  i'd be content with this score as NS|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jlall: of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: nop, they dont play 2d weak M|pg||
nt|jlall: raluca do you know if their CCs are posted somewhere? For Romanian championships do you have to submit an electronic CC before hand?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sommer: +50 is a fine plaster on the wound:)|pg||

nt|sybarra: (cow flew by is expression used for not being "at the table")|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I apologise. I thought the contract was 4@s|pg||
nt|toobad: be lucky ..........|pg||
nt|lestergold: well after opps have missed two cold slams you dont want to be optimistic just sit tight|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: godness knos what 2@c meant at other table but it scored what it deserved|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: 6c here if no S lead|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a good 6@c tho|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: 6N or 61c by north cant be touched as the cards lie|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: A Hugh Kesley expression - it's chapter title in one of his books!  (thx spec,  I knew I didnt make it up)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: whoever bids 3N first seems the order of the day|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this is the normal spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  my auction would have 3@s from South and 3NT from North|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|mamos: coffee|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, North could have a single @c|pg||
nt|stewball: looks like east is inviting by relay|pg||
nt|lestergold: but sanity has returned to west|pg||
nt|sybarra: either the beer or the tea kicking in maybe|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||

pc|hT|nt|sybarra: we can get coffee and n/s will be disappointed with result |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: one problem with these hands is that if 3@C is forcing South can't really tell whether North has 6-7 useful hcp or a poorer hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: how do you win 46 imps in 2 bds?|pg||
nt|jlall: they must just be very sound then :)|pg||
nt|jlall: ah finally, an action hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: not really:))|pg||
nt|jlall: EW have a huge result in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: no, i dont have their CC online|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close to a missed @S-GAME|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: ok :(|pg||
nt|barbyh: 15 imps on bd 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i think we can safely congratulate team Laffineur on a very good win - well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: win each board by 4000 point difference|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have seen players make 4 @S on cards like these|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|Vugraphzyf: 2@D = 5 @H in a weak hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|hedyg: have never seen 4000, is that possible at all?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Dinner is waiting so Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|barbyh: thx Ralf|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlall: 6D and 6H both make, 6H being a bit better because you might make with 3-2 trumps if the CA is off (and you rightside it, or they don't lead a club)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would expect most table to end at 4@H only, but 6@H obviously is a very good score|pg||
nt|jlall: but very tough to bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a good guess, 5 @D is 3 down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West must lead the @D King, couldÂ´nt be wrong after Easts support|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Are the players still at the table...?|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks all for watching, sorry to say I have to leave now|pg||
nt|uttam: ty Bob|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: very normal contract here..guess a fast flat board|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jlall: i agree|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlall: jeremy do you like 2@H or would you jump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: coffee anyone?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 4 sp the limit on this hand, thanks all for watching|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjbrr:  i like to go low on this type of auction and bid 2@H only|pg||
nt|jlall: i confess id be tempted :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the void is very nice, but having no aces is bad|pg||
nt|jlall: assuming 4D shows strong diamonds, east still has a problem because he doesn't know which shortness west has...if it is short clubs he can basically claim slam, short spades and he ...|pg||
nt|jlall: has some issues...i expect him to move though|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  the dbl by S makes E unhappy, because AQxx of @S looks less exciting... but W gets very excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe with a 4@S cue hoping to get a club cue from partner, or maybe he will be less scientific hoping to not give away the lead|pg||
nt|jlall: still after the double if you're off cashing clubs probably south has them both so I would not be attempting trickery here :)|pg||
nt|jlall: and of course you could be off the first THREE clubs on a bad day, though that seems pessimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: come on Rosu, 4@S :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|smoller: Dont go away, last hand is a slam (maybe)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk5: Blackwood is a fine convention|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jlall: west admits to his club control|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  looks like theyre off to the races|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jlall: east will bid at least 5@D here|pg||
nt|uttam: push b|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: yes i once conceded such a score 7@HXX = IN ONE ROOM AND 7@SX Iin the other both making on a ruff and discard at trick 1 in each room|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: west concerned still by his lack of aces, doesn't like the void after 4@S, and has no @HK either|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  in my style i would cuebid 4@C first to show first or second round control; 5@C after 4@S would show first round control|pg||
nt|jlall: east concerned about bad trumps with the likely bad split...|pg||
nt|jlall: still might stop here|pg||
nt|jlall: i will boldly predict a pass from east :) maybe he shouldn't with the AK of trumps though|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Maybe N-S in the other room should adopt this new gadget|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jlall: the jack of trumps is so huge here|pg||
nt|uttam: one h ruff, then blk suit squee or even last @s is becoming good for h pitch|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jlall: so is the jack of diamodns to a lesser degree...maybe west should have done more with both of those|pg||
nt|jlall: what do you think jeremy?|pg||
nt|jlall: reasonable? or who should have bid more?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jjbrr:  i really want to assign the blame to west, but i really think they both made reasonable actions.|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i think its west also|pg||
nt|barbyh: its been a very interestng set|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jjbrr:  4@D is such a space-consuming bid|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzzn: arguing now:)|pg||
nt|uttam: north may duck it to south 9 for 2nd trump play|pg||
nt|pelu: will not help defense|pg||
nt|pelu: same squeeze after 1 @H-ruff|pg||
nt|uttam: but -- one @h ruff and run trumps play, cold as south is caught in black suit squee|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jlall: haha|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jjbrr:  but in fairness his hand isn't really spectacular, so it's hard to assign fault.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jlall: aruging...AFTER the CA lead :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the thing is, once youre in 5, 6 is much better, because if the CA is off 5 might well go down|pg||
nt|jlall: and if it's on, 6 will make|pg||
nt|jlall: so getting to 5 is kind of a disaster|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jlall: and also south bid of course making the ace very likely to be on|pg||
nt|pelu: but GIB will prob tell us, that 5@D = down 1 on @D-lead (not @Sk) - impossible :):)|pg||

nt|roswolf: for their perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes. Finally, our gratitude to the FFB (Claude Dadoun) for ensuring that this world class event ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: is brought to BBO.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jlall: i think west can kind of expect east to have the aces and kings to drive past game, what else could he have?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jlall: the more i think about it, the more i will assign west the blame for not bidding it at the end over 5D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh i may have spoke too soon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well :) there's quite a bit on this one|pg||
nt|toobad: this should be fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: if theirm partnership style allows south to double with his pile of mgrabage then north should not float it|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I predict the p[layers will be consulting the back of the 2@d bidding card if this makes|pg||

mb|1D|nt|iq007:  inspired double for Popescu to reach 4@h on the previous board|pg||

nt|yuval10: last hand now - thanks all|pg||
nt|uttam: ty all ,last  now|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|roswolf: great slam here i dont think|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm 9@s 2nd entry to N |pg||

nt|pelu: se u to morrow - 09.00 (local time)|pg||
nt|uttam: its property of N/S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jlall: south will catch a raise of spades and just punt out game|pg||
nt|smoller: Surely void showing|pg||
nt|sommer: on their way now|pg||
nt|sommer: can it make with @C's 5-2?|pg||
nt|wolwerine: South has many losers, maybe he just bids 4@H|pg||
nt|smoller: No, a passed hand in North and wasted poins in diamonds|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, a quiet 4@H seems right|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but for sure 6 is tempting!|pg||
nt|wolwerine: But what about East? Is he thinking about 4 NT?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: hard to find the @H lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or not!|pg||
nt|jlall: i find norths pass strange, do you disagree?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  The bad luck is very different|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: A@S|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I admit I woul bid 2@S after the dbl|pg||
nt|jlall: those jacks are pretty bad but its still 7 points, 3 spades, a ruffing value, white/red...|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s will be the final contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sommer: N would have opened with @Dvoid and those 3 top cards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: so Bilde-Hansen had a chance to board 14: winning 6@C + no X of 5@S = 26 IMP :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jlall: hah, even the delayed raise does it...I think east pushed them there though|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be automatic|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  well. they've made the last guess, which has some merit in competitive auctions.|pg||
nt|jlall: I am not sure why east bid 4@D either|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: yes, and i also think that supp part in @s is holy:)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  and in this case does quite well.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: if you dont play the A@S you never know what is going on|pg||

nt|jlall: partner to have 2 spades and some values, likelyy in clubs given the auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wolwerine: Actually North did open in the orther room|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  note the other table did quite well with the NS cards also; not sure why EW were so timid. Is 5m very expensive insurance?|pg||
nt|uttam: ty all ,hope everyone here had a  nice time|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: Quantin played A@S after J@C ducked|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iq007:  What are your choices here? K lead or small @c?|pg||
nt|iq007:  If the K is lead you are subject to a bath coup (declearer will play small to remain in control)|pg||
nt|iq007:  small-big is 2-0 until now :)|pg||
nt|iq007:  it depends also on what signals have you discussed with your partner, I prefer to give attitude on Q lead and count on K lead|pg||
nt|zensuni: 2@c by Chelu doesn't make @c lead too appealing though|pg||
nt|rocketer: K@C|pg||
nt|iq007:  So from KQ I can lead both K or Q, Q from something like KQx and K from strong holdings which asks unblock, then count|pg||
nt|uttam: good night from India|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|zensuni: K definetely looks better if @C lead, or rusinow Q|pg||
