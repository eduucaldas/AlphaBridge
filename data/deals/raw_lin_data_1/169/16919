mb|p|nt|delberto:  1c strong or a weak NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|delberto:  an intersting decison now|pg||
mb|d|nt|greerm: strong @C has many advantages but in this type of auction, very difficult for South now|pg||
mb|p|nt|delberto:  is 4C enough and might a potential 4-4 heart fit be lost|pg||
nt|delberto:  that's why he's chosen to double|pg||
nt|greerm: anyone vote for 3NT by HAnlon?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|delberto:  now the main danger is that Hanlon passes with a club fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: might try 4@S now|pg||
nt|delberto:  sorry...was 1C natural?|pg||
nt|delberto:  it must have been|pg||
nt|greerm: from Carroll viewpoint, anything could be on|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|an|a|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|greerm: classic position here when either red suit finesse is enough for 12 tricks|pg||

nt|delberto:  ok|pg||
nt|delberto:  and 3H ?|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S was 0-4, then really east has a pretty good hand, so surely he should co-operate a bit more over 3@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|delberto:  so 2H is pre-emptive after the XX|pg||
mb|p|nt|delberto:  and 2S forcing|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|greerm: 3NT a very good score for e/w in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|delberto:  it seems doomed on a heart to the ace and a heart return|pg||
pc|h5|nt|delberto:  so Rex has done very well to avoid 3NT |pg||
nt|greerm: but 4@S better maybe|pg||
nt|delberto:  and 4S on the 5-2 fit is a very good  spot here|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|greerm: very difficult i agree|pg||
nt|delberto:  there might be something to be said for cashing the Ace of diamonds|pg||

nt|delberto:  and 4h is just one down|pg||
nt|athene: is 1@S a forcing notrump?|pg||
nt|greerm: yes i think so|pg||
nt|athene: seems odd not to just raise hearts, whatever 1@S means|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|greerm: maybe their 2@H stronger although the singleton @C ..|pg||
nt|delberto:  I think SOuth might beid 2NT now|pg||
nt|greerm: South might risk 3N now|pg||
nt|athene: close between 2n and 3n|pg||
nt|athene: you would prefer a bigger club to be sure they were running|pg||
mb|2S|nt|delberto:  or maybe double if he wants to bring spades  into the game|pg||
nt|athene: and even if you do have six clubs to run that is only 8 tricks in time on a heart lead|pg||
nt|delberto:  well 2S impplies a club fit of sorts...because ther was no 1S overcall initially|pg||
nt|athene: so i think 2nt was enough|pg||
nt|greerm: the advantage of 3NT on these auctions is that east west may downgrade their hands|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@S has to be a club raise of some sort|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|delberto:  it looks as if EW have missed out on the hearts|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|greerm: he is hoping for 6@C 1A 1K and  something|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: the amusing disaster from north's point of view would be if his partner had 10987 and they broke 3-0, so they are blocked|pg||

nt|delberto:  unbearably amusing !|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|sA|mc|9|nt|delberto:  worth seeeing if the queen of spades is covered|pg||
nt|greerm: South will certainlt now be thinking if any safe overtricks are availabl|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that since the defenders only have two clubs between them, a 3-0 break would be very unlucky indeed|pg||

nt|greerm: it's good someone awake|pg||
mb|2H|an|a|mb|p|nt|athene: but assuming your partner has something good in a suit just because you have a singleton is a bad idea|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: yes, but they are tricks 3-15|pg||

nt|delberto:  I assume that there are  some artificial bids here|pg||
nt|delberto:  3H ?|pg||
nt|greerm: no alert though|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2@H is a spade raise|pg||
nt|delberto:  it  is|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H was 10+ @S raise i'm told|pg||
nt|delberto:  and 3H = shortage ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: 3@H was < 14, s@H splinter|pg||
nt|delberto:  and then Hanlon showed great restraint !|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: 2@H - exactly 3 spades either invi, gf|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|hA|nt|athene: a good example of how bad it is for all the defensive strength to be concentrated in one hand|pg||

mc|9|nt|athene: ok, i don't believe that|pg||
nt|greerm: well east had shown a lot of high cards|pg||
nt|athene: that was just weird|pg||
nt|athene: he was trying to pin the @CJ and @C10 simultaneously?|pg||
nt|athene: the only way leading the @CQ could be legit is if you put west with @CJ10 and @SK and you want to transfer the menace|pg||
nt|athene: and i don't believe any of it|pg||
nt|greerm: and the "obvious" way was to play him for all the rest|pg||
nt|james_h: did that happen?|pg||
nt|athene: my contention is, no :)|pg||
nt|greerm: vugraph operator is silent|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: it did happen|pg||
nt|greerm: but the ruff of @D king is a tad extravagant, so we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that perhaps declarer didn't believe west could have all those points and not say something during the auction, or at least wriggle uncomfortably|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe he was going for the transfer-the-menace line|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he thought that with the hand he actually had, greenwood would surely have bid 2@D, or 1NT, or doubled|pg||
nt|athene: over 1@H|pg||
nt|james_h: menace transfer is reasonable|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well, it was our fault for all saying he couldn't go wrong, i suppose|pg||
nt|james_h: south read a chapter too much in the sqz book|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: right, all over thanks all|pg||
