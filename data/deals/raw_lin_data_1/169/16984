nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 to start out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry having trouble finding the right boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Sorry about that, have the right boards now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: The profile for our excellent viewgraph operator gives Denis Dobrin from Russia|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: A quiet pass by E, would have a reasonable 1NT rebid after opening 1 of a minor.  Meanwhile, choice of openings perhaps for S, either @S or NT.  Likely @S with a small side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: doubleton.  Some like to have three of the other major to open 1NT with a five-card major; the thinking is that they can still land in the better fit if pd has five of the other ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: major.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also conceivable some E could 1@D and rebid 2@C over 1@S but that seems a bit much.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: contract is |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is nasty--NS likely to make nine tricks on a spade lead--4@S a phantom |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have been led up the garden path again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry had to get a mouse will get contract in a min|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sounds like the contract may be 3@S - obv not on a 3@S opening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: think it is|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S will fail by one or two and EW will post the plus on this 20-20 hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: shame I've never been to russia!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry have lost the bidding though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its OK final contract 2@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
nt|garnetts: straight in and North probably should double --minimum and not wanting to bid 5@H |pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close run thing though...|pg||
nt|garnetts: when a spade is led it will pay south to duck |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: director has been called|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 2@D showed 5@S and 4@H according to the system|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcwla: In the famous words of Barry Crane, "God dealt you A-K so you wouldn't have a lead problem."|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here no other choice.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wilkinsona: ...but 6 spades may be tricky|pg||
nt|idc: we'll try to get you names as we can - starts of matches are often rushed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..it looks to have handling probs, but the diamond ace is right..|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psridhar: when they bid slam on long suits it is often a 'tempo' game, so u make attacking leads|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is a no play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: the contract is really 6C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not surprised-W suggested 6C enroute to 6N ...and E imagined his pd has a 5 bagger-lack of unnderstdg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, hoped the original @C wasn't short, alas it was|pg||
nt|garnetts: You might make 4@H double dummy --more likely going at least one off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: ..and certainly dont want to ship any defensive tricks here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: mast play 2NT as 4 card support...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wilkinsona: well, I certainly dont like the double|pg||
nt|idc: It'll mean your commentators will be impartial - since we don't know which direction the countries are sitting!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wilkinsona: that can only help declarer..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona: and this lead also...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great cost to either side just no gain here|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, a big decision for poor South to have to take this early in the morning|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h6|nt|idc: I can barely put my slippers on the right way round, leading to a doubled slam way beyond me|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and that it shipped it seems|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: This is an easy make now after south's giveaway|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wilkinsona: since i dont know the names, i can criticize the players freely for once..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess Scotland are E-W, took me ages to work that out|pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: I suspect many would overcall 2@c on west non-vul but few would vul|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jcwla: 1@H a @S bid and the double to show @H's - presumably higher level choices available to one or both sides.|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Ian Crorie|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: and this contract looks in danger too |pg||
nt|dagold: This looks close but probably 1 down|pg||
nt|dagold: due to the bad red suit breaks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: 5@c is not a hopeless contract, needs defense to shift to @h before winning @d ace|pg||
nt|idc: I think 2@c is natural but alerted since game forcing|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS heading overboard...|pg||
nt|idc: and 4@d a shortage showing splinter of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland compete to 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|idc: North does have some extras after 4@h, and at least they have managed to stop below six|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which has a chance|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  south trying to signal for a heart: declarer has to play him for stiff ace|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west best to play ace and another trump it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: does not want to concede a ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is that not an assumed name you are using?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like the first four tricks in the round suits and two @S to follow in time - but let's see.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: if west had taken the ace of spade a trump promotion would have led to an axtra undertrick |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|garnetts: j@H sorts this |pg||
nt|dagold: even down 2 I think as declarer will lose 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: On a heart switch that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: east asking lots of questions about the methods|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: but they found the defense and beat it, so the leaders get ahead further|pg||
nt|idc: normally you'd say a 6-0 @c split was awful, but here it is a lot better than 5-1, when they might suffer a ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: enough undertricks as it is...|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: tricky for south though|pg||
nt|garnetts: agreed|pg||
nt|idc: You can get other info from the event site at:  http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Connection problems here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona: yes I suppose its asking a lot to read the stiif ace|pg||
nt|dagold: slam surprisingly reasonable too with only 29 and 1-5 card suit. No waistage I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Sri Lanka have just tossed a wicket to Canada by contriving a run out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  easy for us :)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks, Denis|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do we like 3@C?  |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Similar trump suit to the previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: it also breaks 3-3 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont really see he has a choice, I am not waiting for a heart lead vs 1NT|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: with both major suit hooks wrong...|pg||
nt|idc: a good slam this time but both major Kings wrong|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really a great 4@S --so they got their reward|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: Do you agree with pass ?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no, but seems to work this time|pg||
nt|dagold: A little suprised as Noramn is usually very sharp in these type of situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this will end the auction|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that 2 heart bid ... well north is between bids, a hand often seen|pg||
nt|garnetts: my thoughts entirely |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I like to raise partner - keeps them sweet|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: just making|pg||
nt|psridhar: all cards lying badly for declarer|pg||
nt|dagold: not saying double was clear by any means but it is his style|pg||
nt|idc: An example of the Welsh pair's system - 1NT in 3rd seat 15-17, 12-14 otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this may be a good slam.... to stay out of|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, cruel if N-S bid it given the way the morning has started, so I'm rooting for them to stop in 5@s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: double game swing board 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 2@H should carry preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: With a spade & club to lose, declarer may well take two heart finesses and go down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: personally i dont think it is obvious for N to seek 4H. one alternative would be 1N-3N. a compromise would be to bid 4S if S shows spades, and bid 3N otherwise|pg||
nt|idc: A club lead from West may have helped South avoid a loser in that suit, so this @d instead is better for the defence|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure...i think S can organize the play to put the defense in a bad spot|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, West may have problems finding a safe lead later|pg||
nt|chilloncan: exactly|pg||
nt|idc: say declarer wins in hand, @d to dummy & takes a @h finesse - tough for West|pg||
nt|chilloncan: normal play is to let the D ride around and then force out spade ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are several options both early and late but i think S should eventually prevail|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, if the club finesse wins later on, he'll be looking to set up a pitch for the 3rd club, so avoiding a loser there|pg||
nt|idc: He doesn't know that the @c finesse won't win of course|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: but @s break shd help|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In spite of slamy suggestions from a spec, WBU settle for game|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT for the black suits here - would not be everyone's choice but reasonable and has N shown this @D holding? |pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h was going to make|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|idc: that will do also!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well may be some points back to WBU here, then|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark:  Indeed it should - my partners igore my signals also|pg||
pc|d4|nt|spil: probably drifting 1 off|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dagold: so this is a good save |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am quite suprised Norman let that go--he wouldn't at money bridge.  4@S is a daft bid ---partner can double again then bid it |pg||
nt|dagold: would have been 800 if doubled|pg||
pc|sK|nt|spil: perhaps 2...but 3@C was likely to make so no disaster|pg||
nt|idc: not a bad line for declarer, but it had the side effect of leavign West an easy exit in @d|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|idc: Apropos of nothing, I noticed an advert for Ryanair in yesterday's newspaper which I liked|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am suprised that he dropped the Q@H offside on board 1--admtitedly the lead was not best|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  something wrong with flags or names here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  Goodman -Thomas are Wales not WBU and defintely not Irish|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|cuttysark:  Still having connection problems - this looks a very tricky gamw|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: WBU taking a lead with a swing on 18|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: Visit Ireland: the Home of Cricket|pg||
nt|dagold: I have sympathy with 4@s. If partner has 5 trumps then you probably want to be in it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|idc: and now he has an exit in @s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dagold: that is why I like 1@s to show 5|pg||
nt|idc: can't really blame declarer, his line was normal enough, even if a different one would have succeeded|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there was certainly a bewildering array of options|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dagold: and double with 4|pg||
nt|idc: Only a few scores in round the matches but Scotland 7 up v Ireland, England 4 up v WBU|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Roland hi specs|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i think the play could get tricky in 4S if N starts off with two rounds of clubs, but W can always prevail if he reads the layout|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psridhar: we saw E open 2D on Bd 4 with much less, so it was easy guessing:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: They went off in 4@C on baord 3 for a swing to england--but it looks laydown to me |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: everything wrong for NS |pg||
nt|dagold: 5 imps to england on board 3. Denning did overcall 2@c but didn't take the heart hook and went down in 4@c|pg||
nt|idc: hhmm, yes, SOuth having the @s9 creates some worries|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wilkinsona: the score shows board 3 as flat but..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we think they were -1 in this room..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: board 3 was -1 in closed room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: hand plays well for EW though|pg||
nt|idc: As the other room play the boards we have already seen, the socres will come in|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: slam almost there the opening put it off their thoughts|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  This set back to all square when WBU tried 4@S on board 20|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normal lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a quick two off  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: quick?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: without that opening EW may well have overshot to slam and gone down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: my thoughts also|pg||
nt|psridhar: With E undervaluing his @s queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Julian, it seems that it is the player names that are wrong - the right names for Irelad/WBU are in the Open room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Operator probably has not had time to set up here|pg||
nt|idc: 1 & 2 flat, 3 IMPs to N.I. on Bd 3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is dangerous but i like 3H better than 2H, esp if NS are playing support doubles. 3H puts the pressure on and increases chances of scoring a black queen (or two)) on defense|pg||
mb|3C|nt|wilkinsona: thanks, Denise, so further 10 or so to Scotland|pg||
nt|garnetts: assuming that £@C is to play here--would you bid it David?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzb: Names correct here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I see Ireland v WBU on the scoreboard|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Some relief for declarer - an easy game at last|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In that case you connected to the wrong broadcast|pg||
nt|idc: Oh good, another agressive bidder to commentate with, a pleasant change!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wilkinsona: yes and I suspect there was a board misscored first half so may be al square over all|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: 7-2-2-2 is a bad shape (7-3-2-1 or other better) which might stay my hand going to stop card|pg||
nt|idc: but that point about the Qx Qx holdings being *more* likely to win tricks if you preempt is a good one|pg||
mb|4C|nt|wilkinsona: tight game...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: unless 2N forcing, hard to see  whe Norths extra value is|pg||
nt|chilloncan: now with a clear run, NS likely on way to cold slam. E would perhaops been better off passing if he was not going to bid 3H|pg||
nt|idc: Here, the 2@h overcall has left N-S a lot of room (and convenient cue bids) to investigate|pg||
nt|idc: Is 6@d better?  since 2 clubs in South could go on spades if they split|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: on the other hand Scotland off in OR on 2 games to be scored|pg||
nt|dagold: sorry David popped off|pg||
nt|dagold: what was his hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: the same as it still is|pg||
nt|garnetts: its OK I will just get a coffee shortly |pg||
nt|dagold: it is missing 3-cards|pg||

nt|garnetts: 6-4-2-1|pg||
nt|dburn: @cQ, @s7 and @c2|pg||
nt|dagold: I would if I could yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: With nine top tricks outside @D's if @C's come home - not sure I love the 2NT rebid even if "right" on strength.|pg||
nt|idc: mostly not i guess - North short of an entry for that plan|pg||
nt|idc: assuming a heart lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: well nothing is ever quick these days is it |pg||
nt|dagold: I play 2N as a puppet to 3@c (invite in NTs via 2@c which is a puppet to 2@d)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: if that @s 8 were the 9, some partial elimination may hv helped, as it is N can now insert the jack on @s play and prevent any end play on his pd|pg||
nt|garnetts: might get a trump promotion now |pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: for three off |pg||
nt|garnetts: well done by North |pg||

pc|c6|nt|garnetts: Its an odd game the longer you think the less likely you are to get it right |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|idc: the sequence is game forcing for them, after 1@c - 2@c|pg||
nt|idc: Not easy for East but has to be a @s to beat it now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes|pg||
nt|idc: he may be tempted by a @h, hoping West has a little more in the suit|pg||

nt|idc: A low scoring match so far, 4-3 to Wales after 5 comparisons in|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: I see Murdoch/Spears also got to the bad 6@h on Bd 4, so a flat board in one down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it appears that the usual connection prob have scuppered the comparisons|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S playing any system is obligatory |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland also went down in 6 hearts on 4, a contract off on the diamond hook|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|dburn: still, no one is going to bid a sla,|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, even playing 4-card heart as they do|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: 1 diamond must be hearts|pg||
nt|idc: so very tight at the top|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Aggressive opening bids sometimes backfire when partner has a fair hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@s was hasty too. I play it as a bit weaker than that. Cuebidding then 4@s to show a real hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: transfer responces, it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: Next year they should hold it in North Korea bound to be better internet :) |pg||
nt|jcwla: W declining to show @D's right away without extras, now 3NT showing the @D values if not the length.  A quiet pass by E but recognizing the lack of a great fit.|pg||
nt|idc: In the other matches Scotland 1 up v Ireland,  WBU 6 up v England|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure about that 4S call. couldnt E have been angling for 3N? admittedly after the double W doesnt want to bid 3N, but he could bid 3H or else pass, whichever sequence would ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: show heart concentration|pg||

nt|garnetts: That seems a mighty odd lead holding AQ stiff in hearts --but nothing looks great |pg||

nt|psridhar: running the @c jack works when W has KQX|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cashing A is 1 loser also|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ace works when E has stiff K / Q-other combos , both work / or dont|pg||
nt|dagold: for me 4@s is 6 spades and a semi punt typically|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  might North redbl to secure a diamond lead? |pg||
nt|garnetts: yes--a lazy bid |pg||
nt|idc: That was a bit cumbersome, so there are conventions around these days where East can make enquiries about the West hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: still, slam might not make if East-West do not give away too much in the bidding|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|idc: no solution wll work 100% of the time mind you|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: KQX is 2 combos, k/q stiff also 2 combos..|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: nice wd|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: not much to choose from|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

nt|lestergold: altho may go off evenc without heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  and very possible if played by West, as N really cant hope to get his club suit going|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: Bd 16 is a potential 12 imp gain for Wei, so the gap may be actually 40 imps approx now -with 5 bds to go, seems tough for yeh|pg||
nt|garnetts: If you cannot open 2@D--anyone for 3@D?  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: I'd open 5@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like NS can make 4@H |pg||
nt|dagold: 4@s would be a good save over 4@h here|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@s just 1 down|pg||
nt|dagold: doubt 4@h will be bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E has gone right in trumps, suggesting that NS do not lead low from three small. without such a NS lead agreement, E could not confidently place club queen in S hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|idc: South has difficult bid over a dbl by North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS plenty of tricks in hearts here|pg||
nt|garnetts: North will have to bid it|pg||
nt|dagold: would be surprised|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very well for declarer here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this will go to 4 spades|pg||
nt|spil: not the most exciting set of boards for the last match of the day|pg||
nt|dagold: suspect EW will steal it in 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: the @s9 is actually a stop with this spade layout, but not obvious to him|pg||
nt|garnetts: Game on a finesse --not so bad--not making either |pg||
nt|dagold: dble-p-3h-3s-p-p|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: not unreasonable to pass, just a bit scary|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NS do well in spades, EW make NT so swing here possible|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cuttysark:  Or possibly 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Norman will compete with 3@S over £@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H|pg||
nt|idc: Scores in other matches going well for Wales hopes so far:|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: will bid 4 hearts now, nearly worth 3 hearts earlier|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland 14 up v Ireland, WBU 24 up v England|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: swingy bd alright|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of times now N has not pushed the level early in the auction - either matter of system or style.|pg||
nt|dagold: this some kind of scramble I guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT to show garbage |pg||
nt|dagold: I don't like that as he only has 1 place to play|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is about to go D1|pg||
nt|psridhar: now was 4@s making?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  2@C has several meanings, and 2N showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psridhar: couple of guesses involved in 4@s..|pg||
nt|psridhar: but favoourite to make -once the @h ace is seen with W, the opener shd hv @c ace, so 4@s rates to make|pg||
nt|dagold: partner has to have 4 hearts|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: hence we hv to assess this 5@d as a good save by the leaders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: accurate defense required to secure 500 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Sudden change of personality by south|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I had though the auction over|pg||
nt|dagold: for me this sequence shows a good 3@h bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark:  Bit of a lunge by East|pg||
nt|dagold: but perhaps it was lebensohl for them|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has shown values with the doubel so leaves it to partner |pg||
nt|dagold: it really shouldn't be leb here|pg||
nt|dagold: pass of 2@s showed a bad hand already|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: He will feel good after this --likely gain |pg||
pc|hA|nt|idc: so both the Welsh team's rivals are losing, though early days yet|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...no real reason..|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: the righ gets richer here, perhaps closing out the match, a looong one|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  A frozen moment in time|pg||
nt|garnetts: a weak two with two aces --a hanging offence |pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: if so somewhat optomistic|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@s a make or 4@c|pg||

mb|2C|nt|idc: Murdoch got @c suit wrong on Bd 6, so -3 in 3NT instead of making, more IMPs to WBU|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Padman thanks for your great commentary|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I dont go along with norths bid Im afraid, with a double fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with you Tony--cramp them for space--get them at the five level |pg||
nt|dagold: one with a heart underlead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks like a maximum|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if declarer guesses trumps he can make with a throw in on N|pg||
nt|psridhar: Thanks Gary , you have been very educative too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a great pleasure being with you and thanks all our great spectators for your feedback |pg||
nt|psridhar: first he shd ruff a club -as a matter of technique, here it is essential too|pg||
nt|psridhar: after @c ruff, run @h jack, @h to king, @s to king, run trumps for the throw in = is the double dummy line, can it work ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6 @h tricks + 2 @s tricks +1 @c =9 and the throw in for 10th =yes double dummy line works|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 @cs 2 @hs 2 @ds and 2@s doesnt add to 9|pg||
nt|idc: 5-card suit, good intermediates|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: amazing, wd|pg||
pc|d8|nt|idc: That was 5-card Stayman, so 2@h was continuing the search for a fit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: more likely route to NT partial would be 1N all pass|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: so you expect -1 then :)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: NV|pg||

nt|chilloncan: the thing is, you are so barren outside of hearts that even if you find a heart fit you probably do not have game|pg||

pc|d6|nt|garnetts: does anyone know where the scores can be seen?  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|chilloncan: you have 9 LTC and opener will have 6-7, hence IF you have a fit you still dont rate tpo have a game|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  North will be in deep trouble, and declarer can guess the spades, Mike|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: he has done|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: the problem in runnning the @h jack is N made a TAKE-OUT double of 1@h|pg||
nt|dagold: link through the ebu website|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: so, declarer's misguess is reasonable|pg||
nt|spil: 3@H going 1 off and NS making 3@D exactly so not much in it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and you might be down at the 3 level, if you invite and W passes|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i wouldnt call it a "good stop" since both major games rate to make. they are almost surely worried they will LOSE imps|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h3|nt|psridhar: that @s queen shift has created a major tenace for Declarer|pg||

nt|chilloncan: they will gain IMPs on 6, but not because they played a partial:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland also made the close game on 24|pg||

nt|idc: Thanks Daniel, a good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: bad heart break for NS here|pg||
nt|idc: I think N-S play 1M - 2M as a sound, full value raise to two (maybe 7-9 or so), hence the alert last hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  Deep Finesse, a double dummy analyst, would assume a @d lead|pg||

nt|spil: yes but perhaps unlikely to get there|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: actually i often wonder why people so often do not lead their partner's suit especially whene a heart lead here was more or less guaranteed to give a trick|pg||

mb|4H|nt|wilkinsona: Walker avoids a give away double|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: you were right David|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N has a problem due to the diamond blocakge. Declarer may need to run the T on the first round|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: bye for now |pg||
nt|henryb:  why? couldn't partner have the @hQ instead of the @sK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: could do but my partners never do they alwayswin these post moprtems when i dont lead their suit|pg||
nt|idc: A strong club pair are limited to about 15 when they open 1@d, so can freely distinguish between 14/15 maximums and bad 11-13 hands|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idc: Declarer can still pick up the trumps, and I'm not sure leading @d would help the defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  and rightly so|pg||
nt|chilloncan: confess that at these colours i would surely open 1S as E in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|idc: The hands are both pretty flat and don't mesh tpogether very well, so plenty of potential losers in 4@h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well one of them has just vanished|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: East allowed to play 2 hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: if declarer plays the Q@d the suit is blocked if Espen takes the first one|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 3@h was unwarranted in my opinion|pg||
nt|psridhar: Liu made a take out X, his pd passed 2@s he had no reason to overrule that|pg||
nt|idc: on a bad day you could lose 3@d, a @c and a @s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E had tough lead. can make a case for eevery suit. perhaps when that is so, trump is best idea|pg||
nt|idc: now draw trumps and ... perhaps try to set up a @c for a @d pitch|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well done|pg||
nt|idc: Sensible - they have about 30 mins for 4 boards, not terrible but worth getting on with it|pg||
nt|dagold: good result for Wales|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually on that hand the @d lead was especially marked because south also held likely double stop in clubs sp he kn ew declarer was likely tobe under pressure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|spil: perhaps a trump lead might have rendered the play a little more tricky (in 4) |pg||
nt|lestergold: in close no trump contracts moral is to let declarr do his own work lead safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: may be an overtrick imp to Wei|pg||

nt|dagold: NS can make about 3@s I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark:  Sorry Tony, I keep forgetting there is more than one 'A' in the Wilkinson family|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  -1 was the normal result|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: 1NT shows 5+ cards in @s|pg||
nt|dagold: a spade partial is likely|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psridhar: Ew have a big @d fit, here W may well balance if given a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3@d is d1|pg||
nt|garnetts: obvious 4@S --likely 11 tricks |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|idc: a 1@s response is fewer spades, kind of like a normal focring NT hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wilkinsona: this looks a well judged contact by NS|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, though playing normal methods I'd expect 1@h - 1@s - 2@s  - that North hand is fine to raise with|pg||
nt|dagold: this should make fairly comfortably|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cuttysark:  Must be tempting for West to move on|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: well, I hate to say it, but that North hand looks like a stong NT to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: overboard, can make if he guesses trumps-very tough, double dummy only|pg||
nt|lestergold: with this right sided i dont think it can fail as north is never in to lead a club thru|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: wait a minute it can|pg||
nt|idc: I used to play with a much older player, though still a very good one, you usually said..|pg||
nt|idc: when his partner led a trump, "do you have a licence to do that partner?"|pg||
nt|idc: You quickly learned only to do it when right (i like to pretend I did at least)|pg||
nt|idc: West doubling to suggest a lead of dummy's first bif suit|pg||
nt|idc: He's half right - it's a good lead for the defence but sadly 3NT will make anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: ..so relieved to here 4 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry cant discard two losers on one long @d|pg||
nt|idc: because declarer is likely to be taking a @c finesse into the danger East hand, he won't want to rise with @sA at trick one|pg||
pc|s8|nt|idc: I wondered if West might consider a switch to a low @h at trick 2, but North's bidding should incline him to an honour|pg||
nt|idc: since North will be short in majors|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: altho isnt soth endplayable?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Like the q@H now and then the ace of trumps --that should ensure enough tricks|pg||
nt|idc: Scary hand for Gary Jones to play, but no realistic alternative to @c finesse I think|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|spil: well if W goes slamming the @H is winning (Hurray) ... but the trumps are disappointing (:()|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psridhar: we can see all cards-win ace, king and jack of @h =11 tricks, but that is double dummy. more normal is to take the failing @h finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  South about to be disappointed when his ace is ruffed|pg||

nt|spil: so Goldilocks contract...not too much...not too little...just right|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|psridhar: trciky play but ace and 10 of @s hiding the queen has small chance of success, but this shd not win |pg||

mb|2S|nt|wilkinsona: surprised south didnt bid 4 spades... will it work?|pg||

nt|dagold: my double has the same meaing whatever I open which is easy on the memory!|pg||
nt|henryb:  slow going at the other table|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S ought to have been thinking that if W had heart queen 3N could easily fail, and if H queen is with E then that increases size of penalty |pg||
mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|chilloncan: 3HX goes for more than the game, and without any guesses:)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|5D|nt|wilkinsona: so thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@C can make --but very agressive |pg||
nt|dagold: probably the same auction here|pg||
nt|idc: And when South didn't pass the dbl at those colours, perhaps North could have read him for unblanced hand, and corrected to safer 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: last hand for now, but play in this close match continues after a short break|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: good idea but i prefer 4C, keeping slam in the picture|pg||

mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: nobody bidding clubs yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I do not like 2@H--prefer 3@C by a lot |pg||
nt|dagold: same result likely |pg||
mb|p|nt|spil: seems to have made the wrong response if asking in @C ... but moving sharply along :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@C a cuebid for @H's - not a new place for us to play after N has opened 2@C and shown primary @H's.|pg||
nt|dburn: fortunately for the defenders, South's diamonds are better than his clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks to our operator|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: sorry board 16 too, Im a bit early|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, consevative 2 spade bid works for WBU|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems you can start with a double|pg||
nt|garnetts: if North leads a heart this will not make |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  But then you might lose a major suit  fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like double either strikes me that 3@C and then 4@H if thats what I need to bid get this hand over |pg||
nt|spil: absolutely...3@S may be natural but the 4 level should be a cue|pg||
nt|dagold: Wales need to get this right|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, rather random|pg||
nt|chilloncan: at these colours there is much to be said for a 4D overcall instead of 3D. that totally obliterates their bidding space and they may easily miss a slam|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: the inevitable|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  how about @SK lead :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it gets the hand over|pg||
nt|garnetts: that works too and so does a club |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  So 6 cards beat it and 7 let it make |pg||
nt|garnetts: anything but a Johannisburg sparkler |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|psridhar: weak NT opg is popular inn this part of the world|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 suits to beat it, one to let it make|pg||
nt|garnetts: might not get the clubs right |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Oh well, opportunity knocked|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: 3N no problem but 4@s may not be so easy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: Byrne must have been warned here that the support wasonly 3 cards|pg||
nt|idc: should be -3 though, so no big gain for Irish|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: leads wrong major a chance|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, it is a barrage of sorts, but i think 4D is the pressure call|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|idc: This reminds me of Board 5 - slam is a good contract, cards lie badly, and WBU avoid it|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as confession time, I am afraid I would have found the 3 spade  bid Sime did in the or|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: interesting hedre that south had a choice of leading frm either unbid suit and here the lead from the K may not have been optimal|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|psridhar: will take @C finesse and go 2 off|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and this hand looks like being a big result for WBU|pg||
nt|idc: Given East found an agressive raise to 5 level (which I like) maybe West worried that he go too high after a 4@d preempt by him|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: lead from unsupported homoyrs in general from K i think is the riskiest of all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: that was a good trade her a @d loser being riffed from the long truimp holding|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|sA|nt|psridhar: N wd hv been squeezed in blacks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but with Scotland off in 3N why worry?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: maybe, but 5D is the normal level to raise a preempt to. it takes out 4N and leaves 5 lvel open to opps, so it is the perfect plateau|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|h3|pg||

pc|hA|pc|c2|nt|drewsky: cashing the AK @D cost the defense 2 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Last hand now...|pg||
nt|spil: On board 24 N Ireland managed to bid and make 7@D...only needed 3-3 trump fit and the opposition forgetting to cash A@S|pg||
nt|dagold: here England let through 4@s|pg||
nt|dagold: so a chance for a big swing to Wales|pg||
nt|henryb:  that was not a Greek gift. It had no poison attached|pg||
nt|lestergold: does this make on  best defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  No hidden warriors in the belly of the horse|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry henry it was a scottish gift|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland lead v Ireland only 5 now, but WBU 39 ahead of England|pg||
mb|1D|nt|spil: *trump break|pg||
nt|dagold: on a club lead, south tried to give north a promotion rather than playing for his own ruff in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: probably a flat board anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now I see NO merir in this VUL opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: merit|pg||
nt|psridhar: bidding here doesnt seem consistent with cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: West  got a bit carried away next door |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Last board, so looks like a good win for WBU|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: A good comeback from WBU after they were 24-0 down early in the set|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a bid of interest from south|pg||
nt|idc: this is only approaching the half-way point of course, 2nd half begins in 30 mins|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  not sure i like east's double - more than half his points in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also like a bid here like 1NT  to get things stirred up--been known to try 2@H too |pg||
nt|henryb:  would you respond to 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: That's when it's time to crawl back in bed and pull the covers up - or if you're Ireland go straight to Monte Carlo.|pg||
nt|dburn: that won't happen on this bidding - if North leads a club, of course|pg||
nt|dagold: the 3@d bid is likely to make the defence easy if Goodman leads a club|pg||
nt|chilloncan: great result for wales vs endgland|pg||
nt|chilloncan: england LOL|pg||
nt|chilloncan: freudian slip?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wilkinsona: If this is a single suited major, trouble on its way..|pg||
nt|idc: IMHO, the 2@d bid shows 2 things:|pg||
nt|idc: spades and another suit|pg||
nt|idc: and that South has forgotten they aren't playing matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if they can get to 3 clubs, not so bad..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the vulnerability is favourable but I still don't like the overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, this is the last board here.  Big thanks to Denis, to BBO's great and tireless Roland Wald, and to Stephen Peterkin and Liz McGowan.|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: So thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double stirred thing up too it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: dbl is a poor bid might as well pass or bid 1NT --if you must|pg||
nt|idc: I love it!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: I guess 3@c is -3 probably?   as long as the defence lead trumps to prevent 2 spade ruffs in North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and to specs for their comments|pg||
nt|spil: I guess trump promotion available here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: My thanks also to Michael Rosenberg for his analytic comments (and corrections), much appreciated.|pg||
nt|spil: A@S K@S A@C and spade through to give W a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When South removes the dbl of 2@d to 2@s, North knows the second suit is clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4 card drury i suppose|pg||
nt|idc: Start a new craze - how about Germ many|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: might just be an UCB?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: N having bid his hand bids again|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H is not my idea of a bid on Jxxx--why not 5@D  --perhaps he plays the cards better |pg||
nt|dburn: and after 4@h, I guess he might lead one|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h may have been 'last train'|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yep. may have though 5 diamonds as encouraging|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  May have thought it was the least encouraging noise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  now has to take a good view in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
nt|dagold: so this should go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think so because on most rebids i can bidm clubs to play and i do not mind 2 spades contract as i have ruffing vlaue and bullet|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes sorry didnt see the opening bod, too busy thinking up puns|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT down 3 by Wales in Open room not good, but looks like 10 tricks there in @s for N-S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: another freudian slip|pg||
nt|idc: not that will get to game of course|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hope you will be with us later.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be more afraid of partner's strong rebids propelling us too high than his weak rebids|pg||
nt|lestergold: weid also be afraid of missing a game when pard has a maxi|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'd be afraid of getting much too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: id also be reluctasnt to let oppd find ared suit comntract as well|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
nt|garnetts: haven't got a lot of sympathy --there are two entries vai a club ruff|pg||
nt|chilloncan: most would double initially with N hand i think|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he gets off play with a diamond--should  east get the hearts right?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades beats it if hook is on|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Well he could hardly lead a spade away from his ace...|pg||
nt|garnetts: It depends if East thinks North knows the heart position|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|psridhar: need to tap E hand off a trump now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean Liz--he could cash the ace of spades and ace of clubs if South had Qxx|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think the club intermnediates swing the balance for me its not likely to be a disaster p-laying as high level club contract|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|dagold: Wales have played very well in this set|pg||
nt|dagold: only 1 error|pg||
nt|dagold: in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: in letting through 4@h|pg||
nt|dagold: England have their work cut out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks all - see you shortly|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: Now the dummy (with singleton spade) and declarer's line, are also screaming "trump lead"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence going well, back to trumps now..|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  i understand, but it is ever so obvious to declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: a @h ruff was needed|pg||
nt|psridhar: now may be 2 late|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|psridhar: now decl can ruff the @h, play @c king and ruff with @s J, back to hand with a trump and play @c as trump substitutes thru S|pg||
nt|idc: still time|pg||
nt|spil: a disappointing finish for Scotland but well done to WBU|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so by for now|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  that would be 'never.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  As in this -200?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: as cards are spitting ok neither £@s or 4@c making but Goodman still felt that a double was too risky|pg||
nt|idc: So this likely to be 4 IMPs to N.I., leaving Wales 57 ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks all|pg||
nt|idc: restart in 17 mins or so|pg||
