mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|odysseus69: another near slam - any danger of getting there?|pg||
nt|dburn: slam not too bad - problematic on the actual lie, so Anderson and Greenwood stopped well|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|garnetts: 2@S here?  Not an acol two in my book |pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: 3@C natural and 9+ ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the opening bid may make it tough for N/S- but that pass not a good idea- nor that 3C bid-passing 1NTx  looke automatic|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|3D|nt|greerm: nice competitive hand,|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wrong vulnerability for E-W sacrifice|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|greerm: Michael byrne refuse to pass with support and a side suit, even at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|garnetts: I prefer 3@C to 3@D ---why rush to key in spades?  |pg||
nt|copeyj: Playing a (normal) sound overcall style at the 2 level vulnerable I think you have to raise with the E hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: I hate 3@C - would much rather double|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Thats OK too--what is wrong with 3@C?  |pg||
nt|greerm: I think the 3@C bid meant by the N hand|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Seen worse |pg||
nt|greerm: West wonders how distributional partner is for 4@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: Bell knows that his partner has singleton @S - makes the W hand quite powerful|pg||
nt|pitiful:  one problem might be if the bidding continues 4@d and partner bids 5@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  difficult to get back to 4M then|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe unlikely at this vul|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bell might be thinking void|pg||

nt|greerm: lets hope more caution|pg||

nt|garnetts: try stopping South now |pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: :)|pg||

nt|copeyj: what do they use 2N for, Greer, any idea?|pg||
nt|greerm: soryy, no idea, I woud have guessed this hand|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why he shouldn't be interested - when partner has four-card spade support, you have an opening bid|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn: in fact, you have about a four-loser hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now you can all point out that they got to a slam because North opened - I like 1S and my 2 arms|pg||
nt|greerm: i bet many get to slam even when North doesn't open|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|garnetts: fine when this is partner's hand but what about when the opps start bidding --do you think partner play you for more and something different Victor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: he may have been attempting some measure of revenge for board 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: where a 1@s opening on a rather worse hand than this one resulted in a big swing to England|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2S helps them in a way|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont think so Victor - 2@S only "helps" if you are prepared to bid 3@H with the south hand|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: But thinking can be dangerous |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure about that - may be a psychic cue bid, or some form of "last train"|pg||
nt|dburn: but the former looks more likely not|pg||
nt|dburn: now, rather|pg||
nt|greerm: North has made his mind up it seems|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4D looks like whatI call a Hoffman cue -stop the diamond lead before bidding slam - Martin has been doing this for 40 years|pg||
nt|garnetts: anti cue bid as  used by the late Joe Amsbury perhaps |pg||
nt|garnetts: Dating myself again |pg||
mb|5C|an|1 or 3|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Is South thinking of some constructive (lying)  response here?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not carbon dating--not quite that old :)  |pg||

nt|odysseus69: maybe 4D was something else --South took a while to bid 5C |pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|greerm: may have been working out if 4N coudl have been a sign off|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Since my granny never takes finesses she would go off in this --but it might just make |pg||
nt|greerm: not obvious how to play it, so wont be quick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe a diamond lead|pg||
nt|dburn: the problem is the lack of a quick (and safe) entry to the South hand to take the finesse|pg||
nt|greerm: maybe will rely in the @H k onside|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: Yes to all those who suggested she might be pretty old---its a bit like the Bates Motel |pg||

nt|dburn: if declarer discovers the spade position early, he has some indication to go right in clubs|pg||
