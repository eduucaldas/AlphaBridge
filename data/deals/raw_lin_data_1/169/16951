mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|idc: For the first time we have a result from the Closed room, and it isn't a bad looking one to Welsh eyes|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Walker ducked his @dA twice in the other room if the play record is to be believed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i wonder how 4@S came home|pg||
nt|athene: ah right |pg||
nt|idc: They play reverse distribution signals, so North gave correct count|pg||
nt|danmac: you can make this double dummy, but I think in practise you will go down|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps, as the late great Hugh Kelsey used to say, a cow flew by and distracted him|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|idc: Patrick is thinking about it|pg||
nt|idc: The lead suggests a singleton, so something like his actual shape is possible|pg||

nt|danmac: good choice|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: can anyone think of any other evidence?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||

nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: The profile for our excellent viewgraph operator gives Denis Dobrin from Russia|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N!|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is nasty--NS likely to make nine tricks on a spade lead--4@S a phantom |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have been led up the garden path again|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: shame I've never been to russia!|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
nt|garnetts: straight in and North probably should double --minimum and not wanting to bid 5@H |pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close run thing though...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: ...but 6 spades may be tricky|pg||
nt|idc: we'll try to get you names as we can - starts of matches are often rushed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..it looks to have handling probs, but the diamond ace is right..|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psridhar: when they bid slam on long suits it is often a 'tempo' game, so u make attacking leads|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is a no play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: the contract is really 6C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not surprised-W suggested 6C enroute to 6N ...and E imagined his pd has a 5 bagger-lack of unnderstdg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, hoped the original @C wasn't short, alas it was|pg||
nt|garnetts: You might make 4@H double dummy --more likely going at least one off|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: ..and certainly dont want to ship any defensive tricks here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: mast play 2NT as 4 card support...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: well, I certainly dont like the double|pg||
nt|idc: It'll mean your commentators will be impartial - since we don't know which direction the countries are sitting!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: that can only help declarer..|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: and this lead also...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great cost to either side just no gain here|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, a big decision for poor South to have to take this early in the morning|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|idc: I can barely put my slippers on the right way round, leading to a doubled slam way beyond me|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and that it shipped it seems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wilkinsona: This is an easy make now after south's giveaway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: since i dont know the names, i can criticize the players freely for once..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess Scotland are E-W, took me ages to work that out|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East still has a choice but knows the club ace is with south..|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: as spec point out with no x and trump lead declarer has handling problems|pg||
nt|garnetts: that was frankly dreadful |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Hello everybody. Is that score correct??|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Since we are the Closed room, we began 3 boards ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: A strong NT from Spears|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 0-0 you mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: NS have 650|pg||
nt|psridhar: xcellent save that 6H ...gains against a Vul game even, let alone the making slam |pg||
nt|psridhar: 6@c shd make?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  No:) 590|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: oh yes indeed|pg||
nt|idc: but at this rate, they will cacth us up|pg||
nt|garnetts: Afraid so Liz|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure was..|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: undo..?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  i shall not ask for details|pg||
nt|garnetts: They had to work at it though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: has got Mr Carlisle into great form straight away|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark:  Good practical bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well 2 clubs must be majors so NS take a strange view ang play in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Well I was as polite as I could be :) |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: That won't do a lot of damage |pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: but NS here are far from finding their @c fit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: well there it is 650|pg||
nt|psridhar: wonder why N didnt bid his clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this lead clarifies thinks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: does not rate to make, with 2 spades ok and 1N going off|pg||
nt|garnetts: laydown anyway |pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: I see mousing over the hands produces Short/Walker E-W, and Tower/Richards N-S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|idc: So I guess names have been entered but possibly in wrong box|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|psridhar: he chose a cue 3@d instead|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|wilkinsona: ..but defence going wrong..|pg||

nt|psridhar: "if only people bid what they have and not what they dont....."  Late Kaplan :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello Liz|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: be that as it may, Yeh just inched 4 Imps closer|pg||
nt|garnetts: didn't fancy 3@D then :) |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|kiwibridge: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|garnetts: Both EW rightly conclude bidding is dangerous--|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sad to admit, thik I would have tried 2 spades with East|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: 3@H is making|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  best to stop quickly on a misfit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: as is 4@C :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I might under an assumed name |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5@c is not a hopeless contract, needs defense to shift to @h before winning @d ace|pg||
nt|idc: I think 2@c is natural but alerted since game forcing|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|wilkinsona: NS heading overboard...|pg||
nt|idc: and 4@d a shortage showing splinter of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland compete to 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: North does have some extras after 4@h, and at least they have managed to stop below six|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which has a chance|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  south trying to signal for a heart: declarer has to play him for stiff ace|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west best to play ace and another trump it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: does not want to concede a ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is that not an assumed name you are using?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: if west had taken the ace of spade a trump promotion would have led to an axtra undertrick |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|psridhar: but they found the defense and beat it, so the leaders get ahead further|pg||
nt|idc: normally you'd say a 6-0 @c split was awful, but here it is a lot better than 5-1, when they might suffer a ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: enough undertricks as it is...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: ...but may be a problem nevertheless|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW closer to 2 hearts than NS|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|idc: did he have time to set up spades Tony?  too late now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might still do it with AK and another club |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|nt|idc: maybe not, I guess the 5 level was too high|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  That did not go well :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: And EW dropped a trick|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzzb: board 3 was -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: NS will reach 3N..unless they decide to nail W now |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: interesting opening from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: If that is 14-16 OK---not in my view if it is 12-14 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky for south though|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cuttysark:  Connection problems here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes I suppose its asking a lot to read the stiif ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Sri Lanka have just tossed a wicket to Canada by contriving a run out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  easy for us :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard high card vaues and a decent suit make 1@H look better |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks, Denis|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do we like 3@C?  |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Similar trump suit to the previous board|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: it also breaks 3-3 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont really see he has a choice, I am not waiting for a heart lead vs 1NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: if S can finesse @d based on the Vul bidding by W......this will make overtricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Support double |pg||
pc|h5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|idc: There's a website for this weekend at:  http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/|pg||
nt|garnetts: This one makes though|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: any card will do|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark:  3@D GF|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: even a double finesse in @c will do|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: results, CCs and more|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Lucky heart position - but he has nothing else to play for|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wilkinsona: only 11 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: I assume toys prohibit anything else |pg||
pc|cA|pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|idc: N-S only have one quick loser, but that's not the same as having 12 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we all have a pramful vs NT thesedays|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h6|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: a low @D now can do little harm|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: you got that laptop working yet Liz?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: I'm not convinced the North hand is a 2@c opener; nice @h suit but that's about it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well hard to see where the 12th come from|pg||
nt|idc: I should say, we don't get running scores on website, just updates at the end of each session|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: trouble is, last time I didnt open 2 clubs with the north hand it was passed out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  It comes - and then it goes|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  If it does not like what it sees....|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Michael Rosenberg tells me that if south has Ax, 109xx. KQJxxx x he could be triple squeezed|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h7|pc|dT|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: well caught partner|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: another slammy hand to test NS|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with both major suit hooks wrong...|pg||
nt|idc: a good slam this time but both major Kings wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Do you agree with pass ?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no, but seems to work this time|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: this will end the auction|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that 2 heart bid ... well north is between bids, a hand often seen|pg||
nt|garnetts: my thoughts entirely |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I like to raise partner - keeps them sweet|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: just making|pg||
nt|psridhar: all cards lying badly for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: this may be a good slam.... to stay out of|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, cruel if N-S bid it given the way the morning has started, so I'm rooting for them to stop in 5@s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double game swing board 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 2@H should carry preference overtones|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: but @s break shd help|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In spite of slamy suggestions from a spec, WBU settle for game|pg||

nt|garnetts: I am suprised that he dropped the Q@H offside on board 1--admtitedly the lead was not best|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|cuttysark:  Still having connection problems - this looks a very tricky gamw|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: sorry 9 |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: I like the flights too|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  we call this an Aberdeen double - when your only 4-card suit ahs already been bid|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: Yeh needs swingy games and slam boards, last few have been flattish|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well doubtless if you come from Aberdeen you would have a different word for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, NS missed out here it seems|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|cuttysark:  that word be printable?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: south a little heavy for 2N perhaps and north just not worth a raise|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: j@H is a killer now |pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: defence needs to be careful, though|pg||

pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: looks like it's slipping awei from Yeh|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|psridhar: to recover 30 one needs about 5 swingy bds - assuming u judge 4 right and err on one....|pg||
nt|idc: The @d suit may not matter to make 3NT, guessing @c correctly probably the key|pg||

nt|garnetts: looks like a quick two off  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: quick?|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: east has an interesting decision over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: double, 2@H and 3@c are all possible|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a suit that isn't strong|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: with a strong and shapely hand you are supposed to start bidding your suits right away|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I have been relegated to the Closed Room - good luck all |pg||

mb|2S|nt|idc: Our loss Liz|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: i would treat that east hand as a game force i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in which case perhaps 3@C then hearts is right, but it's easy to see that getting very high very quickly|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: The trouble with a negative double is (a) partner might just pass and (b) you haven't started to get your extreme shape across|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he just loses the sixth club here - a reasonable view, similar to opening it 1@H rather than 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead you just have to bring in the clubs|pg||

mb|d|mb|3S|nt|athene: easy for west to imagine his partner won't have much wasted in spades now|pg||
nt|idc: I expect West will bid 4@h, and N-S will defend|pg||

nt|athene: start off with 4@S and then fiddle around|pg||

nt|athene: you can always back into hearts if need be|pg||
nt|danmac: I don't think you can pass|pg||
mb|5N|nt|athene: the only time you lose out is if you bid 1nt with hearts and partner refuses to believe you can have them, so doesn't investigate|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: even if 1nt was going to lose hearts it might be best - it does get the overall hand across so much better than double|pg||
