mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|an|*|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't have a CC for NS, sadly|pg||

mb|3D|nt|henryb:  much modified, I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though south decided he had a game force|pg||
nt|henryb:  He does not|pg||
nt|athene: he hasn't got many losers, but i thought you were supposed to wait until you found a fit before using that method of evaluation|pg||
nt|henryb:  but I sympathise|pg||
nt|mikeirl: me 2|pg||
nt|mikeirl: reasonable spot|pg||
nt|athene: yes, even if you get to a game which is in theory unsound, the opponents still have to beat it|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|athene: south might think his partner has something for 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S could be an advance sac with the same hand just no @CA, for example|pg||
nt|athene: some people like to play lebensohl in that position (over 2@S, 2NT would be a weak hand) |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: but i don't see why 3@H is really all that necessary|pg||
nt|athene: if the hand is yours, that means partner has the world and he is going to do something again|pg||

nt|athene: he is a bit strong for 3@C; maybe he will double then bid clubs|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|an|diamonds|nt|athene: 3nt not so great because you could have a slam on, or game in clubs or the major west hasn't got, and 3nt be going down|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  5@s is better than 5@c|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|henryb:  5@d is cold|pg||
nt|athene: all depends if west gets his club ruffs|pg||
nt|henryb:  don't you think Greenwood might have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|athene: it rarely costs to conceal a 4-card minor when you have a 7-card major, but this is one of those times|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess 4@s is down comfortably on the cross ruff|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D over 2@S is possible but maybe that sounds like 6-5|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: if you play 2-suited 2major openers then perhaps 3@D here ought to be this sort of hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  but partner announced diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  by passing 2@d doubled|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok, the pass of the double|pg||
nt|athene: well depends how many diamonds it announced|pg||
nt|athene: if it was a strong suggestion to play there then west ought to be bidding more than just 3@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: 6@H might make here sometimes when 6@D does not - you can throw a spade on the long diamond and ruff a spade|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Northerners seem to be having all the best of the play so far here|pg||
nt|athene: of course, in practice you are unlikely to make either slam|pg||
nt|athene: but NS might get excited when they find they have a double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: was this south's 3@S and north's 3nt?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: i am not sure when (if ever) they agreed hearts - couldn't south be cueing for diamonds here?|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|athene: i guess when he bids 6@H that will give his partner a hint which red suit he wants to play in|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead, you don't take the finesse - you need the diamonds to come in anyway, so the finesse would only be needed if hearts were 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but still, it would be better for south to be declarer, for that reason - the defenders can't put you to an early guess|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm ok sounds as though they somehow agreed hearts somewhere along the line|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  South can only be declarer in 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told there are two discussions going on|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  that solves the @s finesse|pg||
nt|athene: a nice lead (from north's point of view)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: now even if hearts are 4-1 you can finesse clubs and avoid the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: so you just need the diamonds to behave|pg||

nt|athene: if declarer elimiantes the minors and then plays ace and a heart|pg||
nt|athene: south had better not put a lazy 8 in or north wins the jack and has to give a ruff and discard|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: 7@C or 7@S on here|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|nt|mikeirl: Hi|pg||
nt|athene: nothing wrong with 7nt, either, as the cards lie, but that isn't south's concern|pg||
nt|athene: he is just wondering which grand is safest|pg||
nt|athene: you might want to ruff the spades good, playing in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps ruff hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  7@c won't make. 7@s or 7NT will|pg||
nt|athene: sorry, yes, there is a bit of a problem in 7@C :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  7@d goes down on a club lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  7@c I mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikeirl: unlucky|pg||
nt|henryb:  7@s I mean|pg||
nt|henryb:  This needs @sJx in one of the hands|pg||
nt|henryb:  or stiff J|pg||
nt|athene: usually the reason for choosing notrumps over suit slams is that you have two long suits, two potential trick sources|pg||
nt|athene: and you can make in notrumps even if one breaks badly|pg||
nt|athene: because you have enough tricks without needing both suits|pg||
nt|athene: here that isn't the issue, but transportation is|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps south could have imagined the problem with playing in clubs (no way to unblock spades and get over there, if dummy only has @CQx(x) as an entry)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: he'll probably take the normal line of @SJ singleton or doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: but it's asking a lot|pg||
nt|athene: i think if north had as many as three clubs he should have supported first time after 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: so you can't expect more than Qx|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps North should have encisioned the problem and not bid 7@c|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  now there's an overcall with great purpose. uses up bidding space, lead directing, and suggesting that it might be our hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps 1@H here is north's way of showing a little thing like 7@C-2 isn't ruining his day :)|pg||
