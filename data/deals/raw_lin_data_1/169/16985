mb|p|nt|garnetts: We are on catch up here it seems |pg||

mb|4S|nt|ady: light double from south   with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd guess sime/matheson|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is aggressive when 3@s can be bid on that junk|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree - 4@S too optimistic here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anderson and Greenwood one of the most experienced pairs in the event|pg||
nt|paulg:  David Greenwood, known as jtr on BBO, is also a frequent vugraph commentator|pg||

nt|dagold: 4 losers but I am not sure there are 9 winners|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pitiful:  assume opps have not bid|pg||
nt|ady: only 1 top loser in spades   but with spades 4-1  difficulties at the slam level|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cameron_1: i wonder what the real auction was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would not want to bid a slam single dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on these cards|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|paulg:  @h10 from Walker to show diamond interest|pg||
pc|sA|nt|puncher: Ireland will be looking for a big win here to nail the camrose - Wales and England also hoping for big wins - any of these three could win it|pg||

pc|s7|nt|pitiful:  good duck by Norman?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: doesnt matter what he does does it?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: 4@H makes double dummy -- but it's a tall order|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: just drop the @HQ and guess clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: And if slightly strange things happen, even Scotland could still do it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dagold: seems to be  atrick short|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulg:  declarer should probably have played the @dJ there|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short would not lead small from the @dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  so he must have the @dK ... often right to play your middle honour of a sequence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: S could have doubled 3@H, showing a good hand, but the final contract would have been the same|pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: Hi everyone! (again)|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not --  depending on defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Sound opening even though flat and 11 HCP|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cameron_1: @d looser in end game I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d doesn't look like an acol 2|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Sid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @S suit worth more trhan one HCP|pg||
nt|puncher: Any weak NTs in the whole event? I'm a fan but others don't seem to be these days...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dagold: I would bid on Souths hand I must admit|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I just saw Scotland bid this to 6@S via Kokish relay |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are putting in contracts and leading and claim|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT  for n/s   no reall problems|pg||
nt|newmoon: me 2|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 3N -- whether E preempts or not|pg||
nt|paulg:  At least you approve the 4-card majors here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: could make a game facing the right weak notrump type|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Some oftThe Northern Irish still play weak NT |pg||
pc|d3|nt|puncher: Well I'd have opened 1@C before 1@S - except that it'd be a 1NT for me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|2hplus4: Tight game missed Declarer perhaps able to endplay S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker has been conservative holding three small clubs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the @sK surprisingly well positioned this will play well for declarer|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
pc|c9|nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|puncher: yes so should be a comfortable make |pg||
nt|puncher: west endplayed now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  short conservative because his opener is minimum and they are non-vulnerable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
pc|s2|nt|2hplus4: Yes W quite conservative|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h7|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With S long in @C and @S declarer suspects @H A falling|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|paulg:  Walker and Short have a tendency to avoid thin games. They are often in the par contract but the trend is to bid these games and challenge the opponents to beat you|pg||
pc|cA|nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||
nt|newmoon: plse stay tuned - we have a problem|pg||
nt|newmoon: will he make it tho?  has to hook @C10 after 2@Hs|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: hoping for 3-3 split|pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulg:  Short will be telling Walker to evaluate better and raise with his six count|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||

nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
nt|puncher: seems a shame not to be able to bid those clubs!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play canape, so they often often a 4-card major rather than a longer minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when it is clubs, since they don't like that suit|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
nt|puncher: no difficulties for declarer here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
pc|c2|nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||

nt|dagold: 4@c is a nice bid, although here 5@c might have caused major problems|pg||

mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Again game making|pg||
nt|puncher: that's true|pg||
nt|paulg:  but 4@h is the normal contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be lucky that you don't really have the entries for the double heart finesse|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  West might take the push with a doubleton diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: North contemplating his good hand:  "is there more than 4@S here?"|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dagold: Espen has done well to only bid 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 1@H as S, then pass any rebid by N|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: this is a peaceful one|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  did South believe that the double was takeout, by a passed vulnerable hand, rather than just diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why would S bid 3@S? Vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  or was he just competing in diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 800 or 1100 depending on where they fight it out|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like 800, more if they bid 5@d|pg||
nt|idc: undo operator - i expect this is by E-W?|pg||

nt|xenya: well played for an overtrick|pg||
nt|paulg:  I like to make the opponents work for +800, but defence was very simple here |pg||
nt|paulg:  you have a sinking feeling with contracts like this .. taken three failing finesses and you know that there was a winning line somewhere|pg||
nt|puncher: likely to be flat though|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: and 13 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  There was an appeal from the Wales-Scotland match yesterday afternoon. The decision has gone in Wales' favour and has resulted in another VP for them, the final result now being 20-10 VPs to Wales.|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: although I'm beginning to learn that it's dangerous to make such predictions |pg||
mb|1S|nt|2hplus4: Appeals are an unappealing part of the game. Why can't players just get on with the game|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D!|nt|dagold: Rosen also bid 3@d but tried 3N over 3@h, probably figuring he had suggested doubt|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  You would just go with the Director's ruling?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: NS may overreach here with cards lying badly|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is takeout without spades, a method popular in Europe|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why have a director. Just assume the opponents are not cheating and accept what happens|pg||
nt|paulg:  this was a case of misinformation where a splinter was not alerted but said to be natural|pg||
nt|paulg:  unsurprisingly this caused the opponents not to appreciate their fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the lead you can afford a loser in every suit, so some may play the @hA first|pg||
nt|puncher: things could get interesting now|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c from Walker?|pg||
nt|puncher: yes at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dagold: Espen would be able to bid if he was in the balancing seat here|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Joe|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|xenya: not that 1N rates to make on this layout |pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: pretty chunky 2N overcall not sure with two tens it was right|pg||
nt|dagold: dangerous in the middle of a live auction, mainly because partner will expect more|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S likely shows exactly 3 cards |pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass by s shows ...|pg||
nt|xenya: safe contract :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like playing bridge with or against Philadelphia lawyers|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  West does not have an easy lead |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Nor the next time he gets in|pg||

mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|2hplus4: Not a conclusion you really can draw against Short or Walker|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is going down two, a good save against 4@s or 4@h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dagold: Should be an easy make|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|paulg:  upgrade from Walker, nice intermediates|pg||
nt|puncher: an unlikely 6@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Obviously not|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think most cannot do that these days, playing 2@c.... 3@c as game forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: bold but sensible double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, in that case n-s weren't robbed.|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Excellent grand slam in a balck suit here as long as they promise not to lead diamonds :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  South a little fixed now and may just raise to 4@c|pg||
nt|puncher: hand for the bad 2N for south - to show a minimum opener with 6 diams|pg||

nt|dagold: looks like a bidding missunderstanding |pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 3N showed or was thought to show 4/4 M or something?|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway another 4-3 fit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: East will be relieved that west has four small hearts |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C puppet?|pg||
nt|newmoon: even so, 3N T a sign-off|pg||
nt|dagold: have seen 3N played as 4/4 majors|pg||
nt|dagold: in that structure 3@h= spades or no major|pg||
nt|newmoon: if 3@D = 1 or both 4xmajor, 4@D would ask for 4M|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT could be 3=3-4-3 hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 5 more imps to England on 21 for 620 to NI and 800 to England|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not sure of the wisdom of that|pg||
nt|paulg:  if the clubs were breaking then it would need accurate defence to beat 3NT, but when they are 3-1 Walker does not have the tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing our operator lost the play with the crash of the connection, always difficult in these circumstances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What causes all these crashes?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Poor phone connection?|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can imagine that everyone except Short taking their time on this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be the wifi in the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problems this weekend have all been in the closed room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that should be a consideration in future when considering venues|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect the signal strength is not great in that area of the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Part of the problem is the devolved nature of the adminstrators|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bridge Great Britain relies on the home unions|pg||
nt|paulg:  The home union typically asks a district to run the event|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but surely an audience of over 1000 should be considered|pg||
nt|paulg:  and each district ends up running an event every seven or eight years, so never has the experience|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not write it down and pass on the experience gained?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Because there is no-one co-ordinating it all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So all bridge in Britain is as badly run as the SBU?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|garnetts: just claims 11 |pg||

mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|santyclz: Does this auction call for the lead of the highest card in your hand?  Lindsay doesn't think so.|pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: this is ok on careful play|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That is the problem with 3@C |pg||
nt|puncher: the dodgy connections are infectious|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short knows that it is on the club finesse, but his club intermediates are good.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the cards are very friendly and every chance of a gain|pg||
pc|h9|nt|puncher: this will be a fortunate make for scotland but we've all been in worse :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|xenya: apparently the 2@H opening shows a weak hand with both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Undo?  (Ihope)|pg||
nt|paulg:  they bid the slam because Walker showed a huge club raise in the context of passing over 2@h|pg||
nt|puncher: But unfortunately looks like 4@H made on board 5 in the other room - it was a spade lead and then a club switch|pg||

pc|c4|nt|puncher: Possibly so if they don't play bad 2N|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: on Bd 21 - not a great slam at all but as the cards lay it was more successful|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|puncher: With a bad 2N available they could have shown a 5/5 shape in the minors - 2N would be artificial showing 5/5 in minors or 6 diams - both minimum openers|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Walker now|pg||
nt|puncher: Open room in 4@S on the previous 6@C board so a gain for Scotland - looks like this is not to be a flat match|pg||

mb|2C|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: looking for an adverse save |pg||

nt|garnetts: loses a couple of imps|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if I like the 2NT bid or not |pg||
nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard for us to believe that Walker-Short could play too quickly for the operator :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dagold: with short majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must have been declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: depends what they had for lunch|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is limited to 16 points|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
nt|idc: Result from other room just in - 3NT -1 by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|puncher: 3N looking like a normal spot but the poor @D break kills it|pg||

nt|paulg:  i'm not a fan of MUD leads but they can be difficult for declarer to read too|pg||
nt|alok_daga: btw what was 3nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW playing Blue Club, so 2@s only promised five|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|april7: you very seldom get a good score if opps.play at 1 level|pg||
nt|dagold: some Kibs do not like the side 4cM|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|newmoon: my shpellingg iss garbage these dayss|pg||
nt|idc: Bad Roland|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the club slam attempted in the other room was less than thin|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Difficult for eitrher to come in|pg||
nt|paulg:  Only going to happen if East opens|pg||
nt|puncher: other way round surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am cheap, just diet coke|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|newmoon: still, -2 not too bad|pg||
nt|dagold: here for example the handwill not play so well facing many hands with 4-card spade support|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E is to blame here|pg||
nt|idc: same lead as other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also inferences that East did not have four hearts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dagold: probably need 5 spades opposite|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|2hplus4: Needed to lead @CK to beat this.|pg||
nt|puncher: unlucky but a flat board|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
pc|cK|nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S was OK i think, but not 3N|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||
nt|paulg:  South can suggest doubleton heart because his partner knows he cannot have doubleton|pg||
nt|puncher: does N have to avoid playing a club now to stop declarer shortening his trumps?|pg||
nt|paulg:  it cannot cost to lead diamond here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|pc|c5|nt|paulg:  1@d was not alerted but showed 4+ hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulg:  from the carding he knew Walker had @cQ7 or @cQ75|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|xenya: not on this layout though|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: guessed    potential swing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
nt|idc: I like that @sQ play - on the bidding declarer cannot have 3 spades, since they never supported the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Unconfirmed, but current live ranking: Eng 163; Ireland 160; Wales 160; Scotland 154; WBU 149; NI 112|pg||
nt|puncher: too double dummy to get that right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pitiful:  well q@h lead sort of helped the guess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: *first seat|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: true or an inspired club lead and a heart switch|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|idc: not that it will make much of a difference either way on this hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c8|pc|dT|nt|paulg:  declarer did not have enough information to get the spades right and played the percentage line|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|mdgraham: dull 4@h EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: I nearly claimed it for him once AD not led|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, Wales with a good lead at the half but England have fought back|pg||
nt|paulg:  played the other way up he could endplay the defence into opening the diamonds|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|ady: also hand 12 maybe another swing against  England   down in 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H|pg||
nt|puncher: but I don't think that was what happened|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  defence could see it happening, so tried to break it|pg||
nt|puncher: but even the ruff and discard only gives the 9th trick doesn't it?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: a great slam for n/s  here   they will do well to stop out|pg||
nt|newmoon: in OR NORTH played it in 2S - where 1@H - 1NT (showed a @S-suit)|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough call for Walker here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: makes 11 with the fortunate diamond position|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  5@c looks best spot|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they will need to lead a @s|pg||
nt|xenya: not a bad 5@C here -- but EW in OR gailed to reach it after the same start|pg||
nt|paulg:  strong sequence from Short but Walker has no aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: *failed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
nt|santyclz: I saw this board in another room, e-w bid to the 5 level and paid the price.|pg||
nt|paulg:  so no danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|puncher: and should be a rare flat board for this match |pg||
pc|c4|nt|pitiful:  tough for david here|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  a very good contract    fails here|pg||
nt|paulg:  testing lead with the bad spade break, but luckily East has three hearts and the ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N however looks hopeless on any lead -- providing NS defend correctly afterwards|pg||
nt|pfbr: on a @d lead there are 9 tricks arent' there?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes, sorry|pg||
nt|pfbr: luckily david didn't :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so a great lead by N -- only to lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|idc: I'd guess that 2NT must be conventional there, not an uncommon treatment|pg||
nt|puncher: a missed opportunity for the Scots on board 13 as they talked oppos out of the making 3N by doubling them so they removed to a non-making 5D which slipped through|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|puncher: yes and 3@H is minimum with 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Double for the lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: or win the same amount|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: which is only fair|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Lindsay thinks it may go down if partner leads a heart|pg||
nt|idc: It's right in that a heart is an attractive lead for defence, wrong in that there are 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|puncher: i have to say it's one of my favourite toys - helpful for finding best game or staying out of a poor one|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|puncher: North will be miffed that this one can't go off|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, some of us build our whole game on reaching poor games|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|pitiful:  this was an unlucky hand for England|pg||

nt|eamongall: but low high card points |pg||
nt|galadriel: Ireland will be determined to go for a good win as they 5 vps behind England going in to this last match|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|spil: Would be hard to catch a raise from N no matter what S bids|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Last board of the set now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pitiful:  last board here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Got a trump lead and s shifted to the @d on winning the @c ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: That seems normal|pg||
nt|puncher: Last board so thanks to all for your patience with the dodgy connections|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Many thanks to Melanie Thomas, our excellent operator. Tough conditions|pg||
nt|idc: 4 IMPs but that just takes Scotland to 52 IMPs, still 23-7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and to our commentators, Sam and Ian|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: yes    5 unlcuky    spade lead   clubs 3-0   and east doubleton diamond   so in fact Ireland did well to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: good job, thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Hi Anto, it's Laura but I can't talk because I'm BBO op|pg||
nt|puncher: A very thin 4S here but unlikely to get to it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: That room also got to 3@s on this in a multi mixup.|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: East was hoping for an entirely different sort of auction when he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Something from partner, 3@c from him I expect, showing weak hand with long suit|pg||
nt|idc: If dbl is takeout, he'll bid 4@c and then West will have the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Double is a bit dangerous as you must expect to get 4@C from partner now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: now waht does North do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  strange choice by East in both rooms|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, E supported diamonds at his first turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Once bitten ...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I thought choice was 1Nt or X|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree, but that did make things easier for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H looks just about right here|pg||
nt|paulg:  walker did well to bid 1@s, otherwise they may never have got into the auction|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: goes for it :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H now? or 3@S? or something else?|pg||
nt|xenya: not 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If you bid again (I think you should), I prefer 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  3n a real shot from david|pg||
nt|ady: thin 3NT    will not make|pg||
nt|pitiful:  upgraded his pips |pg||
nt|pitiful:  might now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what is @s 8 lead from|pg||
nt|ady: yes    if he gets this right|pg||
nt|ady: would be a lucky swing |pg||
nt|pitiful:  this will be a big board in the march|pg||
nt|pitiful:  match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: No, it's a bit lily-livered|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1 or 4, I agree.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Will he take the push now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Last hand of this set, we'll be back in 18 minutes for the exciting finale of this year's Camrose|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: might go down 2 trying heart finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: Hope you all enjoyed this set!   :)     Thanks to BBO for making this VUgraph available to us.  Even poor souls in South Africa can attend now!|pg||
nt|puncher: I guess it's just too hard to get to this one|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: Scotland can afford to lose 5 IMPs and still stay at 23-7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is overstating the hand in my opinion|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|idc: North will surely have some of this|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pitiful:  might make if no @c switch|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
nt|puncher: kind of inviting the double here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|idc: and this for his second course :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: that was quick -- it seems 3N could be made by squeezing N|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: 1730 restart|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East bid hearts, so a little surprising to have no loser in the suit and four winners!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|puncher: i guess that's no longer 23-7...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think NS have just turned a top into a bottom |pg||
nt|mdgraham: can now manage a club ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|idc: They can afford 11 and only drop to 22-8, but could be worse perhaps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|puncher: a good come back from Ireland in this set given Scotland's handy start|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: this will put england further ahead    but they have 2 potential bad results not yet scored|pg||
nt|xenya: well stopped -- actually if E had 4 diamods he probably should bid 5|pg||
nt|puncher: shame to slip a bit at the last hurdle but still a good win for Scotland|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|ady: the match might still be close   |pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
