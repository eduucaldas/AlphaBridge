nt|puncher: hi all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and hello Ian|pg||
nt|idc: G'day Sam & Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: interesting hand since 4@S seems better than 3NT--but no way to bid it I think|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pitiful:  2@d multi|pg||
nt|ady: club guess |pg||
nt|dagold: or one of these constructive 2@h|pg||
nt|dagold: is fine|pg||
nt|dagold: as Espen has done|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib said:  "or one of these constructive 2@h"|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: EW might reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 1@s....|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: looking for an adverse save |pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white saves not often best|pg||
nt|garnetts: loses a couple of imps|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if I like the 2NT bid or not |pg||
nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dagold: with short majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
nt|idc: Result from other room just in - 3NT -1 by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|puncher: 3N looking like a normal spot but the poor @D break kills it|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|Walddk7: Sam is a debutant commentator. I wonder if she knows that co-commentators expect to get a drink from newbies :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: you very seldom get a good score if opps.play at 1 level|pg||
nt|dagold: some Kibs do not like the side 4cM|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: my shpellingg iss garbage these dayss|pg||
nt|idc: Bad Roland|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the club slam attempted in the other room was less than thin|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Difficult for eitrher to come in|pg||
nt|paulg:  Only going to happen if East opens|pg||
nt|puncher: other way round surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am cheap, just diet coke|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|newmoon: still, -2 not too bad|pg||
nt|dagold: here for example the handwill not play so well facing many hands with 4-card spade support|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E is to blame here|pg||
nt|idc: same lead as other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dagold: probably need 5 spades opposite|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dQ|nt|2hplus4: Needed to lead @CK to beat this.|pg||
nt|puncher: unlucky but a flat board|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S was OK i think, but not 3N|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|paulg:  1@d was not alerted but showed 4+ hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|xenya: not on this layout though|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: guessed    potential swing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
nt|idc: I like that @sQ play - on the bidding declarer cannot have 3 spades, since they never supported the suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pitiful:  well q@h lead sort of helped the guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: *first seat|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: true or an inspired club lead and a heart switch|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|idc: not that it will make much of a difference either way on this hand|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|xenya: good double by S|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Could he not read the @C pip for a second ruff?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but we would have been doubled|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, did he think his partner has raised on singleton king of hearts?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must be getting close to time trouble here, with five boards still to play|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3NT likely to make here|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be another multi auction and North will raise 2NT to 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @C lead needed|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Unlikely from W|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence may block the diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: which might give them another shot|pg||
nt|2hplus4: True and nothing declarer can do about it Is there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|2hplus4: It did seem rather strange|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: 1@C?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'll boldly predict this won't be openned 1nt.|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: or it may die out on the 1 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h by s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but the final contract is probably correct|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: North has done well to pass--I might well have bid |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even stranger|pg||
nt|paulg:  May be 2@d from West, weak with both majors|pg||
nt|puncher: welcome back all|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: East might also have just bid 3NT over 2@H unless he is really thinking six might be on |pg||
mb|2S|nt|pitiful:  3@c was pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: not the time to beak the transfer with 4@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2N was a @h raise|pg||
nt|newmoon: with 3-4-3-3, deduct a point = he has a minimum|pg||
nt|xenya:  looks like pass is missing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well this is not the real auction of course |pg||
nt|paulg:  no, this is either the wrong auction or wrong board|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: an odd choice with all that black suit cover --heart lead and spade switch beats it |pg||
nt|puncher: not the easiest of leads for south - trump likely|pg||
mc|9|nt|paulg:  okay, i think this is close except that Soith opened 2@d multi|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We don't have a score on 26. Maybe our operator can enter it manually|pg||

nt|newmoon: so... is this a 2@S by South, even with 2 aces|pg||
nt|xenya: still 11 -- sorry|pg||
nt|2hplus4: S very conservative whatever N showed|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: or in 3rd seat, that rule falls away|pg||
mb|1D|nt|delberto:  yeah he would never have played KC|pg||
nt|santyclz: That hand could have taken 10 min to play with a trump lead,|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If you need the code, please let me know|pg||
mb|d|mb|r!|nt|vugraphzzc: They didn't have 10 mins to spare|pg||
nt|paulg:  South showed 19-20 balanced and North passed the 5-card stayman response|pg||
nt|dburn: reasonable facing 19-20, I guess|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This auction is odd too|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Redouble = hearts|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d!|nt|xenya: unfortunately the rooms are not linked it seems, so we don't have the comparisons|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h is a transfer showing 4+ spades|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@H looked like a normal contract in the other room - but a bit tricky to make|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Pretty common nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|newmoon: @SA - then @S2 (for a club)... but gets ruffed|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s guarantees 4-card support and a minimum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: TD standing at the table with his arms crossed and tapping his foot?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Ew missed fit again Should they have come in?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Although NS not far from making 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Both would have considered it, given it is a known 8-card spade fit|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Would it really be too much to remind the next organisers of the Camrose to remember to check wifi connectivity at the proposed venue?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Given the time situation I guess we are lost again|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Sime's double is support, 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzzc: Not quite, but 25 mins to play 5 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Spears' sorry|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome back to Ian Crorie|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|xenya: declarer could take a different view in the trump suit -- but 4@S is always safe as the cards lie|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|newmoon: easy game this eh?    well played|pg||
nt|xenya: well this onewill be quick enough|pg||
pc|h9|nt|santyclz: Will he make the overtrick?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|newmoon: In OR, South opened 2@D, but West also overcalled 4@H|pg||

nt|april7: either 2@H after a 1NT opening by S, but W will possibly reach a @S part |pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Yes, played too fast.|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|puncher: This 4@S looks a bit more comfortable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|april7: if EWplay DONT, then 2@D is a good bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be spades and another suit |pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@d a good spot here|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   playable|pg||
nt|newmoon: interesting hand this... 4@H, 4@S or 5minor all possibilities|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Anyone for a bid with Murdoch's cards or too light for you?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pitiful:  should get @d right after the overcall|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@S = weakish, 3@C will be a good raise in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: South knows that the hand belongs to them.  And is pleased with the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Oh sorry, thought S opened|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: North took a view to ignore the @h's|pg||
nt|idc: The Scottish lead is 46 IMPs at the moment, which converts to 22-8 in Victory Points|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: It's worth taking an extra minute or 2 in slams and x'd contracts.  He went from +1 to -(2 I think) by not taking that moment.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|newmoon: Very pleased|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: all those interruptions are really annoying :)|pg||
nt|puncher: And they meet Ireland in the final match|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: Norman is a bit overstocked in spaded    but still 3NT  seems a little pessimistic |pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|santyclz: One even I could make.|pg||
nt|xenya: me too|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: no half-measures for North!|pg||
nt|yuval10: with such a bad suit and all the points elsewhere|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Time play, ask if @Cs break and claim 7.|pg||
mc|12|nt|newmoon: looks like 140, and another 3 IMPs to England   (140-50)|pg||
nt|puncher: England and Wales seem to be having a close match|pg||

nt|mdgraham: dull 4@h EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: I nearly claimed it for him once AD not led|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, Wales with a good lead at the half but England have fought back|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: also hand 12 maybe another swing against  England   down in 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ady: a great slam for n/s  here   they will do well to stop out|pg||
nt|newmoon: in OR NORTH played it in 2S - where 1@H - 1NT (showed a @S-suit)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: makes 11 with the fortunate diamond position|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pitiful:  5@c looks best spot|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they will need to lead a @s|pg||
nt|xenya: not a bad 5@C here -- but EW in OR gailed to reach it after the same start|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|xenya: *failed|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
nt|santyclz: I saw this board in another room, e-w bid to the 5 level and paid the price.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pitiful:  tough for david here|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  a very good contract    fails here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N however looks hopeless on any lead -- providing NS defend correctly afterwards|pg||
nt|pfbr: on a @d lead there are 9 tricks arent' there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: oh yes, sorry|pg||
nt|pfbr: luckily david didn't :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so a great lead by N -- only to lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|idc: I'd guess that 2NT must be conventional there, not an uncommon treatment|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|puncher: yes and 3@H is minimum with 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Double for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: or win the same amount|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: which is only fair|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Lindsay thinks it may go down if partner leads a heart|pg||
nt|idc: It's right in that a heart is an attractive lead for defence, wrong in that there are 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|puncher: i have to say it's one of my favourite toys - helpful for finding best game or staying out of a poor one|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|puncher: North will be miffed that this one can't go off|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, some of us build our whole game on reaching poor games|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Last board of the set now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  last board here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Got a trump lead and s shifted to the @d on winning the @c ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: That seems normal|pg||
nt|puncher: Last board so thanks to all for your patience with the dodgy connections|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Many thanks to Melanie Thomas, our excellent operator. Tough conditions|pg||
nt|idc: 4 IMPs but that just takes Scotland to 52 IMPs, still 23-7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and to our commentators, Sam and Ian|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: yes    5 unlcuky    spade lead   clubs 3-0   and east doubleton diamond   so in fact Ireland did well to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: good job, thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Hi Anto, it's Laura but I can't talk because I'm BBO op|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: That room also got to 3@s on this in a multi mixup.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|idc: East was hoping for an entirely different sort of auction when he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Something from partner, 3@c from him I expect, showing weak hand with long suit|pg||
nt|idc: If dbl is takeout, he'll bid 4@c and then West will have the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Double is a bit dangerous as you must expect to get 4@C from partner now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: now waht does North do?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yorkbeach:  strange choice by East in both rooms|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, E supported diamonds at his first turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Once bitten ...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I thought choice was 1Nt or X|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree, but that did make things easier for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H looks just about right here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: goes for it :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H now? or 3@S? or something else?|pg||
nt|xenya: not 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If you bid again (I think you should), I prefer 3@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pitiful:  3n a real shot from david|pg||
nt|ady: thin 3NT    will not make|pg||
nt|pitiful:  upgraded his pips |pg||
nt|pitiful:  might now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what is @s 8 lead from|pg||
nt|ady: yes    if he gets this right|pg||
nt|ady: would be a lucky swing |pg||
nt|pitiful:  this will be a big board in the march|pg||
nt|pitiful:  match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: No, it's a bit lily-livered|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1 or 4, I agree.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Will he take the push now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ady: might go down 2 trying heart finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: Hope you all enjoyed this set!   :)     Thanks to BBO for making this VUgraph available to us.  Even poor souls in South Africa can attend now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Scotland can afford to lose 5 IMPs and still stay at 23-7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is overstating the hand in my opinion|pg||
mb|d|mb|5C|nt|idc: North will surely have some of this|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  might make if no @c switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
nt|puncher: kind of inviting the double here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|idc: and this for his second course :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: that was quick -- it seems 3N could be made by squeezing N|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: 1730 restart|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: i guess that's no longer 23-7...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: I think NS have just turned a top into a bottom |pg||
nt|mdgraham: can now manage a club ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|idc: They can afford 11 and only drop to 22-8, but could be worse perhaps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|dT|nt|ady: this will put england further ahead    but they have 2 potential bad results not yet scored|pg||
nt|xenya: well stopped -- actually if E had 4 diamods he probably should bid 5|pg||
nt|puncher: shame to slip a bit at the last hurdle but still a good win for Scotland|pg||
