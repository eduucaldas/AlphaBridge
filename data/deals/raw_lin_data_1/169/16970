nt|mcarroll: So it is Precision versus Blue Club at this table|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
nt|lestergold: Engel refused to be sunject to indignity of endplay!|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello all!|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back everyone .. i guess we've missed 17 as the connection settled down|pg||
nt|dagold: Nice lead|pg||
nt|ady: last tricks not shown   but down 2   so 2 trump tricks were lost|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|dagold: 3@h might steal it|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
nt|dburn: this might not play all that well|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
nt|dagold: even a heart lead won't beat this as the spade is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes connection problems here keeps crashing|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  South doubles to show that he had a very good 2NT bid, North has nowhere to go|pg||
nt|ady: Caroll decided on a penalty  rather than try 3NT  |pg||
nt|ady: this will cost plenty|pg||
nt|dburn: very sensible, even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: w does not expect pard to make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Evening|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: This room will have severe connection problems|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Ns time?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare may have difficulty developing his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mcarroll: declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: no matter, E saved them|pg||
nt|dburn: if the defenders can force declarer to play clubs himself, this looks down about five|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts we assume|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mmm interesting|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S always need to have a semi inside.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hi all|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime has an absolute HIROSHIMA!|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|steshome:  Potential loss for England on board 17|pg||
nt|steshome:  Sad to say|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S on    difficult to reach|pg||
nt|ady: will do well to get out for 800|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: still, it isn't easy to defend perfectly in this kind of situation|pg||
nt|ady: do not want to over do shortening declarer |pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: therer isa lot of thism about these days|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not start with a high heart?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|the saint: Can be difficult to get across hands with thatmany HCP|pg||
nt|galadriel: good shot|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: seems u were dealt that to lead but as it happens 2 off whatever|pg||
nt|paulg:  Most of the cards are marked for Matheson, so he will be planning how to endplay South to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|the saint: That is one way. Was 2NT in that sequence 25+ or a specific range?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But now may duck second Heart to set up the King|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If he plays Diamonds he has enough of a count to place S with a doubleton Heart|pg||
pc|dK|nt|steshome:  Ah A downside of Kokish|pg||
nt|dburn: now, for example, South may have to play a trump or blow a trick, and that's difficult|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||
nt|jcomyn: honestrly i dont see the point|pg||
nt|lestergold: often tho achieves right siding contracts|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi mike and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ruud|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i know about right siding but why not protect the Ck and those queens|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pdjourdain:  Denning has four spades to cash so Micheal looking ahead|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  If scores remain as now Eng & Rep lead on 117 with Wales on 116|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mcarroll: light opening  helps EW keep Wales out of a making 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well i wasnt referring to this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards for all pairs are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|steshome:  South is Norman Selway btw|pg||

nt|ady: good slam|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: but othe odds are that the opening bidder is the stronger hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|the saint: With all the bangers and a solid 9 card fit, the hand was pulling extra. Some risk of missing grand, but could that be bid with confidence if it were there?|pg||

nt|chick: 5@C could have made on the good lie of the cards, but more than likely EW would have sac'd at 5@D, so not much difference|pg||
nt|chick: 5@DX-2  = a few imps|pg||
nt|yke:  I was in a partnership with steven den donder a few years ago, We played in holland in the "meesterklasse" |pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice card fit EW|pg||
nt|yke:  he is a very creative player with a tendency to overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: this table will have connection problems|pg||
nt|dagold: with a possible side entry the club King looks reasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: missed all bidding with the internet problems sorry|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi (again) David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mikeirl: would be better if the table didn't keep closing :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|lestergold: bridge is a very young game and new bidding ideas are being tested every day|pg||
mb|d!|an|C+H|nt|jcomyn: oh dont be so modest|pg||
nt|dagold: and would expect east to bid 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  I think they are the favorites in this final|pg||
nt|rodal f: So system for EW is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as Donder and u Yke?|pg||
nt|yke:  I;m not sure|pg||
nt|chick: E probably has a 2-suiter bid available, but would you use it Vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, that looks reasonable alright|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yke:  ofcourse you would, I think now 2@H means hearts an a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: vul and nice 11HP now.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: e/w should reach game   but if 3NT may well go down|pg||
nt|dagold: assume north opened 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  ah ok, 2NT means hearts + clubs, they play multi defence|pg||
nt|steshome:  I love North's double|pg||
nt|ady: was as expected   800|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: That was hard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT with 1@c always promising at least 3|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has a chance   but can go down to a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dagold: cleary this isn't right specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  I'm informed by a specatator that 2NT means a strong two suiter with a minor|pg||
nt|steshome:  Thin spade game missed - likely to be missed at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Uttam Gupta|pg||
pc|d7|nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems a normal way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and good eve all|pg||
nt|ady: no game making if defence right with 26 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: dummy amuses everybody|pg||
pc|d8|nt|steshome:  No game makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W has a lead problem|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: aand now the polish club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 3NT by W would have been better|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hi there|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Uttam welcome|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and ty|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s seems normal contract |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 3@H=invit for 4 in @D or @H since a M and a MIN?|pg||
nt|yke:  he could have overcalled 2@H which would be 5 hearts + 4+ minor|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: Y. Capp|pg||
nt|yke:  so he was thinking if he could afford to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|steshome:  Seriously though chaps, don't you think that doubling on the North hand is winning bridge?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If he finds the @S switch the contract goes down|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, the Italians seem to think so|pg||
nt|mcarroll: otherwise the @Hs can be set up for @S discards|pg||
pc|s4|nt|galadriel: and who would argue with them :)|pg||
nt|ady: declarer will play on diamonds   and likely play low from west  to cater for sing. ace with north|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good morning all|pg||
nt|ady: should just lose 2 more tricks  1 heart and 1 spade|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Hi all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|steshome:  West eschewed leading clubs|pg||
nt|galadriel: @C opener steering Sime away from his 5 carder lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||
nt|the saint: Byrne (North) is forever telling the U20s to double on those hands. Playable in 3 suits. |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|paulg:  i'd prefer the double with an extra diamond and one less club|pg||

pc|s7|nt|steshome:  Aye, just the 11|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Spears/Murdoch play 15-17 1NT too, so I doubt that they'll be in game |pg||

nt|steshome:  It's my keyboard|pg||

nt|rodal f: Last was interesting. Never used it my self.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Possible gain there for England, if played by West hand|pg||
nt|galadriel: on a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: a lot play like that but they do it well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n;x can make 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell might bid 2@h here|pg||
nt|ady: n/s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: minus 2 becoming a habit|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Two trumps and a singleton - I suppose a reasonable rasie|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|jcomyn: is it all artificial then|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u bid suits that u havent got to show what u have got it does make it difficult for opps|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I'd open W hand with 2@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: But how commond by other variants u know better Yke.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another strong club opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Think we may be in for a bumpy ride|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|lestergold: because their bids often become ambiguous is double for takeouit or showing the suit thats been bid etc....|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Hello et Bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|steshome:  I am confident that England can bid this game |pg||
nt|paulg:  this would be a good time for Matheson to bid 2@d ...|pg||
nt|ady: there is a complication with 4@S     |pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Oh my - North is going to struggle to get his spades across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and put a Pass card on Sime's side of the bidding tray for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell is going to bid 2@H this time|pg||
nt|steshome:  And North will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: if north plays 4@S   and east leads J@D    west will have to duck|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|ady: has chosen the unbeatable  contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it does not seem to matter where the Camrose is held, there are often connection problems in the first session ... very frustrating for the vugraph operators|pg||
nt|steshome:  Nice vulnerable save from the Scots|pg||
nt|paulg:  good pressure bidding|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: I agree with problems|pg||
nt|steshome:  So easy to find|pg||
nt|paulg:  Byrne definitely thinking he has an RHO, LHO and CHO at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: if east leads a club or heart should north play 4@S   dont think it can be made|pg||
nt|the saint: There are no screens in the Camrose - am I right?|pg||
nt|steshome:  He might've done better to rebid 2@S at his second turn|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might hve to bid bid 6@s to end all confusion|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: screens in use|pg||
nt|ady: now 10|pg||
nt|mcarroll: indeed |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jcomyn: sort of mixture of  Walsh, martens, carrot and ekrons|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But you have the vital intermediates in the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said i would open it for that reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Ah OK, makes this hand easier for the players.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Twelve tricks with the clubs behaving. 1Nt showing 18-20|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1@S control showing|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|paulg:  it's not a save is it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes it is :)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: it is now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it would not surprise me if Bell is still thinking|pg||
nt|steshome:  Not sure about the 4@h bid - seems a bit previous - horrible hand to play now|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be made if playing carefull as 9@S comes down   so can plat spades from the top and later discard a diamond on a heart   lose 2 spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@H sounded like he has longer hearts to me. 2@H seemed more descriptive. Partner was still in the game.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i still prefer my initial 2@h over 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  5@d looks cold on any lead, declarer just established the hearts|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye|pg||
nt|the saint: I would be surprised if they didn't have that agreement.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: doesnt that 7 make it difficult fo s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not that it matters|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we stuck or something|pg||
nt|steshome:  Connection problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes sorry but connection crashing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have gone beyond 3NT which makes because the @H finesse an 3-3 brek produces 4 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|uttam: y i think ,now a days most would open 2s w/west hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: jT empty i wouldnt|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|ady: 4@S  interesting    might well be the contract OR    as they lay  will likely make as defence cannot profitably attack clubs    and west has a useful holding in hearts combined ...|pg||

nt|yke:  and also bid 2@H after 1@S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: me too, it is not a close decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|chick: I can't see bidding over 1@D vul with 3 queens, but after the balance, I might try 2@H (because I have the doubleton spade as backup)|pg||
nt|the saint: Apparently they definitely have that agreement|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|jcomyn: another trensfer i assume|pg||
nt|chilloncan: multi or weak 2 with 7 card suit is highly controversial. personally i loathe the idea, but many successful players will do it freely according to their judgment. one such case is ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 7222 and/or vul. personal decision|pg||
nt|dagold: doubt this is right either|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  i expect West is going to bid 2@s after East's reopening double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|uttam: red hence 2h|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ady: e/w will reach a thin game once east opens|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2@h was going for probably 800|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Prefer 1@H. Still chances of game opp passed partner|pg||
nt|chick: I'm with you, Marshall, weak 2 bids and weak 3 bids are much more different than just the one extra trump|pg||
nt|galadriel: The old problem of whether to open 1 of major or 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Bergen raise presumably, 4+ trumps and 10-11?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: shrug of shoulders from E|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes good bergin|pg||
pc|sA|nt|2hplus4: 2@H worked well here|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Interesting action by Towers. Holding a five card suit doesn't want to play against the room|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcomyn: seems to assume 1C is not clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we'll be here until tomorrow at this rate|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: 2N was asking, and 3@C showed a poor weak 2 bid in hearts|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder if any point in steyin here|pg||
nt|uttam: but i think east had one more bid|pg||
nt|ady: might get a club lead|pg||
nt|ady: that helps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: connections still awful - will be having problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: I really need a drink!|pg||
nt|ady: 9 on a club lead    3 clubs   2 diamonds     4 major suit tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|2hplus4: Perhaps he should have opened 2NT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: not only 19 but extras for all 4 bullets and 5 card suit |pg||
nt|steshome:  Declarer doesn't know he has 3 clubs though|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17 flat    3NT -1  at this table    6@C-1 in open room|pg||
nt|steshome:  Extraordinary|pg||
nt|ady: if south avoids the club lead  3NT might fail    could lead a spade|pg||
nt|steshome:  Partner is marked with 5+ hearts though|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|uttam: 2s pass was speculation|pg||
nt|the saint: I don't think it is remotely close with that suit quality|pg||
nt|steshome:  Is it a problem on a 5-2-2-4?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson will always opened 1@s when holding clubs too, so he can use Gazzilli|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah yes, easier if playing G|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson knows that Selway only has five hearts for his overcall, so will have most of the remaining points|pg||
nt|the saint: If matheson ruffs this, a 4th round of @H will establish South's trump length. Might do well to discard @D here.|pg||
nt|the saint: Especially if as Paul suggests he can work out AQ are offside|pg||
nt|steshome:  Interesting link to a commentary from Liz McGowan provided by a spec event:http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/the-camrose-trophy-2011-by-liz-mcgowan.html|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may discard as there is little hope of avoiding two diamond losers when South has AQ, with no real endplay prospects|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|lestergold: of course for money players like me its anathma not to play in no trumps|pg||

nt|chick: you are not bidding it because you think you will make it ... preempts are for a different reason|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: I'll correct scores shortly -|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chilloncan: for me, it is about the GOALS of preemption, which is to get in the opponents' way. that means a 3H bid is more effective than 2H. you aren't that likely to end in 3HX, and if you ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: do it may be only a small loss (or a gain) against a game they can bid and make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: exactly :)|pg||

nt|dagold: tricky to play as not convenient entries to play on spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not for me why hide the d suit|pg||
nt|uttam: bad break, has to be well conducted|pg||
nt|yke:  if you open 3@H with hands like this, and also with a KQJxxxx plus a king, 3@H will be to wide ranged|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was time for a X at N|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: might as well duck this as not clear what to do had he won it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  or maybe 1NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: N/S surely will reach and make 3n|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sell all bids u don't open at the MOL?|pg||

nt|ady: 1@H  transfer response  showing spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzzd: tried deceptive spade play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  Sime just has to avoid a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: shrug of shoulders 6H|pg||
nt|paulg:  and holding an ace that should not be difficult|pg||
nt|steshome:  Undisciplined|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think Iain will lead a spade|pg||
nt|dagold: did he really duck the second club?|pg||
nt|dagold: hard to believe|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my point is why not explore the possibility of 6d and stop in 5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: 5 can go off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not safe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whov was it said clubs disappeared 10 years ago and diamonds are on the way out.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love unsafe contracts if there is a smell of a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think this combined 26 count with 8 card @d fit and the rest of thehand misfitting is one to explore for slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: however caution i.e. un derbidding would be rewarded today|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a viable opinion, but again it goes back to the main goal of preempting. if we are doing it mainly to get in the opponentss' way, then a wider range is BETTER than a narrow ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: range -- we will get to do it more often, and when they opops play the contract they will have a harder time reading the layout|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: i dont think it makes even double dummy|pg||
nt|uttam: qx aqjxx kxx xxx , bidding will likely go the same way?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May go for 1  of 2 finesses. Or to discard @C on @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so worst scenario needing 2 out of 3 finesses i think this was a normal slam to bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|uttam: of course all north will bid the slam ,after they hear south open 1h|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u when east ruffs in on the third round of @ds there is still play left in the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can play on clubs|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I think he'll discard @C and go for cross ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and at least one club will take care of a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe it can be made after all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With K@S falling he may make this|pg||
nt|uttam: depends on trick 1|pg||
nt|yke:  it's generally a good idea not to let your opponents play at the one level in a suit, unless you suspect they have a better fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT or X there. What give ure pard best freedom?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nt feels as a order and a X ure pard give the advice|pg||
nt|yke:  ith such a flat hand, i would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as Terence Reese always said, the more narrowly a preempter's hand is defined, the less effective a weapon it is  ("a dull swrod" was his phrase)|pg||
nt|chick: The idea of not let opps play at the 1 level depends a bit on the auction, I think.    1@D P P ?   is not the same situation as   1@D P 1@H P 1@S P P ?|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rodal f: X for me. Free my pard to say his/here meaning.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: in any case club lead defeats 5@d as you cannt ruff spade losers without running into adverse club  ruff|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: boy bridge would be a very dull game if we only played in safe contracts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: well he wasnt ever going to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: now is critical point|pg||
nt|chilloncan: true, chick, but the original comment said "unless you may think they have a better fit", so the second of your sequences would not really apply to the scope of that remark as they ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: have bid 3 suits.|pg||
nt|yke:  well actualy 2 suits, since 1@C can be short|pg||
nt|chick: still different is    P P 1@D P 1@H P P ?|pg||
nt|steshome:  Diamond lead easy to avoid IMO - he's looking at what must surely be the only missing ace|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  the @c2 will tell Matheson the club situation, which will relieve some stress|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6@c cold|pg||
nt|paulg:  seems to be a testing set for North-South|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades for n/s|pg||
nt|petergill: Still, 110 is a sound result for EW. |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Very - club switch from N|pg||
nt|petergill: NS are topping the datums so far this weekend in the Camrose. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: reaching it is another matter|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so weill it be bid or play in a safe 3nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: im on tis hand|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I would overcall as West|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT   for e/w|pg||
mb|2S!|an|C|nt|ppiglett: They topped the Datum for the Europeans after Day 3 as well. They are playing very well at the moment. However the Captain didn't want to put them in against England yesterday ...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: evening?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north needs to find out if south has K@d basically even then 6@c may be a punt|pg||
nt|uttam: normal 4h contract here for n/s|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't want to defend all day|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|chilloncan: does the panel all brebid 1N as S?|pg||
nt|yke:  on this hand, you can make 6@S, but it's not a good contract|pg||
nt|chilloncan: rebid|pg||
nt|chick: yes|pg||
nt|yke:  but its not easy to avoid once North knows his partner has 3spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: 2S - a club transfer|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chilloncan: well, N has pretty bad spade quality. he is going to need some very chunky trumps from S, and S ought to realize he does not have them.|pg||
nt|chick: I don't raise with only 3, although some people do.   Not if there is a better choice, and here 1N is better|pg||
nt|dagold: A vry agressive double |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzd: S lead simplifies this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: With @DQJx dropping, 3@C should make fairly easily. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|chilloncan: and it should be relatively easy to get S to focus on spades as the big question mark|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been many hands by a lot quest "how to handle it" I love those but go for the specs from beginners and up. All with.|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H is a relay to 2@S, showing 5+|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|yke:  I raise with a 3 card when I have a wirthless doubleton|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulg:  Selway might have considered 3@c over the double, but all routes seem to lead to 4@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Later in the play, North could try a minor diversion of dropping a diamond honour on @DA if he wants to. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yke:  worthless|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chilloncan: a very reasonable criterion|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzyn: Sorry all seems we have bad connection :(|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@d i believe did show a @d stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if theyb reached this sciebtifically its impressive|pg||
nt|lestergold: although i think most red bloodded bridge players would bid 6@c with north's hand alm,ost regardless|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats wha\t i am saying|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi all back hope the laptop stays on..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and s could have HQ|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Play to ruff hearts and lose two trumps and two hearts.|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS switch to trumps, East needs to set up the long @d while he still has an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Indeed|pg||
nt|petergill: The trumps swtiih looks ugly looking only at the North and West cards, but we can see it is an OK thing to do|pg||
nt|petergill: switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Current scores are found by scrolling down at http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Camrose-best-current5.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: Butler Scores for this weekend are at http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ButlerRanks3.txt|pg||
nt|petergill: Same bidding at other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Padraig is doing well to give this a very long think|pg||
nt|petergill: The club switch from AJx into Kxx is almost impossible to find, without (like us) looking at all 52 cards - then declarer needs to play @D before dummy's last entry is gone|pg||
nt|petergill: and on @DA, North might play a @d honour to try to confuse declarer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Not so sure Peter. North knows that E is 1-4-2-6 and wants to ruff hearts. It is therefor attractive, playing E not to hold the A of diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Privat chatroom Cornelia and Yke? Or me to find mine?|pg||
nt|rodal f: WE ARE HERE TO HELP SPECS!!!|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 2N showed 5 spades and slam interest|pg||
nt|ppiglett: And therefore need to play trumps not to beat the contract|pg||
nt|petergill: Low club in case partner has bare queen?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: so 4@S is obviously a shutdown, and rightfully bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  N/S bid the spade game on 20 in the other room.  Likely loss for England :(|pg||
nt|ady: cue bid their way to the 5 level      still not too high|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell wondering about 6@c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: although E/W were always facing endplay problems|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzzd: thought long and hard before 5S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  Good stop, hard to believe partner does not have a diamond control|pg||
pc|d2|nt|2hplus4: Thanks to trump promotion he needs@H finesse now|pg||

pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: Yes the last set was also very mundane|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chilloncan: i agree that S is minimum, but sometimes slam depends on WHICH (type of) minimum you hold. depending on what the full range of options is for S over 2N, i might or might not agree ...|pg||

nt|ady: 6NT   will certainly make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 15 tricks on a non Spade lead|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 10 red suit tricks available   so only 2 club tricks needed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chilloncan: one can organize rebids over 2N so that minimums can be included with an economical bid. but it requires a lot of memory for the system|pg||
nt|ady: maybe a longish auction ending in 6NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: and back to the auld 3nt|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW  play weak 2s in this position|pg||

nt|petergill: South has a four and a half spade bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not single dummy it won't|pg||
nt|rodal f: S try at least. 2@D=major|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: 4 and three quarter even|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: a need for conservatism on part of e/w but i think a heart barrage will propel them to indiscretion|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand   either 1NT  or 2@D  e/w|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: 3@D=same|pg||
nt|chick: 3@D = take your choice|pg||

pc|dT|nt|lestergold: double well judged|pg||
nt|2hplus4: It's for take out surely|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 4@S automatic with E|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|uttam: ask p ,to do some thing intelligently|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a less memory intensive version has cheap rebids showing doubtful trump quality, as that is one of the primary  issues for slam in a 53 fit|pg||
nt|ady: North contesting a 2nd time|pg||
nt|ady: south wont be too happy|pg||
nt|dagold: I like the 1@s opener but here it is leading to a minus score|pg||
nt|petergill: Given that the 4@h bid at equal vulnerability makes partner likely to have singleton or void @h, yes, four and three quarters, you're right.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Known singleton/void H. Therefore with Kxxx, x, Axxx, Axxx - 6 is a good shot. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: i dont agree witgh north's 4@h with thse hands i like to bid 3@hs and give opps space to do the wromg thing|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes - looked like just a @D and @S loser|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 6@H as it has gone|pg||

nt|2hplus4: I like the whole auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well east with massive defence has decided to do wrong thing in any case|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: yes but that D9 is useful|pg||
nt|uttam: east can contribute in defence only|pg||
nt|lestergold: east would probably stretch to bid 3@s over 3@h and west would have bid 4|pg||
nt|the saint: 5@C was paying.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: And take ure -1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: "enterprising" is a word straight from the BBO VuGraph Commentator's Manual|pg||
nt|chick: anyone know the right way to play the heart suit?|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you think 5@s would be reasonable by South over 4@H?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|ady: not everyone would raise to 4@H with west hand   would normally expect more than 2 card support|pg||
pc|h4|nt|boedhy: offcourse he can now make it by finessing in @d but he doesnt have a count yet|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|2hplus4: No He has 3 trumps and 3 tricks All cards should be working for @S|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@d looks like it is making for East-West on this hand|pg||
nt|ady: around 150 to e/w    neither able to double with confidence   |pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  although hard to see how they get into the auction over 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: sorry from sime|pg||
nt|galadriel: Very difficult for East|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is certainly not going to make - but how many undertricks? it is probably difficult for the defenders to realise their @S strength|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: presumably the double shoows values why panic and bid 4@s at these colours take a safe penalty|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: your points i daresay|pg||
nt|boedhy: funny now he has. South has 4@s 2@h (form the bidding) and probably 4@c....|pg||

pc|cK|nt|lestergold: if u are making 4@s what is happening to 4@h?|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|jcomyn: 4h and a little bit of work|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: this should not be too taxing for Neil|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, but perhaps South's 1NT at this suitable vulnerability in 3rd seat was partly to try to "preempt" EW out of any spade contract?|pg||
nt|petergill: EW make 3@S (I think), so minus some 50's in 3NT is no disaster|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yes fair point |pg||
nt|petergill: Even 4@d might make if the defence doesn't switch to @d in time|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S I mean|pg||

nt|chilloncan: 5C is an extremely practical contract. chances of a trump lead are small, and even then a squeeze is likely|pg||

mb|p|nt|steshome:  Another swing in, you meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it needs to be specific heart k so would 5@h show that|pg||
mb|1C|nt|uttam: but east could have bid 4d cue,on 3s to hear 4h cue from p, then bid 4nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Depends on their agreements|pg||

mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Even @DK is likely to be enough |pg||
nt|chick: I'm told the XX showed hearts|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well my remark was that 5C is a good practical contract. i would far rather be hoping for good news in 5C than playi ng 4C|pg||
nt|chilloncan: especially when i know the opponent holding my cards in the other room will be trying to pick up 40 IMPs in a very short time|pg||
nt|yke:  yes, stopping in 4@C on a dime sounds too impractical for me|pg||
nt|ady: defence need a diamond switch quickly or this may slip through|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i agree with the 6H call. S could be stronger for sure, and there is play even off 2 aces|pg||
nt|yke:  strange north didnt ask for aces|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yke:  maybe because of the state in the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes that's what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: last hand  e/w have 10 tricks in diamonds   could be useful part swing score for the Irish|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: would you balance with south??|pg||
nt|jcomyn: noooooo|pg||
nt|steshome:  So, would you make a two suited overcall on the East hand? |pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, if i could|pg||
nt|paulg:  but it has worked out well for Matheson without one|pg||
nt|paulg:  they cannot show the black suits over 1@d|pg||
nt|steshome:  Only because his partner raised spades in a sequence that could have been 4-6|pg||
nt|the saint: Holding the spade suit you are always under less pressure. Because you can always come over the top|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might have doubled 2@s with 4-6|pg||

mb|p|nt|uttam: 4s here|pg||
nt|yke:  will east git this right?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i disagree. he needs a swing, so the last thing he wants is to push the board, what is exactly what KC would achieve|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|chick: Looks like you were right, Marshall,  board 9, EW found 5@C|pg||

nt|galadriel: Yes, when you have so many HCP, partner may not re-open|pg||
nt|paulg:  I was thinking that you could be missing slam .. more of a concern at a reversed vulnerability|pg||

nt|petergill: I think it's 800 on perfect defence if 4@CX was passed, maybe 500. |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Spade lead would be a killer|pg||
nt|petergill: Even spade switch might be troubling, with shortage of entries to North hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: he must duck this...|pg||
nt|uttam: 2h .pass or correct|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i would pass in a flash with S hand. maybe N has already won a big swing with the 3N bid|pg||
