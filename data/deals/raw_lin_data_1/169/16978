nt|wilkinsona: with both major suit hooks wrong...|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Do you agree with pass ?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no, but seems to work this time|pg||
nt|dagold: A little suprised as Noramn is usually very sharp in these type of situations|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: just making|pg||

nt|idc: Yes, cruel if N-S bid it given the way the morning has started, so I'm rooting for them to stop in 5@s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: double game swing board 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 2@H should carry preference overtones|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psridhar: but @s break shd help|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In spite of slamy suggestions from a spec, WBU settle for game|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT for the black suits here - would not be everyone's choice but reasonable and has N shown this @D holding? |pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h was going to make|pg||

pc|d5|nt|spil: probably drifting 1 off|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dagold: so this is a good save |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: I am quite suprised Norman let that go--he wouldn't at money bridge.  4@S is a daft bid ---partner can double again then bid it |pg||
nt|dagold: would have been 800 if doubled|pg||
pc|d9|nt|spil: perhaps 2...but 3@C was likely to make so no disaster|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: Apropos of nothing, I noticed an advert for Ryanair in yesterday's newspaper which I liked|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am suprised that he dropped the Q@H offside on board 1--admtitedly the lead was not best|pg||
