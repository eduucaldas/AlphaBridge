nt|pdjourdain:  Welcome to second half of match|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Other table starts with Boards 30-32 so no results here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Denning-Shields play Precision so 1D meant 1 nothing!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: thats the irish spelling of michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: only making game bypASSED|pg||
nt|lestergold: cheeky barrage has done its damage|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Brussels|pg||
nt|rodal f: With Wald nr 4 might a full table:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Conelia and Frank|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and our operator, Frederic|pg||
nt|mcarroll: operator, are you sure of the bidding? Tom does not usually open a 3 card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: hands don't match those in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: just noticed when dummy went down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah that explains lots :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: its being checked out now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Cornelia u welcomed lady.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Evening all :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Micheal sitting East and Padraig West of the brothers|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: west had a serious problem too strong for 3@c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So it is Precision versus Blue Club at this table|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: and as we can see 41s a very sensible contract unfortunately not today|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9 tricks on top and now a real horror|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: 6-0 breaks not the way to spend sunday mornin|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: why did s not double - cant be takeout|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if 3nt not bid no way are bthey bidding 4nt kloen|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: had south passed with his pile of garbage bidding liekly woujld have been 2@d cue by west 2@s by east 3@c by west 3n by East|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: moral of the story......|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: await developments before jumping in|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 0f hearts coudl hardly cost|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Very odd, Micheal thought the double showed C+D as 1D meant nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: all leading to a "challenging" contract|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well i do not want to encourage too many raises with 3 to the J and out|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story is that putting a spoke in often works|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes backfires also|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not wait and see what opps do and then clobber bem|pg||
nt|lestergold: because what opps would have done here was ti get to laydown 3N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine playing in game in the opps weak suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed laydown 4N|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: might prove costly declarer could do with 5 heart tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: playing low on heart lead would work if south held Ten or Jack without the 8 it is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: ie setting up finesse position on next round but that would involve a guess- and north has led a heart in spite of the bid on his left|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence of course may well find it difficult not to give declarer a 9th  trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|lestergold: not obvious but best for defence to take 1d and return it|pg||
nt|lestergold: very tricky hand communcations not great for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jim Patrick|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hello there|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult for defence too south is worried about entry for the A@c in due course not easy to see that the 7@d is that entry eventually|pg||

nt|dburn: still, no great harm done, but...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  violates a well known rule|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
nt|lestergold: Engel refused to be sunject to indignity of endplay!|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello all!|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back everyone .. i guess we've missed 17 as the connection settled down|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  South doubles to show that he had a very good 2NT bid, North has nowhere to go|pg||
pc|c8|nt|steshome:  Evening|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Ns time?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: no matter, E saved them|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts we assume|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mmm interesting|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S always need to have a semi inside.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hi all|pg||
nt|the saint: Sime has an absolute HIROSHIMA!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|steshome:  Potential loss for England on board 17|pg||
nt|steshome:  Sad to say|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S on    difficult to reach|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: therer isa lot of thism about these days|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not start with a high heart?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|the saint: Can be difficult to get across hands with thatmany HCP|pg||
nt|galadriel: good shot|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: seems u were dealt that to lead but as it happens 2 off whatever|pg||
nt|paulg:  Most of the cards are marked for Matheson, so he will be planning how to endplay South to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|the saint: That is one way. Was 2NT in that sequence 25+ or a specific range?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|steshome:  Ah A downside of Kokish|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||
nt|jcomyn: honestrly i dont see the point|pg||

nt|boedhy: hi mike and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ruud|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i know about right siding but why not protect the Ck and those queens|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pdjourdain:  Denning has four spades to cash so Micheal looking ahead|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  If scores remain as now Eng & Rep lead on 117 with Wales on 116|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: light opening  helps EW keep Wales out of a making 3NT|pg||

nt|chick: 5@C could have made on the good lie of the cards, but more than likely EW would have sac'd at 5@D, so not much difference|pg||
nt|chick: 5@DX-2  = a few imps|pg||
nt|yke:  I was in a partnership with steven den donder a few years ago, We played in holland in the "meesterklasse" |pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice card fit EW|pg||
nt|yke:  he is a very creative player with a tendency to overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: this table will have connection problems|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: bridge is a very young game and new bidding ideas are being tested every day|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oh dont be so modest|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yke:  I think they are the favorites in this final|pg||
nt|rodal f: So system for EW is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as Donder and u Yke?|pg||
nt|yke:  I;m not sure|pg||
nt|chick: E probably has a 2-suiter bid available, but would you use it Vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  ofcourse you would, I think now 2@H means hearts an a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: vul and nice 11HP now.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: e/w should reach game   but if 3NT may well go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  ah ok, 2NT means hearts + clubs, they play multi defence|pg||
nt|steshome:  I love North's double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: That was hard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  both pairs play 5-card majors and a strong 1NT with 1@c always promising at least 3|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has a chance   but can go down to a diamond ruff|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yke:  I'm informed by a specatator that 2NT means a strong two suiter with a minor|pg||
nt|steshome:  Thin spade game missed - likely to be missed at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Uttam Gupta|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems a normal way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and good eve all|pg||
nt|ady: no game making if defence right with 26 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  No game makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W has a lead problem|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: aand now the polish club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 3NT by W would have been better|pg||
pc|d9|nt|2hplus4: Hi there|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Uttam welcome|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and ty|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s seems normal contract |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 3@H=invit for 4 in @D or @H since a M and a MIN?|pg||
nt|yke:  he could have overcalled 2@H which would be 5 hearts + 4+ minor|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Y. Capp|pg||
nt|yke:  so he was thinking if he could afford to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|steshome:  Seriously though chaps, don't you think that doubling on the North hand is winning bridge?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If he finds the @S switch the contract goes down|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, the Italians seem to think so|pg||
nt|mcarroll: otherwise the @Hs can be set up for @S discards|pg||
pc|cA|nt|galadriel: and who would argue with them :)|pg||
nt|ady: declarer will play on diamonds   and likely play low from west  to cater for sing. ace with north|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good morning all|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|steshome:  West eschewed leading clubs|pg||
nt|galadriel: @C opener steering Sime away from his 5 carder lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||
nt|the saint: Byrne (North) is forever telling the U20s to double on those hands. Playable in 3 suits. |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||

nt|chilloncan: Hello et Bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|steshome:  I am confident that England can bid this game |pg||
nt|paulg:  this would be a good time for Matheson to bid 2@d ...|pg||
nt|ady: there is a complication with 4@S     |pg||
mb|3D|nt|steshome:  Oh my - North is going to struggle to get his spades across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and put a Pass card on Sime's side of the bidding tray for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell is going to bid 2@H this time|pg||
nt|steshome:  And North will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: if north plays 4@S   and east leads J@D    west will have to duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
mb|4C|nt|paulg:  it does not seem to matter where the Camrose is held, there are often connection problems in the first session ... very frustrating for the vugraph operators|pg||
nt|steshome:  Nice vulnerable save from the Scots|pg||
nt|paulg:  good pressure bidding|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: I agree with problems|pg||
nt|steshome:  So easy to find|pg||
nt|paulg:  Byrne definitely thinking he has an RHO, LHO and CHO at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: if east leads a club or heart should north play 4@S   dont think it can be made|pg||
nt|the saint: There are no screens in the Camrose - am I right?|pg||
nt|steshome:  He might've done better to rebid 2@S at his second turn|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might hve to bid bid 6@s to end all confusion|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: screens in use|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: sort of mixture of  Walsh, martens, carrot and ekrons|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  it's not a save is it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes it is :)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZZD: it is now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it would not surprise me if Bell is still thinking|pg||
nt|steshome:  Not sure about the 4@h bid - seems a bit previous - horrible hand to play now|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be made if playing carefull as 9@S comes down   so can plat spades from the top and later discard a diamond on a heart   lose 2 spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@H sounded like he has longer hearts to me. 2@H seemed more descriptive. Partner was still in the game.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i still prefer my initial 2@h over 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  5@d looks cold on any lead, declarer just established the hearts|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye|pg||
nt|the saint: I would be surprised if they didn't have that agreement.|pg||

nt|vugraphzzd: yes sorry but connection crashing|pg||

nt|paulg:  this is not the worst slam in the world, just needing the diamonds to come in|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzzd: tried deceptive spade play|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  Sime just has to avoid a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: shrug of shoulders 6H|pg||
nt|paulg:  and holding an ace that should not be difficult|pg||
nt|steshome:  Undisciplined|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think Iain will lead a spade|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: my point is why not explore the possibility of 6d and stop in 5|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 can go off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not safe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whov was it said clubs disappeared 10 years ago and diamonds are on the way out.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love unsafe contracts if there is a smell of a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think this combined 26 count with 8 card @d fit and the rest of thehand misfitting is one to explore for slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: however caution i.e. un derbidding would be rewarded today|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a viable opinion, but again it goes back to the main goal of preempting. if we are doing it mainly to get in the opponentss' way, then a wider range is BETTER than a narrow ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: range -- we will get to do it more often, and when they opops play the contract they will have a harder time reading the layout|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: i dont think it makes even double dummy|pg||
nt|uttam: qx aqjxx kxx xxx , bidding will likely go the same way?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May go for 1  of 2 finesses. Or to discard @C on @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so worst scenario needing 2 out of 3 finesses i think this was a normal slam to bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|uttam: of course all north will bid the slam ,after they hear south open 1h|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u when east ruffs in on the third round of @ds there is still play left in the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can play on clubs|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I think he'll discard @C and go for cross ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and at least one club will take care of a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe it can be made after all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With K@S falling he may make this|pg||
nt|uttam: depends on trick 1|pg||
nt|yke:  it's generally a good idea not to let your opponents play at the one level in a suit, unless you suspect they have a better fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT or X there. What give ure pard best freedom?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nt feels as a order and a X ure pard give the advice|pg||
nt|yke:  ith such a flat hand, i would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as Terence Reese always said, the more narrowly a preempter's hand is defined, the less effective a weapon it is  ("a dull swrod" was his phrase)|pg||
nt|chick: The idea of not let opps play at the 1 level depends a bit on the auction, I think.    1@D P P ?   is not the same situation as   1@D P 1@H P 1@S P P ?|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: X for me. Free my pard to say his/here meaning.|pg||

nt|lestergold: in any case club lead defeats 5@d as you cannt ruff spade losers without running into adverse club  ruff|pg||

pc|c3|nt|lestergold: well he wasnt ever going to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: now is critical point|pg||
nt|chilloncan: true, chick, but the original comment said "unless you may think they have a better fit", so the second of your sequences would not really apply to the scope of that remark as they ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: have bid 3 suits.|pg||
nt|yke:  well actualy 2 suits, since 1@C can be short|pg||
nt|chick: still different is    P P 1@D P 1@H P P ?|pg||
nt|steshome:  Diamond lead easy to avoid IMO - he's looking at what must surely be the only missing ace|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  the @c2 will tell Matheson the club situation, which will relieve some stress|pg||

mb|p|nt|uttam: ask p ,to do some thing intelligently|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a less memory intensive version has cheap rebids showing doubtful trump quality, as that is one of the primary  issues for slam in a 53 fit|pg||
nt|ady: North contesting a 2nd time|pg||
nt|ady: south wont be too happy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: i dont agree witgh north's 4@h with thse hands i like to bid 3@hs and give opps space to do the wromg thing|pg||

nt|2hplus4: I like the whole auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well east with massive defence has decided to do wrong thing in any case|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: yes but that D9 is useful|pg||
nt|uttam: east can contribute in defence only|pg||
nt|lestergold: east would probably stretch to bid 3@s over 3@h and west would have bid 4|pg||

nt|rodal f: And take ure -1|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|boedhy: offcourse he can now make it by finessing in @d but he doesnt have a count yet|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|2hplus4: No He has 3 trumps and 3 tricks All cards should be working for @S|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@d looks like it is making for East-West on this hand|pg||
nt|ady: around 150 to e/w    neither able to double with confidence   |pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  although hard to see how they get into the auction over 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: sorry from sime|pg||
nt|galadriel: Very difficult for East|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|ady: 4 of either major for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: wrong vulnerability for e/w to sac in 5@D|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|uttam: good 6s for ew|pg||
nt|yke:  nice 8 card club suit, how high will he bid?|pg||
nt|yke:  probably 5@C now|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@C is give-up|pg||
nt|the saint: A plus position for England - who probably need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: opposite a strong NT, this could easily be a slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and as for smaller swings, pass is also the best way to achiever that too. for example, on that hand the auction would normally go 1D-P-1N-P-P, and NOW  he can reopen for the ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: majors, without having to worry about going to the 3 level. then NS go plus in 2H or on defense|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: 4h and a little bit of work|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand here 9 tops in 3n available but 4@h can be defeated by trump lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: except for the fact n has two natural leads|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: presumably 3C is forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not that often Cornelia. Give my for Yke.|pg||
nt|yke:  probaby lebensohl, so 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C now is more than minimum|pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, make E's @DK into the @HK and 6@C makes|pg||

nt|chilloncan: 5C is an extremely practical contract. chances of a trump lead are small, and even then a squeeze is likely|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcomyn: h v clubs|pg||
nt|2hplus4: If partner has a king he shows it over ask|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shall I give up or shall WE try to give them?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|steshome:  Another swing in, you meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it needs to be specific heart k so would 5@h show that|pg||
mb|4C|nt|uttam: but east could have bid 4d cue,on 3s to hear 4h cue from p, then bid 4nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Depends on their agreements|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|yke:  you only have a squeeze on a trump conitnuation at trick two, not after a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3nt now i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: this should drift down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Even @DK is likely to be enough |pg||
nt|chick: I'm told the XX showed hearts|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well my remark was that 5C is a good practical contract. i would far rather be hoping for good news in 5C than playi ng 4C|pg||
nt|chilloncan: especially when i know the opponent holding my cards in the other room will be trying to pick up 40 IMPs in a very short time|pg||
nt|yke:  yes, stopping in 4@C on a dime sounds too impractical for me|pg||
nt|ady: defence need a diamond switch quickly or this may slip through|pg||
nt|ady: north likely to win and switch to J@D|pg||
nt|ady: Scotland  have built up a big lead|pg||

pc|cK|nt|boedhy: But now I think he made a dubious call|pg||
nt|lestergold: true but on bidding that is very unlikely|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What do the Belgians need to overcall at the 2 level. Where was N?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|paulg:  he'll be feeling more confident with the ace of clubs onside|pg||
nt|the saint: Still plenty of ways to play it - difficult hand to combine all your chances to best effect|pg||
nt|paulg:  may cash the ace of diamonds, heart to the king and ruff a diamond high|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|steshome:  Connection problems - sorry to the specs|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|chilloncan: i agree with the 6H call. S could be stronger for sure, and there is play even off 2 aces|pg||
nt|yke:  strange north didnt ask for aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  maybe because of the state in the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes that's what happened|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|boedhy: would you balance with south??|pg||
nt|jcomyn: noooooo|pg||
nt|steshome:  So, would you make a two suited overcall on the East hand? |pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, if i could|pg||
nt|paulg:  but it has worked out well for Matheson without one|pg||
nt|paulg:  they cannot show the black suits over 1@d|pg||
nt|steshome:  Only because his partner raised spades in a sequence that could have been 4-6|pg||
nt|the saint: Holding the spade suit you are always under less pressure. Because you can always come over the top|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might have doubled 2@s with 4-6|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h, sorry|pg||
mb|3D|nt|uttam: 4s here|pg||
nt|yke:  will east git this right?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i disagree. he needs a swing, so the last thing he wants is to push the board, what is exactly what KC would achieve|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|chick: Looks like you were right, Marshall,  board 9, EW found 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|chilloncan: double dummy this was cold after D lead, but declarer's line is very understandable|pg||
