mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: ...but 6 spades may be tricky|pg||
nt|idc: we'll try to get you names as we can - starts of matches are often rushed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..it looks to have handling probs, but the diamond ace is right..|pg||
mb|5H|nt|psridhar: when they bid slam on long suits it is often a 'tempo' game, so u make attacking leads|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is a no play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: the contract is really 6C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not surprised-W suggested 6C enroute to 6N ...and E imagined his pd has a 5 bagger-lack of unnderstdg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, hoped the original @C wasn't short, alas it was|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: mast play 2NT as 4 card support...|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, I certainly dont like the double|pg||
nt|idc: It'll mean your commentators will be impartial - since we don't know which direction the countries are sitting!|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: that can only help declarer..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: and this lead also...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: no great cost to either side just no gain here|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, a big decision for poor South to have to take this early in the morning|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|idc: I can barely put my slippers on the right way round, leading to a doubled slam way beyond me|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: This is an easy make now after south's giveaway|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: since i dont know the names, i can criticize the players freely for once..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess Scotland are E-W, took me ages to work that out|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|psridhar: need to tap E hand off a trump now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|idc: Now the dummy (with singleton spade) and declarer's line, are also screaming "trump lead"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence going well, back to trumps now..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psridhar: a @h ruff was needed|pg||
nt|psridhar: now may be 2 late|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|psridhar: now decl can ruff the @h, play @c king and ruff with @s J, back to hand with a trump and play @c as trump substitutes thru S|pg||
nt|idc: still time|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|cJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|psridhar: that @d king re entry is working against defense|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|c6|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|psridhar: thats the reason def shd not hv played @d earlier|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cunning 3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|idc: double dummy I suspect -2 was possible after 2nd trump but declarer's line and this result look normal|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: wd|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: done, should be a good one for Wei De|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|idc: restart in 15 mins, thanks for watching all|pg||
mc|7|nt|wilkinsona: yes, match about level so back shortly|pg||
