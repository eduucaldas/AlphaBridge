mb|2H|nt|garnetts: We are on catch up here it seems |pg||
nt|pitiful:  good morning|pg||
nt|dagold: Good afternoon Everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson is looking for a superaccept, otherwise will pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: light double from south   with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd guess sime/matheson|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson, in my eyes, easily the best Scottish pair this weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  Mesbur/Fitzgibbon, perhaps the most experienced pair at the event|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, half time scores: Wales 168; England 161; Ireland 161; Scotland; WBU; NI 104|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is aggressive when 3@s can be bid on that junk|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree - 4@S too optimistic here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anderson and Greenwood one of the most experienced pairs in the event|pg||
nt|paulg:  David Greenwood, known as jtr on BBO, is also a frequent vugraph commentator|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good morning all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Jim|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|pitiful:  how good is 6@s on say a trump lead|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 losers but I am not sure there are 9 winners|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pitiful:  assume opps have not bid|pg||
nt|ady: only 1 top loser in spades   but with spades 4-1  difficulties at the slam level|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i wonder what the real auction was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would not want to bid a slam single dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on these cards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  @h10 from Walker to show diamond interest|pg||
nt|puncher: Exciting time for Wales - when was the last time they won it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks Alan, of course we know international bridge players are hopeless with bridgemates|pg||
pc|d9|nt|puncher: Ireland will be looking for a big win here to nail the camrose - Wales and England also hoping for big wins - any of these three could win it|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have never won|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dagold: 3@c would have been close, perhaps struggling on a forcing game in spades|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  good duck by Norman?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: doesnt matter what he does does it?|pg||
nt|puncher: Even more exciting then|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|xenya: 4@H makes double dummy -- but it's a tall order|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: just drop the @HQ and guess clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: And if slightly strange things happen, even Scotland could still do it|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dagold: seems to be  atrick short|pg||
nt|puncher: But can they hold on to their current lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they will be very nervous, but even more so their supporters, NPC and sitting out pair|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  declarer should probably have played the @dJ there|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short would not lead small from the @dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  so he must have the @dK ... often right to play your middle honour of a sequence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: S could have doubled 3@H, showing a good hand, but the final contract would have been the same|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  Scotland can help themselves, and Wales, by keeping Ireland at bay|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|puncher: yes that's true - it's probaby the worst for the sitting out pair|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, halftime scores: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ireland 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||

nt|pitiful:  12|pg||
nt|puncher: Yes would nice for Scotland to hold onto, and even increase, their lead - though others might not agree :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|hK|nt|paulg:  N-S are playing 5-card majors, strong 1NT, like many in this event|pg||
nt|paulg:  E-W are playing Blue Club, probably the only ones to do that|pg||
mc|7|nt|paulg:  meanwhile Sime struggles along in 2@h|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|james_h: that was a mis quote of H S Thompson, it should be " When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro"|pg||
nt|galadriel: Short had a 2@D opener available to show weak with both majors, but decided he didn't really have both :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eamongall: James has a pile of good head wrecking Polish bridge books on his table at home |pg||

nt|spil: unfortunately for them it would seem to be non-making however|pg||

nt|ady: seems only 11 after all|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sensiblle result for e-w|pg||
nt|ady: looked like 12   maybe play not as it was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but are we sure not 12 operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Gold and Sid Ismail|pg||
nt|newmoon: hello all  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 off is not that bad considering |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Hi everyone! (again)|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not --  depending on defence|pg||
mb|1C|nt|2hplus4: Sound opening even though flat and 11 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: @d looser in end game I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d doesn't look like an acol 2|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Sid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @S suit worth more trhan one HCP|pg||
nt|puncher: Any weak NTs in the whole event? I'm a fan but others don't seem to be these days...|pg||
nt|paulg:  This is a clash of systems, with Precision Club against 'standard' here and Carrot Club against 'standard' in the other room ... part of the reason for lots of swings|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dagold: I would bid on Souths hand I must admit|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I just saw Scotland bid this to 6@S via Kokish relay |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are putting in contracts and leading and claim|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT  for n/s   no reall problems|pg||
nt|newmoon: me 2|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 3N -- whether E preempts or not|pg||
nt|paulg:  At least you approve the 4-card majors here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dagold: could make a game facing the right weak notrump type|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Some oftThe Northern Irish still play weak NT |pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|puncher: yes let's hope this match is as exciting as the last one|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might pass 1NT|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|puncher: Well I'd have opened 1@C before 1@S - except that it'd be a 1NT for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Tight game missed Declarer perhaps able to endplay S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker has been conservative holding three small clubs|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe 2@c is puppet to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the @sK surprisingly well positioned this will play well for declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: after a long weekend of watching it is good to have swingy boards to finish to keep us all awake|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would like to bid 2@s, but Sime has not shown any values|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s now is probably the bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
nt|puncher: now will do |pg||
mb|3D|nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: yes so should be a comfortable make |pg||
nt|puncher: west endplayed now|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  short conservative because his opener is minimum and they are non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: should scrape home|pg||
pc|dT|nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fairly comfortable as you have the @s10|pg||
nt|paulg:  might make an overtrick on this lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|2hplus4: Yes W quite conservative|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
nt|paulg:  cannot cost to put the @d8 in|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With S long in @C and @S declarer suspects @H A falling|pg||
pc|sK|nt|puncher: so if you lead a trump you should lead a low one here - declarer could have played the 8@D for the overtrick|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker and Short have a tendency to avoid thin games. They are often in the par contract but the trend is to bid these games and challenge the opponents to beat you|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||
nt|newmoon: plse stay tuned - we have a problem|pg||
nt|newmoon: will he make it tho?  has to hook @C10 after 2@Hs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: hoping for 3-3 split|pg||
mc|9|nt|paulg:  Short will be telling Walker to evaluate better and raise with his six count|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure Matheson will say that playing the @dK guarantees the contract, which is the prime objective at the end of a tough weekend|pg||
nt|puncher: absolutely|pg||

nt|idc: In the closed room, Mesbur's 1NT response to partner's dbl worked well when both spade honours in South|pg||

nt|james_h: X - p - 3N?|pg||
nt|galadriel: Very dificult now |pg||
nt|galadriel: X should be a game try?|pg||
nt|idc: West may double and East may leave it in or try 3NT - at this vul perhaps the latter|pg||
nt|idc: he won't like doing it but got to do something|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|idc: If West doesn't dbl (should just be strong, game try, suitable for defence) ... then I give up|pg||

nt|eamongall: short can bid 3NT now |pg||
mb|3N|nt|galadriel: well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: East did really well not to pass on his first turn, and his reward is a tough decision :)|pg||

nt|spil: so S has rather pushed them into this one|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yes, East made 2 good decisions on one board|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: Actually his hand is pretty reasonable for 3NT - fast Ace, Qx in partner's suit, @sQxx fine when South has bid them twice|pg||

nt|paulg:  they will open 1@c in the other room but probably get a similar result|pg||

nt|paulg:  2@s is an old fashioned Acol Strong Two|pg||

nt|paulg:  2@c is either natural, gf, or a good heart raise|pg||

nt|paulg:  Convention cards available at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2@d shows a minimum|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is the upside that you see all the bad bids and plays of everyone else|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Certainly prevented EW finding @C fit|pg||
nt|puncher: this is true and somewhat comforting for all of us watching them now! |pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  good bid by the Irish, 9 tricks even on a non-spade lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|puncher: with hearts breaking badly looks like one off|pg||
pc|d2|nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||

nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
nt|paulg:  something to be said for 2@c by Sime|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps 1NT?|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N for me I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even 1@s, but I'd like a better suit|pg||
nt|puncher: i certainly don't like pass but then I don't have many green cards in my box :)|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N at least has the advantage of getting the values across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and you do have somewhere to run|pg||
mb|2C|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an obvious defence perhaps|pg||
mb|d|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||

nt|cameron_1: bezerk might be a better word|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Cards lie well for slam here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
nt|puncher: seems a shame not to be able to bid those clubs!|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Sime reads my blog, so he knows my preference|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it is East thinking here|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree that 1@S would be fine with better pips|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play canape, so they often often a 4-card major rather than a longer minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when it is clubs, since they don't like that suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
nt|puncher: no difficulties for declarer here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||

nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
pc|dT|nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard to know if they can have a weak two in 4th, or an immediate two in 4th seat|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: again not an easy hand to handle|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|xenya: i have some difficulty counting the undertricks here |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|xenya: -3 as a spectator suggests? |pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: but landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|dagold: no 9 on the second round|pg||
pc|d8|nt|garnetts: must admit I would not have led a spade |pg||
nt|paulg:  both have prime cards and the breaks are very friendly|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|newmoon: now the @C gets ruffed|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen and Norman know this is  a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|2hplus4: Yes. A below par slam anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|xenya: or 4?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  declarer will take the heart finesse in an attempt to make the contract, not with any hope|pg||
nt|paulg:  and probably go two down|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|nt|dagold: so a likely swing to England|pg||
nt|paulg:  although he can count Sime's hand now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: bold but sensible double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, in that case n-s weren't robbed.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3@c shows a fit so Short might be tempted to bid on|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was thinking more of getting to the better game|pg||
nt|paulg:  which is probably 5@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime will just bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East will be on the spot ... and the one thinking now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  but West's pass is deafening|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Excellent grand slam in a balck suit here as long as they promise not to lead diamonds :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd prefer to double with the North hand rather than introduce that club suit, although it would complicate things later on|pg||
nt|paulg:  South a little fixed now and may just raise to 4@c|pg||
nt|puncher: hand for the bad 2N for south - to show a minimum opener with 6 diams|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think 3@h is likely with nothing in hearts when his partner has failed to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: South checking cards re the club bid|pg||

nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: rewiring tomorrow morning so should be back to normal|pg||
nt|dagold: unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: 9 tricks only, it seems on a @H lead, else 11|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like a bidding missunderstanding |pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 3N showed or was thought to show 4/4 M or something?|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway another 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: East will be relieved that west has four small hearts |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C puppet?|pg||
nt|newmoon: even so, 3N T a sign-off|pg||
nt|dagold: have seen 3N played as 4/4 majors|pg||
nt|dagold: in that structure 3@h= spades or no major|pg||
nt|newmoon: if 3@D = 1 or both 4xmajor, 4@D would ask for 4M|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT could be 3=3-4-3 hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 5 more imps to England on 21 for 620 to NI and 800 to England|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not sure of the wisdom of that|pg||
nt|paulg:  if the clubs were breaking then it would need accurate defence to beat 3NT, but when they are 3-1 Walker does not have the tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing our operator lost the play with the crash of the connection, always difficult in these circumstances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What causes all these crashes?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Poor phone connection?|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can imagine that everyone except Short taking their time on this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be the wifi in the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problems this weekend have all been in the closed room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that should be a consideration in future when considering venues|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect the signal strength is not great in that area of the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Part of the problem is the devolved nature of the adminstrators|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bridge Great Britain relies on the home unions|pg||
nt|paulg:  The home union typically asks a district to run the event|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but surely an audience of over 1000 should be considered|pg||
nt|paulg:  and each district ends up running an event every seven or eight years, so never has the experience|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not write it down and pass on the experience gained?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Because there is no-one co-ordinating it all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So all bridge in Britain is as badly run as the SBU?|pg||
nt|paulg:  he does not need two diamond finesses, but has the entries for them anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: matheson says should be stronger|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|garnetts: just claims 11 |pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Does this auction call for the lead of the highest card in your hand?  Lindsay doesn't think so.|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@d is probably keycard blackwood (kickback)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg:  with 4NT showing 2 keycards and no @cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i must admit that I thought this was the stronger form of weak raise|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pitiful:  9 or 10 tricks looks likely here|pg||

pc|sT|nt|dagold: this is ok on careful play|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is the problem with 3@C |pg||
nt|puncher: the dodgy connections are infectious|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short knows that it is on the club finesse, but his club intermediates are good.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the cards are very friendly and every chance of a gain|pg||
nt|paulg:  but eleven tricks nevertheless|pg||
pc|c8|nt|puncher: this will be a fortunate make for scotland but we've all been in worse :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think South might have just bid 5@C over 3@C since it would be a picture raise|pg||

nt|puncher: my dodgy connection is proving a little tiresome|pg||

nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||

nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||

nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||

nt|james_h: now the play|pg||
nt|spil: well done E ... but South suggesting 7 with his pass|pg||
mb|7S|nt|ahh: more insurance needed |pg||

nt|ahh: 8 @D anyone ?|pg||
nt|idc: Ireland lucky that @d lie as they do, so that was making, but sometimes at the table you can get a feel for whether opps will bid on|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eamongall: this is some filler for the evening |pg||
nt|james_h: more likely for declarer to try to pin the @dJ I think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|james_h: but I still think 7@s right|pg||
nt|ahh: show off |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|idc: spec gowdy made a good point to me: since East ended up willing to go to 7@s, why not try messing around by bidding, say, 4NT first time around?|pg||
nt|ahh: will try to set up @H|pg||
nt|idc: It isn't as though you expect 4@s to be passed out|pg||
nt|james_h: One spec not impressed with the pass of 4@s|pg||

nt|james_h: 6@s direct not unreasonable after 4 opened|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|xenya: good double by S|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Could he not read the @C pip for a second ruff?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but we would have been doubled|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, did he think his partner has raised on singleton king of hearts?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must be getting close to time trouble here, with five boards still to play|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3NT likely to make here|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be another multi auction and North will raise 2NT to 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @C lead needed|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Unlikely from W|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence may block the diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: which might give them another shot|pg||
nt|2hplus4: True and nothing declarer can do about it Is there?|pg||
nt|puncher: England have a big board lurking on their score card - they seem to have lots of plus scores, but again, not sure it's enough to give Wales a headache|pg||
nt|puncher: Ahh - this is more like it!|pg||
nt|puncher: Could be some fun here... |pg||
mb|4S|nt|puncher: pass by north and dbl by south?|pg||
nt|paulg:  deep finesse will be saying that 7@c by South is the contract|pg||
mb|5C|nt|2hplus4: It did seem rather strange|pg||
nt|puncher: to avoid the heart ruff|pg||
nt|paulg:  you can make 6@c by North even after a heart ruff, if you get the diamonds right|pg||
mb|5D|nt|xenya: 1@C?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'll boldly predict this won't be openned 1nt.|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: or it may die out on the 1 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h by s?|pg||
nt|wendle: AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
nt|puncher: 6@S a good save over 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i think it is a matter of what level you accept the spade sacrifice|pg||
mb|6C|nt|xenya: but the final contract is probably correct|pg||
mb|6S|nt|garnetts: North has done well to pass--I might well have bid |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even stranger|pg||
nt|paulg:  May be 2@d from West, weak with both majors|pg||
nt|puncher: welcome back all|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: East might also have just bid 3NT over 2@H unless he is really thinking six might be on |pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  3@c was pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: not the time to beak the transfer with 4@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2N was a @h raise|pg||
nt|newmoon: with 3-4-3-3, deduct a point = he has a minimum|pg||
nt|xenya:  looks like pass is missing here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson might have bid 5@s on the way there|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: well this is not the real auction of course |pg||
nt|paulg:  no, this is either the wrong auction or wrong board|pg||
nt|puncher: It's the best they can do|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: an odd choice with all that black suit cover --heart lead and spade switch beats it |pg||
nt|puncher: not the easiest of leads for south - trump likely|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  okay, i think this is close except that Soith opened 2@d multi|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We don't have a score on 26. Maybe our operator can enter it manually|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: greenwood has hopes on defence|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks ok with everything onside|pg||
nt|xenya: good, bold auction|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: 3@D by EW and a partscore of 2 @S in @S by NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice club position for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: the bidding will make sure that Erichsen gets the hearts right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|newmoon: even 2@H is precarious here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  west almost endplayed on the lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|sQ|nt|ady: a save for e/w in spades looks a bit difficult if the east hand gets forced early   but 5@D is ok    at most  500 if a sspade ruff is found|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|santyclz: That lead doesn't hurt.  Nor the shift.|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulg:  needed to lead a high heart to pin the 7 i think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Ka ching.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  as long as the defence does not broach diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker can establish a discard from each hand, but this does not help him|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: safety play by finessing|pg||
nt|newmoon: Declarer hopes that THEY will break @Ds for him|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 rather -- i didn't notice the @H10|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|paulg:  even if West switches to a diamond, Walker might fly with the king of diamonds because he was given a chance that he was not due|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|vugraphzzc: They didn't have 10 mins to spare|pg||
nt|paulg:  South showed 19-20 balanced and North passed the 5-card stayman response|pg||
nt|dburn: reasonable facing 19-20, I guess|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This auction is odd too|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Redouble = hearts|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4Hs|nt|wendle: open room of match 5c will remain open to announce official result (also on www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: unfortunately the rooms are not linked it seems, so we don't have the comparisons|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h is a transfer showing 4+ spades|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@H looked like a normal contract in the other room - but a bit tricky to make|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Pretty common nowadays|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|newmoon: @SA - then @S2 (for a club)... but gets ruffed|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s guarantees 4-card support and a minimum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: TD standing at the table with his arms crossed and tapping his foot?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Ew missed fit again Should they have come in?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Although NS not far from making 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Both would have considered it, given it is a known 8-card spade fit|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Would it really be too much to remind the next organisers of the Camrose to remember to check wifi connectivity at the proposed venue?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Given the time situation I guess we are lost again|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  possible to overstretch here .. i don't think you can make 6@h on a diamond lead or club lead with the 3-0 heart break|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk7: Sime's double is support, 3 hearts|pg||
nt|paulg:  9 tricks here on the club finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Anyone for a bid with Murdoch's cards or too light for you?|pg||
nt|puncher: not everyone would overcall 1@H here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson have taken a very forward approach this weekend, it has been noticeable|pg||
nt|puncher: north will show a constructive 4card raise?|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@c is strong of cource|pg||

mb|3H|nt|paulg:  so i don't think constructive raises are part of the system|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pitiful:  should get @d right after the overcall|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@S = weakish, 3@C will be a good raise in @S|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course, Walker and Short have to start bidding at some point|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Walker will double this|pg||
nt|puncher: the 2N is a little joke by west?|pg||
nt|puncher: dbl by south for take out here|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the opponents passed over 2NT, you think West wishing he'd just bid 4@h immediately now?|pg||

nt|paulg:  Thanks Alan|pg||
nt|puncher: yes sry I forgot about the strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: North took a view to ignore the @h's|pg||
nt|idc: The Scottish lead is 46 IMPs at the moment, which converts to 22-8 in Victory Points|pg||
pc|h9|nt|santyclz: It's worth taking an extra minute or 2 in slams and x'd contracts.  He went from +1 to -(2 I think) by not taking that moment.|pg||
nt|paulg:  awkward on a heart lead|pg||
nt|puncher: a bit awkward but this can make|pg||
nt|paulg:  a small club at trick 2 will probably do the trick?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  hard to believe that Short passed|pg||
nt|puncher: given that slam was bid in the other room, passing doesn't actually cost that much|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: all those interruptions are really annoying :)|pg||
nt|puncher: And they meet Ireland in the final match|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd rather double on the first round, but passing worked out well when he could double on the second round|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: Norman is a bit overstocked in spaded    but still 3NT  seems a little pessimistic |pg||
nt|xenya: easy 12 tricks on a @H lead -- that's what must have happened in OR|pg||
nt|puncher: especially when he knows that Walker's bidding is generally sound|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

nt|mdgraham: dull 4@h EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: I nearly claimed it for him once AD not led|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, Wales with a good lead at the half but England have fought back|pg||
nt|paulg:  played the other way up he could endplay the defence into opening the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: also hand 12 maybe another swing against  England   down in 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H|pg||
nt|puncher: but I don't think that was what happened|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  defence could see it happening, so tried to break it|pg||
nt|puncher: but even the ruff and discard only gives the 9th trick doesn't it?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|ady: a great slam for n/s  here   they will do well to stop out|pg||
nt|newmoon: in OR NORTH played it in 2S - where 1@H - 1NT (showed a @S-suit)|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough call for Walker here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: makes 11 with the fortunate diamond position|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pitiful:  5@c looks best spot|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they will need to lead a @s|pg||
nt|xenya: not a bad 5@C here -- but EW in OR gailed to reach it after the same start|pg||
nt|paulg:  strong sequence from Short but Walker has no aces|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: *failed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
nt|santyclz: I saw this board in another room, e-w bid to the 5 level and paid the price.|pg||
nt|paulg:  so no danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|puncher: and should be a rare flat board for this match |pg||
pc|h5|nt|pitiful:  tough for david here|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  a very good contract    fails here|pg||
nt|paulg:  testing lead with the bad spade break, but luckily East has three hearts and the ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N however looks hopeless on any lead -- providing NS defend correctly afterwards|pg||
nt|pfbr: on a @d lead there are 9 tricks arent' there?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: oh yes, sorry|pg||
nt|pfbr: luckily david didn't :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so a great lead by N -- only to lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|idc: I'd guess that 2NT must be conventional there, not an uncommon treatment|pg||
nt|puncher: a missed opportunity for the Scots on board 13 as they talked oppos out of the making 3N by doubling them so they removed to a non-making 5D which slipped through|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|puncher: yes and 3@H is minimum with 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Double for the lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: or win the same amount|pg||
nt|puncher: looks like this will be a couple off and given that NS could make 2S, not much in it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: which is only fair|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Lindsay thinks it may go down if partner leads a heart|pg||
nt|idc: It's right in that a heart is an attractive lead for defence, wrong in that there are 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|puncher: i have to say it's one of my favourite toys - helpful for finding best game or staying out of a poor one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|puncher: North will be miffed that this one can't go off|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, some of us build our whole game on reaching poor games|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|puncher: They seem to have got a little high in the other room|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|pitiful:  this was an unlucky hand for England|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|newmoon: Camrose website:  http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzzc: They wouldn't have on that defence|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hanlon opened a 14-16 1NT with his 13 count|pg||
pc|c5|nt|puncher: it's true that these days most poor games are bid! and many roll in...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|idc: The play will be over soon now|pg||
nt|puncher: but it did have some play|pg||
nt|paulg:  Carroll did not even invite, just bid game of course|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: Ireland could have saved for -300 here   so a decent board for England  |pg||
nt|pitiful:  nice play from norman|pg||
nt|pitiful:  going down if he ruffs david|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: as pointed out, the same diamond position means that EW can make 6@D, but that is a rather poor contract|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|newmoon: it is played this year in...   Llandrindod Wells, Wales|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: very well done|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|spil: 6@C going off on a @S ruff|pg||

nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|idc: My fellow commentator & I last set discovered a new game, when he made a typo|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|idc: He mentioned the country called: Endgland|pg||
nt|idc: I asked if it was near Germ-many|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|eamongall: I note the iron men partnership of Greenwood and Anderson appears to have retired for the weekend from Northern Ireland action |pg||
nt|idc: and so we went on...  pity the poor spectators|pg||

nt|eamongall: is my monitor correct |pg||
nt|james_h: no Dbl? :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|galadriel: playable opposite a sigleton, according to their notes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: Well, I was about to blame South for not ending in 6NT|pg||
nt|eamongall: @Ss is trumps ...and we got 9 of another suit |pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s9|pc|c9|nt|james_h: South expects 3n to guarantee a 6 card suit , but North wants to highlight maximum|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|idc: still a case for 6NT though, but I expect he thought club may need ruffed good opposite singleton in North|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Last board of the set now|pg||
nt|puncher: And it's an exciting board for the last one|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are on the last board of the event. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Alan, for an excellent job.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentator Samantha Punch for her peceptive comments. |pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  last board here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Got a trump lead and s shifted to the @d on winning the @c ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: That seems normal|pg||
nt|puncher: Last board so thanks to all for your patience with the dodgy connections|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Many thanks to Melanie Thomas, our excellent operator. Tough conditions|pg||
nt|idc: 4 IMPs but that just takes Scotland to 52 IMPs, still 23-7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and to our commentators, Sam and Ian|pg||
nt|puncher: NS were in silly 6@S instead of a making 6N or 6C (which can go off on a spade ruff)|pg||
nt|paulg:  inally, our appreciation to Sandra Claridge (Bridge Great Britain) together with Alan Jones and the Welsh Bridge Union for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: yes    5 unlcuky    spade lead   clubs 3-0   and east doubleton diamond   so in fact Ireland did well to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: good job, thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Hi Anto, it's Laura but I can't talk because I'm BBO op|pg||
nt|puncher: A very thin 4S here but unlikely to get to it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|santyclz: That room also got to 3@s on this in a multi mixup.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: East was hoping for an entirely different sort of auction when he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Something from partner, 3@c from him I expect, showing weak hand with long suit|pg||
nt|idc: If dbl is takeout, he'll bid 4@c and then West will have the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Double is a bit dangerous as you must expect to get 4@C from partner now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: now waht does North do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  strange choice by East in both rooms|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, E supported diamonds at his first turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Once bitten ...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I thought choice was 1Nt or X|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree, but that did make things easier for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H looks just about right here|pg||
nt|paulg:  walker did well to bid 1@s, otherwise they may never have got into the auction|pg||
nt|puncher: Game good enough here for a final swing to Scotland |pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: goes for it :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H now? or 3@S? or something else?|pg||
nt|xenya: not 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If you bid again (I think you should), I prefer 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  3n a real shot from david|pg||
nt|ady: thin 3NT    will not make|pg||
nt|pitiful:  upgraded his pips |pg||
nt|pitiful:  might now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what is @s 8 lead from|pg||
nt|ady: yes    if he gets this right|pg||
nt|ady: would be a lucky swing |pg||
nt|pitiful:  this will be a big board in the march|pg||
nt|pitiful:  match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: No, it's a bit lily-livered|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1 or 4, I agree.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Will he take the push now?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|d|nt|paulg:  Last hand of this set, we'll be back in 18 minutes for the exciting finale of this year's Camrose|pg||
nt|puncher: any point doubling here?|pg||
mb|p!|nt|ady: might go down 2 trying heart finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: Hope you all enjoyed this set!   :)     Thanks to BBO for making this VUgraph available to us.  Even poor souls in South Africa can attend now!|pg||
nt|puncher: I guess it's just too hard to get to this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Scotland can afford to lose 5 IMPs and still stay at 23-7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is overstating the hand in my opinion|pg||
nt|paulg:  suggests a safe lead, as long as partner does not have the ace|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|idc: North will surely have some of this|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  might make if no @c switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
nt|puncher: kind of inviting the double here|pg||
nt|paulg:  not my style|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  2@h was control showing, presumably 2 |pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: and this for his second course :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: that was quick -- it seems 3N could be made by squeezing N|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: 1730 restart|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East bid hearts, so a little surprising to have no loser in the suit and four winners!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|puncher: i guess that's no longer 23-7...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: I think NS have just turned a top into a bottom |pg||
nt|mdgraham: can now manage a club ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
mc|12|nt|paulg:  thanks everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  I am told the party has already started for Wales|pg||
nt|puncher: And thanks to you Paul - time for a beer?|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I guess they are going to win|pg||
nt|paulg:  glass of red Zinfandel I think|pg||
nt|puncher: Not a great 6N here - 6@C better apart from the ruff... but still a nice end for Scotland|pg||
nt|puncher: well done to Wales - beers all round|pg||
