mb|2D|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: 3 @H usually a good spade raise |pg||

nt|gracelin: south found a good lead, if he led his partner's suit, H, 4S might make.|pg||
nt|baldjean: with 5/5 in majors I can understand they became active. East's hand is upgraded a lot if there isd a fit and even more so if there is a double fit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ni hao: welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks like precision auction |pg||
pc|h2|nt|gracelin: Yes, Shirley, they are competing with Mr. Yeh.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor E has virtually nothing |pg||
nt|gracelin: You will see lot of Precision actions in this tournament, I guess more than 60% of Chinese players play Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recall from other vugraphs  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I must say I play with many chinese players on bbo,  and they play an excellent 2/1 game also!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (since I do not play precision) |pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, you need to know natural system well to also play well with Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hates to balance and find the next bid to be 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but he knows pard has some point given the E bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: *points|pg||
nt|gracelin: this East hand worth a 2S raise in the way I play, but no harm is done.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you mostly play precision, Patrick?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|gracelin: Ths is the 2nd match of the RR from group C.  Both teams have won their first match.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: Mr. Gua, sitting north here, is the boss of the automibile company.|pg||

nt|gracelin: Sun made his name known in the semi-final match against Italy in the 2004 Olympiad.  Sun and Kang also reached semi-final in the 2011 Vanderbilt in the Spring NABC.|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|gracelin: How could East raise his passed hand partner to game is a little surprising.  He also has wasted honors in club.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: Sun obviously has length in Heart so East seems to have an unsuitable hand for partner.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this case, not a problem|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  but if S had Qxx of @cs and 2 spades, then not ducking would have produced effects EW don't want to think about.|pg||

nt|sybarra: you are either up very early or staying up very late |pg||

nt|andyv:  with no entries and such a weak suit, W would have been better off to lead partner's known 5 card suit|pg||

nt|gracelin: stiff|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, a 9-card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  board 10 was 13 imps to EW when 4@h made 5 in CR|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gracelin: 3NT by north is probably where this hand will rest.|pg||
nt|gracelin: some modernest may only overcall 2C with the south hand.  Then north must find a bid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S dbles now |pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is a line between t/o double and simple overcall.  South hand is a little too strong for me to only overcall.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: precision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  I wonder what S expects to do with the double?  Spend the rest of the auction trying to convince N he really has none of the other suits?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south is from Eric Kokish's school and north is from the same school.|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have bid 5@d over 2@c|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  right, but he had to assume that the Q of @s was with S since N didn't ruff with the Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  that seems sensible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: bet we missed a pass |pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  it was a guess|pg||

nt|gracelin: Shanxi won a swing last board.  The other room also in 4C but went down.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|baldjean: why double when trump suit is clear?|pg||
nt|gracelin: south maybe subject to an endplay if declarer reads the cards well.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|gracelin: East did not hear me and lose his SA.|pg||

nt|twcho: in bd 10, the auction is exactly the same until east double the 3NT and north scared and run to 4@c|pg||

nt|twcho: and lose 10 more imps|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|gracelin: NS's 4H depend on the location of DA, but EW can make 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't see why he did that.  He should not be ashamed of his double of 3H with AK, A and a 5-card suit. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cash it you dont get it   maybe try caps next time |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: will S bid spades |pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@c is not guaranteed to be a good contract either|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3H is a cue of opponent's implied H suit.  It shows invitationa or better hand for spade.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|gracelin: yes, 4C will be too high, but may also push NS into the unmaking 4S.|pg||

nt|andyv:  looks as if EW will be shut out of bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, if NS can make 4S, north would have bid it over 3C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  perhaps E could have doubled 2NT|pg||
nt|twcho: good stop. even 5@s is dangerous|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: -2 is ok since NS is likely to make 3S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's Cue is just in case West has a strong raise hand, which West didn't have.|pg||
