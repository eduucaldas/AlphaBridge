mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes horrible system|pg||
pc|d5|nt|djneill:  he may have avoided the @h lead at least|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|psyck: ACOL, 4 card Majors, Weak NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes one of the rare virtues of such a bid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  East leads longest and strongest, and runs into a buzzsaw|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence's usual fate|pg||
nt|psyck: if he continues @d's it will be 12 again as usual|pg||
nt|psyck: non @d's, dec does not have communication to enjoy it all|pg||
nt|djneill:  North may choose to guarantee the contract by hooking the @d and not hooking the club|pg||
nt|djneill:  if East shoots a @d back|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|psyck: defense had enough of allowing dec to enjoying 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|djneill:  North would like to throw East in somehow to lead away from @c or @d, but with what?|pg||
nt|psyck: will just take @c fin now likely|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @h-@s squeeze on West is good except that both threats are now behind dummy, making it hard for a simple squeeze to work|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|djneill:  by ducking hearts, North has extra chances since East may be out of hearts now, and clubs can break or the @c9 can come down, but West can't get in to cash the last @h|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: the screen is closed ,,, Here we go !|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi CK|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Welcome to everyone to this second session in this premier league match|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: welcome :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Hi Baard & Andre|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Hi All :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobholl: hi welcome all :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Baard |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone!|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  There was a lot of swings in the first one, so there is every chance to watch some interesting bridge here :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Hello Cornelia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: re Bob :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: can the hinden team catch up in this round? |pg||
nt|chick: A rather mundane partscore to start off the last session|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi all|pg||
nt|penseur9: welcome to the last round of round 4....|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Hello (finally)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  looks like EW has a game in @h's and are well on their way to finding it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|chick: Hinden came back from a 40 IMP deficit to within 10 points of the lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bvdahl:  even with the KQ offside in trumps, it  should not be too difficult to make 4@h's because of the @c suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: East's spades look as good as the AKQ|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|penseur9: should have said last segment of round  4 :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bvdahl:  Seems like we will start with a normal 4@s Where declearer has to either set up dummy's @c's or ruff as many !'d's as possible|pg||
nt|penseur9: welcome for the 4th (of)7) rpund of this great tourney|pg||
nt|penseur9: *rounds that is :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bvdahl:  N found the best lead, and declearer can play for 11 by finessing @s's early|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: 7 tricks is my guess 3@C 2@H 1@S 1@D|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  The @s finesse is close to certain after the bidding and the lead, because S must have something in @d's since N didn't lead a high @d. Thus N must habe @s K for his opening lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: game is cold and if the @D finesse loses, he could go down ... would you take that finesse?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: sorry @S* finesse ...|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|psyck: now that he got the @s right, can even make an overtrick with @c breaking|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|bvdahl:  I am not sure I would, but I hard to find scenario where the finesse is not good|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|chick: I agree, and in MPs absolutely, but at teams, is it worth the 3% risk for 1 imp?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  If you are 95% sure, you take it because you win 1 IMP 19 out of 20 times and lose 11 1 out of 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: sorry for that - misclaim|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|bvdahl:  Q@h's would have been an interesting shift to attack dummy's entries, but the contract makes regardless this time|pg||

nt|roswolf: all that to lose an imp|pg||
nt|roswolf: a similar test for e/w now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzpu: According to Malinowski, his line of play was to show off for the wonderful people here on BBO.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|djneill:  East has reversing shape, unless East wants to rebid 1NT with a singleton to show the 15-17 range|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmm |pg||
nt|djneill:  there's the 2NT - 15-17 (playing a weak NT opening)|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d would not occur to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes simple raise now|pg||
nt|psyck: with unpassed pd & an unmentionable suit|pg||
nt|psyck: not to mention the unfav vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|Fourth Suit Forcing|nt|djneill:  with clubs 3-2, 4@c, 2@d, and 2 Aces at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: victor will have the pleasure of bidding 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: with @c breaking, possibly 4@c & a couple each in other suits here|pg||
nt|djneill:  the lead surely a @d?|pg||
nt|psyck: bad enough to bid, bad enough to lead|pg||
nt|djneill:  North had an opportunity to double 3@d, but chose not to.. a clue?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: heart would be my choice -|pg||
nt|djneill:  well even a @h does not save the day, but now there are 10|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: always lead an unbid major|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|djneill:  playing South for a sing or doub @s honor could work with the @h entry intact|pg||
nt|roswolf: south is too weak to hope to set up and enjoy her suit |pg||
nt|djneill:  East now must think:  how to make if clubs are 4-1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|djneill:  if clubs 4-1, then just 8 sure tricks again|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: Welcome all...sorry again for the late start. Blame a certain british telecommunications company.|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and you will win an average of 0.4 IMP's per time you do it ;)|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
mb|1C|nt|penseur9: 20-20 board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bvdahl:  I would expect bidding to go 1@s (1 NT) 2@h p p p, and then W has a choice|pg||
nt|penseur9: after 3 rounds, the Teltcher team stands in 2nd place while the De Botton is in 4th|pg||
nt|penseur9: how high will EW go? |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bvdahl:  whether or not to re-open|pg||
nt|chick: another 20-20 partscore, neither side has a serious fit|pg||
nt|chick: so 19:11 gain, but then there is that meeting with the teammates the one time it fails :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|6 spades GF|nt|vugraphzpv: Running score Teltscher +51 against Hackett|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphzpv: Hinden +77 against Fegarty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: De Botton +16 against Allfrey|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: it's ok...you weren't meant to know :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: looking like another 3nt contract here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|penseur9: 2@H should make here|pg||
nt|penseur9: I will attempt to put my brain in gear at 5:38am here :)|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpv: likewise!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  To defeat this contract the defense had to not touch @d's, but very dofficult to get it right|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  def needed 3@d truicks|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  tricks... sorry for typos|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  True, but I feel bridge players need to think more like poker players, and that is a good example of how a poker player would approach the problem|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: in pairs you could try 2nt as N but not now :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: S isn't going to be real happy about helping set up the heart suit for declarer|pg||
nt|penseur9: the delay is that they are playing with screens and Mike, the vugraph operator waits till both players have recorded their bid before showing us|pg||
nt|ady: j@D   now   and 9 easy tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||

nt|bobholl: but he doesn't take the profit :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pitiful:  2@h weak raise, 2@s random game try, could have shown a shortage|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: entries are limited, so now he won't get to enjoy the hearts|pg||

nt|psyck: Looks like a phantom sac other room, 4@h surely does not make|pg||
nt|psyck: well actually, looks like they were bidding it to make|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|d|an|T/O|mb|r|mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: rdbl shows values and some heart support but not specifically Hx as some play it|pg||
mb|5C|nt|djneill:  West's overcall is to 2-level vulnerable nonjump as South's 2@d was to 2-level jump vul - substandard|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: Rosenkrantz would be Hx|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: looks like a 2 imp pickup for teltscher|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@h would be an alternative to the 2@h overcall|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psyck: That would be my choice too|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a make|pg||
nt|psyck: I doubt x of 5@c had any special meaning, @h should surely have been lead here|pg||
nt|djneill:  will spedn a club getting back to hand, but the @sK comes into being|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|hT|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|djneill:  often you can tell the singletons with the degree of eagerness it is played, in context|pg||
pc|c9|nt|djneill:  sometimes it is followed by an expectant stare at partner, but they are using screens here|pg||
mc|11|nt|djneill:  so maybe a cough|pg||
pg||

nt|psyck: so you will only see final contract, lead, & result for the initial boards.|pg||
nt|psyck: *if W played...|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  yes|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  it was a nice stop in 3@h's, but a nice defense|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  didd they miss one ruff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: sorry about that - Celia isn't feeling so hot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: I've taken over, if that's OK with you all.|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  We are back...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: (I'll pass you to our able hand, Tom - Mike C)|pg||
nt|penseur9: ok thanks Mike|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: double seems normal from North (to show @H)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will east bid 1 or 2nt ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d maybe will be hard|pg||
nt|penseur9: note that the OR starts with 18 to 20 in order to have comparisons when they get back to  1... so we will not have compairisons here in the CR :(|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike, welcome :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Aggressive 3@h's opening from South. Many would be happy to open 2@h|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Tom|pg||
nt|ady: no game available  here   good club fit   but 3 losers if defence take their 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|penseur9: how will North handle the bidding here|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|penseur9: Hi Ian welcome|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: I sure would, but perhaps NS have some other meaning for 2@H|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@S showing minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: for me that would be natural but if not it's nice|pg||
nt|chick: alerted, so must be a form of michaels|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: Martin Jones has enough to go on to game|pg||
nt|penseur9: good bidding chalange for NS here|pg||
nt|chick: I also play it natural|pg||
nt|chick: can double or Unusual NT with the other two suits|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ady: 3@H  can make    but not more on a spade lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ianmcc: Hi glad to be let in|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  This vulmerability and 2-6-1-4, I can certainly sympathize with 3@h's|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Thanks all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: luckily for NS the @C finesse works|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: fireworks :)|pg||
nt|psyck: if that hand happened, E could have played trump & they would have gotten the extra @d trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  9 tricks EW in @s while NS could get problems in 4@h's because he gets short in trumps|pg||
mb|5C|nt|yo_yo: and the losing club can go on the @SQ|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha ha ha|pg||
nt|ianmcc: didn't think of 3NT very practical|pg||
nt|penseur9: better late then never :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: no don't understand that bid I must admit|pg||
nt|penseur9: still might just make|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: 4@Cs would be a good contract here for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: back live now|pg||
nt|chick: NS being very cautious, knowing the spades will probably split badly|pg||
nt|bobholl: brave 4 @D vulnarable|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I don't like 5@s with doubleton diamonds, but I have the privilege of watching all four hands, of course|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  this is 10 tricks with no hope of getting the 11th|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but 5@d was a nice bid, and it shows the value of bidding the sacrifice you are planning to make immidiately and not waiting for your opponent to bid the game|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Is North thinking?|pg||
nt|chick: North is trying to decide if the @DQ was a falsecard, mandatory if W had a doubleton, or if he needs to switch to a heart now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but is it one down still?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Declearer needs to set up a @c trick before pulling trumps|pg||
nt|ady: in hearts if a spade is led   then trumps will have to be drawn to avoid a spade ruff  in which case there 4 losers  2 clubs 1 spade and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps, but with 4 diamonds, a lot of crossruff possibilities ... partner surely has no more than 1 spade|pg||
nt|ady: this will be over quickly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: guess it will make exactly|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: now a @C and @D loser it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks like there is a trump and a late club to lose   |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but Gib thinks it makes, must be some way I cant see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pretty boring so far apart from board 1 which i missed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ianmcc: overtrick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: GIB sees a lot of things that us lesser mortals don't |pg||
nt|yo_yo: bill niccol points out that it's better for Rosen to throw a @C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: then if clubs 3-3 away goes the @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: apparently it makes if ERichsen leads a @H but i cant see how|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Just wondering why chris jagger didnt open it 5@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: with the misguess in @H ??|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes -1 :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: it must be a squeeze|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  well played.|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Bob & Cornelia|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ianmcc: did'nt want it|pg||
nt|penseur9: the OR is starting with boards 18-19 and 20 before returning for board  1|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to finish in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  They will be fighting for a part score here|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT?|pg||
nt|penseur9: double maybe?|pg||
nt|ady: north will then take some action|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I think that does work - West has to lead a spade, giving a ruff-sluff |pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably the alert is for @C maybe 2?|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N is the place to be in with 4@s in trouble on @c lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, serious trouble|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely @S contract NS here will win|pg||
nt|chick: in case anyone is confused, we are just catching up on a couple of boards lost in a crash, we'll be back to live play in just a moment|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: 1@c can be 11-14 or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Think 8 in @h's is max EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: How do we like the 1@D opening bid?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess east feels not too well with his @D K|pg||
nt|chick: (I do) :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: too strong for a weak 2 so open :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Light openings are mostly a matter of partnership style|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: could 1NT be a transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|psyck: If it is your style, W certainly has a 1@d opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ah that's better|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  You need names here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am not surprised :)|pg||
nt|chick: one of the silliest things people do is leave a gap between a weak 2 bid and an opening 1 bid.  There should never be a hand that is "too strong for a weak 2 and too weak to open ...|pg||
nt|chick: 1"|pg||
nt|ianmcc: can 4@h live?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I think even I could make this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Might make as many as 10 in @s's if they are psychic, but I would expect 9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: obviously not|pg||
nt|ady: south could be weaker in balancing seat   but  8 tricks unlikely to be too high so Selway will  invite|pg||
nt|ady: in fact has been more agressive and gone to game|pg||
nt|penseur9: not unreasonable at these colours|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: but bidding it is more difficult|pg||
nt|yo_yo: better than crying|pg||
nt|ady: west knows North likely to have 4 hearts on the bidding so has an awkward lead|pg||
nt|penseur9: 5-3-4|pg||
nt|ady: good lay for declarer   4 club tricks on top  and can develop 2 hearts and 2 diamonds   on top of spade winner|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: likely to get minors right|pg||
nt|penseur9: same here CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: my apologies. Had an internet blackout. Will try to resume service after this board.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Not sure how you are meant to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: this has no real chance actually as cards are, but likely other room will also be in 4@s-1|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but not so many entries in North to play monors toward dummy|pg||
nt|penseur9: right David|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psyck: will probably need to do that for 9, 10 looks too much :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  minors|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpv: he is stil smiling!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: still|pg||
nt|ady: not clear cut   east could have Q@H   and if winning spade and playing heart to the jack  a 2nd spade would put declarer in difficulty|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: @C suit favourable for him but he doesnt know that yet|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  EW dodged a bullet there since 2@s xx can be set|pg||
nt|chick: I'm guessing that 1@C is artificial and 1@H is a transfer|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  yes, that must be right|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and it seems that 3@h's will make with 1@s loser + 2@h + 1@c|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|psyck: tried to put dec to test immediately...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: cannot afford to draw trumps, so will continue some minor cards|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely cornelia :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|chick: so I think Bob nailed it .... it is too strong for a weak 2 bid, therefore must open 1|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, the defence need to do well her ... they must attack clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  good start for declearer. Might try anothther @d and go for xruff|pg||
nt|psyck: he is on track & should make it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Impresive|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: another good suit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and now @c|pg||
nt|ady: decided to duck spade    and continuation of spades has made life easy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: True, e.g. I would open 2@d in an undiscussed pdship here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|penseur9: looking like down one here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a partner-torturing false card|pg||
nt|penseur9: this will give declairer a good idea of card distribution now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: just one more trick to find......|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the @H suit is blocked too |pg||
pc|c7|nt|penseur9: from W opening he knows where the cards are now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  9 now regardless, either on xruff or because E can't ruffthe @cQ|pg||
nt|penseur9: he can now cross ruff for 4 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: not me, 27 zars (need 26 to open), and 12 total points (need 12 to open)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt will be made on @C lead but @S lead stands out|pg||
nt|chick: so 1@D for me|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
mc|9|nt|penseur9: could have been +1|pg||

nt|djneill:  South may find an overcall  over the weak NT, some hands just have to be bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|psyck: 6N only makable slam DD|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|an|Diamonds|nt|roswolf: but feels it is best to keep her powder dry|pg||
nt|psyck: this is a better hand than deal 2 overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|roswolf: 3@C should show the fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|djneill:  West has 17 opposite 12-14, needs a little fittage for a slam|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|chick: these dinky partscore hands aren't helping Hinden overcome the IMP lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: even with a "ligth" opener i would bid 2nt with the E hand|pg||
nt|psyck: They already closed the gap a bit last session|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2nt by west here to show srenght|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 12 tricks in no-trumps  as they lay   but may end in game|pg||
nt|penseur9: strenght even :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: depends if you regard Jxx as adequate, I guess|pg||
nt|psyck: They got to 3N on deal 1 other room, which has chances, unlike the contract played here|pg||
nt|psyck: If only the @cA was right, 3N would be on velvet here :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Interesting 3NT in S here. EW can take the first 7 tricks, but easier said than done|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, 30 points worth :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I guess @S by EW will win over @H by NS (as usual) :)|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D fails if defence take spade ruff|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
nt|ady: 4NT   invite possibly|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3nt seems a safe contract|pg||
nt|ady: east might accedpt with nice diamond fit|pg||
nt|ady: accept|pg||
nt|penseur9: double dummy, 6nt seems to make :)|pg||
nt|ady: west thinking rather thaan south|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|bvdahl:  really..?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: No lie|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  is this correct?|pg||

mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: gosh  a cue bid from callaghan|pg||
nt|chick: and we all like a close match, right?  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: should be -1: phantom but good insurance|pg||
nt|penseur9: the X and XX rare in competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: W/S have no idea what's going on here...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: apparently not insurance|pg||
nt|penseur9: they can join the club Mike :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North would be crazy to pull|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: overboard|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  1@s as showing @d's is quite popular nowadays|pg||
nt|penseur9: S & W bids shown toguether and N & E also|pg||
nt|ady: south now thinking rather than north|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: sure :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: oops|pg||
nt|penseur9: desaster looms :(|pg||
nt|ianmcc: insurance picked up 500/800|pg||
nt|ady: wrong choice    but is ok on the lead|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: strange i would take @D a and finesse @C |pg||
nt|psyck: trying to keep E away from lead for a while|pg||
nt|psyck: expecting W to cash @s & then @h protected for the moment|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9: in 6 level contract I would have expected the @S ace lead here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: South needed to grab the first spade.  Declarer has successfully switched horses|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: XX is a wonderful weapon if they belive you|pg||
nt|penseur9: just a remonder they will be playing 3 rounds of 20 boards, so much bridge left here|pg||
nt|penseur9: *a reminder...|pg||
nt|ady: I would think Selway condiered that south would have none or 1 diamond   so unlikely to have a siingleton spade|pg||
nt|ady: considered|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point|pg||
nt|ady: declarers problems not over yet   but will eventually be ok|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|bvdahl:  here 4@h's would not be horrible, but goes down since @cA is beind the king|pg||
nt|penseur9: ho ho|pg||
nt|ady: had south held JX spade  and only 4 clubs   contract would very likely have failed|pg||
mc|12|nt|mdgraham: this is a very trickey hand for NS. All their actions seem reasonable, but xxx opposite xxx in the opposition suit is awful|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: the is another reason for W to have tried, knowing other room will likely do so with some catching up to do when the match started|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, but it's doubtful whether declarer would have blocked the suit ... more likely he holds up, and now it's down|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  9? West probably only pitched 1 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, normal, looking at those @h in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Erichsen can't believe that pull to 4NT...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: and now back to our scheduled broadcast :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|chick: 4@S looks makeable|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow, the OR catching up... only 2 boards behind... we might get compairisons yet :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a routine 4@h|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: that's a song :)|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Mike! :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|bvdahl:  Another interesting hand. I think 4@s's can be made EW, and NS has a good save in 5@d -1|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: 2@C=3-card support, 9-11 hcp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might make a big difference to the result of this contract|pg||
nt|psyck: i'd lead @s6|pg||
nt|penseur9: another partial contract here I guess|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: Well it works a lot better on this lead than @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: dec still has a 2nd stopper & should be ok|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yo_yo: maybe they are playing strong Club  EW|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 10 tricks as they lay    playing south for  one high honor and 10@C   and spade guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3NT too will be bid now i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: There's a heap of work to do ... probably need an endplay here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Even with @s's 4-1, the good @c break would have helped declearer|pg||
nt|chick: I approve of the 2@D bid.  Some might make a takeout double (to check for spade fit) and then correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: a sort of drury bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but they cant be if we look at hand 5|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  W could have tried 2@h in balancing pos, but if 2@h's makes, 1NT is likely to go down|pg||
nt|chick: this is another thing I personally dislike ... bypassing a 4 card major to rebid 1N|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: hand 2|pg||
nt|psyck: nicely done, 3N is superior|pg||
nt|psyck: it is normal to bypass in Walsh style|pg||
nt|penseur9: with 6@Hs and partner support I would have bid 4@H here by west|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: it certainly is when the defense sets up hearts for you|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: yes indeed, far from over |pg||
nt|psyck: N played @hK to try creating more entries in S hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he was thinking: if South has @HA, then I better win the first @H and clear the spade suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was a nice play, but doesn't help here|pg||
nt|psyck: Operator, It would be nice if players names were entered|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right, we want to know who we are complimenting (or insulting)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  actually... on that lead, the 1c loser will disappear|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @c loser|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  since declearer can ruff out the @hA and sicard a @c on @hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: hey, how's it going?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  discard. Sorry all, I type fast, so there will be some errors|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wonder why callaghan didnt open 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: Not a good start for Hinden with a poor choice of takeout double on deal 1|pg||
nt|chick: I know, that's why I dislike walsh style|pg||
nt|psyck: you  can always find it later in hands with GF values|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: 2@H is an enterprising overcall|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 12 opposite 12 are these slam tries?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: That should answer your question :)|pg||
nt|ady: down 1   here   1 spade 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bvdahl:  This should be 1 down. Even if E does not find the @h shift now, there are only 6 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzpv: That any better?|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: No problem :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: Well, declarer certainly has an endplay in mind, if he played @HQ, rather than play for @HJ onside|pg||
nt|penseur9: they may try but probably 5@H here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is there a shortage of oxygen?|pg||
nt|penseur9: oops :(|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4NT may prove a desaster here depending on the lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @sA at least -1|pg||
nt|penseur9: well desaster may be a little too strong a word, but...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: try disaster|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hmm|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NS play 2@h=5/5 hearts and a minor in first and second seat  |pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|chick: 4S is cold here on any lead, and 3N could go down on some layouts|pg||
nt|chick: actually, either contract works fine on this hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am closer to 3NT preferable :)|pg||
nt|chick: point is, they never made a decision, they never found they even had a spade fit|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: Sorry guys tht contract just made|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 3NE=|pg||
nt|ady: -50  a good score for Teltcher|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|mdgraham: Some variance of evaluation on board 2. Five Hearts doubled here, Three Diamonds next door|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unusual to see a penalty double of a strong NT|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: N/S must play the 19-21 1NT opening|pg||
nt|psyck: unless they have methods to show 65, S may just try to get to 4@h|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S!|nt|yo_yo: to show a balanced 19-20 Jones will x first then bid NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North has opened 1NT as a preempt I suppose (rather than 1@D) ... but the hand is really very strong for such an approach|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I use 3NT in this spot to show 5@s and 4@h's. A classic problem hand over strong 2 NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: now N will check for @S i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @h partial E/W - no slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: correct. board 5 is 5Dx Bakhshi Contract.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: apologies|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: is South feeling lucky? |pg||
nt|bvdahl:  So.. on to calmer waters. A quiet 1 NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: some play it as showing a long suited hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: one suited|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahha they play a weak NT NS |pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: speed pass :)|pg||
nt|psyck: true, the 6th @d in such a good suit makes a big difference|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Seems like NS use Puppet stayman. 3@d shows on ore moth major suits|pg||

nt|penseur9: could EW try for 3NT here?|pg||
nt|ady: part score battle    2 spades  the limit for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: no wrong again :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's what we are here for, Kath - to be wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: stiff @D10 is handy|pg||

nt|yo_yo: but here it's not the thing to do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only when something else would have been better |pg||
nt|yo_yo: another big score for the teltscher team on 3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, no drama ... 4@S making 6 I expect|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bvdahl:  and there, the operator misclicked ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Heather dhondy - never knowingly underbids :)|pg||
nt|psyck: KnR evaluates it as 18.05|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  4@d asks pd to chose a suit. Presumably without slam interest|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: yep :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bvdahl:  a nicer duck by Norht there. If he wins the trick, it will be easy for declearer|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzpv: ns play acol,wknt, 3wk 2's, 5cdS|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well done, with limited values and a 5-3 fit|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks gitte|pg||
nt|chick: should still be easy, although E may be worrying about a 4-2 spade split|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but I suspect declearer puts N on th @sK since there are very few holdings where S would not cover  the @sQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: I assume S chose to show his hand as 55 game forcing, planning to correct 3N to 4@h|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  4@c over 3@d would show both majors with slam interest|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but he might not think they are 3-3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: most people upgrade,  downgrading very unusual  i find|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: :) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: board 1,  Jeremy dhondy made 3NT after a @D lead set up an entry to his hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobholl: N can count 9 sure tricks so won't finesse @D i guess|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: no one likes to open it 5@C  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|bvdahl:  oops|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: There are a zillion variations of Puppet Stayman, I play a variation where 3N on 3@c shows 2@s & 3@h|pg||
nt|penseur9: contract should make now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ducking the @D wasnt the thing to do|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|bvdahl:  but I think the contract makes regardless. Best defense would be to let W win the @hQ and shift @c's even without cashing a @d, but since declearer can cash 4 @s tricks without being ruffed, he will be able to discard the @c's in hand|pg||

nt|penseur9: woops... all we need to do is say something and BAM... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: North's rebid is a real problem|pg||
nt|psyck: 2N rebid would show the values, but has no @s stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D or 3@H is not enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And as you say, 2NT is not particularly nice either|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d rebid could be with less|pg||
nt|ianmcc: what is 2@s?|pg||
nt|penseur9: showing 6 card suit???|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Good hand for various mechanisms where North could bid 2@C (forcing) |pg||
nt|psyck: they are playing in tougher contracts in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: 5+ Spades, 4+ Minor, 15+ HCP|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 5 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bvdahl:  Looks like 8 tricks. Declearer can set up 2@h tricks pretty easy, and he doesn't have many alternatives...|pg||

pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: 1D is a transfer to @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: LOW flying contracts.....|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@h was probably the least of evils|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, here they are in what looks like the wrong game, but might be the right game|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure why it's so popular |pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: from a linguistic point of view, transfer probably isn't quite the right term - ok, it shows hearts, but partner doesn't have to bid them|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This defence might be as good as anything ... probably important to get rid of dummy's @CA, even though it costs a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With the diamonds and hearts 3-3, this is certainly makeable double dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: S's best chance is to start ruffing @d maybe|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: what is the term then?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: the good thing is that opener can rebid (assuming 11-14) 1M with three-card support and 2M with four - you show the degree of fit immediately |pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: Ian pagan wont be enjoying leading on this hand|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I think in hindsight that he made a good call.  Finessing successfully when diamonds are 4-2 doesn't necessarily help|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: With one of my partners we use the term muppet - as it isn't really a transfer and isn't a puppet either |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South will certainly bid a slam here|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for w |pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: And probably be disappointed with dummy and the result|pg||
nt|psyck: will tread cautiously with no fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No fit, but if I was looking at that monster South hand and partner opened, no amount of caution would suffice|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @d lead to give pd 2@d ruffs ;)|pg||
nt|bobholl: and guessed wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N ambitious, 4@c preferable|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  This looks like an undramatic 4@s with 10 or 11 depending on the trump play. Of course, if they get ambitions of slam, they might get to a sticky spot like 5@s-----|pg||

pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: Brian Callaghan  in the driving seat yet again|pg||
nt|psyck: 5N = pick a slam now? :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good bid I reckon|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N would probably be quantitative here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, a good rule of thumb:  whenever partner makes a natural NT bid, then the next bid of 4NT is quantitative|pg||
nt|psyck: when no fit agreed & 4 level bids/cues bypassed, it is generally quant|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard to blame South for being in the tank here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, tough indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's heard nothing helpful, so his hand is not QUITE as good as before, but still, he has to move towards slam|pg||
nt|mathat: 4 @s or 5 @c by EW|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|psyck: I think some number of NT better than continueing to fish with 4@d|pg||

pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: a lot of pairs play 2@H as the negative to 2@c these days |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s has good play NS, so this may be a real steal |pg||
nt|psyck: W knows have vlaues close to grand, but with balanced hands, not likely to see the source of tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: I'd open the S hand as it is, but cringe when partner bids hearts :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: Mike, our vugraph operator doing a great job... thanks|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  2@h's seems like the maximum of what NS can make|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  W tries a balancing take out double|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: Both the hands would have the same zar count, but that is only just another guideline to evaluate openings|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: with a few cards interchanged, it could have gone for a telephone number|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: is it your partnership style to allow a 3@D overcall with the South hand?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  looks like it can make. Very interesting spot if declearer plays low @h towards dummy. S shold put in the K ti deny two entries in dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: actually, this has 1 zar point less than if the K were @D ... you must subtract one for short suit honors|pg||
nt|bobholl: ligth 3rd hand openers often forget the disadvantages as in this case |pg||
nt|chick: but still enough to open|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  the XX shows maximum and interest to play defense|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: can't blame W, he has a hand it was probably hard to pass over 1@C|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: yes, enough zar either way|pg||
nt|chick: you define "light" by HCP only?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bvdahl:  This is at least 1 down. And NS can make sure of -2 by ducking a @h and get a trump promption for @d 9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzpv: thanks very much :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bvdahl:  but even without that, E will need to lead spades twice towards dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|bvdahl:  which is why he unblocked c!K|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  now N has to duck to get 500|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  he will wonder why pd didn't lead @h|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and since S bid 1NT, he most likely has Qx in @h's, so a duck is possible to find|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bvdahl:  good defense :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: easy 11|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bvdahl:  def will feel very endplayed at every turn from now on|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @h K might be best chance|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also, North might have tried 4@s, bit it's easy to see that that could backfire|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: sorry missed it, will look at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: was bizarre line..... |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: vul  i probably wouldnt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: yes, as i said, in a new pdship, I would rarely open 10-11 hcp hands, as it often creates problems|pg||
nt|psyck: in a regular pdship, i may open 10-11 or pass 12|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|psyck: declarer should have placed the rest of the values with N after @hK for the x|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunate, N could cash @h & wait for @s|pg||

nt|chick: a good hand for a defense class on ducking :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: personally I think it's slightly too weak, but it could well be right to bid - if pard has 12-13 ish and a heart stop 3NT may be making our way|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@s E/W - if N/S quick|pg||
nt|penseur9: would you preempt in first seat Ian?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: most would open the South hand, but it's terribly easy to get to game after doing so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: small break at table .......|pg||
nt|clinch: Hello :)|pg||
nt|chick: I guess I figure that even a new pard should understand enough hand evaluation to be comfortable with good shapely 11 counts|pg||
nt|chick: if not, I can find a new one :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  of course a @hQ lead would have made it easier this time|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H appears to be a make for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 5@d exclusion?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks like a Kokish sequence here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i missed the play on 9, thought 3NT was cold|pg||
nt|clinch: Was it a wrong view in diamonds?|pg||
nt|penseur9: I agree|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: Another hand where 3NT is better than 4@S on the 6-2 fit|pg||
nt|chick: 2N is some kind of game forcing raise of spades, although I wonder why not a splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the kibs arent impressed by Brian's declarer play :)|pg||
nt|clinch: Even so, there seem 9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's because he's overworked,  had to play all those contracts|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes that's why it's so surprising|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: no, they've stopped|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  be a little better on S's hand, but the difference is in the overtricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: all those first bids forced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be. Can't find it on the CC though |pg||
nt|yo_yo: where do you find their cc?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  a club lead sets the slam, I think|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  because no...|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  or...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  if a @c is lead, declearer wil have to pull trumps|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  otherwise E gets a @c ruff|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: Neil needs so little to make slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have it stored on my computer, but it might be an old version - on 2@C it just says ART and nothing else at all |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And N/S solve it!|pg||
nt|psyck: did well to find it this time|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On this layout, I guess both contracts make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: Other room commented that Michael Courtney, who features heavily in the book The Big Game, preaches that 6322 shapes (any 6 card suit) belong in NT.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: not sure where I got it from - could be the ecats site|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  ok, declearer has to let this go to hand|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and now 3 x trumps ending in hand|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  then lead @d J|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Then the best defense is to duck @dJ|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what you you open here peter?|pg||
nt|bobholl: played a @S or just gave up ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: possibly - but KQJ109 seventh is usually an adequate trump suit :) |pg||

nt|clinch: I confess maybe 4 @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like 4@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so does heather :)|pg||
nt|psyck: cards lie fine for 3N|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  3 NT makes because @h's are blocked. 5@d is down because @sK is offside|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Regardless, Very high quality bridge all around|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bvdahl:  hard to say which is the best contract|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  3NT makes without a @h lead or h!'s 4-4|pg||
nt|psyck: @h's 44 or blockage|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  S has a difficult choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: that's a strong weak two - all those tens, nines, and eights|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may convert this|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  knows|pg||
nt|penseur9: we are 7 boards ahead of OR... some of us will be able to watch many hands a second time :)|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   likely to play a part score in hearts|pg||

nt|clinch: Not I|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: has done|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D   shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ok and selway's 4@D says bid your major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not much interest here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  might even get 10 tricks here. Not unreasonable for E to play small @h's on trick 2|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  He can see they need 5 @h tricks to defeat the contrack|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and that if N has Qx in @h's, they can't beat it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: level about right|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  1@d shows at least 4@h's and 2@d's is a normal revers showing a strong hand (probably without 3 or more @h's)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|bobholl: playing a @S is not that bad :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, good stop|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: now, where's partner's trick...|pg||
nt|ady: trumps often a good lead from 5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: the EW card has a glitch :) in one place it says 0-7 and in another 2-7 |pg||
nt|bvdahl:  so  he only has to worry about pd having Qxx in @h's originally|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Both 3NT and 5@c make comfortably here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And something definitely went wrong there..... (if W really passed)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although declarer does have a trick 1 decision:  rise ace or run it?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: @s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: not an easy hand|pg||

nt|bobholl: yes i surely would :)|pg||
nt|psyck: would be interesting if N plays low @h 1st trick|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, declarer will surely prevail whatever defense does|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  unless S plays @c, then he has a chance for 10|pg||
nt|penseur9: the only reason to overtake would be to play @Hs here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the hearts are 3-3 to make up for it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be an idea to duck a spade now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then if West has four hearts as well as the diamonds, a nasty time will await    |pg||
nt|psyck: less if defense is friendly open opens the frozen @c suit or something|pg||
nt|ady: east has asked for a club with 2@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: cunning spade play by West|pg||

nt|psyck: I should have kept my mouth shut|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  will brobably find @dQ since E is a favorite to have length in @d's when he is void in @c's|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|clinch: Just set up clubs I think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: Communications getting slightly awkward - only one entry left in hand  |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|mdgraham: possibly not too bad - 3NT looks ok for EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's Binkie?|pg||
nt|clinch: The Hinden team unsurprisingly gained on board 9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I've changed my mind about them beating par :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I thought that 6@S might be just 2 off, but I think it actually loses control|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  as long as the last @s is good, it sisnÃ¦t matter, but at the time he played @s to K, he could not know that|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  didn't...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bvdahl:  oh well... good contract, and he made it :)|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: you southerners know these things |pg||
nt|clinch: Seems to have superseded his earlier moniker of "Brains"|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@D seems to be @Ds and one major suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a great contract|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bvdahl:  EW bidding might help them to stay low|pg||
nt|psyck: likely stop here though|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: some prefer a stronger suit|pg||
nt|chick: at the time he played the @S to the K, he still had the ability to finesse twice in @Ds|pg||

nt|chick: once the @SQ fell, then he had a choice|pg||
nt|ady: excellent heart fit e/w    can make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D a good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: seems 2@D was a weak multi here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he hopes they draw trumps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: obviously not strong enough for Erichsen|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@s was indeed only -2, def cant do it all|pg||
nt|ady: Erichsen must be wondering whether he should save with such strength|pg||
nt|penseur9: could 4@H go down on a @C lead?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: Yes, I changed my mind about changing my mind|pg||
nt|psyck: even 2 level difficult with only 7 tricks in sight|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I think the queston now is 7 or 8 trickc. @hJ would be a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Sorry all. I type fast, so there will be typos|pg||

nt|clinch: Callaghan and Burn known colloquially as "Binkie and Berky"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: message from a kib|pg||
nt|ady: not really    club round to the king |pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: when he played with David Burn, they were called Binkie and Berkie, after Pinkie and Perkie, having a resemblance of figure|pg||
nt|psyck: & I thought 4m was never to play :(|pg||
nt|psyck: but then I would be in 5 dropping the @dK :)|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Mick Jagger has played before |pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if it could have been guessed as W did not lead a @c honor|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and lokoing at the hands together, 3 NT is certainly not a walk in the park since there are only 8 top tricks even if @dK is onside|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 15-17 NT|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and a few high cards, presumably|pg||
nt|clinch: Disciplined pass by Pagan|pg||
nt|penseur9: a good 4@S EW here|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think :)|pg||

mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: yes i like it|pg||

mb|p|nt|clinch: Me too|pg||

nt|ianmcc: trumps ugly but might handle|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes I think so|pg||
nt|penseur9: the @C suit might save the day|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  EW had taken 5 trick and the rest was good|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Not a clue. however, no incorrect claim - they all agree -1 due to spades.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 5@c maybe|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: it's given NS a big problem however|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  cards lie well for 3NT EW here. I assume 1NT now shows 15-17|pg||
nt|penseur9: it seems that 5@C makes unless @S lead (if @S lead you make if you start with A of clubs)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well the auction warns|pg||
nt|penseur9: must be W thinking here|pg||
nt|penseur9: could they make 3nt?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bvdahl:  doesn't make any sense|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  unless they played 3 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: A bit loaded outside - not enough to stop 3NT thouh|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: correct|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good @h stopper|pg||
nt|ady: 8 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: even 3@H too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT no sinecure on a spade lead, but a heart lead is possibly more likely |pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|bvdahl:  after @d lead and a couple of ducks, it is natural to play @c to T and then run @sJ|pg||
nt|psyck: Well, you got your answer about their NT range :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Big swing coming to Hinden on board 9, playing in 4@sx other room , with defense giving it away|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bvdahl:  :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  E will not like the contract now, but he has no choice but to play for this exact layout|pg||
nt|penseur9: how low can you go? :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|clinch: Nice easy contract for the leaders|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: 4 diamonds to the 10 enough to stop 3NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bvdahl:  if he only ducks 1@d he might get 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: both teams are getting most hands right (or equally wrong) & the score remains low|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and very little chance thet Erichsen bid 1@d on 4 card|pg||
nt|psyck: S not continuing @d would likely place him with no entry|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  exactly|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: regardless, it's -1 I'm afraid :s|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  A difficult contract to play since N will have to ruff 2@c's high|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bvdahl:  I still think it is best to play S  for @cQ because that gives declearer 4 club tricks if S has Qxx or Qx in @c's. If you play N for @cQ, you only get 4 tricks if he has exactly Qxx|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: 3NT has some chances NS|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|psyck: more deals played than imps traded|pg||
nt|ady: selway might later try club finesse and go more down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bvdahl:  but can finesse the @sT on the way back|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|chick: low @S now would be scary|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|bvdahl:  is this right?|pg||
nt|penseur9: they say, no double no problem :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: sorry  Erichsen playing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @d to ruff @c to high ruff and then @s to the 9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|clinch: Looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: it all looks fishy :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: yup|pg||
nt|psyck: declarer was in danger of losing 2@s, 2@h, 1@d by playing @s's that way|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I can't see the logic in cashing the @sQ|pg||
nt|psyck: & defense continuing @s looking at that dummy...less said the better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: ><=> fishy|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  still needs to find @c Q|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And quite possible to go wrong after S has shown a lot in red suits|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  different now since declearer only needs 3 club tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but a @h was autimatic one down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: so Hinden takes the lead, very strong comeback from an early deficit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|pc|h6|nt|chick: that works, but spade to the Q could also work if the spades split|pg||

nt|mdgraham: if the pre-empt is on a six-carder you pay off, of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: 4N scrambling i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another good auction by E/W, who have been quite impressive.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The key point is that West's double is takeout (not sure I agree with it), and East took out|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h is ok, 9+ cards in the 2 suits & good @hs as well, but I admit 2NT is a tempting option|pg||

pc|h4|nt|psyck: winning 1st trick in hand & playing low @s may have been the winning play|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|clinch: On 12, Dhondy managed to get out for -1 in 5@h with - dare I say - more careful play than Jagger|pg||
nt|ady: Teltcher got 1 imp on hand 10   they all count now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, once again, the save against slam might be even less than the value of game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Surprising how often that happens|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, we have themes repeating themselves this session :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@S is down 500, less than the 620 that was actually scored|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|bvdahl:  as it lies, yes, but not so easy|pg||

nt|bobholl: 3 nt i mean|pg||
nt|psyck: A 3 level bid on the reverse would probably have game forced for them with going via 2N showing a minimum response|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  so even if you go -1100 once in a while, these are the kind of hands that compensate for that|pg||
nt|chick: I think you're right ... W had what he needed to know to bid 3N|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: i think South should bid @H, agree with you mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: 22-13 in favour of the Teltcher team after 10 boards|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, lead has increased a little|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  This is an interesting spot for E. Some might see 17 HCP with a @c stop and bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: we should get compairisions with the next 3 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will west compete?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|clinch: Jagger slightly less disciplined in his opening bids than his partner!|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|bvdahl:  but x is a lot more flexibile with 4-4 in major|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  slam time for NS|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|bvdahl:  let's see how high they go. Seems like grand is on because of the nice layout in @c's|pg||
nt|ady: 2 clubs  looks like majors     but lopsided  6-4|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D  asks for west to bid longer major  when east has 3-3|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|clinch: and may pay a price|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Speaking of repeating themese ... here's a 3NT which is vastly superior to 4@S on the 5-5 (!) fit|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  so now they found the good @h game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: possible to make 10 trricks on an end play    ruffing 3 diamonds in hand   plenty of entries    trumps are 2-2  and North can be end played in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    still only 9 tricks   ruff and discard wont help|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  and now they will just have to win it ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I don't mind a single stopper for 1NT overcall, but x is clearly superior here|pg||
nt|psyck: I think N may choose to lead a @s for want of anything better to do against 3N last deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Did Michael Courtney's book preach:  "look for 3NT when you have a 5-5 major fit"?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  North has tried his best to discourage his partner, so maybe South will show restraint|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Sorry all, I have to go now. Thanks to our splendid operator Gitte |pg||
pc|sK|nt|penseur9: this should make|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  6@D wouold have shown (in most systems) @hQ and @dK, and @dK is not a good card from Souths point of view...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bvdahl:  3 x @h's now and run the @d's will give 4@h + 5@d + 1@c = 10|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  or of N ruffs one of the @d's it will be 5@h's and 4@d's|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S have lost the partial. They can make 3@h|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck: I'm sure it will be updated to include it in the next edition|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes good point Ian|pg||
nt|ady: unwise double       this can be made|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|clinch: Looks fairly easy to get 800 here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: I'm told that 6@C shows @HQ, 2 kings but not the @CK|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  ok,|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  it probably doesn't matter, but leading a singleton when opponents have told you they have all the aces, is usually not the best lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  or maybe they didn't have the time to show all aces... sorry ;)|pg||
nt|chick: and especially when you don't have any hope of trumping anything|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5@d is not a GS try, of course|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|clinch: or 500 maybe|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About as useful as "bid 6322 hands to NT" (in my not-very-humble opinion)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should he ruff two @Ss here?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  nooo, just run the @d's|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: Selway has to find Q@D|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but if either bid they land in 4@h, still better than -110|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|penseur9: while we have a minute... please note that rounds 5-6 and 7 of this tournament will be played at Solihull, England on November 11 -12 and 13... don't miss it :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|penseur9: ah OK |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: North took the direct route - could have tried 3@H perhaps. However, that may have been shortage or something |pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's attractive to open a good 6 card suit but  having opened maybe he should have shut up|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  he does not have the entries to ruff two spades, really|pg||
nt|penseur9: right you are|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: double might have thrown the match      with it so close|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: and set up 4th @H too|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  To be fair, It was actually possible for E to have @cA on this bidding|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: if south showed a weakish point count North probably thought no higher than game|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: 10 imps on board 10. They got to 4@S NS. We said at the time that 4@H-2 might be a steal  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: well played, he found the @DQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: last board coming up  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: next segment at 2pm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still 7 boards to play in the other room|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|mc|11|nt|ady: debotton got another 6 imps on hand 11 where game was missed in OR|pg||
nt|ady: they have taken the lead    but have last board to calculate|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: 4@S by n/s seems normal|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|djneill:  silverston(e) chooses the light 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: an overtrick likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: might be played in 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: many would respond 1@h as W|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: or 2@H if playing weak jump shifts|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: which is what i would choose at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  North can add 3 HCP to his hand, in balancing seat, essentially - so eclipses the minimum needed to start with a takeout double|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  wow 2NT...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: well i think 3nt is automatic - vul game and all that whatever north has|pg||
nt|roswolf: an Artur special|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|psyck: with favorable black suits, this lead could give 12th trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|djneill:  North will enjoy the fact that the only thing West has to contribute is finessable|pg||
nt|djneill:  East having opened, normally everything is pinpointed with them, except for the odd honor - had West anything substantial they would have responded to 1@d |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: should finesse now while he has a spade entry and does|pg||

nt|clinch: Let's see how the slam bidding is |pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time but not in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if other table would choose @s preempt too, not that they were getting anywhere else whatever they do|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  It was probably the best contract. I doubt 7@h's was more than 50%|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bvdahl:  probably more like 40|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: I can't see   18,19 20 on Open score|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|clinch: Quite tricky to bid, I'd say|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|psyck: Frances judged right to stop in 3NT on the 6@s-2 hand deal 9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: light opening from East - no way to stop below game now|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  The cards lie very well for EW, they can actually make 6NT|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but I would expect 3NT to be their final stop|pg||
nt|chick: but pretty tough to bid I think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Extremely well done, assuming partner opened the bidding|pg||
nt|penseur9: can 4@S make here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: glad they are not playing gazzili (strong 2@C) i guess|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Ye, impossible|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And it is not a good contract|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Just sayin' ;)|pg||
nt|chick: "Any slam that makes is a good one"  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: same contract as OR here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  no. For starters, NS can play 3x @H's for a trump promotion|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and there will still be a @c loser|pg||
nt|penseur9: playing with screens, it could be East thinking|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  3@h x could be painful|pg||
nt|penseur9: for lack of a better word :)|pg||
nt|chick: well, EW missing out on a nice heart partscore|pg||
nt|chick: even game on lackidaisical defense|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a pure cross ruff may be even game|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry not looking properly it's bedtime|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  not for the oponents...|pg||
nt|ady: must have wrong hands up|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Apologies the boards are out of order - but 4S is the contract|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: they might get to 4@H now|pg||
nt|clinch: And so it proved|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it did |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was effectively same as here till 3N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|penseur9: no problem Tom :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: what is rex?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with me it's first round control|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may lead to 4@H - West will be a little scared of spades|pg||
nt|psyck: except 2N instead of the 2@h here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  though might be hard to get more than -1|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|clinch: Don't really like 3@D myself|pg||
nt|psyck: 3NT could have been defeated here other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not unreasonable to head for 5@D ... but it's not going to make|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpv: still live here - but long think from McIntosh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would love to know what redouble means|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it can only mean no stop?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kibs think xxx or xx  for the rex|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Espen deep in thought. rdbl was explained but didn't catch. maybe small cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if so 4@h must be better|pg||
nt|psyck: the @d break kills any game|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  agiain people, I apologize for typing. I try to comment fast and disregard typos. I am not struck by temporary (or permanent, for that matter) dyslexia, if you were wondering :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I would expect declearer to take @c finess through N now to protect the @s's|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psyck: E could have made a double on 1N i suppose, at these colors, as a takeout of @s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: what do you prefer?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: another great decision by erichsen|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: but will the director be called after a slow 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: rdbl explained again as 2 or more small spades|pg||
nt|penseur9: :) and here I just got up (now 7:18am here)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  good to have some @c tricks to fall back on in case @d's don't break|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psyck: even on the @s lead, N could have played another @s after winning @hK to cut off declarer to beat it, but made a normal @c switch instead i guess|pg||
nt|chick: if either E or W bid, we would be saying it was too brave :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  now @S has to cash @sA if he wants that trick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: That's right ... I watched that hand, and North might have been misled by the opening lead of @S6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was a tough hand to get first up in the morning|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 3N has better chances that way, defense often difficult|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ianmcc: is it cold?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|psyck: too much work to do here, & no chance with the @d break & @h fin off|pg||
nt|bjacobs: feels like a crash|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=5708|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: likely win & take @h fin here hoping for some fin or breaks working|pg||
nt|penseur9: mushy and rainy... miserable temperature|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: spade finess refused in case of club ruffs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: on a trump lead, even 3@h does not make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|penseur9: about 6celsius now|pg||

nt|djneill:  North over a strong NT might proffer a nuisance overcall showing @d and a higher suit, but over West's weak NT, North is constrained to Pass because bids need to have some strength with them in order to get to game if needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a good day e/w may bid 3nt and make it on a bad day if you bid 3nt you go a lot down|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a bad day|pg||
nt|djneill:  that club suit looks attractive to run at 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: true maybe the sun will come out to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: the weak nt bernard is true to his acol roots|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|Clubs|nt|djneill:  shold East shoot out 3NT, red geoff|pg||

nt|roswolf: and hope its a good day:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: declarer can make 3N is he guesses it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  the red means East is vulnerable, which means you bid games that are not odds on to make, based on the increased bonus over white (NV)|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@c|pg||

nt|clinch: Match getting tight!|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they could well have competed, if E came in fav vul having passed earlier, E would bid to 3@h at lead|pg||
nt|psyck: *at least|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes still 8 boards to score yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: now for the comparisons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West doubled 3@d next door|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  this is a very good slam|pg||
nt|psyck: Just the bids E wanted to hear|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Grand hangs on the @c finesse, so this is not one you want to miss|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5@c on the other table was an unexpected contract, but it made, obviously|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  very good NS score in the open room here....|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: noooo :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck: not likely to find double fit & hence the slan|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  problem is that W have no controls, so E will have to make another try over 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: callaghan prefers to bid NT on his 4333 shape|pg||
mb|2N|nt|clinch: Will surely bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hasnt East denied 4@H?|pg||
nt|clinch: I mean after Heather's double|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  now it might be easier. One of those hands where opponents bidding is helpful|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if N/S must be in game 4@h best but should fail as in OR|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H = pass or correct|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  particularly since 6@d makes EW|pg||
nt|ady: best hope  is debotton go to 5 diamonds on last hand which also makes on correct diamond view   |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bvdahl:  E even has hopes for a grand :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 7@h coming? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: West doubled in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: with a 15-count, albeit with no aces, it looks thre normal action  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think West is asleep at the wheel here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, had perfect shape to balance|pg||
nt|psyck: and for 2 level part scores, you do not look at vul|pg||
nt|penseur9: what about 5@Cs?|pg||
nt|penseur9: down more :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s 1@h|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||

nt|yo_yo: duck a @S  then  go after @H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He'll go plus, but still, I don't think those passes are a good idea.  I would have doubled 1@H|pg||
nt|ady: best hope for debotton that is|pg||
pc|d2|nt|clinch: That works, but not if heart honours are split|pg||
nt|clinch: miht be better to go for clubs?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bvdahl:  needs 2 @d ruffs to get 800 and win the hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 2 @S and not 2@H (may be planning to bid twice ?)|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  the play here is not interesting. Might as well claim 12 right away|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: only 500 now|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @d lead is actually possible to find. Pd must have 1st round control in @d's on this bidding|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  since he looks for grand by bidding 6@h's|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, he may not have been keen on ruff with nat @h trick, but it was possible to envision 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely to play @D ace and a small @D after|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: that he did|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you have an advantage peter!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: Looks lhe lead was given back with a non @h lead on deal 12|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|psyck: the @cJ will be promoted for 2nd undertrick|pg||
nt|penseur9: but he did...very well done|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: as berry (westra) always says 4th best from your longest :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|nt|ianmcc: clear misdefence|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: North should play @SQ on the second round|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps he did|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|psyck: yes well, operator may not allways get spot cards right|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  can make on a spade lead as well   but again would have to guess well in heart suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|clinch: this was the problem...going for clubs, best to cash AK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: as pointed out on a spade lead if you give up a club   you can really get  heart wrong as if A@H with north you are down|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|clinch: now down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, possible for North to have Hx|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|clinch: Best to cash AK to cater for Hx offside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not finding the 4-4 @H fit cost then|pg||
nt|psyck: Hinden will pick up some this deal anyway, for choosing @h instead of @s|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chick: this sure has turned into a tight match, after such a disparate start|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hK|nt|ianmcc: oh sorry missed altogether very good defence|pg||
nt|penseur9: -3 |pg||
nt|ianmcc: bedtime indeed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|psyck: just 1imp here, but everyone seems to count now|pg||
nt|psyck: ducking the @sk would have worked better with declarer stuck in dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: @sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: w still trying to devine a way to beat it|pg||
nt|bobholl: now it will be only 1 imp |pg||
nt|chick: every IMP has always counted, it is just more obvious now :)|pg||
nt|psyck: getting to the last board & we still don't know who will win the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: 0-4 uis a draw|pg||
nt|chick: 5 boards to compare, still plenty of room for a disaster |pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: 15-15|pg||

mb|1N|an|15-17, bal|mb|p|nt|djneill:  NT-ophile|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|djneill:  rule of 11 would indicate East has the A, J, and 9, so North just needs to decide where he wants to be at trick one|pg||

nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|chick: Sean, do you know what happens in a draw?   Do they have a playoff, or use a tiebreaker?|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha ha ha... well deserved Ian... thanks for your help|pg||
nt|penseur9: this is our last board here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: next board is very routine I will go and many thanks to all|pg||
nt|chick: about 15 needed IMPs for de Botton|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  defense against 5@h's is very interesting. I think a @s lead from the !A is needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Last board of this stanza. We reconvene AT THE LATEST 5.15pm UK Time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: May be earlier.|pg||
nt|penseur9: This is the last board in the CR... I wish to thank Tom, our excellent vugraph operator for a job well done as well as my co-commentator  David Edwin...  We also wish to express ...|pg||
nt|penseur9: our appreciation to the EBU organisers (Jeff Smith and Kevin Comrie)...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: we seem to have skipped 16-18|pg||
nt|clinch: An undignified result for Dhondy, and another at the other table on this deal|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks to our vugraph operator Sean... well done|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: last hand now,  thanks peter and gitte  - until next weekend from Manchester|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: a reminder that... while we have a minute... please note that rounds 5-6 and 7 of this tournament will be played at Solihull, England on November 11 -12 and 13... don't miss it :)|pg||

nt|penseur9: a job very well done by our vugraph operator Mike... thanks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzpv: director wanted them to play 19-20 first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The "4NT = two places to play" convention is quite handy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: :D|pg||
nt|bobholl: this won't be a push :)|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of the EPL, which concludes tomorrow, will also get a berth for the Camrose tourney|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: nice fat penalty coming to someone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Gitte's understudy thanks thanks for the thanks. She went for  a smoke and drink a few boards ago|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: No problem. Pleasure doing so!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: We reconvene at 1.45pm UK time.|pg||
nt|chick: that's about 1.5 hours from now :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|penseur9: and thank you to all our viewers for their insightfull questions ans comments|pg||
nt|penseur9: *and|pg||
nt|penseur9: the final round will start in about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  interesting hand here. 12 tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|penseur9: the next round of 20 boards is scheduled to start in about 1 hour and 15 minutes...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|bvdahl:  4@s's like in the other room is an interesting contract. Since @cK is offside, a @h needs to be ruffed in S|pg||
nt|chick: 3@H smolen showing 5 spades and 4 hearts, game forcing|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: yes blood will flow |pg||
nt|yo_yo: so boring in the other room :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: heather bidding!?|pg||
nt|clinch: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: phantom phantom|pg||
nt|rodal f: The @H splinter came so might easyer to find the @D lead from N now.|pg||
nt|chick: looks like N's 1@C opening at the other table put E on lead and no reason to suspect a club was right|pg||
nt|bobholl: tya especially sean good job :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: So this will be a big pickup for Hinden|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bvdahl:  3 NT is much easier with 9 top tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: the ladies blood will gush out|pg||

pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3863  for heather's pic|pg||

nt|penseur9: ok, bye for now... see you all soon|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: 4 or 6 hand here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|clinch: Better cash all available winners right now!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: at least, after the lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Bidding 3NT seems like a good choice by south with the 4-3-3-3 shape and solif holdings in the minors|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And that was that. Thanks Cornelia|pg||
nt|chick: The TD tells me that the next match will start on the hour, 1h 20m from now|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Thanks operator, and spectators|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And in the next match, my ramblings will be blissfully absent. Have a nice evening all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: And that's it for this round|pg||
nt|chick: Excellent job by our operator Mike Coop :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: We restart at about 5pm - latest 5.15pm UK time. Thanks to the commentators. THe room will be kept open until all the scores are in. See you soon! :)|pg||

pc|d3|nt|psyck: Last deal, thanks to my co-commentator Bill, good job by out operator Bob (who was essentially awake); thanks to the kibs for joinnig us|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|nt|roswolf: hmm this is unclear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pagan hoping for 4 @C tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|d6|pc|sJ|pc|c5|mc|10|nt|ady: another 2 to debotton   looks like they will be ahead   though still a few results to come|pg||
