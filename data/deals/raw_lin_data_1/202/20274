nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North is Fu Zhong I am told|pg||
nt|baldjean: @h split well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a world class player who used to play with Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|andyv:  and @d suit behaves|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 tricks, S should just bid 5@ds|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @H usually a good spade raise |pg||

nt|gracelin: south found a good lead, if he led his partner's suit, H, 4S might make.|pg||
nt|baldjean: with 5/5 in majors I can understand they became active. East's hand is upgraded a lot if there isd a fit and even more so if there is a double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ni hao: welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|d|nt|sybarra: this looks like precision auction |pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: Yes, Shirley, they are competing with Mr. Yeh.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor E has virtually nothing |pg||
nt|gracelin: You will see lot of Precision actions in this tournament, I guess more than 60% of Chinese players play Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recall from other vugraphs  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I must say I play with many chinese players on bbo,  and they play an excellent 2/1 game also!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (since I do not play precision) |pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, you need to know natural system well to also play well with Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hates to balance and find the next bid to be 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but he knows pard has some point given the E bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: *points|pg||
nt|gracelin: this East hand worth a 2S raise in the way I play, but no harm is done.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you mostly play precision, Patrick?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|gracelin: Ths is the 2nd match of the RR from group C.  Both teams have won their first match.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Mr. Gua, sitting north here, is the boss of the automibile company.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW, Sun and Kang are member of China open team many years ago.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sun made his name known in the semi-final match against Italy in the 2004 Olympiad.  Sun and Kang also reached semi-final in the 2011 Vanderbilt in the Spring NABC.|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|gracelin: How could East raise his passed hand partner to game is a little surprising.  He also has wasted honors in club.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: Sun obviously has length in Heart so East seems to have an unsuitable hand for partner.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this case, not a problem|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  but if S had Qxx of @cs and 2 spades, then not ducking would have produced effects EW don't want to think about.|pg||

nt|sybarra: you are either up very early or staying up very late |pg||
nt|baldjean: born and grew up in the USA though|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no entries and such a weak suit, W would have been better off to lead partner's known 5 card suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baldjean: +1 only? so declarer too kno chances in @h, despite East's bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: took no chances*|pg||
mb|3N|nt|baldjean: the latter|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: a boring 3NT, probably.|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be an easy make as the lead will give E three tricks in the suit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|gracelin: China's national team is in group D, Hongkong's national team is in group C.  They lost to Ji Li last match.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 32 teams in the 4 groups will play RR within the group.  Top two teams from each group will quaify for the 8 team fina in the two last days.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|gracelin: defenders can win another 2H, 1S and 1C, so the contract will probably be made.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gracelin: on the other hand, declarer can eatablish 2S, 3C and 2D for 7 tricks.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice inference taken by declarer in @c suit|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d3|pc|c3|nt|gracelin: Group A is the VIP group including sponsors and other VIP's.   |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|gracelin: Sun and Kang's misfortune on board 4 (800 in 4S X) gave away 12 imps.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: Patrick said earlier the main sponsor is playing at the other table |pg||
nt|gracelin: In this way the VIP's are assred of two berths in the final. |pg||

nt|gracelin: stiff|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, a 9-card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  board 10 was 13 imps to EW when 4@h made 5 in CR|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gracelin: 3NT by north is probably where this hand will rest.|pg||
nt|gracelin: some modernest may only overcall 2C with the south hand.  Then north must find a bid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S dbles now |pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is a line between t/o double and simple overcall.  South hand is a little too strong for me to only overcall.|pg||
mb|d|nt|baldjean: precision|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  I wonder what S expects to do with the double?  Spend the rest of the auction trying to convince N he really has none of the other suits?|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: south is from Eric Kokish's school and north is from the same school.|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have bid 5@d over 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  right, but he had to assume that the Q of @s was with S since N didn't ruff with the Q|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andyv:  that seems sensible|pg||
mb|d|mb|5S|nt|sybarra: bet we missed a pass |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it was a guess|pg||
