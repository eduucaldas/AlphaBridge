nt|roswolf: should cost a bundle|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|yo_yo: luckily for NS the @C finesse works|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: fireworks :)|pg||
nt|psyck: if that hand happened, E could have played trump & they would have gotten the extra @d trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  9 tricks EW in @s while NS could get problems in 4@h's because he gets short in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: and the losing club can go on the @SQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: back live now|pg||
nt|chick: NS being very cautious, knowing the spades will probably split badly|pg||
nt|bobholl: brave 4 @D vulnarable|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: but is it one down still?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Declearer needs to set up a @c trick before pulling trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: perhaps, but with 4 diamonds, a lot of crossruff possibilities ... partner surely has no more than 1 spade|pg||

nt|yo_yo: bill niccol points out that it's better for Rosen to throw a @C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: then if clubs 3-3 away goes the @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: apparently it makes if ERichsen leads a @H but i cant see how|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bvdahl:  They will be fighting for a part score here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: I think that does work - West has to lead a spade, giving a ruff-sluff |pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably the alert is for @C maybe 2?|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N is the place to be in with 4@s in trouble on @c lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, serious trouble|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely @S contract NS here will win|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@c can be 11-14 or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Think 8 in @h's is max EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: How do we like the 1@D opening bid?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess east feels not too well with his @D K|pg||
nt|chick: (I do) :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: too strong for a weak 2 so open :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Light openings are mostly a matter of partnership style|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: could 1NT be a transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|psyck: If it is your style, W certainly has a 1@d opening|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: ah that's better|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  You need names here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am not surprised :)|pg||
nt|chick: one of the silliest things people do is leave a gap between a weak 2 bid and an opening 1 bid.  There should never be a hand that is "too strong for a weak 2 and too weak to open ...|pg||
nt|chick: 1"|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: I think even I could make this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Might make as many as 10 in @s's if they are psychic, but I would expect 9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: but bidding it is more difficult|pg||
nt|yo_yo: better than crying|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: likely to get minors right|pg||
nt|penseur9: same here CK|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not sure how you are meant to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: this has no real chance actually as cards are, but likely other room will also be in 4@s-1|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but not so many entries in North to play monors toward dummy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: will probably need to do that for 9, 10 looks too much :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  minors|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpv: he is stil smiling!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: still|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: @C suit favourable for him but he doesnt know that yet|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|psyck: tried to put dec to test immediately...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: cannot afford to draw trumps, so will continue some minor cards|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely cornelia :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|chick: so I think Bob nailed it .... it is too strong for a weak 2 bid, therefore must open 1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: Still, the defence need to do well her ... they must attack clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  good start for declearer. Might try anothther @d and go for xruff|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bvdahl:  9 now regardless, either on xruff or because E can't ruffthe @cQ|pg||
nt|penseur9: he can now cross ruff for 4 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: not me, 27 zars (need 26 to open), and 12 total points (need 12 to open)|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: 2@H is an enterprising overcall|pg||

nt|psyck: Thanks Bob|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Some variance of evaluation on board 2. Five Hearts doubled here, Three Diamonds next door|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unusual to see a penalty double of a strong NT|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: N/S must play the 19-21 1NT opening|pg||
nt|psyck: unless they have methods to show 65, S may just try to get to 4@h|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: to show a balanced 19-20 Jones will x first then bid NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North has opened 1NT as a preempt I suppose (rather than 1@D) ... but the hand is really very strong for such an approach|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I use 3NT in this spot to show 5@s and 4@h's. A classic problem hand over strong 2 NT|pg||

nt|psyck: 4N would probably be quantitative here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, a good rule of thumb:  whenever partner makes a natural NT bid, then the next bid of 4NT is quantitative|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Hard to blame South for being in the tank here|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|psyck: I think some number of NT better than continueing to fish with 4@d|pg||

pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: is it your partnership style to allow a 3@D overcall with the South hand?|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  after @d lead and a couple of ducks, it is natural to play @c to T and then run @sJ|pg||

nt|clinch: Let's see how the slam bidding is |pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time but not in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if other table would choose @s preempt too, not that they were getting anywhere else whatever they do|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|clinch: Quite tricky to bid, I'd say|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|psyck: Frances judged right to stop in 3NT on the 6@s-2 hand deal 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: light opening from East - no way to stop below game now|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Extremely well done, assuming partner opened the bidding|pg||
nt|penseur9: can 4@S make here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: glad they are not playing gazzili (strong 2@C) i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  no. For starters, NS can play 3x @H's for a trump promotion|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and there will still be a @c loser|pg||
nt|penseur9: playing with screens, it could be East thinking|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  3@h x could be painful|pg||
nt|penseur9: for lack of a better word :)|pg||
nt|chick: well, EW missing out on a nice heart partscore|pg||
nt|chick: even game on lackidaisical defense|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a pure cross ruff may be even game|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: they might get to 4@H now|pg||
nt|clinch: And so it proved|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it did |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was effectively same as here till 3N|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: what is rex?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with me it's first round control|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may lead to 4@H - West will be a little scared of spades|pg||
nt|psyck: except 2N instead of the 2@h here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  though might be hard to get more than -1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|clinch: Don't really like 3@D myself|pg||
nt|psyck: 3NT could have been defeated here other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not unreasonable to head for 5@D ... but it's not going to make|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpv: still live here - but long think from McIntosh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would love to know what redouble means|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it can only mean no stop?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kibs think xxx or xx  for the rex|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Espen deep in thought. rdbl was explained but didn't catch. maybe small cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if so 4@h must be better|pg||
nt|psyck: the @d break kills any game|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: E could have made a double on 1N i suppose, at these colors, as a takeout of @s|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: what do you prefer?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: another great decision by erichsen|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: but will the director be called after a slow 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: rdbl explained again as 2 or more small spades|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: even on the @s lead, N could have played another @s after winning @hK to cut off declarer to beat it, but made a normal @c switch instead i guess|pg||
nt|chick: if either E or W bid, we would be saying it was too brave :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: That's right ... I watched that hand, and North might have been misled by the opening lead of @S6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was a tough hand to get first up in the morning|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 3N has better chances that way, defense often difficult|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck: too much work to do here, & no chance with the @d break & @h fin off|pg||
nt|bjacobs: feels like a crash|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=5708|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: likely win & take @h fin here hoping for some fin or breaks working|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: on a trump lead, even 3@h does not make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

nt|ady: Frances decided that is enough with just 3 jacks|pg||
nt|henryb:  which suit you should bid over a takeout double is interesting with 4-4. This is being discussed on the voice|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|clinch: Yes, I personally would bid 2S!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: a@C club right   game would have made|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: ok to bid spades first if you are given  another go   but otherwise a guess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|clinch: The only reason to bid 2@s, of course, is to anticipate another round|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  The issue is suppose you bid 2@h and partner continues with 3@d -- |pg||
nt|henryb:  partner might be 4-3-1-5 with an even better hand|pg||
nt|ady: if partner continues 3@D   should have a full heart fit|pg||

nt|clinch: Match getting tight!|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they could well have competed, if E came in fav vul having passed earlier, E would bid to 3@h at lead|pg||
nt|psyck: *at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: now for the comparisons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West doubled 3@d next door|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  this is a very good slam|pg||
nt|psyck: Just the bids E wanted to hear|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Grand hangs on the @c finesse, so this is not one you want to miss|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|psyck: not likely to find double fit & hence the slan|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  problem is that W have no controls, so E will have to make another try over 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: callaghan prefers to bid NT on his 4333 shape|pg||
mb|2D|nt|clinch: Will surely bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hasnt East denied 4@H?|pg||
nt|clinch: I mean after Heather's double|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  now it might be easier. One of those hands where opponents bidding is helpful|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  E even has hopes for a grand :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 7@h coming? :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: West doubled in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: with a 15-count, albeit with no aces, it looks thre normal action  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think West is asleep at the wheel here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, had perfect shape to balance|pg||
nt|psyck: and for 2 level part scores, you do not look at vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: So, how to play this? Can see that it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: duck a @S  then  go after @H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He'll go plus, but still, I don't think those passes are a good idea.  I would have doubled 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: That works, but not if heart honours are split|pg||
nt|clinch: miht be better to go for clubs?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bvdahl:  needs 2 @d ruffs to get 800 and win the hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 2 @S and not 2@H (may be planning to bid twice ?)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: i dont have much success with AK10x  opp xxx |pg||
nt|clinch: which also works|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: only 500 now|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @d lead is actually possible to find. Pd must have 1st round control in @d's on this bidding|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  since he looks for grand by bidding 6@h's|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, he may not have been keen on ruff with nat @h trick, but it was possible to envision 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely to play @D ace and a small @D after|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: you have an advantage peter!|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psyck: Looks lhe lead was given back with a non @h lead on deal 12|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|psyck: the @cJ will be promoted for 2nd undertrick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: as berry (westra) always says 4th best from your longest :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: North should play @SQ on the second round|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps he did|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: yes well, operator may not allways get spot cards right|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|clinch: this was the problem...going for clubs, best to cash AK|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes, possible for North to have Hx|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|clinch: Best to cash AK to cater for Hx offside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not finding the 4-4 @H fit cost then|pg||
nt|psyck: Hinden will pick up some this deal anyway, for choosing @h instead of @s|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|psyck: just 1imp here, but everyone seems to count now|pg||

nt|psyck: @sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: w still trying to devine a way to beat it|pg||
nt|bobholl: now it will be only 1 imp |pg||
nt|chick: every IMP has always counted, it is just more obvious now :)|pg||
nt|psyck: getting to the last board & we still don't know who will win the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: 0-4 uis a draw|pg||
