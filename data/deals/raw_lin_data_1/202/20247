nt|vugraphzrm: This deal seems to be interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: does E really open?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: the bid probably will not finish before level of 5.... for both lines :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Yes i think so too. Bopth sides have enough tricks for 5|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kemperg: ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 1@H - 1NT F1 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: This might cost lots for any of these teams|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: Not shure this is correct too|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass pass first Justas?|pg||
nt|kemperg: technical problems in lithuania?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like that|pg||
nt|kemperg: look like 8 tricks, 2@H,2D and 4@Cs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i watched this board at Laurilas table, and declarer went -1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S a better contract. 3NT does not like this lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup: 4 @s is better but this makes without @d lead -it seldom comes in these secvences ,but Garvey found it here well done|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gluckenval: Garvey-Carroll play a 5M system, with 1@C 11-13 balanced or 17+ any, 1@D may have longer clubs and ususally unbalanced. After 1@C their responses are in canap√®. 1NT = 14-16 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: (perfect range, imho :))|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|gluckenval: The italians a nat. system with 1@D 4+ cards, and strong (15-17) NT. They also play the new version of 2@D = 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzrm: nera|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: l am a fan of leading his own suit except....|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Garvey-Carroll play also in the national Ireland team|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzrm: It seems like N wants something more than 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: a 9 counter to open but still 4 @s makes with good guess -not bidden ofcause but 10 available tricks |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kemperg: thats a 50% game, :( @HK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Well that is antural with 17 points and partners 1NT opening|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|gluckenval: 6@C makable... but... honestly... really hard to find it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: natural*|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: YEs very hard to find indeed|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 6NT makable with @SJ ?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lead*|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: i think with diamond J|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: he can make if he guesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: well not sure about lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm:  but 6Nt is doable|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: WOW|pg||
nt|gluckenval: at double dummy it is very easy... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: seems like 3D was a singleton or void in S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gluckenval: in the meantime, at board 2  the @Ss were not found in OR too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Yes and thats a shame actually|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vbman: can make tons of tricks with an endplay|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: so now declarer needs to make a guess on diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: now north can handle this +1 even if west has 4 clubs -because he is squezed in minors ,but wrong guess and =|pg||
