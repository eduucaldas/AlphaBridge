mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|clinch: These are, indeed, the two leading teams this year in this particular Premier League|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: Should West rebid 2@S, 2NT or 2@D? or ?|pg||
nt|clinch: I feel he'll bid 2@s|pg||
nt|petergill: David Bakhshi was 2nd in the Vanderbilt this year|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|clinch: and my first wrong prediction|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bakhshi goes for the less revealing (to NS) 2NT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Could rebid 2@C if playing Gazzilli, but that might confuse some of our audience|pg||

nt|clinch: Even with this lead, very tough to make |pg||
nt|clinch: Will need a misdefence|pg||
nt|petergill: @S6 lead was less revealing (about @SJ)  than @S2 lead would have been  |pg||
nt|roswolf: h9i all|pg||
nt|petergill: Tom T hoping for @D 3-2|pg||
nt|clinch: Hello Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Geoff|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s8|pc|d5|nt|clinch: The Hinden team, though less well-known, is probably the most cohesive unit in the league... they've played together for years|pg||
nt|petergill: Frances Hinden is an excellent player. She is well known on BBO Forums for making sensible comments there. She rarely (if ever) plays in women's bridge events|pg||
nt|clinch: Townsend was, for a long time, part of that unit|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a clear -1 the @C switch is all too obvious looking at that dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: I I played some bridge in the same team as Graham Osborne about 10 years ago. An excellent player, though not as well known as the others.|pg||
nt|petergill: N worried that E might have bare queen in @H, @DA and @CK|pg||
nt|roswolf: north mustnt lazily duck this|pg||
nt|petergill: = big problem now for North|pg||
nt|mathat: if take the K and retern @c make |pg||
nt|clinch: Has to rise here|pg||
nt|clinch: and return @S I think|pg||
nt|petergill: as otherwise S might get endplayed for 9th trick, if he ducks, on that layout|pg||
nt|clinch: Not a nice first board to play or defend!|pg||
nt|roswolf: no good to see north taking his time|pg||
nt|petergill: If E has @CK and @DA10 and @HQ, then E wins @HQ if you duck, and throws S in, in @s or @D|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: N had no clues about the club and @D layouts, as far as I can see|pg||
nt|roswolf: he was thinking about his switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
nt|clinch: He passed the first test|pg||
