nt|othered1: EW have 8 tricks, so NS had to pay attention.  Wonder if return of @H2 led south to believe north had only 4 @H?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|arunbapat: but surely difficult hand to play..|pg||

nt|psyck: had|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|othered1: 10 lucky tricks are available to NS here in @S.  Not really good enough for a nonvul game.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|arunbapat: this hand looks routine 4S |pg||
nt|mathat: 1 @c1 @d 2 NT |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: ns must act early enough in clubs to beat 3nt/4 @h -not so easy after @c opening and south to lead|pg||
nt|psyck: as the cards are, defense has time even after non @c lead maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes lead not needed but then hurry|pg||
nt|runnerup: this irish team seems to have a great score so far |pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: did not look for @h fit due to those @s?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: right, have to at least switch at 1st chance|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|mathat: 3 NT and 4 @s is ok|pg||
nt|arunbapat: N chose to play 3NT with 4333 hand..|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 NT need finesse @h|pg||
nt|arunbapat: which will work here are leader has both AK of clubs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|arunbapat: he will take D finesse.|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 3nt works better here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: this will test the defense if a @h is ducked|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psyck: they know the strong @s's in the closed hand now|pg||
nt|psyck: 2N realy & 3@h min balanced|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt =100% without @c lead |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, quite an impossible lead to find|pg||
pc|sA|nt|arunbapat: club lead now he will be on tender hook he may not know which finesse to take for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|mathat: with @d finesse go down with @h make|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|runnerup: but it was not easy to beat 4 @h either like other result shows|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: are we after a @S to see a new @D.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|psyck: was easier here as S knw the @s & @d strength with declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: other room should have found the switch too maybe, as if pd lead from Qxxx, there is no future in continuing @s|pg||
nt|psyck: this is likely to score very well for the Irish|pg||
