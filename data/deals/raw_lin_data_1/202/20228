mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm the full auction in the other room isnt given - good job i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: sorry about that - technical problems|pg||

nt|petergill: event website http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2011Aug-Dec/Premier%20League/Ranks.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D transfer to @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: this contract has some chances|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 3 cards in @H|pg||
nt|clinch: This looks to have better chances than the doomed 4@h in the closed room|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mathat: 2 @s 2@c 2@d and 3 @h if play x to the 9 or x to the Q|pg||
nt|petergill: S might play W for @HK, given that West did EW's bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i favor declarer but it is a rabbi hand ie. dropping the @CK |pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, the heart guess is key, and likely to be misguessed|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, easy for us, hard for declarer who cannot see that bare king|pg||
nt|petergill: I think she is most likely to play hearts next|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: YES THE DOUBLE MAY BACKFIRE|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL DONE|pg||
nt|petergill: Good play, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: One step passed |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|petergill: S now thinks W is 4351 shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Frances is thinking: @D to king and ace, then ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @d exit and can then play heart to endplay E in 3 suits - doesn't work as dummy is squeezed in 2 suits to discard on 3rd @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: @SA +Q PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON WEST|pg||
nt|petergill: !AS and @S then @D9 exit - might still have to guess @H|pg||
nt|mathat: maybe make with edplay in @c|pg||
nt|clinch: I think she is definitely thinking endplay somehow|pg||
nt|clinch: but every suit offers exposure if played|pg||
nt|roswolf: YES this is a good test of card-reading and endplay technique|pg||
nt|clinch: Glad I'm up here!|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2011Aug-Dec/Premier%20League/Ranks.htm  for standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a little easier for us:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Fantastic hands, both this one and Bd 18 - almost impossible to analyse - lucky specs have both voice commentary and written commentary to choose from|pg||
nt|roswolf: south is a fine technician and this is a hand for that virtue|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot see a 100% solution - can anyone?|pg||
nt|clinch: Ace and queen of spades seems sensible to me here|pg||
nt|clinch: passing the problem|pg||
nt|clinch: Nobody will wish to play anything!|pg||
nt|mathat: with K @h in E 100 % make|pg||
nt|petergill: How about @D to king and ace ...|pg||
nt|petergill: forces @D9 exit, pitching @SQ from dummy!!!|pg||
nt|clinch: I am fairly sure she's thinking W has K@h|pg||
nt|petergill: then @H to 9, forces spade exit, then exit @C9|pg||
nt|mathat: now need the K @h or J @h in E|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that works as long as W does not have both @HK and @HJ, so is not 100%|pg||
nt|roswolf: she must NOT play clubs i think anything else is ok i think - if east is stripped of spades and diamonds he can be endplayed - depends i think where declarer thinks the @HK IS|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|clinch: Decided to guess early|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah unlucky south payed for the doubler to have it|pg||
nt|petergill: I think my (extremely odd-looking) line makes as long as E has either @HJ or @HK or both|pg||
nt|petergill: @H exit is best now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|clinch: It takes both skill and courage to play in that kind of fashion, Peter, but you may well be right|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer should still gain some imps for -1|pg||
nt|petergill: declarer is heading for -1 now |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes another tough hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|clinch: Yes, she won't feel good about it though|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Momentum: in the 2008 World Champs, my team (Australia) lost 5-25 to Tom Townsend's tetam (england) in teh very first amtch. We ended up having a terrivlbe event, adn tehy came 2nd ...|pg||
nt|petergill: into OItaly. |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|mathat: 4 @h very easy from EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Pardon typos - I pressed Send by accident|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|clinch: Yes, another respite here|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT = some sort of good raise, a useful agreement to have|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the 2@S bid fills me with horror|pg||
nt|clinch: Why? Partner opened 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|clinch: Seems normal to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in these days provided pard doesnt take it too seriously no big deal at the rubber bridge tale a different story|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I suppose Geoffs bid more soundly than Peters - I always raise (2@S) with support on hands like these|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: imo it gives opps fielders choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: you are vul at teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Hinden: I would have bid 2N good raise - wishes to call TD|pg||
nt|clinch: Without the raise, partner won't know you have support, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Doesn't seem to bother for now|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no-one doubles for penalties any more:(|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = just in case partner has the perfect passed hand, e.g. xx, KQxx, KJxxx, Jx or the like|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|clinch: So 2NT wasn't alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Correct|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|clinch: Don't think it will matter|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|clinch: Though a little worried that Frances may be feeling strain|pg||
nt|roswolf: but it pinpoints the non-wastage of values in that suit for opps - i think i am with terence reese's view of these hands|pg||
nt|petergill: Even at the unsuitable vulnerability, 4@SX might cost only 500 with good declarer play|pg||
mc|11|nt|roswolf: or -110 with good defence:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: -1100|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H by E over 2@S would have been weaker than 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: DIRECTOR CALL|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Only N/E had an alerted 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Apparent erroneous alert by W|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: *E|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: agreement of 2N is natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing with screens produces these situations|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: E thougght it was a good raise in H, but W doesn't agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Hinden would have bid 3S if alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: No rectification for now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|clinch: Won't alter result, though maybe some kind of procedural ticking off ahead|pg||
nt|petergill: so W bid 3@S as if 2NT was natural, showing 6 @H and a good hand, offering choice of games|pg||
nt|mathat: with dbl finesse @s 7 make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a slam should be reached here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think procedural penalties can be overdone. Let's just play bridge. |pg||
nt|petergill: Tempting to bid 5@C voidwood (or exclusion keycard) now |pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, something big looming :)|pg||
nt|petergill: then settle in 6@S when a keycard is missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: 4 1c splinter|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petergill: or perhaps a slower approach might be better, trying to stop in 4@S when 10 tricks are the limit|pg||
nt|roswolf: we appear to have technical issues concerning the auctions in the other room - sorry if this spoils the entertainment|pg||
nt|clinch: May be another IMP to Hinden, as it's far from clear that 13 tricks will be made|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D shows good long @D and 4!+ spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Yes...sorry about that :s|pg||
nt|petergill: unless East misunderstands :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|roswolf: i assume 4@D implies massive spade support - although many would play it as a splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@H over 4NT would be 2 keycards, 5@S is 2 + @SQ when West decides (reasonably enough) to pretend to have @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat:   2 A and extra card in @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you play a short@D as many do - a splinter IS possible|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Yes, 4@S also was possible bid by West. |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C splinter I mean|pg||
nt|clinch: So... 12 or 13 tricks?|pg||
nt|clinch: I say 12|pg||
nt|petergill: Can pick up @S K108x in either hand - not sure what the best play is. |pg||
nt|petergill: @SQ covers K108x in S, low spade to ace or jack covers K108x in N|pg||
nt|mathat: x @s to the J becs if N HASE k 10 xx @s go down|pg||
nt|clinch: Most spectators are saying 13 to me|pg||
nt|petergill: so who is more likely to have K108x, that's what Tom Townsend is thinking. Safety play is everything, overtrick is irrelevant at imps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|clinch: Townsend is exceptionally good at card combinations - I trust whatever he ends up doing!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think tom may well take a safety play silly to go down|pg||
nt|petergill: small to jack doesn't cover K108x in South hand|pg||
nt|clinch: 12 then|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugraphzpu: Just waiting for Bakhshi to return...|pg||
nt|petergill: North was more likely than S to have 4 spades, as N passed at fav vul over 1D (--> @S void less likely), hence Tom's play|pg||

nt|petergill: card suit) belong in NT. The rest of the expert world (except perhaps Zia) perhaps to their detriment, do not seem to agree with him. Too many losers in 6322, he says. |pg||
pc|d7|nt|clinch: This was not the winning line here; better to play A@d then very difficult for East to pitch a loser effectively|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1@H anD BID NATURALLY THEREAFTER|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 7: I think that passing on an "almost 5 loser hand" with both majors is losing bridge. If your system has a weak major 2-suiter opening, use it then kick on to the 3 level, or ...|pg||

nt|clinch: Not many IMPs on the board, but much potential|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: 4@H seems an odd contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 6 imps in 7 boards is low scoring, bu there have been chances aplenty for swings|pg||

mb|3H!|an|3-6 Game Force|mb|p|nt|clinch: OK thanks|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: Being best known as a rubber player, Norman Selway went for the good old-fashioned rubber bridge style 3@H rebid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Graham Osborne went for most duplicate players' choice of 2NT|pg||
nt|clinch: by the wrong hand in some ways|pg||
nt|clinch: May need to guess spades well|pg||
nt|petergill: s!6 in dummy is useful, but both @d honours are offside|pg||
nt|petergill: @S6 in dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H was the choice in the other room - not 2nt|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: Swing due partly (mainly) to luck - @D 3-3 with KJ offside and @H 3-3 suited 4@H but doesn't suit 3NT|pg||
nt|clinch: Even the second spade stop is to no avail|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|petergill: He's wondering whether to exit with @S5 or @S10 then @S5|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, nothing much to think about really....|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|hT|nt|petergill: perhaps a tiny bit concerned that 2 rounds of spades might trouble partner a bit in the discarding|pg||
nt|clinch: He is very meticulous |pg||
nt|petergill: no, no such worry, but it would be horrible if East got squeezed by 4 rounds of clubs, if North had @CAKx|pg||
nt|petergill: so E was thinking about that before his @s exit - what to discard on clubs if that happened|pg||
nt|clinch: That was probably his concern, but if North had that he wouldn't have AKJ of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: but 3@H had shown 3-6 in red suits (I missed that) so club worry was non-existent|pg||

nt|mdgraham: from a linguistic point of view, transfer probably isn't quite the right term - ok, it shows hearts, but partner doesn't have to bid them|pg||

nt|bjacobs: With the diamonds and hearts 3-3, this is certainly makeable double dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not sure about single dummy|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|petergill: I sometimes do that - overthink the hand, thinking that every move by the opponents has full-on logic behind it, when it doesn't|pg||

nt|petergill: Frances Hinden is an excellent player. She is well known on BBO Forums for making sensible comments there. She rarely (if ever) plays in women's bridge events|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: Extremely well done, assuming partner opened the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: they might get to 4@H now|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what is rex?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with me it's first round control|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: this may lead to 4@H - West will be a little scared of spades|pg||
nt|psyck: except 2N instead of the 2@h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Don't really like 3@D myself|pg||
nt|psyck: 3NT could have been defeated here other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not unreasonable to head for 5@D ... but it's not going to make|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|vugraphzpv: still live here - but long think from McIntosh|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: Espen deep in thought. rdbl was explained but didn't catch. maybe small cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if so 4@h must be better|pg||
nt|psyck: the @d break kills any game|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what do you prefer?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|yo_yo: another great decision by erichsen|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but will the director be called after a slow 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: rdbl explained again as 2 or more small spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: even on the @s lead, N could have played another @s after winning @hK to cut off declarer to beat it, but made a normal @c switch instead i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: That's right ... I watched that hand, and North might have been misled by the opening lead of @S6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was a tough hand to get first up in the morning|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 3N has better chances that way, defense often difficult|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|psyck: too much work to do here, & no chance with the @d break & @h fin off|pg||

nt|roswolf: the weak nt going for a burton perhaps|pg||
