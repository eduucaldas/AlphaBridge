nt|ralfwil: i watched this board at Laurilas table, and declarer went -1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S a better contract. 3NT does not like this lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|gluckenval: Garvey-Carroll play a 5M system, with 1@C 11-13 balanced or 17+ any, 1@D may have longer clubs and ususally unbalanced. After 1@C their responses are in canap√®. 1NT = 14-16 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: (perfect range, imho :))|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gluckenval: The italians a nat. system with 1@D 4+ cards, and strong (15-17) NT. They also play the new version of 2@D = 18-19 balanced|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzrm: It seems like N wants something more than 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|runnerup: a 9 counter to open but still 4 @s makes with good guess -not bidden ofcause but 10 available tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: thats a 50% game, :( @HK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Well that is antural with 17 points and partners 1NT opening|pg||

nt|gluckenval: 6NT makable with @SJ ?|pg||
