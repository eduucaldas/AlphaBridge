nt|psyck: one little pip could have made all the difference there|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H AJ better than @S, and no dbl On 2@S|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, a well judged lead|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|riccho:  Bd 3 EW played 3@d with 12 easy tricks. A success only in caparision to the other table, where EW tried 3NT (-1)|pg||
mb|r|mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: not obvious line of play here, but cards all fav|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will make easily as the @s lead will probably set up 3@s tricks for S|pg||
nt|psyck: with minor honos well placed, no way to go wrong even if he wins @sA now|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  AFAIK NS are playing a strong club system|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|riccho:  that is perhaps the only reason for opening 1@s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: they bid a tad too much other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|riccho:  The main reason for playing strong club systems is NOT the 1@c opening but the possibility to limit (and stretch) the 1level openings|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe they could have used some lebensohlish seq to stop in 3@d instead|pg||
nt|psyck: What you open with N's hand is largely a matter of partnership style|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|riccho:  But S may think different about the opening here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|riccho:  a @c lead would have beaten that I guess, but now |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|riccho:  5@s 3@d 3@h 1@c = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: those who open light, say hands that satisfy Zar count, will open 1@s.  Some may open 2@s like other room, some may open 3@s & possibly some may pass|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s5|nt|riccho:  a bid relieving smile on S face perhaps? |pg||
nt|riccho:  ugly slam here|pg||
nt|riccho:  and S still needs @d finesse or 3-2|pg||
nt|riccho:  or singleton @dQ|pg||
nt|riccho:  THe problem with streching opening bids is, that partner has to take it into his reasoning as well |pg||
nt|riccho:  stretching|pg||
pc|s7|nt|riccho:  yes and 6@d is an ok slam here, but they didnÂ´t reach it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|s8|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|riccho:  now the relieving smile :)|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d9|pc|c7|nt|kemperg: N is too strong for a weak opening, and 4@S in first hand is ridiculous.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|wstuart: Surely it is up to east to continue past 4@S if a slam is possible,|pg||
