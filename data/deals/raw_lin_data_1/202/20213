pc|dA|nt|othered1: East will have 9 tricks with either normal play in black suits -- 2 finesses in @C or lead towards @SJ.  Auction might make me prefer the latte.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|psyck: had|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: 10 lucky tricks are available to NS here in @S.  Not really good enough for a nonvul game.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|arunbapat: this hand looks routine 4S |pg||
nt|mathat: 1 @c1 @d 2 NT |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|runnerup: ns must act early enough in clubs to beat 3nt/4 @h -not so easy after @c opening and south to lead|pg||
nt|psyck: as the cards are, defense has time even after non @c lead maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes lead not needed but then hurry|pg||
nt|runnerup: this irish team seems to have a great score so far |pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: did not look for @h fit due to those @s?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: right, have to at least switch at 1st chance|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|arunbapat: 1H is relay |pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: hmm, nt may work better there ill not be a @c lead:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|arunbapat: showing many types of hand...2NT now show balance hand with 23/24 HCP|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|runnerup: here lead needed no chance for me|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|mathat: 3 NT and 4 @s is ok|pg||
nt|arunbapat: N chose to play 3NT with 4333 hand..|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 NT need finesse @h|pg||
nt|arunbapat: which will work here are leader has both AK of clubs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|arunbapat: he will take D finesse.|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 3nt works better here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: this will test the defense if a @h is ducked|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: they know the strong @s's in the closed hand now|pg||
nt|psyck: 2N realy & 3@h min balanced|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt =100% without @c lead |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, quite an impossible lead to find|pg||
pc|s2|nt|arunbapat: club lead now he will be on tender hook he may not know which finesse to take for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|mathat: with @d finesse go down with @h make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|runnerup: but it was not easy to beat 4 @h either like other result shows|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: are we after a @S to see a new @D.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: was easier here as S knw the @s & @d strength with declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: other room should have found the switch too maybe, as if pd lead from Qxxx, there is no future in continuing @s|pg||
nt|psyck: this is likely to score very well for the Irish|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
