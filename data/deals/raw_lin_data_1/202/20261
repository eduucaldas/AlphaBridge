mb|1N|nt|bobholl: hi welcome all :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Baard |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone!|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  There was a lot of swings in the first one, so there is every chance to watch some interesting bridge here :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Hello Cornelia|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: re Bob :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: can the hinden team catch up in this round? |pg||
nt|chick: A rather mundane partscore to start off the last session|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Hello (finally)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bvdahl:  looks like EW has a game in @h's and are well on their way to finding it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chick: Hinden came back from a 40 IMP deficit to within 10 points of the lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bvdahl:  even with the KQ offside in trumps, it  should not be too difficult to make 4@h's because of the @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: East's spades look as good as the AKQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  Seems like we will start with a normal 4@s Where declearer has to either set up dummy's @c's or ruff as many !'d's as possible|pg||
nt|penseur9: welcome for the 4th (of)7) rpund of this great tourney|pg||
nt|penseur9: *rounds that is :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bvdahl:  N found the best lead, and declearer can play for 11 by finessing @s's early|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: 7 tricks is my guess 3@C 2@H 1@S 1@D|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  The @s finesse is close to certain after the bidding and the lead, because S must have something in @d's since N didn't lead a high @d. Thus N must habe @s K for his opening lead|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|chick: game is cold and if the @D finesse loses, he could go down ... would you take that finesse?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: sorry @S* finesse ...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: now that he got the @s right, can even make an overtrick with @c breaking|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|bvdahl:  I am not sure I would, but I hard to find scenario where the finesse is not good|pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: I agree, and in MPs absolutely, but at teams, is it worth the 3% risk for 1 imp?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  If you are 95% sure, you take it because you win 1 IMP 19 out of 20 times and lose 11 1 out of 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: sorry for that - misclaim|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: 20-20 board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bvdahl:  I would expect bidding to go 1@s (1 NT) 2@h p p p, and then W has a choice|pg||
nt|penseur9: after 3 rounds, the Teltcher team stands in 2nd place while the De Botton is in 4th|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bvdahl:  whether or not to re-open|pg||
nt|chick: another 20-20 partscore, neither side has a serious fit|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bvdahl:  To defeat this contract the defense had to not touch @d's, but very dofficult to get it right|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  def needed 3@d truicks|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  tricks... sorry for typos|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  True, but I feel bridge players need to think more like poker players, and that is a good example of how a poker player would approach the problem|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: I've taken over, if that's OK with you all.|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  We are back...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|yo_yo: double seems normal from North (to show @H)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will east bid 1 or 2nt ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d maybe will be hard|pg||
nt|penseur9: note that the OR starts with 18 to 20 in order to have comparisons when they get back to  1... so we will not have compairisons here in the CR :(|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike, welcome :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Aggressive 3@h's opening from South. Many would be happy to open 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: Hi Ian welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I sure would, but perhaps NS have some other meaning for 2@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bvdahl:  They will be fighting for a part score here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: I think that does work - West has to lead a spade, giving a ruff-sluff |pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably the alert is for @C maybe 2?|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N is the place to be in with 4@s in trouble on @c lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, serious trouble|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely @S contract NS here will win|pg||
nt|chick: in case anyone is confused, we are just catching up on a couple of boards lost in a crash, we'll be back to live play in just a moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@c can be 11-14 or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Think 8 in @h's is max EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: How do we like the 1@D opening bid?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess east feels not too well with his @D K|pg||
nt|chick: (I do) :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: too strong for a weak 2 so open :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Light openings are mostly a matter of partnership style|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: could 1NT be a transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|psyck: If it is your style, W certainly has a 1@d opening|pg||
mb|r|nt|yo_yo: ah that's better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  You need names here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am not surprised :)|pg||
nt|chick: one of the silliest things people do is leave a gap between a weak 2 bid and an opening 1 bid.  There should never be a hand that is "too strong for a weak 2 and too weak to open ...|pg||
nt|chick: 1"|pg||
nt|ianmcc: can 4@h live?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I think even I could make this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Might make as many as 10 in @s's if they are psychic, but I would expect 9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: obviously not|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but bidding it is more difficult|pg||
nt|yo_yo: better than crying|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: likely to get minors right|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: my apologies. Had an internet blackout. Will try to resume service after this board.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: Not sure how you are meant to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: this has no real chance actually as cards are, but likely other room will also be in 4@s-1|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but not so many entries in North to play monors toward dummy|pg||
mc|9|nt|psyck: will probably need to do that for 9, 10 looks too much :)|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this needs some help from the defence|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, but it's doubtful whether declarer would have blocked the suit ... more likely he holds up, and now it's down|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  9? West probably only pitched 1 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, normal, looking at those @h in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Erichsen can't believe that pull to 4NT...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: and now back to our scheduled broadcast :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@S looks makeable|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow, the OR catching up... only 2 boards behind... we might get compairisons yet :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a routine 4@h|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: that's a song :)|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Mike! :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|bvdahl:  Another interesting hand. I think 4@s's can be made EW, and NS has a good save in 5@d -1|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: 2@C=3-card support, 9-11 hcp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might make a big difference to the result of this contract|pg||
nt|psyck: i'd lead @s6|pg||
nt|penseur9: another partial contract here I guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Well it works a lot better on this lead than @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: dec still has a 2nd stopper & should be ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: maybe they are playing strong Club  EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3NT too will be bid now i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: There's a heap of work to do ... probably need an endplay here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Even with @s's 4-1, the good @c break would have helped declearer|pg||
nt|chick: I approve of the 2@D bid.  Some might make a takeout double (to check for spade fit) and then correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: a sort of drury bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but they cant be if we look at hand 5|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  W could have tried 2@h in balancing pos, but if 2@h's makes, 1NT is likely to go down|pg||
nt|chick: this is another thing I personally dislike ... bypassing a 4 card major to rebid 1N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: hand 2|pg||
nt|psyck: nicely done, 3N is superior|pg||
nt|psyck: it is normal to bypass in Walsh style|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: it certainly is when the defense sets up hearts for you|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: yes indeed, far from over |pg||
nt|psyck: N played @hK to try creating more entries in S hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he was thinking: if South has @HA, then I better win the first @H and clear the spade suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was a nice play, but doesn't help here|pg||
nt|psyck: Operator, It would be nice if players names were entered|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right, we want to know who we are complimenting (or insulting)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  actually... on that lead, the 1c loser will disappear|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @c loser|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  since declearer can ruff out the @hA and sicard a @c on @hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: hey, how's it going?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  discard. Sorry all, I type fast, so there will be some errors|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: wonder why callaghan didnt open 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: Not a good start for Hinden with a poor choice of takeout double on deal 1|pg||
nt|chick: I know, that's why I dislike walsh style|pg||
nt|psyck: you  can always find it later in hands with GF values|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: 2@H is an enterprising overcall|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 12 opposite 12 are these slam tries?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzpv: That should answer your question :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bvdahl:  This should be 1 down. Even if E does not find the @h shift now, there are only 6 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzpv: That any better?|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: No problem :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, declarer certainly has an endplay in mind, if he played @HQ, rather than play for @HJ onside|pg||
nt|penseur9: they may try but probably 5@H here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is there a shortage of oxygen?|pg||
nt|penseur9: oops :(|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4NT may prove a desaster here depending on the lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @sA at least -1|pg||
nt|penseur9: well desaster may be a little too strong a word, but...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: try disaster|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: hmm|pg||
nt|chick: so the theory goes, but usually ends up missing the 4 card fit|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha ha ha|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good duck of the diamond by South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS play 2@h=5/5 hearts and a minor in first and second seat  |pg||
nt|bvdahl:  It will be a very good board NS, but it was a natural contract and lead, so I would not at all be surprised to se 550 on both tables here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: as here .... N certainly had GF values|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: west will be squeezed in @C @S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: 3N is cold here on any lead, while 4@s could go down on some layouts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And now... claim|pg||
mc|10|nt|chick: 4S is cold here on any lead, and 3N could go down on some layouts|pg||
nt|chick: actually, either contract works fine on this hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am closer to 3NT preferable :)|pg||
nt|chick: point is, they never made a decision, they never found they even had a spade fit|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  ??|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: Some variance of evaluation on board 2. Five Hearts doubled here, Three Diamonds next door|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unusual to see a penalty double of a strong NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: N/S must play the 19-21 1NT opening|pg||
nt|psyck: unless they have methods to show 65, S may just try to get to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: to show a balanced 19-20 Jones will x first then bid NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North has opened 1NT as a preempt I suppose (rather than 1@D) ... but the hand is really very strong for such an approach|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I use 3NT in this spot to show 5@s and 4@h's. A classic problem hand over strong 2 NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: now N will check for @S i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @h partial E/W - no slam|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: apologies|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: is South feeling lucky? |pg||

nt|yo_yo: ahha they play a weak NT NS |pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: speed pass :)|pg||
nt|psyck: true, the 6th @d in such a good suit makes a big difference|pg||

nt|chick: should still be easy, although E may be worrying about a 4-2 spade split|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but I suspect declearer puts N on th @sK since there are very few holdings where S would not cover  the @sQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: I assume S chose to show his hand as 55 game forcing, planning to correct 3N to 4@h|pg||

mb|d|nt|bjacobs: North's rebid is a real problem|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 3@D or 3@H is not enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And as you say, 2NT is not particularly nice either|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d rebid could be with less|pg||
nt|ianmcc: what is 2@s?|pg||
nt|penseur9: showing 6 card suit???|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Good hand for various mechanisms where North could bid 2@C (forcing) |pg||
nt|psyck: they are playing in tougher contracts in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: 5+ Spades, 4+ Minor, 15+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  Looks like 8 tricks. Declearer can set up 2@h tricks pretty easy, and he doesn't have many alternatives...|pg||

pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: 1D is a transfer to @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: LOW flying contracts.....|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@h was probably the least of evils|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, here they are in what looks like the wrong game, but might be the right game|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: not sure why it's so popular |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: from a linguistic point of view, transfer probably isn't quite the right term - ok, it shows hearts, but partner doesn't have to bid them|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This defence might be as good as anything ... probably important to get rid of dummy's @CA, even though it costs a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With the diamonds and hearts 3-3, this is certainly makeable double dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: S's best chance is to start ruffing @d maybe|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I think in hindsight that he made a good call.  Finessing successfully when diamonds are 4-2 doesn't necessarily help|pg||

nt|bobholl: difficult decision for w |pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: And probably be disappointed with dummy and the result|pg||
nt|psyck: will tread cautiously with no fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No fit, but if I was looking at that monster South hand and partner opened, no amount of caution would suffice|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @d lead to give pd 2@d ruffs ;)|pg||
nt|bobholl: and guessed wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N ambitious, 4@c preferable|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  This looks like an undramatic 4@s with 10 or 11 depending on the trump play. Of course, if they get ambitions of slam, they might get to a sticky spot like 5@s-----|pg||

nt|psyck: 5N = pick a slam now? :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good bid I reckon|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N would probably be quantitative here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, a good rule of thumb:  whenever partner makes a natural NT bid, then the next bid of 4NT is quantitative|pg||
nt|psyck: when no fit agreed & 4 level bids/cues bypassed, it is generally quant|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard to blame South for being in the tank here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, tough indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's heard nothing helpful, so his hand is not QUITE as good as before, but still, he has to move towards slam|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: I think some number of NT better than continueing to fish with 4@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: *though|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a lot of pairs play 2@H as the negative to 2@c these days |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s has good play NS, so this may be a real steal |pg||
nt|psyck: W knows have vlaues close to grand, but with balanced hands, not likely to see the source of tricks|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: I'd open the S hand as it is, but cringe when partner bids hearts :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: Mike, our vugraph operator doing a great job... thanks|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  2@h's seems like the maximum of what NS can make|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  W tries a balancing take out double|pg||
mb|r|mb|3D|nt|psyck: Both the hands would have the same zar count, but that is only just another guideline to evaluate openings|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: with a few cards interchanged, it could have gone for a telephone number|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: is it your partnership style to allow a 3@D overcall with the South hand?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  looks like it can make. Very interesting spot if declearer plays low @h towards dummy. S shold put in the K ti deny two entries in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: actually, this has 1 zar point less than if the K were @D ... you must subtract one for short suit honors|pg||
nt|bobholl: ligth 3rd hand openers often forget the disadvantages as in this case |pg||
nt|chick: but still enough to open|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  the XX shows maximum and interest to play defense|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: can't blame W, he has a hand it was probably hard to pass over 1@C|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, enough zar either way|pg||
nt|chick: you define "light" by HCP only?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bvdahl:  This is at least 1 down. And NS can make sure of -2 by ducking a @h and get a trump promption for @d 9|pg||

pc|cA|nt|bobholl: yes|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  but even without that, E will need to lead spades twice towards dummy|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|bvdahl:  which is why he unblocked c!K|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  now N has to duck to get 500|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  he will wonder why pd didn't lead @h|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and since S bid 1NT, he most likely has Qx in @h's, so a duck is possible to find|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: personally I think it's slightly too weak, but it could well be right to bid - if pard has 12-13 ish and a heart stop 3NT may be making our way|pg||

mb|3S!|an|Both Minors|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H=5/5, hearts/minor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H showing a 2 suited weak hand, i presume|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will selway pass 3@HX?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4-9 hcp|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or bid 3@S or 3NT. lots of possibilities|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  EW plays well in !'s, but has to be careful to not overreach. After a @d lead I think 9 tricks is max|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @s's|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both the @d fin & @c rty were normal actions at the table|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yo_yo: the alert may be for the @C suit 2+|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Even with 4-0 split it seems that 6@c can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well N/S might have beaten par here, in a strange way|pg||
nt|penseur9: with 9 HCPs and 9 points...excellent preempt here|pg||
mb|4D|an|Cue/Better Place to Play|nt|yo_yo: Selway goes for blood|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norman likes collecting penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: After 3@D, Heather would have had a more difficult bid|pg||
nt|psyck: well fitting cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They were both conservative ...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: great raise. I fancy 4@s|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  if declearer can find @dQ|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  so.. first hurdle cleared ;)|pg||
nt|penseur9: and 6 card suit :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chick: provided you play the club suit exactly correctly ... finesse on the first club trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  don't need to finesse|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  can cash one high club and then lead @c toward N|pg||
mb|5D|an|Unknown|nt|mdgraham: I can understand the 3@H bid - pre-emption and all that - but it is not a LTT bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|mdgraham: (LTT=Law of Total Tricks)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Heather doesnt refuse invitations |pg||
nt|ianmcc: the @d over-ruff is a defensive trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Cards lie well this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  Natural is to start with high @c and then try to find @dQ if you can't solve trumps without losers|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: this is cruel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they do |pg||
nt|yo_yo: try to ruff a couple of @S?|pg||
nt|clinch: Brian Callaghan has an idiosyncratic form of hand evaluation, that ives weiht to 8s and 0s - his hand was a very solid opening in this system|pg||
nt|clinch: 9s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bvdahl:  Cashe high club, then play small @c to dummy to finesse on the back way|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: rude diamond split|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  no problems for declearer here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  unless S plays @c, then he has a chance for 10|pg||
nt|penseur9: the only reason to overtake would be to play @Hs here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the hearts are 3-3 to make up for it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be an idea to duck a spade now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then if West has four hearts as well as the diamonds, a nasty time will await    |pg||
nt|psyck: less if defense is friendly open opens the frozen @c suit or something|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I thought that 6@S might be just 2 off, but I think it actually loses control|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  didn't...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  oh well... good contract, and he made it :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|clinch: Binkie is a nickname of Brian|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: you southerners know these things |pg||
nt|clinch: Seems to have superseded his earlier moniker of "Brains"|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@D seems to be @Ds and one major suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a great contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  EW bidding might help them to stay low|pg||
nt|psyck: likely stop here though|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: some prefer a stronger suit|pg||
nt|chick: at the time he played the @S to the K, he still had the ability to finesse twice in @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: right you are|pg||
nt|chick: once the @SQ fell, then he had a choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: seems 2@D was a weak multi here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he hopes they draw trumps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: obviously not strong enough for Erichsen|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@s was indeed only -2, def cant do it all|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: Yes, I changed my mind about changing my mind|pg||
nt|psyck: even 2 level difficult with only 7 tricks in sight|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  Sorry all. I type fast, so there will be typos|pg||

pc|h5|nt|clinch: Callaghan and Burn known colloquially as "Binkie and Berky"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: message from a kib|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: when he played with David Burn, they were called Binkie and Berkie, after Pinkie and Perkie, having a resemblance of figure|pg||

nt|ianmcc: trumps ugly but might handle|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes I think so|pg||
nt|penseur9: the @C suit might save the day|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  EW had taken 5 trick and the rest was good|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Not a clue. however, no incorrect claim - they all agree -1 due to spades.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 5@c maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it's given NS a big problem however|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  cards lie well for 3NT EW here. I assume 1NT now shows 15-17|pg||
nt|penseur9: it seems that 5@C makes unless @S lead (if @S lead you make if you start with A of clubs)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well the auction warns|pg||

pc|cK|nt|bvdahl:  doesn't make any sense|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: Agreed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|clinch: A bit loaded outside - not enough to stop 3NT thouh|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: correct|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good @h stopper|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: even 3@H too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT no sinecure on a spade lead, but a heart lead is possibly more likely |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bvdahl:  after @d lead and a couple of ducks, it is natural to play @c to T and then run @sJ|pg||
nt|psyck: Well, you got your answer about their NT range :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Big swing coming to Hinden on board 9, playing in 4@sx other room , with defense giving it away|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bvdahl:  :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  E will not like the contract now, but he has no choice but to play for this exact layout|pg||
nt|penseur9: how low can you go? :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|clinch: Nice easy contract for the leaders|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bvdahl:  if he only ducks 1@d he might get 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: both teams are getting most hands right (or equally wrong) & the score remains low|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and very little chance thet Erichsen bid 1@d on 4 card|pg||
nt|psyck: S not continuing @d would likely place him with no entry|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  exactly|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: regardless, it's -1 I'm afraid :s|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  A difficult contract to play since N will have to ruff 2@c's high|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bvdahl:  I still think it is best to play S  for @cQ because that gives declearer 4 club tricks if S has Qxx or Qx in @c's. If you play N for @cQ, you only get 4 tricks if he has exactly Qxx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: 3NT has some chances NS|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: more deals played than imps traded|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bvdahl:  but can finesse the @sT on the way back|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @d to ruff @c to high ruff and then @s to the 9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|clinch: Looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: it all looks fishy :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: yup|pg||
nt|psyck: declarer was in danger of losing 2@s, 2@h, 1@d by playing @s's that way|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I can't see the logic in cashing the @sQ|pg||
nt|psyck: & defense continuing @s looking at that dummy...less said the better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: ><=> fishy|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  still needs to find @c Q|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And quite possible to go wrong after S has shown a lot in red suits|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  different now since declearer only needs 3 club tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but a @h was autimatic one down|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: so Hinden takes the lead, very strong comeback from an early deficit|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||

nt|bobholl: 3 nt i mean|pg||
nt|psyck: A 3 level bid on the reverse would probably have game forced for them with going via 2N showing a minimum response|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  so even if you go -1100 once in a while, these are the kind of hands that compensate for that|pg||
nt|chick: I think you're right ... W had what he needed to know to bid 3N|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: i think South should bid @H, agree with you mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: 22-13 in favour of the Teltcher team after 10 boards|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, lead has increased a little|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  This is an interesting spot for E. Some might see 17 HCP with a @c stop and bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: we should get compairisions with the next 3 boards|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|clinch: Jagger slightly less disciplined in his opening bids than his partner!|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  but x is a lot more flexibile with 4-4 in major|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  slam time for NS|pg||
mb|2S!|an|Forcing|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  let's see how high they go. Seems like grand is on because of the nice layout in @c's|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|clinch: and may pay a price|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Speaking of repeating themese ... here's a 3NT which is vastly superior to 4@S on the 5-5 (!) fit|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  so now they found the good @h game|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|1 keycard|mb|p|mb|5D|an|Asks for Q|nt|bvdahl:  and now they will just have to win it ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I don't mind a single stopper for 1NT overcall, but x is clearly superior here|pg||
nt|psyck: I think N may choose to lead a @s for want of anything better to do against 3N last deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Did Michael Courtney's book preach:  "look for 3NT when you have a 5-5 major fit"?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  North has tried his best to discourage his partner, so maybe South will show restraint|pg||
mb|6C|an|Has Q|nt|mdgraham: Sorry all, I have to go now. Thanks to our splendid operator Gitte |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: this should make|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  6@D wouold have shown (in most systems) @hQ and @dK, and @dK is not a good card from Souths point of view...|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bvdahl:  3 x @h's now and run the @d's will give 4@h + 5@d + 1@c = 10|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  or of N ruffs one of the @d's it will be 5@h's and 4@d's|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S have lost the partial. They can make 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: I'm sure it will be updated to include it in the next edition|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes good point Ian|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|clinch: Looks fairly easy to get 800 here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: I'm told that 6@C shows @HQ, 2 kings but not the @CK|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  ok,|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  it probably doesn't matter, but leading a singleton when opponents have told you they have all the aces, is usually not the best lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  or maybe they didn't have the time to show all aces... sorry ;)|pg||
nt|chick: and especially when you don't have any hope of trumping anything|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5@d is not a GS try, of course|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|clinch: or 500 maybe|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About as useful as "bid 6322 hands to NT" (in my not-very-humble opinion)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should he ruff two @Ss here?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  nooo, just run the @d's|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: Selway has to find Q@D|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but if either bid they land in 4@h, still better than -110|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|penseur9: ah OK |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: North took the direct route - could have tried 3@H perhaps. However, that may have been shortage or something |pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's attractive to open a good 6 card suit but  having opened maybe he should have shut up|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  he does not have the entries to ruff two spades, really|pg||
nt|penseur9: right you are|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

nt|clinch: Let's see how the slam bidding is |pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time but not in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if other table would choose @s preempt too, not that they were getting anywhere else whatever they do|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  It was probably the best contract. I doubt 7@h's was more than 50%|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bvdahl:  probably more like 40|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: I can't see   18,19 20 on Open score|pg||
mb|2C|nt|clinch: Quite tricky to bid, I'd say|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|psyck: Frances judged right to stop in 3NT on the 6@s-2 hand deal 9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one quiet|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: light opening from East - no way to stop below game now|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  The cards lie very well for EW, they can actually make 6NT|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but I would expect 3NT to be their final stop|pg||
nt|chick: but pretty tough to bid I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: Extremely well done, assuming partner opened the bidding|pg||
nt|penseur9: can 4@S make here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: glad they are not playing gazzili (strong 2@C) i guess|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Ye, impossible|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And it is not a good contract|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Just sayin' ;)|pg||
nt|chick: "Any slam that makes is a good one"  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: same contract as OR here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bvdahl:  no. For starters, NS can play 3x @H's for a trump promotion|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and there will still be a @c loser|pg||
nt|penseur9: playing with screens, it could be East thinking|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  3@h x could be painful|pg||
nt|penseur9: for lack of a better word :)|pg||
nt|chick: well, EW missing out on a nice heart partscore|pg||
nt|chick: even game on lackidaisical defense|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a pure cross ruff may be even game|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry not looking properly it's bedtime|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  not for the oponents...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: they might get to 4@H now|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, was effectively same as here till 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what is rex?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with me it's first round control|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: this may lead to 4@H - West will be a little scared of spades|pg||
nt|psyck: except 2N instead of the 2@h here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  though might be hard to get more than -1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|clinch: Don't really like 3@D myself|pg||
nt|psyck: 3NT could have been defeated here other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not unreasonable to head for 5@D ... but it's not going to make|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: Espen deep in thought. rdbl was explained but didn't catch. maybe small cards?|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  agiain people, I apologize for typing. I try to comment fast and disregard typos. I am not struck by temporary (or permanent, for that matter) dyslexia, if you were wondering :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I would expect declearer to take @c finess through N now to protect the @s's|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  good to have some @c tricks to fall back on in case @d's don't break|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: even on the @s lead, N could have played another @s after winning @hK to cut off declarer to beat it, but made a normal @c switch instead i guess|pg||
nt|chick: if either E or W bid, we would be saying it was too brave :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  now @S has to cash @sA if he wants that trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: That's right ... I watched that hand, and North might have been misled by the opening lead of @S6|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpv: director wanted them to play 19-20 first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The "4NT = two places to play" convention is quite handy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: :D|pg||

mb|3H!|an|5 Spades 4 Hearts|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  4@s's like in the other room is an interesting contract. Since @cK is offside, a @h needs to be ruffed in S|pg||
nt|chick: 3@H smolen showing 5 spades and 4 hearts, game forcing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: yes blood will flow |pg||
nt|yo_yo: so boring in the other room :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: heather bidding!?|pg||
nt|clinch: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: phantom phantom|pg||
nt|rodal f: The @H splinter came so might easyer to find the @D lead from N now.|pg||
nt|chick: looks like N's 1@C opening at the other table put E on lead and no reason to suspect a club was right|pg||
nt|bobholl: tya especially sean good job :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: So this will be a big pickup for Hinden|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  3 NT is much easier with 9 top tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|roswolf: the ladies blood will gush out|pg||
nt|clinch: I don't see this contract faring too well!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no it's a nightmare|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|clinch: Better cash all available winners right now!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: at least, after the lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Bidding 3NT seems like a good choice by south with the 4-3-3-3 shape and solif holdings in the minors|pg||
mc|10|nt|bvdahl:  And that was that. Thanks Cornelia|pg||
nt|chick: The TD tells me that the next match will start on the hour, 1h 20m from now|pg||
