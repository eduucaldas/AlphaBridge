nt|clinch: Still, seems only 11 tricks made|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  souths sytem opening is 1d |pg||
nt|psyck: a practical bid by E other room|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: more scope for fun and games here although the bidding in the other room was agricultural |pg||
nt|pitiful:  1@d is 5+@d or 4441|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  over 1@s 1N=15+ without 4@s hence south will bid 2@c|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  surprising 3@c by east|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|clinch: Effective 1@s bid by Liggins|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: 3@C would not have been my choice - double shows the power|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@c was strange, I agree|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would have passed over 1@s|pg||
nt|psyck: passing a normal choice|pg||
nt|pitiful:  then south would have bid 2@c and north 2@d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: with half the pack in my hand i would never just pass - power must be shown at once|pg||
nt|clinch: What does everyone think about 1@s? |pg||
nt|pitiful:  automatic for me|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|psyck: I would not bid 1@s, but it is understandable with 5 cards and fav vul|pg||
nt|pitiful:  automatic for roland as well|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|clinch: I think most players would pass, but that cedes a lot of information to the opponents|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||

nt|psyck: *if W played...|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  yes|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: double seems normal from North (to show @H)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will east bid 1 or 2nt ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d maybe will be hard|pg||
nt|penseur9: note that the OR starts with 18 to 20 in order to have comparisons when they get back to  1... so we will not have compairisons here in the CR :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: Hi Ian welcome|pg||

pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: luckily for NS the @C finesse works|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: fireworks :)|pg||
nt|psyck: if that hand happened, E could have played trump & they would have gotten the extra @d trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  9 tricks EW in @s while NS could get problems in 4@h's because he gets short in trumps|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the losing club can go on the @SQ|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha ha ha|pg||
nt|ianmcc: didn't think of 3NT very practical|pg||
nt|penseur9: better late then never :)|pg||

nt|penseur9: still might just make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|psyck: back live now|pg||
nt|chick: NS being very cautious, knowing the spades will probably split badly|pg||
nt|bobholl: brave 4 @D vulnarable|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: but is it one down still?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Declearer needs to set up a @c trick before pulling trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: overtrick|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|chick: perhaps, but with 4 diamonds, a lot of crossruff possibilities ... partner surely has no more than 1 spade|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess it will make exactly|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: now a @C and @D loser it seems|pg||

pc|h3|pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: but Gib thinks it makes, must be some way I cant see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pretty boring so far apart from board 1 which i missed|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: overtrick|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: GIB sees a lot of things that us lesser mortals don't |pg||
nt|yo_yo: bill niccol points out that it's better for Rosen to throw a @C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: then if clubs 3-3 away goes the @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: apparently it makes if ERichsen leads a @H but i cant see how|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Just wondering why chris jagger didnt open it 5@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: with the misguess in @H ??|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it must be a squeeze|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it doesnt look a NT sort of hand|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|9|nt|bobholl: will make too if he crosses in @D for 2nd @D ruff|pg||

nt|pitiful:  2N over 1@s would be 4+@s 16+ for n-s|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, the risk-reward needs to be based around a confidence that the auction won't spiral out of control|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|clinch: 10 IMPs to de Botton, partly earned by the obstructive 1@s bid, partly by the obscure 3@c overcall, partly by the agricultural punt in the other room|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: east mixing it up again|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i like 3@c|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|clinch: Heavy 3@c bid, made safer by partner's pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: did'nt want it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bvdahl:  They will be fighting for a part score here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I think that does work - West has to lead a spade, giving a ruff-sluff |pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably the alert is for @C maybe 2?|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N is the place to be in with 4@s in trouble on @c lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, serious trouble|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely @S contract NS here will win|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: 1@c can be 11-14 or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Think 8 in @h's is max EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: How do we like the 1@D opening bid?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess east feels not too well with his @D K|pg||
nt|chick: (I do) :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: too strong for a weak 2 so open :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Light openings are mostly a matter of partnership style|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yo_yo: could 1NT be a transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|psyck: If it is your style, W certainly has a 1@d opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ah that's better|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  You need names here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am not surprised :)|pg||
nt|chick: one of the silliest things people do is leave a gap between a weak 2 bid and an opening 1 bid.  There should never be a hand that is "too strong for a weak 2 and too weak to open ...|pg||
nt|chick: 1"|pg||
nt|ianmcc: can 4@h live?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I think even I could make this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Might make as many as 10 in @s's if they are psychic, but I would expect 9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: obviously not|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: but bidding it is more difficult|pg||
nt|yo_yo: better than crying|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: likely to get minors right|pg||
nt|penseur9: same here CK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Not sure how you are meant to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: this has no real chance actually as cards are, but likely other room will also be in 4@s-1|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but not so many entries in North to play monors toward dummy|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|psyck: will probably need to do that for 9, 10 looks too much :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  minors|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzpv: he is stil smiling!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: still|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: @C suit favourable for him but he doesnt know that yet|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|psyck: tried to put dec to test immediately...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: cannot afford to draw trumps, so will continue some minor cards|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely cornelia :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|chick: so I think Bob nailed it .... it is too strong for a weak 2 bid, therefore must open 1|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, the defence need to do well her ... they must attack clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  good start for declearer. Might try anothther @d and go for xruff|pg||

nt|clinch: There appears to have been a phantom sacrifice here|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
nt|clinch: Vul vs not|pg||
nt|clinch: In the other room, 4@s was doubled - it does go down, but E redoubled and this was removed|pg||
nt|roswolf: east ever the cutthoat redobled south's axe of 4@S - north chickened out and who could blame him?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nick is prone to redouble with any excuse|pg||
nt|roswolf: cutthroat|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes he likes the taste of blood - opps blood|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, not sure that removing with a 4-3-3-3 3 count was likely to be a winning decision. Brave, though|pg||
nt|clinch: in a way|pg||
nt|roswolf: is there a break or have we lost connection|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: depends if you regard Jxx as adequate, I guess|pg||
nt|psyck: They got to 3N on deal 1 other room, which has chances, unlike the contract played here|pg||
nt|psyck: If only the @cA was right, 3N would be on velvet here :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Interesting 3NT in S here. EW can take the first 7 tricks, but easier said than done|pg||

mb|2D!|an|Natural Diamonds, good hand|nt|bjacobs: Well it works a lot better on this lead than @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: dec still has a 2nd stopper & should be ok|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: There's a heap of work to do ... probably need an endplay here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: a sort of drury bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but they cant be if we look at hand 5|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  W could have tried 2@h in balancing pos, but if 2@h's makes, 1NT is likely to go down|pg||
nt|chick: this is another thing I personally dislike ... bypassing a 4 card major to rebid 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hand 2|pg||
nt|psyck: nicely done, 3N is superior|pg||
nt|psyck: it is normal to bypass in Walsh style|pg||
mb|3S|an|"Semi-Natural" (?)|nt|chick: it certainly is when the defense sets up hearts for you|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes indeed, far from over |pg||
nt|psyck: N played @hK to try creating more entries in S hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he was thinking: if South has @HA, then I better win the first @H and clear the spade suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was a nice play, but doesn't help here|pg||
nt|psyck: Operator, It would be nice if players names were entered|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right, we want to know who we are complimenting (or insulting)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: wonder why callaghan didnt open 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: Not a good start for Hinden with a poor choice of takeout double on deal 1|pg||
nt|chick: I know, that's why I dislike walsh style|pg||
nt|psyck: you  can always find it later in hands with GF values|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: 2@H is an enterprising overcall|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 12 opposite 12 are these slam tries?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|vugraphzpv: That should answer your question :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  This should be 1 down. Even if E does not find the @h shift now, there are only 6 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpv: That any better?|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: No problem :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, declarer certainly has an endplay in mind, if he played @HQ, rather than play for @HJ onside|pg||
nt|penseur9: they may try but probably 5@H here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is there a shortage of oxygen?|pg||
nt|penseur9: oops :(|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4NT may prove a desaster here depending on the lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @sA at least -1|pg||

nt|ianmcc: try disaster|pg||

nt|chick: actually, either contract works fine on this hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am closer to 3NT preferable :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Some variance of evaluation on board 2. Five Hearts doubled here, Three Diamonds next door|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unusual to see a penalty double of a strong NT|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: N/S must play the 19-21 1NT opening|pg||
nt|psyck: unless they have methods to show 65, S may just try to get to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: to show a balanced 19-20 Jones will x first then bid NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North has opened 1NT as a preempt I suppose (rather than 1@D) ... but the hand is really very strong for such an approach|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I use 3NT in this spot to show 5@s and 4@h's. A classic problem hand over strong 2 NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @h partial E/W - no slam|pg||

nt|psyck: true, the 6th @d in such a good suit makes a big difference|pg||

nt|psyck: if 2@h was GF, E could have made a forcing pass of 5@C|pg||

mc|12|nt|mdgraham: from a linguistic point of view, transfer probably isn't quite the right term - ok, it shows hearts, but partner doesn't have to bid them|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This defence might be as good as anything ... probably important to get rid of dummy's @CA, even though it costs a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With the diamonds and hearts 3-3, this is certainly makeable double dummy|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 4-9 hcp|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or bid 3@S or 3NT. lots of possibilities|pg||

mb|3C|an|"Natural" - No Agreement|nt|bvdahl:  cards lie well for 3NT EW here. I assume 1NT now shows 15-17|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 3NT no sinecure on a spade lead, but a heart lead is possibly more likely |pg||

nt|psyck: Well, you got your answer about their NT range :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Big swing coming to Hinden on board 9, playing in 4@sx other room , with defense giving it away|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bvdahl:  :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  E will not like the contract now, but he has no choice but to play for this exact layout|pg||
nt|penseur9: how low can you go? :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|clinch: Nice easy contract for the leaders|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  if he only ducks 1@d he might get 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: both teams are getting most hands right (or equally wrong) & the score remains low|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and very little chance thet Erichsen bid 1@d on 4 card|pg||
nt|psyck: S not continuing @d would likely place him with no entry|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  exactly|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I still think it is best to play S  for @cQ because that gives declearer 4 club tricks if S has Qxx or Qx in @c's. If you play N for @cQ, you only get 4 tricks if he has exactly Qxx|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: 3NT has some chances NS|pg||

nt|psyck: it all looks fishy :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: yup|pg||
nt|psyck: declarer was in danger of losing 2@s, 2@h, 1@d by playing @s's that way|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I can't see the logic in cashing the @sQ|pg||
nt|psyck: & defense continuing @s looking at that dummy...less said the better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: ><=> fishy|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  still needs to find @c Q|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And quite possible to go wrong after S has shown a lot in red suits|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  different now since declearer only needs 3 club tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  but a @h was autimatic one down|pg||

nt|bobholl: 3 nt i mean|pg||
nt|psyck: A 3 level bid on the reverse would probably have game forced for them with going via 2N showing a minimum response|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i think South should bid @H, agree with you mike|pg||
mb|2S|nt|penseur9: 22-13 in favour of the Teltcher team after 10 boards|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, lead has increased a little|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  This is an interesting spot for E. Some might see 17 HCP with a @c stop and bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: we should get compairisions with the next 3 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: Jagger slightly less disciplined in his opening bids than his partner!|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|bvdahl:  but x is a lot more flexibile with 4-4 in major|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|clinch: and may pay a price|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Speaking of repeating themese ... here's a 3NT which is vastly superior to 4@S on the 5-5 (!) fit|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  so now they found the good @h game|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|bvdahl:  and now they will just have to win it ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I don't mind a single stopper for 1NT overcall, but x is clearly superior here|pg||
nt|psyck: I think N may choose to lead a @s for want of anything better to do against 3N last deal|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: Did Michael Courtney's book preach:  "look for 3NT when you have a 5-5 major fit"?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: About as useful as "bid 6322 hands to NT" (in my not-very-humble opinion)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should he ruff two @Ss here?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  nooo, just run the @d's|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: Selway has to find Q@D|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but if either bid they land in 4@h, still better than -110|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|penseur9: ah OK |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: North took the direct route - could have tried 3@H perhaps. However, that may have been shortage or something |pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's attractive to open a good 6 card suit but  having opened maybe he should have shut up|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  he does not have the entries to ruff two spades, really|pg||

nt|clinch: Let's see how the slam bidding is |pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time but not in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if other table would choose @s preempt too, not that they were getting anywhere else whatever they do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: I can't see   18,19 20 on Open score|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|clinch: Quite tricky to bid, I'd say|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psyck: Frances judged right to stop in 3NT on the 6@s-2 hand deal 9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one quiet|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: light opening from East - no way to stop below game now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Extremely well done, assuming partner opened the bidding|pg||
nt|penseur9: can 4@S make here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: glad they are not playing gazzili (strong 2@C) i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: same contract as OR here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bvdahl:  no. For starters, NS can play 3x @H's for a trump promotion|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and there will still be a @c loser|pg||
nt|penseur9: playing with screens, it could be East thinking|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  3@h x could be painful|pg||
nt|penseur9: for lack of a better word :)|pg||
nt|chick: well, EW missing out on a nice heart partscore|pg||
nt|chick: even game on lackidaisical defense|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a pure cross ruff may be even game|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry not looking properly it's bedtime|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: they might get to 4@H now|pg||
nt|clinch: And so it proved|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it did |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was effectively same as here till 3N|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what is rex?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with me it's first round control|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: this may lead to 4@H - West will be a little scared of spades|pg||
nt|psyck: except 2N instead of the 2@h here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  though might be hard to get more than -1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|clinch: Don't really like 3@D myself|pg||
nt|psyck: 3NT could have been defeated here other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not unreasonable to head for 5@D ... but it's not going to make|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: still live here - but long think from McIntosh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would love to know what redouble means|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it can only mean no stop?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kibs think xxx or xx  for the rex|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Espen deep in thought. rdbl was explained but didn't catch. maybe small cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if so 4@h must be better|pg||
nt|psyck: the @d break kills any game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: E could have made a double on 1N i suppose, at these colors, as a takeout of @s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: what do you prefer?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: another great decision by erichsen|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but will the director be called after a slow 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: rdbl explained again as 2 or more small spades|pg||
nt|penseur9: :) and here I just got up (now 7:18am here)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: even on the @s lead, N could have played another @s after winning @hK to cut off declarer to beat it, but made a normal @c switch instead i guess|pg||
nt|chick: if either E or W bid, we would be saying it was too brave :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: That's right ... I watched that hand, and North might have been misled by the opening lead of @S6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was a tough hand to get first up in the morning|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 3N has better chances that way, defense often difficult|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: is it cold?|pg||

nt|roswolf: south i meant - but they can - a good battlefield effort|pg||

nt|pitiful:  2@h was either 20-22 with 3@h or FG with 3+@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: is north thinking about a try on that minimum?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  with 4@h and 20-22 he would jump to 3@h|pg||

nt|clinch: Thinking is always permitted, Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true -especially at this level but there is a need to conserve stamina|pg||

nt|clinch: Match getting tight!|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they could well have competed, if E came in fav vul having passed earlier, E would bid to 3@h at lead|pg||
nt|psyck: *at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: now for the comparisons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West doubled 3@d next door|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  this is a very good slam|pg||
nt|psyck: Just the bids E wanted to hear|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Grand hangs on the @c finesse, so this is not one you want to miss|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psyck: not likely to find double fit & hence the slan|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  problem is that W have no controls, so E will have to make another try over 4@s|pg||

nt|yo_yo: duck a @S  then  go after @H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He'll go plus, but still, I don't think those passes are a good idea.  I would have doubled 1@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|clinch: That works, but not if heart honours are split|pg||
nt|clinch: miht be better to go for clubs?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bvdahl:  needs 2 @d ruffs to get 800 and win the hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 2 @S and not 2@H (may be planning to bid twice ?)|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  @d lead is actually possible to find. Pd must have 1st round control in @d's on this bidding|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, he may not have been keen on ruff with nat @h trick, but it was possible to envision 2 ruffs|pg||
