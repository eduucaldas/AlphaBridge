mb|3C|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|gracelin: yes, 4C will be too high, but may also push NS into the unmaking 4S.|pg||

nt|sybarra: someone has to hear the screeching of brakes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|gracelin: yes, if NS can make 4S, north would have bid it over 3C.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS is close to 6S but not quite with trumps 3-1.  Let's see how will they go.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|gracelin: My guess is they will reach 6S and struggle for -1 in very slow play.|pg||

pc|dT|nt|sybarra: E  not listening?|pg||
nt|gracelin: East will have a second chance to find the club shift after winning HQ (or SK).|pg||
mc|8|nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: and must have found it|pg||
