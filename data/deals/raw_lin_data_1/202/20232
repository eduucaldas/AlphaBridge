nt|yo_yo: unusual to see a penalty double of a strong NT|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: to show a balanced 19-20 Jones will x first then bid NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North has opened 1NT as a preempt I suppose (rather than 1@D) ... but the hand is really very strong for such an approach|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I use 3NT in this spot to show 5@s and 4@h's. A classic problem hand over strong 2 NT|pg||

pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: ducking the @D wasnt the thing to do|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|bvdahl:  but I think the contract makes regardless. Best defense would be to let W win the @hQ and shift @c's even without cashing a @d, but since declearer can cash 4 @s tricks without being ruffed, he will be able to discard the @c's in hand|pg||

nt|bjacobs: That's a good bid I reckon|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N would probably be quantitative here|pg||

nt|psyck: when no fit agreed & 4 level bids/cues bypassed, it is generally quant|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard to blame South for being in the tank here|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: erichsen will show the majors?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bvdahl:  cards lie well for 3NT EW here. I assume 1NT now shows 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|clinch: A bit loaded outside - not enough to stop 3NT thouh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: even 3@H too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT no sinecure on a spade lead, but a heart lead is possibly more likely |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  after @d lead and a couple of ducks, it is natural to play @c to T and then run @sJ|pg||
nt|psyck: Well, you got your answer about their NT range :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl:  :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  E will not like the contract now, but he has no choice but to play for this exact layout|pg||
pc|d8|nt|clinch: Nice easy contract for the leaders|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  if he only ducks 1@d he might get 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: both teams are getting most hands right (or equally wrong) & the score remains low|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and very little chance thet Erichsen bid 1@d on 4 card|pg||
nt|psyck: S not continuing @d would likely place him with no entry|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  exactly|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  I still think it is best to play S  for @cQ because that gives declearer 4 club tricks if S has Qxx or Qx in @c's. If you play N for @cQ, you only get 4 tricks if he has exactly Qxx|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  I can't see the logic in cashing the @sQ|pg||
nt|psyck: & defense continuing @s looking at that dummy...less said the better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: ><=> fishy|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  still needs to find @c Q|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  And quite possible to go wrong after S has shown a lot in red suits|pg||

nt|mdgraham: if the pre-empt is on a six-carder you pay off, of course|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  actually, it was safe, because he would have gotten 3@c tricks eben if the finesse doesn't work|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  even|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: surely this deal should produce a swing :)|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Another good auction by E/W, who have been quite impressive.  |pg||

nt|bjacobs: Surprising how often that happens|pg||

nt|psyck: Yes, lead has increased a little|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  This is an interesting spot for E. Some might see 17 HCP with a @c stop and bid 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|clinch: Jagger slightly less disciplined in his opening bids than his partner!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bvdahl:  but x is a lot more flexibile with 4-4 in major|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: and may pay a price|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Speaking of repeating themese ... here's a 3NT which is vastly superior to 4@S on the 5-5 (!) fit|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, I don't mind a single stopper for 1NT overcall, but x is clearly superior here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: Did Michael Courtney's book preach:  "look for 3NT when you have a 5-5 major fit"?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: Sorry all, I have to go now. Thanks to our splendid operator Gitte |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  3 x @h's now and run the @d's will give 4@h + 5@d + 1@c = 10|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  or of N ruffs one of the @d's it will be 5@h's and 4@d's|pg||

nt|bjacobs: About as useful as "bid 6322 hands to NT" (in my not-very-humble opinion)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should he ruff two @Ss here?|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  nooo, just run the @d's|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North took the direct route - could have tried 3@H perhaps. However, that may have been shortage or something |pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's attractive to open a good 6 card suit but  having opened maybe he should have shut up|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  he does not have the entries to ruff two spades, really|pg||

mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: light opening from East - no way to stop below game now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Extremely well done, assuming partner opened the bidding|pg||
nt|penseur9: can 4@S make here?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  no. For starters, NS can play 3x @H's for a trump promotion|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  and there will still be a @c loser|pg||
nt|penseur9: playing with screens, it could be East thinking|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  3@h x could be painful|pg||
nt|penseur9: for lack of a better word :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: they might get to 4@H now|pg||
nt|clinch: And so it proved|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, was effectively same as here till 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what is rex?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with me it's first round control|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this may lead to 4@H - West will be a little scared of spades|pg||
nt|psyck: except 2N instead of the 2@h here|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  though might be hard to get more than -1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|clinch: Don't really like 3@D myself|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: Espen deep in thought. rdbl was explained but didn't catch. maybe small cards?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: rdbl explained again as 2 or more small spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: even on the @s lead, N could have played another @s after winning @hK to cut off declarer to beat it, but made a normal @c switch instead i guess|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: That's right ... I watched that hand, and North might have been misled by the opening lead of @S6|pg||

nt|henryb:  The proper statement for that, Gerben, is DOIGB|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: hi Henry|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get wild|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is a very light slam but a great one|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Osborne might make a courtesy raise|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3H|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: or a preemptive raise perhaps - he is very imaginative|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Teltscher has a tough bid with his huge hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: he will pull to at least 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  is he good enough to bid 5@H? the dbl is not very encouraging|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: IN HIS YOUNGER YEARS HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A PUNT FOR THE SLAM|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|Gerben42:  NS could have saved cheaply 4@H is just down 1 (@DA ruff @CA ruff end)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is a octagenian and still a formidable player and a gret supporter of english bridge|pg||

nt|clinch: Match getting tight!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: now for the comparisons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West doubled 3@d next door|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  this is a very good slam|pg||
nt|psyck: Just the bids E wanted to hear|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  Grand hangs on the @c finesse, so this is not one you want to miss|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4H|an|Splinter|nt|psyck: not likely to find double fit & hence the slan|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  problem is that W have no controls, so E will have to make another try over 4@s|pg||
mb|5D|nt|yo_yo: callaghan prefers to bid NT on his 4333 shape|pg||
mb|5S|nt|clinch: Will surely bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hasnt East denied 4@H?|pg||
nt|clinch: I mean after Heather's double|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  now it might be easier. One of those hands where opponents bidding is helpful|pg||
mb|6D|mb|6H|nt|bvdahl:  E even has hopes for a grand :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 7@h coming? :)|pg||
mb|7H|nt|yo_yo: West doubled in the other room|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: with a 15-count, albeit with no aces, it looks thre normal action  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think West is asleep at the wheel here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, had perfect shape to balance|pg||
nt|psyck: and for 2 level part scores, you do not look at vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: So, how to play this? Can see that it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: duck a @S  then  go after @H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He'll go plus, but still, I don't think those passes are a good idea.  I would have doubled 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: That works, but not if heart honours are split|pg||
nt|clinch: miht be better to go for clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  needs 2 @d ruffs to get 800 and win the hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: i dont have much success with AK10x  opp xxx |pg||
nt|clinch: which also works|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|psyck: only 500 now|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  @d lead is actually possible to find. Pd must have 1st round control in @d's on this bidding|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  since he looks for grand by bidding 6@h's|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, he may not have been keen on ruff with nat @h trick, but it was possible to envision 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely to play @D ace and a small @D after|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: you have an advantage peter!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: the @cJ will be promoted for 2nd undertrick|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|d7|pg||
mc|10|nt|bjacobs: North should play @SQ on the second round|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps he did|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Gerben42:  EW play 4-card majors so 2@H is okay|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Gerben42:  playing 5-card majors you wouldnt want partner to pass 2@H which is nonforcing by a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|roswolf: solid no heroics bridge|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  you will lose just @HA|pg||

mc|10|nt|roswolf: solid result|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  he could have had a rather safe 11 tricks but I guess he is saving energy |pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: :D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: nice fat penalty coming to someone|pg||
