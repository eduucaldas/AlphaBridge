nt|vugraphzrm: This deal seems to be interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: well -if it really was made -so doubleswing possible|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: does E really open?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: the bid probably will not finish before level of 5.... for both lines :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Yes i think so too. Bopth sides have enough tricks for 5|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|kemperg: ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 1@H - 1NT F1 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: This might cost lots for any of these teams|pg||

nt|kemperg: technical problems in lithuania?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like that|pg||
nt|kemperg: look like 8 tricks, 2@H,2D and 4@Cs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i watched this board at Laurilas table, and declarer went -1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S a better contract. 3NT does not like this lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @s is better but this makes without @d lead -it seldom comes in these secvences ,but Garvey found it here well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzrm: This might be a loss for Italian team|pg||

nt|runnerup: ew must have been misquessed @c -in last board to be down -even 2 -in 4 @s -but luckyly won imps -so there is allways that other board|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzrm: Club lead might give problems to declarer|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Markku and all |pg||
nt|runnerup: hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|gluckenval: Garvey-Carroll play a 5M system, with 1@C 11-13 balanced or 17+ any, 1@D may have longer clubs and ususally unbalanced. After 1@C their responses are in canap√®. 1NT = 14-16 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: (perfect range, imho :))|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|gluckenval: The italians a nat. system with 1@D 4+ cards, and strong (15-17) NT. They also play the new version of 2@D = 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzrm: nera|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: l am a fan of leading his own suit except....|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Garvey-Carroll play also in the national Ireland team|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: dbl probably 3 card support |pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzrm: It seems like N wants something more than 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|runnerup: a 9 counter to open but still 4 @s makes with good guess -not bidden ofcause but 10 available tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: thats a 50% game, :( @HK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Well that is antural with 17 points and partners 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: ew uses support double here x= 3 hearts -so this didnt end in 1 @s like other table |pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 6@C makable... but... honestly... really hard to find it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: natural*|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: YEs very hard to find indeed|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 6NT makable with @SJ ?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lead*|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: i think with diamond J|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: he can make if he guesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: well not sure about lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm:  but 6Nt is doable|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: not sure he can make this,  even with some favorable sits for a few cards |pg||
nt|runnerup: no -seems like -2 but 1 imp won |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzrm: WOW|pg||
nt|gluckenval: at double dummy it is very easy... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: seems like 3D was a singleton or void in S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gluckenval: in the meantime, at board 2  the @Ss were not found in OR too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Yes and thats a shame actually|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vbman: can make tons of tricks with an endplay|pg||
nt|vbman: if an opp leads from three u can place the honours to his pard|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzrm: match would have become more interesting|pg||
pc|cT|nt|runnerup: perhaps only -1 |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: the discards on clubs will be a bit painful for n/s |pg||
nt|sybarra: but -1 looks right |pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|nt|vbman: pls welcome ozgur , one of the leading young players of turkey|pg||
pc|c9|nt|runnerup: so try all ways to close the cap -boards just running end  |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: ae an endplay on E|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: so now declarer needs to make a guess on diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it will be -2 in the end |pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|runnerup: now north can handle this +1 even if west has 4 clubs -because he is squezed in minors ,but wrong guess and =|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|kemperg: endplay on E now, wd:)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kemperg: E had possibilities, play @S or keep the 3rd @S|pg||

nt|jtr: South shows up with @hAK as a passed hand maybe play North for @sK|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jacksond: well clubs 3/3 makes it better than finesse as opponents may allow you to combine chances|pg||
nt|jtr: I doubt that they will but if South switches to the @sJ all will be revealed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: hallo everybody from Vilnius|pg||
nt|jtr: Taking a little money out of 3@h instead|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mareczek: if partner is 6-9 PC with one or both minors|pg||
mc|8|nt|mareczek: of cours, surely there are two top heart loosers at the start|pg||
nt|mareczek: but 5 in minor is at worst on spade finesse|pg||

nt|sybarra: you were right |pg||
nt|sybarra: need bigger swings than these, as you said |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 5 @d makes here -perhaps a swing|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: Hello Shirley|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|vbman: it must be difficult to play against the ns|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 1@C = strong in this case, and 3@D = Non invite (6+)|pg||

nt|gluckenval: oh, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: players at table also wanted to know what 3D mean|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|vbman: 2cl and 2dia must be art.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D makes because clubs are 3/3  and a spade gets pitched |pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: only 1 imp because he wanted to try spades|pg||
