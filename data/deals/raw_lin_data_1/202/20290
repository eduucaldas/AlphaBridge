nt|gracelin: The whole field of 32 teams are divided into 4 groups.  This match is from group A, what is called the VIP group.|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting on board 2, EW got very active and bid to 4@s making|pg||

nt|gracelin: south found a good lead, if he led his partner's suit, H, 4S might make.|pg||
nt|baldjean: with 5/5 in majors I can understand they became active. East's hand is upgraded a lot if there isd a fit and even more so if there is a double fit|pg||
nt|gracelin: now|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ni hao: welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: this looks like precision auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Yes, Shirley, they are competing with Mr. Yeh.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor E has virtually nothing |pg||
nt|gracelin: You will see lot of Precision actions in this tournament, I guess more than 60% of Chinese players play Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recall from other vugraphs  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I must say I play with many chinese players on bbo,  and they play an excellent 2/1 game also!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (since I do not play precision) |pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, you need to know natural system well to also play well with Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hates to balance and find the next bid to be 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but he knows pard has some point given the E bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: *points|pg||
nt|gracelin: this East hand worth a 2S raise in the way I play, but no harm is done.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you mostly play precision, Patrick?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Ths is the 2nd match of the RR from group C.  Both teams have won their first match.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|gracelin: Jiang in south here play for China Open team last year at the PABF in New Zealand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Mr. Gua, sitting north here, is the boss of the automibile company.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW, Sun and Kang are member of China open team many years ago.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sun made his name known in the semi-final match against Italy in the 2004 Olympiad.  Sun and Kang also reached semi-final in the 2011 Vanderbilt in the Spring NABC.|pg||
nt|baldjean: 6nt actually make here, but they won't be bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|gracelin: He and Zhang play natural, including 16-18 1NT.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C seems to be part of the 2-way check back.  2C for invitational hand and 2D for GF.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gracelin: north has no reason to go on.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: remember, his 1NT rebid could be as many as 15 CP|pg||
nt|gracelin: HCP|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  probably best to duck here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: the lead is helpful.  declarer may only lose 2S + 2D for his contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he needs to handle well and guess everything.|pg||
nt|gracelin: running the D7 will be a good start.|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gracelin: low spade also works well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  taking A@s and E must find the Q of @c|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|gracelin: How could East raise his passed hand partner to game is a little surprising.  He also has wasted honors in club.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sun obviously has length in Heart so East seems to have an unsuitable hand for partner.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this case, not a problem|pg||
pc|sK|pc|hT|pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  but if S had Qxx of @cs and 2 spades, then not ducking would have produced effects EW don't want to think about.|pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi Jeanine|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are either up very early or staying up very late |pg||
nt|baldjean: born and grew up in the USA though|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no entries and such a weak suit, W would have been better off to lead partner's known 5 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: +1 only? so declarer too kno chances in @h, despite East's bid|pg||
mb|1D|nt|baldjean: took no chances*|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: the latter|pg||
nt|gracelin: from each 8-team group, only the top two will aualify for the finals.  |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|gracelin: a boring 3NT, probably.|pg||
nt|gracelin: qualify|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S was doubled in other room and made 3 overtricks on D lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I think we have to guess at some of these, Jean|pg||
nt|gracelin: This HK team is the same that represent HK in the PABF in KL.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: which strategy will you choose with North hand, bid @c or bid @h only, Patrick?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will be an easy make as the lead will give E three tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3H bid gives declarer lot of information in the play.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: 4H would be a lucky make but I can agree East's pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: China's national team is in group D, Hongkong's national team is in group C.  They lost to Ji Li last match.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: but with bad breaks in H and C, don't see how declarer can come to 10 tricks.|pg||

pc|s7|nt|gracelin: defenders can win another 2H, 1S and 1C, so the contract will probably be made.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|gracelin: Group A is the VIP group including sponsors and other VIP's.   |pg||

nt|twcho: 3NT has no chance|pg||
nt|twcho: with no entry and a void, North will probably retreat to 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: north can see that he has no entry for the long spade unless south has SA.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 7H by dropping south H10, but 6H is a sound contract anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW are young players based in Shenzhen while NS are veteran partners based in Beijing|pg||

nt|twcho: which is very popular system in China|pg||

mb|3D|nt|gracelin: EW is cold for 4H but NS can sacrifice in 4S for -2 and a small profit.|pg||

mc|9|nt|twcho: what is the difference between pass then bid 3@s and direct 3@s by west over the 2NT bid?|pg||
nt|gracelin: also south didn't have a suit to cue.  Many play NT bid as cue over a strong club opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's original pass shows a very weak hand so west delayed the 3S bid as a balancing one in orde not to encoursge East to raise.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he knew 2NT was a D fit, so he would have chance to bid 3S next round.|pg||
nt|twcho: what do you think about north rebid of 3@d? seems that he has quite a good hand|pg||
nt|twcho: Can he rebid 3@c instead of 3@d?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Not sure, since I don't know the exact meaning of the 2NT.  If it's a cue, then north may consider 3C.|pg||

nt|gracelin: no, just threatening.|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|gracelin: 3 round of D wll hold the contract to 4|pg||

nt|baldjean: see?|pg||
nt|gracelin: South need to lead D originally to save the SK entry for a D ruff.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  does this have any play?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gracelin: yes, but still need the trump Q to drop.|pg||
nt|gracelin: SQ ruff, of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  it will if you aren't in 6 and won't if you are|pg||
nt|andyv:  S could have made it easier on partner by playing the 8 of @d|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|gracelin: 4 board to go for this round and the next match will start in exactly 2 hours from now.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may take the hook now|pg||
nt|twcho: the @h shift has denied declarer chance to try @d|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: but now defender still has an entry in H for the D ruff.  Declare need to duck HA.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: When north now lead back a small H, south should know north still has H10, or declarer will not play HQ earlier.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|baldjean: not with K10xx @h in S|pg||
nt|andyv:  right....they had to be 3-3|pg||

nt|gracelin: stiff|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, a 9-card suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  board 10 was 13 imps to EW when 4@h made 5 in CR|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gracelin: 3NT by north is probably where this hand will rest.|pg||
nt|gracelin: some modernest may only overcall 2C with the south hand.  Then north must find a bid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S dbles now |pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is a line between t/o double and simple overcall.  South hand is a little too strong for me to only overcall.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW only has partial in spades here, but easy to reach a spade game.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|baldjean: precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I wonder what S expects to do with the double?  Spend the rest of the auction trying to convince N he really has none of the other suits?|pg||
nt|twcho: Patrick, will you opt for double if east hand is with one @c less and one @d more?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: south is from Eric Kokish's school and north is from the same school.|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have bid 5@d over 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  right, but he had to assume that the Q of @s was with S since N didn't ruff with the Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  that seems sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Double, I might even double with this actual hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south's double scared EW to bid their spades. |pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: bet we missed a pass |pg||
nt|twcho: not everyone act with south hand|pg||
nt|twcho: with all the quacks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  it was a guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and foolish N thinks partner has suits for the double|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|gracelin: but declarer has no intermedate sot for any finesse|pg||
nt|gracelin: spot|pg||
pc|c5|nt|baldjean: the @d become worthless in @ss|pg||
nt|gracelin: the cards are not lying well for declarer so the 22 pts 1NT is not a sure thing yet.|pg||
nt|twcho: leading from Q10xx normally a better choice than from AJ9x, especially against 1NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  that is rather amusing|pg||
nt|andyv:  S still thinking|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: for 1NT, the quacks are just as fines.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  true...I was only curious as to what E was thinking when N didn't ruff with the Q|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|gracelin: south found the most damaging lead.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gracelin: But did south's long huddle before bdding 2C give north some hint?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|andyv:  yes, E can't play @hs on his own|pg||
nt|gracelin: north not ruffing with Q1098 ?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: better cash SA now or will lose it.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shanxi won a swing last board.  The other room also in 4C but went down.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, declarer has 6 tricks now.  both sides are fighting for the 7th tricks.|pg||
nt|gracelin: spade is declarer 7th trick|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|baldjean: why double when trump suit is clear?|pg||
nt|gracelin: south maybe subject to an endplay if declarer reads the cards well.|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that south will be endplayed if declarer read the position accurately|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: so how gutsy is N  re the club? |pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: an easy -1|pg||

nt|twcho: NS has managed to make most of their 1NT contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gracelin: East did not hear me and lose his SA.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: right|pg||
nt|twcho: in bd 10, the auction is exactly the same until east double the 3NT and north scared and run to 4@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: this should be an easy 4S for EW, both in bidding and play.|pg||
nt|twcho: and lose 10 more imps|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: NS's 4H depend on the location of DA, but EW can make 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't see why he did that.  He should not be ashamed of his double of 3H with AK, A and a 5-card suit. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cash it you dont get it   maybe try caps next time |pg||
nt|twcho: certainly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the precsion 2 @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will S bid spades |pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@c is not guaranteed to be a good contract either|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3H is a cue of opponent's implied H suit.  It shows invitationa or better hand for spade.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|gracelin: yes, 4C will be too high, but may also push NS into the unmaking 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will surely pass 3 if East didn't compete, but now he is tempted.|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to hear the screeching of brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks as if EW will be shut out of bidding|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: I'd love to make most of my 3NT contract better. :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|gracelin: yes, if NS can make 4S, north would have bid it over 3C.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps E could have doubled 2NT|pg||
nt|twcho: good stop. even 5@s is dangerous|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: -2 is ok since NS is likely to make 3S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's Cue is just in case West has a strong raise hand, which West didn't have.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, when west sign off, east doesn't have many in reserve|pg||
nt|twcho: and wisely pass|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sA|nt|gracelin: 2NT looks to be jacoby and south's jump to 4H show a very bad opening|pg||

nt|famus: yes -2--so got back the trick lost on lead:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  14 imp swing on 13 when 5@dX was made in CR|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, in early Sept. there were two international invitational events held in Beijing and Tienjin.  Prize money is US$200K for both events.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and how high will this get?|pg||
nt|twcho: Probably the wealthy sponsors can sign some US or European top profs for their Club A teams|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gracelin: I am not saying that EW will find their 4S after that, but EW could be missing a 5-4 or even 5-5 spade fit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting on 14 that EW never got into the auction|pg||
nt|twcho: and I expect this will be coming|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS may end up in 3NT.  The right way to handle cubs is cashing A,K first.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS is close to 6S but not quite with trumps 3-1.  Let's see how will they go.|pg||
nt|gracelin: clubs|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: or a good fit in minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  since W will know the take out is on distribution, he may take the plunge with 4@s or 5@cs|pg||
nt|famus: ew will venture in 3NT--perhaps|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, might see it happen.  But not sure whether CCBL allows.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|baldjean: interesting that N opened in the other room on that board|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|gracelin: My guess is they will reach 6S and struggle for -1 in very slow play.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|twcho: I think China is quite flexible. :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: quite an unexpected bid by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can they stop below 6?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looked like 2@s was going down at least 3 which isn't quite good enough because of the vul|pg||
pc|c6|nt|famus: wow-|pg||
nt|baldjean: was 2@d some kind of weak Flannery?|pg||
nt|twcho: with his great @c suit and mediocre support for @H|pg||
nt|gracelin: north is playing south for stronger H and weaker S, probably not warranted.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: don't thk so.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: this is not making.  South may lead C10 to ask for a spade return|pg||
nt|gracelin: or lead SK himself to ensure 4 tricks for defenders.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south has, say : Ax  AJ10xx  Axxx  xx, 4H maybe the winning contract.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  on 13 in CR?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is lucky for them that the @h breaks as friendly as possible|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: guess not |pg||
nt|baldjean: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi|pg||
nt|famus: -2 wud b a god score for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: DA and club now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: 5S maybe a general slam try and south does like his hand.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, in lieu of doubling, N should have been showing his hand...6@d a pretty easy contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|famus: shud duck @h continuation|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should have been using the entries to dummy to ruff @ds|pg||
nt|famus: yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: the deenders are sharp, not giving declarer any chance.|pg||
nt|twcho: Finessing @s seems a better play than playing @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't like the early D play.  takwe spade finesse is more normal line.|pg||
nt|twcho: I think he will go down now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  this getting close to being suicidal|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|twcho: NS has played solidly throughout this match|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, either fast or slowly|pg||
pc|d9|nt|baldjean: not much use though. ruffing @d will give W more trump tricks|pg||
nt|famus: with -2 the match might even out|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h7|nt|gracelin: That explains the scores.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|gracelin: yes, I thk north is very conservative in choosing 3NT.  Double and a trump lead may beat 2S 1,100.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sybarra: E  not listening?|pg||
