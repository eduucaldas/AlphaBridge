nt|jtr: Perhaps 4@h asks in @cs 4@s asks in @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzrn: 5C - 1 ace|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: many pairs use 2 NT to show minors and less than opening - not sure they all know how to handle hands like this|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very short semifinals, 2 segments of 6 boards|pg||

nt|sharkey: NS better introduce the @S suit here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 16 or more Lauria would have bid Gazzilli, 2@C|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jtr: 2@s good @d raise i guess|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

nt|sharkey: Even 5@S as kibs point out|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite vul, would anyone venture a 1@s overcall?|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure Versace would overcall as South but not I|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni would with less|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think the opponents may have some influence....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jtr: Not the right time to correct the count:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: This deal seems to be interesting|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|ralfwil: does E really open?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: the bid probably will not finish before level of 5.... for both lines :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Yes i think so too. Bopth sides have enough tricks for 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: ???|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gluckenval: 1@H - 1NT F1 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: This might cost lots for any of these teams|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|ralfwil: Not shure this is correct too|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass pass first Justas?|pg||
nt|kemperg: technical problems in lithuania?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like that|pg||
nt|kemperg: look like 8 tricks, 2@H,2D and 4@Cs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i watched this board at Laurilas table, and declarer went -1|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzrm: This might be a loss for Italian team|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: OR at same contract by Es hand. So might a push.|pg||

nt|jtr: Yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cricket or Rugby David?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They don't play a lot of cricket in Italy, Carl :)|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4N|an| |mb|p|nt|andyv:  6 clubs happens to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  6N by N may make as leading the @S K  is almost impossible for E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Still on trump lead Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and finally, the 4-3 @h fit will make|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, declarer has 3 @s tricks after the J is led from West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C, 3@D and 3@H all show 3-suiters|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Correction, 3@D, 3@H, 3@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with trump lead, I imagine declarer will have to guess the @d suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4NT quantative here?|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@d shows a major single i believe|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: 3NT would show @s 4NT @s and invite|pg||

nt|sharkey: "pass the buck"....|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|gluckenval: Garvey-Carroll play a 5M system, with 1@C 11-13 balanced or 17+ any, 1@D may have longer clubs and ususally unbalanced. After 1@C their responses are in canap√®. 1NT = 14-16 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: (perfect range, imho :))|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: natural*|pg||

nt|gluckenval: 6NT makable with @SJ ?|pg||
