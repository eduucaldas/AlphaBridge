mb|2H|nt|ricky86: of course :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing hearts i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: and that will not delight south|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think i would want to stress the hearts with north|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: is 4@H now a cue bid or re-transfer?|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 5@s-4+ in a minor 5-10hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is practical bridge, I'm all for that|pg||
nt|athene: he has more a balanced hand with scattered strength, than a heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: but i imagine 1nt was not available (probably showed clubs)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  This will probably end in 3N, making |pg||
nt|mdgraham: always depressing to see partner pass as delaer when all you hold is three jacks |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: raising clubs might work well now|pg||
nt|athene: people rarely do that, though, in this day and age|pg||

nt|athene: east thinking about a diamond sac?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: 5@h??|pg||
nt|ricky86: 5@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: Good lead. @cK and @s switch is diff for decl|pg||
nt|athene: takes a club lead to beat 6@S i guess?|pg||
nt|wboer: It's a deep view by S not converting 2@h to 2@s or 3@d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: This is the last round in the Swiss - 8 best to KO - Japan no 7 with 152 and Australia 1 + 2 + France No 8 with 145|pg||
nt|athene: stops declarer cashing one spade then finessing|pg||
nt|athene: because you don't have the entry to dummy when you need it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: If Poulat has one more to play, diamonds are 4-3 and no worries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a duck caters for a 5-2 split|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome to lovely opatija|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we are having some of the warmest days of the year|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont disagree, but certainly 2H might be the right spot....for example if N has:   x   QJT9xx   xx   Kxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: no comments please.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 5 IMP - in B2 EW stopped in 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess he was playing for e to be 5/5 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|athene: now if it goes 1@S - 1NT from EW, south can't really double, as that is t/o of spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 5@c = min, 5@D = 1/4, 5@H = 0/3, 5@s = 2+@sq + tx Wubbo|pg||
nt|wboer: Ofcourse 2@h could be the right spot, but not likely. |pg||
mb|2C|nt|ricky86: ty :)|pg||
nt|ugis: once again NS can reach 6 diamonds, only that this time it is down 1 after spade ruff|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wboer: but the @dQ holds the trick so east had the @dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT? looks odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will pass and Lebatteux can't really bid again|pg||
nt|athene: north can bid 2@D now |pg||
nt|hajru:  I think they play Gazilli (1M-1N-2@c) for strong balanced hands, freeing up 1M-1N-2N for special hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told Gazzilli, strong 5/5....thanks|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess N will bid 3@c and S will specifiy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D or 2NT in S being non-vul or pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wecan see that 2NT is makeable, but there is a risk that declarer goes wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the question is not really "does 2H rate to be the best spot?" but rather "which is more likely to be best: 2H or whichever correction i will choose?" the fact that 2H is less ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to be right than the BETTER choice of corrections  doesnt automatically make pass the wrong bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has an interesting decision over 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N has decisions now|pg||
nt|ugis: will N bid over 3nt? if S bids 3nt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  4@c cuebid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would not be good to get to slam here |pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: Opatija fotos http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
nt|wboer: some partnerships play 2NT as good/bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has to guess which finesse to take, and if he chooses spades, he must guess who has A and Q|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|athene: i think this is a bit of a sucker double from south in fact|pg||
nt|athene: north clearly has a hand too weak to raise diamonds over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and that is a very weak hand|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|athene: say, 2 points or so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might well beat 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not a sure thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the straightforward bid, but 2H could also be effective, with the plan of bidding 4D if partner  bids 3N at some point|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wboer: 2NT in S for the minors was not poss, because west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: your spades are not exactly well-placed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would get the idea of promary diamond support across while emphasizing hearts|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  E can create some opportunities by playing the A@s and @s|pg||
nt|kakashi84: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: and east didn't have to bid 2nt|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: I am impressed if he gets this right|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: here is looks as if 4N was RKC. many top class pairs use a different call than 4N for KC in the minors, because there is insufficient space between 4N and 5 of the trump suit. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: various forms of this method ar e called "kickback" or "redwood" or other labels. it is a very good idea in principle, but it is essential to have firm agreements on which call is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: KC and WHEN that call is KC|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ugis: they did indeed bid 6d in open room, so France will almost tie the match after board 17|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  on 3rd @s, N will ruff with K@h and finesse for Q|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is a very good example of what s.j. simon talks about in his book|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy 11 tricks - should be flat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has extra offense and extra defense for a 4H bid. should he do something other than 4H to start with(eg 3S)? or should he bid 4H then double later to show extrras (if that is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: their agreement)?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: "why you lose at bridge"|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Wubbo de Boer, world champion 1992|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: he gives a hand almost exactly like this|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  E not aware of hand's potential|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1993, sry|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|wboer: So good/bad 2NT in west meaning a compatative weak 3@c bid with 6-card suit. 3@c in stead off 2NT = 14-16 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If hearts are 5-2, he could have won the first trick and endplayed East with a heart after a few rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N does not know which black king S has, so it may seem that 7D is a dangerous risk. in my view it is the correct call, though, because:  a) S might have heart queen     b)  S might ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have spade king -- he is about a 60% favorite to have that king rather than the club king        c) S might have S jack in which case it is a five-or-seven hand anyway|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand should prove a fruitful source of discussion for EW in finetuning their competitive arsenal |pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: However, that would look silly if East started with six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east putting in the @HJ at trick 1 forced him to commit himself immediately|pg||
nt|athene: much easier if east plays ace and a heart|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: My misguesses never gain IMPs. Hop's do|pg||
nt|athene: north refused to raise clubs in the other room as well on board 2 :(|pg||

mb|p|nt|ricky86: 5 imps to japan|pg||
nt|athene: actually i am not sure the endplay was so useful anyway because when east cashes the hearts, dummy gets squeezed anyway|pg||

nt|athene: if EW stagger into 4@S, will south try another double?|pg||
nt|athene: you might, if they have had an invitational sequence where west showed hearts|pg||
nt|athene: because you know the cards lie badly for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when EW bid 4H to make, NS generally shouldnt be allowed to play 4S undoubled|pg||

nt|athene: the immediate 4@S less likely to draw a double|pg||

mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: some work for East, but @SK sh give him the 9. trick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wboer: He played for the @dK drop.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: when S passes 5C, i think N should also|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: so more IMPs for Japan|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bill and I, among others, got a similar problem on a bidding panel|pg||
nt|athene: you are tempted to make another move after a weak-ish response|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  both E and W overbid their hands slightly|pg||

nt|wboer: In the other room Japan is swinging already|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1@S makes the North hand stronger and a jump was in order|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ricky86: yes, but however was a good contract too|pg||

nt|kakashi84: yes 3@c isn't a good bid, but he knows his part can't reopening and he thinks he must bid|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wondering about the likelihood of north having @DJ10?|pg||
nt|ugis: but, once again, it is not so straightforward at he table  |pg||
nt|ugis: well, or is it? 4c - asks for aces?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Five hands in a row for South to declare |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: disciplined pass by S over 1S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk5: With 1 zillion entries it seems strange that Kido does not lead a club|pg||
nt|wboer: still time to switch for defence|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@c is a big bid for that hand.|pg||
nt|ugis: not familiar with their system, 4c might be natural, sets clubs as trumps...or it might be ace asking|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wboer: 3NT is high but has play if @d are 3/2|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you can guarantee to keep south off lead, your best chance of a double stop in diamonds is to rise the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to cut down on ruffs against the likely 44 fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can scare declarer with spade queen lead:)|pg||
nt|wboer: Not a hand that will be published. prob @c lead, @hT ducked to E and 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: and this one is comfortable as well|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ricky86: a good choice 3nt when you have few points and two balanced hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He feared that Hop had clubs stopped|pg||

nt|hajru:  I think we'll see another declarer than s on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this hand can actually make 6@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good time to get a cuppa, brb|pg||
nt|athene: called "tempo or elopement dilemma" in "adventures in card play"|pg||
nt|ugis: bidding and making a grand allways puts extra pressure on opponents, even when there are 16 tricks available :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H? 4H? |pg||
nt|wboer: What you open with S? 1@h, weak 2 or 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no comment - I try to be nice :)|pg||
nt|ricky86: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: lets see how the rumanians handle it|pg||
nt|wboer: I go for 1@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: @HJ the problem - in Cr S tryed @h9 but also @S here - only @h2/3 will give the message to N|pg||
nt|andyv:  you need to pick up the @s suit...only play that will do that is the J@s lead from S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think 3@D can achieve so much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree, but if you need a swing 4H is fine too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: might just get partner off to the wrong lead against hearts|pg||
nt|athene: north might double this for takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@S now - as in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his side has slightly more than half the deck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D might be short, so maybe West cannot raise to 2@D (could be inverted) |pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: if partner has a heart stack there could be a number on offer|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s probably shows 4@s|pg||
nt|ricky86: shows 4 @s and a maximum hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same lead in OR.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this where it's overwhelmingly likely that the opponents are going to play it, your bids should probably be mostly lead-directing|pg||
nt|athene: mostly you expect pd to pull it but that will hopefully be ok|pg||
nt|ugis: most probably 4h on NS here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: ok, he feels that south bidding spades or diamonds is too likely, and too likely to be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: perfect EW distribution, but with only 8 HCP difficult for W to invite for slam|pg||
nt|wboer: Sure 4@h is a nice swinging bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i had assumed NS play 2/1, in which case 2D is quite a stretch, but N may be looking for a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  1@d as 3+ in standard French style?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: for me S sh pass over 3@s x - 4@D for extra values and no @S-stop|pg||
nt|athene: it seems declarer has the rest here but he can't do it easily with 3-0 trumps|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|Walddk5: I play a gadget when 3@S is doubled. Redouble two or three small|pg||
nt|wboer: i think he wanted to make clear that he had a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Mancoff convention|pg||
nt|ricky86: 1 imps to ned for sure here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and likely same result.|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a very unattractive hand to lead from|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: and too likely to just exchange a small positive for a small negative|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS could have gotten a much needed swing in here if N had not gotten "cold feet"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wboer: He had the feeling they were getting to high if he bids 3@h. Right he was, because that is F|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like 420 to me|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: Playing Mancoff, 4@D would show a singleton spade|pg||
nt|athene: if he draws trumps he has only one club ruff|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello & welcome:)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|ricky86: 4@s very preservative|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Anyway, they reached top spot|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: anyway even if one is right on one particular board, the practice of not respecting game forces (if 2D was one, and if not then 2D followed by 2N surely was?) is a longterm recipe ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for disaster|pg||
nt|wboer: Guessing @h's is not obvious|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: West could try 4@C - sh be singleton after the D in N|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: in one sense there is a motivation for a trump lead. but om the other hand partner may be able to  overruff dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|pg||

nt|marlowepi: approach is that W has too much strength, so E will not be contributing much in high cards. it may be the best strategy to lead a club, planning toi lead another when declarer ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leads a spade, and then maybe W will get a club ruff later|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  Hop is probably wondering how he could have become declarer, so far, he averaged about an overtrick on the hands he played.|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though it's time for east to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, coffee time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: 2S is a 3-way bid:  (a) why should they go down when we can?   (b) let's push them to a game they might not bid and show them how to make it     (c) once in a while, a good result:)...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  W needs to preserve the K@h in dummy.  He should tackle the @s suit now|pg||
nt|athene: NS in the other room gave their opponents some chances to swing the axe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am impressed with the standard I must say. Excellent players, bright future|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it was hard|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: not sure 2@H over 2@D in the other room was a very good bid|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding has gone, the hand looks like a misfit|pg||

nt|marlowepi: that can go down a lot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wboer: In this case you are so right (a en b). In some cases you bid the lead that beats 3NT from opp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is true. but if that is the benefit, we only get to count it when: a) we wouldnt have been on lead ourselves    and/or    b) we wouldnt have gotten to overcall our suit if we ...|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|athene: leading a big heart there so his partner is not tempted to play him for a singleton club, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: hop might lay down the @CK anyway for want of anything better to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are working hard to get many and good junior players all over the world. In Europe, the Netherlands, Poland and France are the strongest youth nations (then add Israel, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: playing in European events). No, I don't want to discuss politics, just stating a fact|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, and it would have allowed north to lead a LOW spade against 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and so avoid making the @S98xxx into a stopper|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but certainly the method has SOME successes, or even the most stubborn wouldnt play it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: if north had been able to show the 5-5 (ghestem, say) then EW might have ended up defending|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, it's possible e-w will be in 3nt at the other table. they do have a @S stopper, but the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess if anyone is playing ghestem this match it will be france :)|pg||
nt|athene: in open events, we assume a break like this is a smoke break :)|pg||
nt|athene: but not in junior events, haha|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|wboer: Made easely after trick 2. @c by S in trick 4 would save a trick. Now 130|pg||

nt|petergill: Andy, thanks for holding the fort while I was otherwise engaged|pg||
nt|andy_h: No problem, Gerben (who was here) helped out a bit too|pg||
nt|andy_h: The total scores as shown should not be read into, as the pairs are constantly moving from table to table after every two boards|pg||

nt|oosb: yes, A@D lead and defence can get 2 ruffs + 2 more @c|pg||
nt|wboer: They went for the beer after this board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i expect to see a glossy picture of that deal on the next promotional brochure for Muyderberg|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final, ARG URU are 3 up against NED RUM|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a good 4@h contract the EW may not get to|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, it is hard to see how to defeat this without getting a number of H tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Let's make a prediction - small swing to France on the 4@S-1 hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: down 400 when opps were going to go down 200 in 3N:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  I wonder if 2@s is a one round force|pg||
nt|ricky86: maybe they can get if NS bid @ds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Absolutely one sided match so far.|pg||
nt|oosb: but without the dbl -400 actually gains against 650!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marginal opening bid by W, the French establishment might frown on it so perhaps not opened in the other room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: @d ruff will beat !3s on a ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  You're not looking at the other table, are you?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Since North jumped inn 3!n i would have played AKQ. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: 3@s is delicate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good spot reached by France in the other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, just this one|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 5@C/5@D will cost 300 against 4 major, but with all green u normal not go for this save - but sometimes u can push opp to 5-level!!|pg||
nt|pelu: both Ns broke Rolands rule No 1 : no weak to with 2 Aces :)|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows a balanced hand south may go for the nine-trick game|pg||
nt|oosb: not an opening for me|pg||
nt|oosb: not even marginal for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you may have a career awaiting you in France:)|pg||
nt|oosb: :)|pg||
nt|wboer: true, no pr for Muiderberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would, with 4333 and strength in all side suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most of the players at this table are unknown to me, but i know E fairly well --  one of USA's most promising juniors, Marius is a Romanian living in the US  and playing here on a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: largely Dutch team. this kind of ecumenical transnationalism is very good for bridge |pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk5: Indeed|pg||
nt|hajru:  And then what?  You know that partner cannot have much and even if you set up a 4th heart, how can you cash it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather open 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D looks like an underbid if it isn't forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid 3NT, and they did in both rooms. Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to have no problem in bidding with marginal hands|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazzili. 2@d = 8+ hcp, 2@s = 5@h + 4@s 18+|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt could be a good hand, though, south might feel obliged to show the support in case they have slam|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt with north, certainly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: as u understand, I dont agree with him :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Ricardo and Wubbo would u open 1@h or 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 3NT, have to bid.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  if north have A@c im hopeing to get inn on single @c K :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 1nt showing hearts and diamonds|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wboer: 6@c is a beauty, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|athene: another trick is to avoid 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the double I wonder. He knows he will be on lead himself|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wboer: 4NT = NF, kanti|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed yes. with QJ@H falling.|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt - 3nt is a reasonable auction i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is itching to double, but the spectre of -470 is a forbidding vision|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|wboer: quantitative|pg||
nt|athene: against diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I would rather be in 3nt than 4@S here, but they should make it either way|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|wboer: You have 11 toptricks with @c not 5/1. Enough entries to develop 5th @h or @dA good|pg||
nt|wboer: Well bid again by EW|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|oosb: lively auction here|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this @c play is best.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wboer: I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: i play 2@h 10-12 with 6 cards, but here i think is weak.. i don't agree|pg||
nt|ricky86: i would open 1 @h|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have Ax of trumps you have to jump in with the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to get endplayed later|pg||
nt|veistikke:  to cash the last @H :P|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: but i think west should be able to see that is not the issue on this hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: made easy.:)|pg||
nt|athene: not clear to run this because if you lose to west's queen, you just incurred an extra loser and you don't have anything so useful to throw on dummy's clubs|pg||
nt|wboer: The @h lead could be from 5 and he didn't expect N to have 4 @c's |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: even if he does, it's only an imp :)|pg||
nt|ugis: it is all about getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|ugis: must lead the diam Q from dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|pelu: and give N @Hj 10 and not the Q would u still open 1@h|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but one of the more embarrassing ones to concede|pg||
nt|athene: pitching a red card might be useful but it might not be|pg||
nt|ugis: well OK, must find the trump Q too, but it should not be a problem|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|wboer: Oops, no cover and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well W doesnt know that N has only 4 hearts, so the likelihood that N has Jxxx of clubs probably seemed small to him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i duplicated your remark:)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only complaint I have regarding these youngsters is that they double (lead-directing) way too much. Most of the time it helps the opponents more than partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W would have done better not to double 2C. he is dead minimum for an opener (if that) and his clubs are not all that great  -- and meanwhile  2C is the contract that suits ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Simon was caught off guard for some reason|pg||
pc|s9|nt|oosb: Yes but after 1NT dbl, he perhaps expected 2@H to be dbled too?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should perhaps have led a trump, and W should perhaps have switched to diamonds at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but is it so clear that he wants to defend 2HX rather than 2C undoubled?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ugis: apparently I might be wrong again :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but I guess he will still play it from the top|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|athene: yes, we have seen lots of lead doubles in the last few days|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|oosb: that's a good question :)|pg||
nt|ugis: the more you think in those situations, the more likely it is that you will go for the percentage play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ugis: I mean if you "feel" that the Q is with E, you do not think, you finesse in tempo :)|pg||
nt|ugis: after two non-vulnerable game swings we see France 1 IMPahead|pg||
mc|10|nt|warrens:  it's a close call, since it's likely the @C 5 is from the queen|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The Italian top guns hardly ever double, and there is a good reason for it|pg||
nt|athene: i think i have seen one of about eight that was useful for the defence|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, the French picked up 5 on the 4@s -1 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT making by South on 22 - 5 to France|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  our first slam|pg||
nt|pelu: so u open on 9+ - is that on your CC?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better check my lottery numbers|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is a very strong result for the Dutch|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: There are problem with running score - prob so many try to enter, that the server cant manage|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR board 8 the contract is 6@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For a start, you have to bid 3NT, and then make it if you do|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: does 1@C promise four clubs? rare these days|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wboer: my cc is secret|pg||

nt|ugis: 3h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I would upgrade to 10, so yes, 10-21 is on my CC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another double coming|pg||
nt|kakashi84: I think, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then Poulat has to decide|pg||
nt|athene: west could have bid 3@D but he prefers to wait for his partner's second double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i played with him 4 days straight in the Open at Juan les Pins and he made no such mistakes. this event is far more grueling though:)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  safest slam is 6N|pg||
nt|ugis: 2H certainly too pesimistic for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would be lebensohl i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is a reasonable punt|pg||
nt|bobholl: at other vulnarabilty he'd have passed i guess 98 are pretty :)|pg||
nt|athene: AK98 a lot nicer than AK87! one trick nicer in fact :)|pg||
nt|athene: guaranteed a double stop|pg||
nt|athene: sorry triple stop|pg||
nt|ugis: 6-4, a terrific 15 points....somewhere between 3 and 4 hearts for me..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though some would say that even a month-long tournament could not be more grueling than 4 sessions with me:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk5: Did you give up on tournament bridge completely, Wubbo? We don't see you any more|pg||
nt|rnmalik: late:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to beat this|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: wd by EW there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: dont be wrong - they can play bridge "down under" :)|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: lead @D :)|pg||
nt|wboer: I play the nice festivals in europe and some leage bridge in Holland Also coach/captain with my wife Agnes of this Dutch juniors|pg||
nt|hajru:  As I'm rooting for the Dutch, 16 flat boards is good for the result|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reasonable lead. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many players would open 2N on the S hand, but that would be ill-advised on a hand that is so well-sculpted for play in a suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|wboer: There is a loosing option in 6@h after @dA and @d. Enter dummy with @d ruff to play for @hQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we can see that it can be set, but it is very tough at the table|pg||
nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||
nt|wboer: Light opening and light take out double. |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo @C lead in that hand would create problems for 6@H.|pg||
nt|hajru:  but I guess the specs don't like it. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|ricky86: shared lead but there isn't a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|wboer: @h lead will beat it. Taking @sA and @h switch will make life diff for decl. He still makes it because the block in @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: and now it's too late already|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: north, reasonably enough, excpected much better clubs for 3@C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ricky86: yes, no problems here for NS. they have 6@c 6@h and 6NT :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but on the actual layout, declarer soon will have a big smile|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oosb: Do you think this auction will be duplicated at all 4 tables?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|wboer: Good defense|pg||
nt|oosb: do you bid 1@H as N too?|pg||
nt|ugis: in the open room S going 2 down in 4h dbld|pg||
nt|ugis: so 9 more imps to France|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: south might underlead the hearts i suppose but that still nets only four tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @H ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: When I was a junior boards with only a single-figure swing rated as flat|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wboer: Now easy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: the double may have more going for it than the opening, but i am ok with either (or with pass)|pg||
nt|wboer: He knows W has @dKQ. So he could misguess the @h-suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: but as for identical auctions, maybe someone will open 2N|pg||
nt|oosb: and end in 4@H as well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well plod away at hearts and hope for a miracle|pg||
nt|hajru:  That is so long ago, that I can't remember|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I didn't really want to add that |pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: if south had not raised clubs and it had gone, say, 1nt - 3nt, then north might lead the @HQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: plod away at spades sry|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: I like the D + 3@D by East - in CR E just jump to 3@D - that dont show a running suit|pg||

pc|dK|pc|s9|pc|d5|nt|warrens:  S needs to pitch a @H to avoid an overtrick|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@C some form of Drury|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S weakest, signoff, thus Reverse Drury|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: 2@C showed spade support and max Pass|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: At a more suitable vulnerability, North should probably Dbl 2@S or 1@S for t/o, as the small differences at BAM scoring encourage vigorous competition for partscores|pg||
nt|petergill: but not at this extremely unsuitable vulnerability|pg||
nt|andy_h: Drury is one of those conventions that has a love/hate passion attached to it. Some people like to open light in 3rd seat and with the aid of the 2@C drury convention they can stop ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: low without having partner to compete too high unnecessarily. |pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: @D5 by S, with singleton in dummy, is suit pref to say "I like @h more than 1C"|pg||
nt|andy_h: The haters would regard the convention as a possible "psyche control bid", and that they dislike giving up the natural 2@C bid (or the potential double of an artificial 2@C)|pg||
nt|petergill: but this @D5 was hard for N to read, with hidden hand having 1098|pg||

pc|c8|nt|petergill: or is it 170?|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think I'm in like category too, because 3rd seat openings can be very tactical that I nearly consider mandatory and it's certainly worth the gain vs. the potential loss of the ...|pg||

nt|petergill: If West assumes @CA is a true card and plays @CA, @HJ, @SK, then top @H, relying on @H 3-3, then 10 tricks might be made, but if @H 4-2, perhaps ducking the club is best |pg||

nt|athene: since the @HK is overwhelmingly likely to be in dummy|pg||
nt|warrens:  but E might have claimed a little early|pg||
nt|athene: that is a 1@H opener for most in this event, i suspect|pg||
nt|veistikke:  South can also duck the @H |pg||
nt|hajru:  Rehi, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: on raw loser count, it is a 3H bid, but with 3 aces and only one queen, it is adjusted to a 4H call. unless of course one has alternative ways to show a hand worth 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  got disconnected but it looks as if I didn't miss much.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: After all, game is on a finesse|pg||
nt|athene: what will east rebid after 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 3@s?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  anyone got link to the results?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ricky86: Donati-Percario play a very good bridge for their age. I should mention that Donati is 13 yo and Percario is 16 yo :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East had @CJ instead of the 10, 4@S can be defeated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as it is, 5@C is a correct save|pg||
nt|athene: NS do well to "take the money" here since pressing on to 5@S would lead to a negative score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many french players have various calls available as opener to distinguish different types of raises to 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would go for 2nt i think|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you misdescribe you hand always :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course, agonized pause and self-recrimination for opening in the first place is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|athene: and it looks as though east is going for that :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would open 1N with E hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wboer: What should N bid? Pass is ok imo|pg||
nt|athene: you might not be too happy taking a probable 500 against your vul game, but you don't want to go for "650 or maybe -100" instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in other lands too as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: strange but winning because @dA is wrong. Do they play a strong @c system?|pg||
nt|pelu: they prob play 2@S contructiv and he didnt like to bid 1NF (forsing - semiforcing)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has no choice.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a very pure hand here and imagines short spades with partner so will sac i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: also 5@C takes blackwood away from north|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: because it uses up SO much room|pg||
nt|athene: when the auction gets icky like this, it's a good idea to favour the cheaper bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: but Australia need 19-11 to pass Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If they do, West'|pg||
nt|Walddk5: s hand is worth a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: which might be what he is about to bid|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qtournid=897&qphase=SF&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|ugis: 6clubs on a finesse...down 1 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and possibly reach 4H|pg||
nt|wboer: yes, I can imagine 1NT. But that would mean EW could get to 4@h making.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, surprised|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be getting old - prefer 2@c to 2@d|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt also down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so this could be an opportunity for france, except that in general the french are even more unlikely to open 1N than their opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: W deterred fronm mentioning hearts by the X|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  the other option is 2nt, which is tough on Jxx.  I actually don't like 1@H very much, unless playing a strong club.|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is 2NT but with Jxx i can't like that too :)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec comments that if you can't stomach 2nt, 3@S must be better than 3@H, which seems right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that the vulnerability here has been an inhibiting factor. for example, at favorable colors N (though not a french N) might overcall 1D|pg||
nt|ugis: 4h an interesting contract, 5c = nothing interesting :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: 10@C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Pity if partner had @CJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hei and welcome|pg||
nt|hajru:  Hi Dan|pg||
nt|wboer: Buying the contract in 3@c is very good for france. Open room could get to 3@s down on a couple of @h-ruffs|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  that is good to know|pg||
nt|wboer: 3NT will make. N won't lead a @c|pg||
nt|ricky86: good contract 4@s but unlucky|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi|pg||
pc|s9|nt|oosb: good contract with the double fit|pg||
nt|ugis: 6h = too much luck needed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: 21-count 3NT - and it looks like it will make |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the ace, diamond ruff, club to the jack, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  5 clubs and 4 red suit winners.|pg||
nt|ugis: after the diamond lead 6h makes I guess :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: possibly open room could get to 4H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|wboer: 3@s will be the contract only if you open 1@s ofcourse|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ricky86: they are the future of Italy bridge :)|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hajru:  N will probably run a C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though there is some work to do|pg||
pc|h3|nt|veistikke:  5@c and 5@h and 1 @d :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and EW can't take three spade tricks, unless North misguesses - unlikely|pg||
nt|djneill:  seems like West can only hope that North has at most 5@c, 2@d, and one @h, so continuing diamonds might be best|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be normal. but north is getting 11 if west continues inn @d |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: no update on running score after 3 boards of this match|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|hajru:  That would give him something like xxx/AJxxx/AJx/xx and that is not a 2N rebid|pg||
nt|ugis: DA, Club A and a club = |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|athene: in some situations like this, i think that opener's cue should not be strong|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: it should just say "i have no bid"|pg||
nt|athene: typically a weak notrump with no stop|pg||
pc|h5|nt|djneill:  well North could have the @sK, but cannot establish it|pg||
nt|hajru:  South gives up ;)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|wboer: This will be 9 or 11 imp's back to japan|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ugis: but it is double dummy of course :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: the trump play is more or less clearcut , when opps have ten diamonds and never bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: let's say for example you open 1@D, 1@S overcall, 2@H from your pd|pg||
nt|veistikke:  now 12|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: nice try - but no succes|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|oosb: +1|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oosb: 4 more boards in the first session of this final. Total 4 sessions of 14 boards each|pg||
nt|oosb: or is it different for 3/4?|pg||
nt|oosb: 3 sessions I'm told since this is 3rd/4th |pg||
nt|oosb: Ah and the room title reads 1/3 dohh|pg||
nt|oosb: Are they taking a break?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this has been a relatively quiet match so far, for this age group...only a couple of big hands|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: now it makes a lot of sense for your 2@S to just say "i  have no support, no rebid, no stop"|pg||
pc|d4|mc|8|nt|andyv:  with @cs dividing, declarer will no other problems here|pg||
