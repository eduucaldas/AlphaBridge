nt|Walddk2: :)  Henry loves that debate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I had it with him the other day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I claim that thereis no such thing as semi-forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but most who play forcing NT do not include game forces in the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
nt|finch:  semi-forcing NT is about as meaningful as grand slam force (which at least is forcing!)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jallerton: I disagree. If you don't include any game forces in your 1NT response then why play it as forcing?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|finch:  Declarer has a difficult problem on the club back|pg||
nt|finch:  he might need the finesse for his 9th trick, but if the majors come in and East has the @CK he's just off by finessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: yeah but no diffrent which card to play here:) lucky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Forcing 1N was originally used to allow invitational hands to bid 1N rather than at the two level, and facilitate 2/1 gf|pg||
nt|finch:  I wonder what declarer can infer from West winning the first spade with the queen and the second with the 10|pg||
nt|finch:  what holdings would do that?|pg||
nt|jallerton: KQ10 and KQ104|pg||
nt|finch:  or as has just be suggested to me, someone with the @CK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think if E had the @ck he would have returned the @d2|pg||
nt|finch:  there are plenty of positions where you just don't bother given suit preference without an ace|pg||
nt|finch:  and this is one of them|pg||
nt|jallerton: @s 3-3 seems more likely than @s4-2 with both rounded suits coming in|pg||
nt|finch:  why would East want to help declarer by showing whether or not he has the @CK?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not a great result for N-S|pg||
nt|finch:  admittedly not very likely, but an extra chance|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 7 than 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|finch:  I think they must have had a bidding misunderstanding at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: likely to bid slam now that 2@c has been opened, one would think|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|finch:  after a 2@C opening and a heart suit, North has a virtual slam force|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 3@H should set the suit and ask for a cuebid|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|finch:  the old-fashioned way to play is the 3@H asks for a first round control, responder bids 3NT with a king but no ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which it probably did|pg||
nt|jallerton: assuming 2@C was their strongest bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch:  with that understanding 3@S showed the ace|pg||
mb|r!|mb|p|nt|finch:  but with that understanding so did 5@C, so they may be cuebidding first or second|pg||
nt|finch:  redouble here will show first round club control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't he also bid 3NT with a singleton, Frances? Any second round control? I don't know Acol that well|pg||
nt|finch:  yes, sorry, 3NT with a second round control; cue with a first round control|pg||
nt|henryb:  As I played that, 3@s showed the @sA and no other ace. 4N would show two aces|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|nt|jallerton: In original Acol, you were supposed to make a positive on any hand with 2 aces|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|jallerton: 5NT should show something extra but no further 2nd round control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to play, not so at the table|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought I was in 7|pg||
nt|finch:  yes I think 6 isn't so hard|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose the right way to play this is @cA, @c ruff, @h, @c ruff, @d finesse|pg||
nt|finch:  not in 6 it isn't|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not?|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d ruff?|pg||
nt|finch:  the ace of diamonds might get ruffed off|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, making 7 is an imp|pg||
nt|henryb:  Once both opponents follow to three clubs and one heart, the probability of a stiff diamond becomes vanishingly small|pg||
nt|finch:  so you need it to be a smaller chance than 1 in 21 that there is a diamond ruff|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|finch:  once everyone follows to the first trump this is indeed safe for 6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
mc|13|nt|finch:  once trumps were 2-1, this line is also safe for 12 tricks and makes 13 sometimes (as here) so is better|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chick: and might get a @D lead ... W doesn't have an easy hand to lead from|pg||
nt|april7: trump lead in 7 ofcourse|pg||
nt|chick: might lead a trump in 6, just because everything else looks worse|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: Open room already played 4 bds and now in the way to finish his 5th, so we might get some action early than expected|pg||
nt|april7: against 7 almost always lead a trump!!@Have you forgotten|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes, and so was I: about 7 or eight hicards are divided between West and North. There is no reason to expect that your side has a suit fit, or that partner has the majority of those high cards|pg||
nt|finch:  the earlier @HJ discard made life easy for South, he knows that East has the @HAQ|pg||
