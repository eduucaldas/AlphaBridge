pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nkgupt: not this play anyway:)|pg||
nt|babs59: I had a partner who used to double failing 3NT contracts and when the opponents ran to 4m she'd also double - and I'm an expert at 510 to 1110 as a result!|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|dslee: thanks mak|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sunit thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: It is rare that 2C is passed,  2C can be a big hand, just short of a jumpshift or 2NT bid as it was here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: pls check scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  with an opening hand and 3@d, 2N is a bit of an underbid but E was able to raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders have changed now it is Jaggy and Dalal|pg||
nt|patricck: The difference of 416 can really be divided by 13 because each score is matched with every one of the other 13 tables, so it is like being about 32 imps behind the leaders|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi welcome NK|pg||
nt|dslee: none of these folks except sunit is very spontenous - i wonder why this bid happened|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is headed for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: looks like -100, with care|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi in long trance |pg||
nt|nkgupt: did not understand seeking pd's opinion and then overrule him :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dslee: well there you see|pg||
pc|dA|nt|strike12: we have every round updates at the above link, so keep urself posted |pg||
nt|dslee: difficult to crack|pg||
nt|dslee: -1|pg||
nt|animeshraj: becoz 6S . should come with HA.J sort of|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ianmcc: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  how high would they stop? even grand is makeable|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|patricck: 2 spades and 2 trump losers unless declarer is a genius|pg||
nt|patricck: 2 spade losers and 2 heart losers on the face of it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzjh: 7 claimed|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gm all.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjh: After this round will be lunch break and we shall be back at 1345 i.e. after 1 hr 45 minutes |pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT probably would also have been 1 light|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: 10 should score well continuing clubs pays off|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, this certainly is safe enough|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but to bid it, E has to imagine exactly such a hand by partner - with long side suit|pg||
nt|peachy: W needs to have control of the auction, E described his in opening and then 3S, I assume|pg||
nt|peachy: This is still makeable if declarer is careful|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|psridhar: Anil will lose 2@h and 4 trumps for d1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi makarand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzjh: hello again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT was possible, not 5@c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: one of the flatest i suppose 4@h-1 all round?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|peachy: or has X-ray eyes :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|babs59: placed currently 4th and 22nd|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|psridhar: RV in lead still?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|babs59: but only 9 ahead of Ashok Goel trio|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a matter of overtricks only|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|strike12: if S can steal a @c trick he could had made 11 |pg||
mc|9|nt|psridhar: looong way to go|pg||

nt|babs59: might as well be there as the 4C in the other room|pg||
nt|psridhar: calculated to go minus :) oppo will decide by how much|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: is wat ps and i said he did not think he had a pd :)|pg||
nt|babs59: swap the major aces?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|psridhar: how about giving @c king to oppo?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|babs59: well I think his 3NT says he has a great fit for clubs, so Venky can now pass 3NT or run to 4C depending on his hand|pg||
nt|babs59: in fact, he IS consulting his partner|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|babs59: but then it's all a matter of how you and your partner think, right?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: but you have already pushed the auction to 4 level B, as a 1N opener are u ok doing that?|pg||
nt|babs59: only if you think that you don't want to defend 3@D|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: did your pd behave in a manner that your @C fit is relevant?|pg||
nt|babs59: so I guess Subhash made that decision|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: 4@H is mighty close here|pg||

nt|strike12: i think he unblocked @d 10|pg||
nt|strike12: to claim 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: as far as i think he didnt unblock|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: but he claimed and it was accepted|pg||

nt|psridhar: my partner is not free|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: both Venky and Sreedharan also have played for INdia the BB|pg||
nt|peachy: Venky also an international level player|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome |pg||
nt|patricck: I am told the difference is 330 imps, as the website is a round behind, so Gupta and Venky are effectively about 25 imps behind the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thats why i announced the scores after 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this vul they play 2/1|pg||

nt|sga1: 5  832  Ashok Goel - Sudhir - Suhas Vaidya|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  with Aces and Kings, 1@h might have been a better choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: nothing much will make|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ianmcc: So the lower N/S stop the better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS aren't strong enough to reach the game but EW may push them|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S might be a pre-blocking bid|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ah! there u go.|pg||
nt|patricck: should just reach a club partscore here|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: the page is still to be updated|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I am informed of a change in the lunch times and next round will start at13 30 i.e after 1 hr 30 minutes |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Germ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi all |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, looks like preempt, but N will be surprised with result|pg||
nt|sga1: Scores are available till last round on this website :  http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3NT alway OK, overtricks if @d not led|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to reach a slam on 5-2 |pg||
nt|strike12: do we have the current results after round 8 Mak?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to X|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can do quite well in hearts but not so easy to come into the auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ianmcc: losing 1 in each suit. average|pg||
nt|babs59: this is one of those hands where the transfer doesn't exactly improve the contract|pg||

nt|nkgupt: quite a position to take to defend 1ntX when pd did not open even 3rd seat|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|strike12: The @s position is favourably placed, so dec has good chances for scoring it|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sunit can smoke out the trump ace now |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: live scores can be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will make 90|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  E will get his 4 tricks and that seems to be it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psridhar: in the air|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may anticipate difficulties with rebid after 1@h opening, but this time both 1NT and @h partscore -  no play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not much worse in NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  true as to play of hand...and 1N usually fine with a 5 card major...here, however, the major is top heavy and the outside points are in Aces...those cards belong in a suit contract.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ianmcc: maybe not a @d|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims 7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzjh: the running scores can be seen on the link http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: he then has 8 ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|strike12: @s 10 vital card|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a correct guess in diamonds probably brings 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting position appears after 6 @h tricks, let's see|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: about 15 kibitzers around the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Rajesh dep in thought|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzjh: all smiling on the table |pg||
nt|babs59: yes - I had the hearts inverted in my mind (defensive hearts)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|patricck: oops|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ianmcc: yes 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  costly switch by S|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|psridhar: that misguess however spells doom|pg||
nt|patricck: now the heart loser goes on the spades|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  or so may be the case - playing W not to have last spade |pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer is taking a line that will allow making.  Ordinarily 5-3 fit in trump contract is preferred, but with enough for game+, NT often better|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|strike12: This will be home soon|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: both pairs playing some variations of precision|pg||
nt|psridhar: JM wasnt tested in other room|pg||
nt|peachy: E might have played the last spade when he was in with a diamond|pg||
nt|peachy: And declarer might not have pulled 2 trumps|pg||
nt|peachy: \|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as usually, a game of errors|pg||
nt|peachy: 6-3|pg||
nt|panja: y, N hand is worth way about 21 HCP|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably 3NT N/S and not good|pg||
nt|ianmcc: when is next|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u in 15 minutes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u after 15 minutes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: sif they lead 4th besst South should play @hQ at trick1|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: I think that will be some imps in there for making 3NT, much harder on a heart lead|pg||
nt|patricck: both sides can make 11 tricks|pg||
mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|psridhar: Sunit 's first seat preempts are not bonded by Llyods of London :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 4@H will need careful handling|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be a snacks break and the next match would start at IST 1745 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: alerted|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good stuff where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: @h6 is a powerful card after j7 drops|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: a big pickup for NS as they gain in terms of Total Imps|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N made good decision - knowing partner has good @h fit, N sees 6 tricks in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, so declarer gets 2 hearts 2 clubs 3 diamonds and a spade before EW get 3 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|patricck: hard to know about the first board, but that was definitely a few imps for EW|pg||
mb|1H|an|alerted|nt|ianmcc: another trouble hand, but not big trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N balanced in passout seat over 1N, E dbld and W played in 2@d, making|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@C Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: W might just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: that puts Arun in a fix|pg||
nt|ianmcc: noone told Anil Padhy|pg||
nt|peachy: Was fortunate they had the agreement to show max with good supp|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: Isn't this pairs?|pg||
nt|panja: 25 HCP..this should be a routine game..10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this foursome have played for INdia so many times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome back |pg||
nt|sga1: 1@C - 17+, dbl 5-7 HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can have two heart tricks, I believe a heart lead from east is awkward too|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: it is IMP pairs |pg||
nt|strike12: 6@s is on if bid|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not familiar with NS system, sorry|pg||
nt|peachy: Standard, with transfers over 1C opening, I was told|pg||
nt|peachy: If anyone interested to see what K & R hand evaluator says about it, here http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@hX -1 or -2 looks about right|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 1@H is a transfer style response|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzjh: The Pair of A Goel and Suhas Vaidya will be playing for Indian in this BB|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: This will be costly for EW|pg||
nt|strike12: Very Costly now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: OK tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: total 28 contestanting pairs |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all play all each pair plays 6 boards against each other barometer|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Modified Precision|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N opens with the end-contract possible, but both sides here have to tell something|pg||
mb|3H|nt|strike12: is N still thinking for a Save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could go down 4|pg||
nt|panja: if W gets to underlead the @CA sometime..it could get interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should duck this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but success!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|andyv:  I mean N|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psridhar: Anil knows it alright-but his 5@d was calculated to test Arun -he knows he has long @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: we will do without those snacks but pl provide us coffee :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: that is abut 45 minutes from now |pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you kibs and Mak|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 27 natural def beats 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: no X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes was a pause |pg||
nt|ianmcc: how do we get a score so fast?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this score is only a comparison of the two vugraph tables|pg||
nt|psridhar: +300|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: bad bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: the game is tooo fast to make all explanations of alerted bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: It is no problem, Mak.  Let me quote somebody: Operator is like a long tailed cat in a small room of rocking chairs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|babs59: hi Ian.  Kiran had to find the lead of a small Diamond|pg||
nt|nkgupt: but is a good save:)|pg||
nt|patricck: it is true eats woud have to pitch a heart if declarer started with two rounds of clubs vs 3NT on a heart lead, but what declarer would cash 2 club tricks at the start of that ...|pg||
nt|patricck: hand?|pg||
nt|patricck: ah yes I said both sides make 11 tricks, but I was wrong, the @D ruff holds spades to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: South was planning on bidding spades twice before bidding @H|pg||
nt|patricck: the transfer response means South is playing this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 H was transfer positive response|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzjh: ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzjh: after a long thought|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the best way - try to reach the table with @s|pg||
nt|sga1: seems like 4 losers 2@d, 1@h and 1@c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: Club lead, or club now, will give declarer plenty trouble making|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ianmcc: wrong guess|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: he might make if he doesn't touch hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: of course Subhash could make but only if he flies the DK immediately|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzjh: yes sorry my fault|pg||

nt|andyv:  in mp, you have to be...but in teams, best contract wins most of the time|pg||

mb|3N|nt|babs59: if the vulnerability was the other way round, would you try for a penalty now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes -but they may not X|pg||

nt|psridhar: Goel thinking of 4Maj sac now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: would prove expensive|pg||
nt|psridhar: he also knows oppo can lead trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: and they both would!|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|babs59: I think it is way more likely that partner has @H on this auction.  This does not sound like an auction where dummy has a singleton;  he'd have many other options |pg||

nt|psridhar: let them make their game first|pg||
mc|11|nt|babs59: so then the small change becomes much more worthwhile...  but an error of judgement also costs a lot more|pg||

nt|patricck: this won't be the only table to score 5@H doubled I am sure, but still a very good board for EW|pg||
nt|patricck: that should be flat across the room|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: can NS find 3N here?|pg||

nt|andyv:  4@h could go for 800|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be the lunch break and next match will start at 1400 Hrs IST i.e about an hr from now|pg||
nt|babs59: Kiran and Satya play transfer responses to 1C, so this shows spades|pg||
nt|patricck: another board with not many imps at stake|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: this one interesting Little for anyone|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opponents are guessing and the 5-level too expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: but She has played for India in BB several times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: in the open catagory |pg||
nt|peachy: Hearts play remarkably well|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: subhash writing explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: pls visit http://royale.hpage.com for running scores |pg||
nt|babs59: it might go 1H  1S  2D  P?|pg||
nt|babs59: or  1H  1S  2NT  |pg||
nt|babs59: if the latter, then 3NT will be reached|pg||
nt|psridhar: subh's decn now|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@d will go all pass|pg||
nt|panja: this must be @H and @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Venky explaing to Sreedhar subhasgh 2S|pg||
nt|peachy: 4D could fit jump apparently, promising nice diamonds _ heart fit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: counting carefully I see 5@c should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: Kokish relay on 2@c going on here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@c was an underbid, lucky|pg||
nt|ianmcc: perhaps they will reach 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggi  + Dalal|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: undo pls|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - he's more likely to downgrade than upgrade that hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing small @h E expectes exactly the @hK, Ace could have been better, as for me|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  hut off!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|babs59: and 2D could be on a 3532 hand shape too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N played by Subhash may be in trouble on @s lead|pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.com/ website with info and results after Round 9|pg||
nt|babs59: that North hand is remarkably similar to Kiran's hand last board!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: certainly not 5@d|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner's strength is unknown and the decn to bid 5@s is making an unwarranted assumption tht they can make and we shd save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@d better|pg||
nt|babs59: 2D by Subhash won't pose any difficulties tho|pg||
nt|panja: this will be difficult..|pg||
nt|patricck: @C offside and @S onside, with one pitch forom the diamonds there should be 10 tricks|pg||

pc|dT|pc|s4|nt|twcho: with squeeze possibility|pg||

nt|patricck: yes, thats better, pass then 1C, 1s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: to open S or not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html is the exact webpage for running scores |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for E/W but not in clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: X looks brave - will he pass 5@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya in a trance|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
nt|peachy: East hand is much too good for any sort of premptive action, 1S is normal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: where are the present pairs running?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all scores may be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@d shows hearts|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: Transfers in Intervention - a good tool|pg||
nt|sga1: Now slam chances with aggressive bidding by S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too hard for the elderly|pg||
nt|babs59: pick a slam?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panja: is this Match Points or IMPS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd suggest 2@s bid by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C might be transfer, in competition|pg||
nt|peachy: transfer to 2D, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was alerted by Satya |pg||
nt|sga1: Now 5@c cue should take them to slam|pg||
nt|patricck: Sorry, table collapsed there for a moment.... presume players are just picking the cards up off the floor and reorganising :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board?  yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  low level bid and acceptable doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: one more after this |pg||
nt|babs59: now 6D by Satya, and 6H by Kiran|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: IMPS Total|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@H showing 4+ @s, 1NT - denies 3@S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: 6 boards per rd, Total IMPs scoring (Pairs)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D will go one down for sure...two likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: trying to correct the score of last deal|pg||
nt|panja: W is taking a huge gamble with that double, holding five of his HCP in @H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opportunity lost|pg||
nt|sga1: you never know, S may carry on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good sequence|pg||
nt|patricck: Any other vulnerability it would have been Ok to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
nt|panja: ah..the lead solves one big problem for the Declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: He is following the pronciple that the person short in their fit suit must be aggressive, but I'm sure he too wishes his 5HCP in hearts were in another suit :)|pg||
nt|peachy: *principle|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|panja: GIB might show this as one down...but will likely be -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  only  point of interest on this hand is if N can guess the @hs|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly without the lightner it is easier to beat slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S would have shown a small profit for NS -500 instead of -620|pg||
nt|patricck: North will eliminate the spades and diamonds and then run the J@C for an endplay, but as one of the club honours is onside the endplay will have been unnecessary|pg||
mc|12|nt|babs59: and board 1 reflects that policy too|pg||
nt|patricck: ??|pg||
nt|patricck: not making 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: corrected :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was 11|pg||
nt|patricck: ty|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: agree|pg||
