nt|oosb: yes, A@D lead and defence can get 2 ruffs + 2 more @c|pg||
nt|wboer: They went for the beer after this board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i expect to see a glossy picture of that deal on the next promotional brochure for Muyderberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final, ARG URU are 3 up against NED RUM|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  a good 4@h contract the EW may not get to|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, it is hard to see how to defeat this without getting a number of H tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Let's make a prediction - small swing to France on the 4@S-1 hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: down 400 when opps were going to go down 200 in 3N:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  I wonder if 2@s is a one round force|pg||
nt|ricky86: maybe they can get if NS bid @ds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Absolutely one sided match so far.|pg||
nt|oosb: but without the dbl -400 actually gains against 650!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marginal opening bid by W, the French establishment might frown on it so perhaps not opened in the other room?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wboer: @d ruff will beat !3s on a ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  You're not looking at the other table, are you?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Since North jumped inn 3!n i would have played AKQ. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: 3@s is delicate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good spot reached by France in the other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, just this one|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: 5@C/5@D will cost 300 against 4 major, but with all green u normal not go for this save - but sometimes u can push opp to 5-level!!|pg||
nt|pelu: both Ns broke Rolands rule No 1 : no weak to with 2 Aces :)|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows a balanced hand south may go for the nine-trick game|pg||
nt|oosb: not an opening for me|pg||
nt|oosb: not even marginal for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you may have a career awaiting you in France:)|pg||
nt|oosb: :)|pg||
nt|wboer: true, no pr for Muiderberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would, with 4333 and strength in all side suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most of the players at this table are unknown to me, but i know E fairly well --  one of USA's most promising juniors, Marius is a Romanian living in the US  and playing here on a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: largely Dutch team. this kind of ecumenical transnationalism is very good for bridge |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Indeed|pg||
nt|hajru:  And then what?  You know that partner cannot have much and even if you set up a 4th heart, how can you cash it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather open 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D looks like an underbid if it isn't forcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid 3NT, and they did in both rooms. Well done|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: wd by both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to have no problem in bidding with marginal hands|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazzili. 2@d = 8+ hcp, 2@s = 5@h + 4@s 18+|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt could be a good hand, though, south might feel obliged to show the support in case they have slam|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt with north, certainly|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: as u understand, I dont agree with him :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Ricardo and Wubbo would u open 1@h or 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 3NT, have to bid.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  if north have A@c im hopeing to get inn on single @c K :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 1nt showing hearts and diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|wboer: 6@c is a beauty, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|athene: another trick is to avoid 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the double I wonder. He knows he will be on lead himself|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wboer: 4NT = NF, kanti|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed yes. with QJ@H falling.|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt - 3nt is a reasonable auction i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is itching to double, but the spectre of -470 is a forbidding vision|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wboer: quantitative|pg||
nt|athene: against diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I would rather be in 3nt than 4@S here, but they should make it either way|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wboer: You have 11 toptricks with @c not 5/1. Enough entries to develop 5th @h or @dA good|pg||
nt|wboer: Well bid again by EW|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oosb: lively auction here|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this @c play is best.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wboer: I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: i play 2@h 10-12 with 6 cards, but here i think is weak.. i don't agree|pg||
nt|ricky86: i would open 1 @h|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have Ax of trumps you have to jump in with the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to get endplayed later|pg||
nt|veistikke:  to cash the last @H :P|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: but i think west should be able to see that is not the issue on this hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: made easy.:)|pg||
nt|athene: not clear to run this because if you lose to west's queen, you just incurred an extra loser and you don't have anything so useful to throw on dummy's clubs|pg||
nt|wboer: The @h lead could be from 5 and he didn't expect N to have 4 @c's |pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: even if he does, it's only an imp :)|pg||
nt|ugis: it is all about getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|ugis: must lead the diam Q from dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: and give N @Hj 10 and not the Q would u still open 1@h|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|athene: but one of the more embarrassing ones to concede|pg||
nt|athene: pitching a red card might be useful but it might not be|pg||
nt|ugis: well OK, must find the trump Q too, but it should not be a problem|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wboer: Oops, no cover and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well W doesnt know that N has only 4 hearts, so the likelihood that N has Jxxx of clubs probably seemed small to him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i duplicated your remark:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: The only complaint I have regarding these youngsters is that they double (lead-directing) way too much. Most of the time it helps the opponents more than partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W would have done better not to double 2C. he is dead minimum for an opener (if that) and his clubs are not all that great  -- and meanwhile  2C is the contract that suits ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Simon was caught off guard for some reason|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosb: Yes but after 1NT dbl, he perhaps expected 2@H to be dbled too?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should perhaps have led a trump, and W should perhaps have switched to diamonds at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but is it so clear that he wants to defend 2HX rather than 2C undoubled?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ugis: apparently I might be wrong again :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but I guess he will still play it from the top|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|sK|pc|d2|pg||

nt|petergill: France won at least one youth World Teams Championship, with East in the team I think, perhaps 3 years ago |pg||

nt|petergill: If so, then another club is best, instead of @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: was best|pg||

nt|wboer: nothing to be ashamed off. Two aces in defense. This is better then a flat 12 hcp|pg||
nt|ricky86: y|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italian top guns hardly ever double, and there is a good reason for it|pg||
nt|athene: i think i have seen one of about eight that was useful for the defence|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, the French picked up 5 on the 4@s -1 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT making by South on 22 - 5 to France|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  our first slam|pg||
nt|pelu: so u open on 9+ - is that on your CC?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better check my lottery numbers|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wboer: I hears this beautifull 6@c will losse 2 imps, because the open room are in 6@h. With bare @hQJ this makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a very strong result for the Dutch|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: There are problem with running score - prob so many try to enter, that the server cant manage|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR board 8 the contract is 6@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For a start, you have to bid 3NT, and then make it if you do|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: does 1@C promise four clubs? rare these days|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wboer: my cc is secret|pg||
nt|kakashi84: no 1@c promise 3 @c|pg||
nt|ugis: 3h?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk5: I would upgrade to 10, so yes, 10-21 is on my CC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another double coming|pg||
nt|kakashi84: I think, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then Poulat has to decide|pg||
nt|athene: west could have bid 3@D but he prefers to wait for his partner's second double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i played with him 4 days straight in the Open at Juan les Pins and he made no such mistakes. this event is far more grueling though:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  safest slam is 6N|pg||
nt|ugis: 2H certainly too pesimistic for me|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would be lebensohl i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is a reasonable punt|pg||
nt|bobholl: at other vulnarabilty he'd have passed i guess 98 are pretty :)|pg||
nt|athene: AK98 a lot nicer than AK87! one trick nicer in fact :)|pg||
nt|athene: guaranteed a double stop|pg||
nt|athene: sorry triple stop|pg||
nt|ugis: 6-4, a terrific 15 points....somewhere between 3 and 4 hearts for me..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though some would say that even a month-long tournament could not be more grueling than 4 sessions with me:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk5: Did you give up on tournament bridge completely, Wubbo? We don't see you any more|pg||
nt|rnmalik: late:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to beat this|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: wd by EW there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: dont be wrong - they can play bridge "down under" :)|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: lead @D :)|pg||
nt|wboer: I play the nice festivals in europe and some leage bridge in Holland Also coach/captain with my wife Agnes of this Dutch juniors|pg||
nt|hajru:  As I'm rooting for the Dutch, 16 flat boards is good for the result|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reasonable lead. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many players would open 2N on the S hand, but that would be ill-advised on a hand that is so well-sculpted for play in a suit|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|wboer: There is a loosing option in 6@h after @dA and @d. Enter dummy with @d ruff to play for @hQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we can see that it can be set, but it is very tough at the table|pg||
nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||
nt|wboer: Light opening and light take out double. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: imo @C lead in that hand would create problems for 6@H.|pg||
nt|hajru:  but I guess the specs don't like it. |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ricky86: shared lead but there isn't a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|wboer: @h lead will beat it. Taking @sA and @h switch will make life diff for decl. He still makes it because the block in @h|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: and now it's too late already|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: north, reasonably enough, excpected much better clubs for 3@C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ricky86: yes, no problems here for NS. they have 6@c 6@h and 6NT :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but on the actual layout, declarer soon will have a big smile|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oosb: Do you think this auction will be duplicated at all 4 tables?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|wboer: Good defense|pg||
nt|oosb: do you bid 1@H as N too?|pg||
nt|ugis: in the open room S going 2 down in 4h dbld|pg||
nt|ugis: so 9 more imps to France|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: south might underlead the hearts i suppose but that still nets only four tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @H ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: When I was a junior boards with only a single-figure swing rated as flat|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wboer: Now easy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: the double may have more going for it than the opening, but i am ok with either (or with pass)|pg||
nt|wboer: He knows W has @dKQ. So he could misguess the @h-suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: but as for identical auctions, maybe someone will open 2N|pg||
nt|oosb: and end in 4@H as well|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: so you might as well plod away at hearts and hope for a miracle|pg||
nt|hajru:  That is so long ago, that I can't remember|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I didn't really want to add that |pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: if south had not raised clubs and it had gone, say, 1nt - 3nt, then north might lead the @HQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: plod away at spades sry|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: I like the D + 3@D by East - in CR E just jump to 3@D - that dont show a running suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: say hi to our operator http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143 !/photo.php?fbid=264131686949677&set=a.264130690283110.81315.263033693726143&type=1&theater|pg||
nt|wboer: Especially when W has the @cQ as well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oosb: via puppet or regular stayman|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to her for the wonderful job she is doing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you reverse the majors in the S hand the double is a bit less attractive. with 4 spades there is a bit of  edge in finding that fit right away to  put yourself in a better ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: position later|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|warrens:  S needs to pitch a @H to avoid an overtrick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: yes, otherwise declarer could cash three rounds of clubs and then play a heart towards dummy|pg||
nt|warrens:  since I'm assuming East will play 3 rounds of clubs.  |pg||
nt|oosb: fair enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|andy_h: Ah yes, that's right|pg||

nt|veistikke:  South can also duck the @H |pg||
nt|hajru:  Rehi, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: on raw loser count, it is a 3H bid, but with 3 aces and only one queen, it is adjusted to a 4H call. unless of course one has alternative ways to show a hand worth 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  got disconnected but it looks as if I didn't miss much.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: After all, game is on a finesse|pg||
nt|athene: what will east rebid after 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 3@s?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  anyone got link to the results?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ricky86: Donati-Percario play a very good bridge for their age. I should mention that Donati is 13 yo and Percario is 16 yo :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East had @CJ instead of the 10, 4@S can be defeated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as it is, 5@C is a correct save|pg||
nt|athene: NS do well to "take the money" here since pressing on to 5@S would lead to a negative score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many french players have various calls available as opener to distinguish different types of raises to 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would go for 2nt i think|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you misdescribe you hand always :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course, agonized pause and self-recrimination for opening in the first place is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|athene: and it looks as though east is going for that :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would open 1N with E hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wboer: What should N bid? Pass is ok imo|pg||
nt|athene: you might not be too happy taking a probable 500 against your vul game, but you don't want to go for "650 or maybe -100" instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in other lands too as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: strange but winning because @dA is wrong. Do they play a strong @c system?|pg||
nt|pelu: they prob play 2@S contructiv and he didnt like to bid 1NF (forsing - semiforcing)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has no choice.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a very pure hand here and imagines short spades with partner so will sac i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: also 5@C takes blackwood away from north|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: because it uses up SO much room|pg||
nt|athene: when the auction gets icky like this, it's a good idea to favour the cheaper bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: but Australia need 19-11 to pass Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If they do, West'|pg||
nt|Walddk5: s hand is worth a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: which might be what he is about to bid|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qtournid=897&qphase=SF&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|ugis: 6clubs on a finesse...down 1 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and possibly reach 4H|pg||
nt|wboer: yes, I can imagine 1NT. But that would mean EW could get to 4@h making.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: ok, surprised|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be getting old - prefer 2@c to 2@d|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt also down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so this could be an opportunity for france, except that in general the french are even more unlikely to open 1N than their opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: W deterred fronm mentioning hearts by the X|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  the other option is 2nt, which is tough on Jxx.  I actually don't like 1@H very much, unless playing a strong club.|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is 2NT but with Jxx i can't like that too :)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec comments that if you can't stomach 2nt, 3@S must be better than 3@H, which seems right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that the vulnerability here has been an inhibiting factor. for example, at favorable colors N (though not a french N) might overcall 1D|pg||
nt|ugis: 4h an interesting contract, 5c = nothing interesting :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 10@C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Pity if partner had @CJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hei and welcome|pg||
nt|hajru:  Hi Dan|pg||
nt|wboer: Buying the contract in 3@c is very good for france. Open room could get to 3@s down on a couple of @h-ruffs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  that is good to know|pg||
nt|wboer: 3NT will make. N won't lead a @c|pg||
nt|ricky86: good contract 4@s but unlucky|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oosb: good contract with the double fit|pg||
nt|ugis: 6h = too much luck needed|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 21-count 3NT - and it looks like it will make |pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the ace, diamond ruff, club to the jack, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  5 clubs and 4 red suit winners.|pg||
nt|ugis: after the diamond lead 6h makes I guess :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: possibly open room could get to 4H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wboer: 3@s will be the contract only if you open 1@s ofcourse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ricky86: they are the future of Italy bridge :)|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hajru:  N will probably run a C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though there is some work to do|pg||
pc|d8|nt|veistikke:  5@c and 5@h and 1 @d :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and EW can't take three spade tricks, unless North misguesses - unlikely|pg||
nt|djneill:  seems like West can only hope that North has at most 5@c, 2@d, and one @h, so continuing diamonds might be best|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be normal. but north is getting 11 if west continues inn @d |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|pelu: no update on running score after 3 boards of this match|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hajru:  That would give him something like xxx/AJxxx/AJx/xx and that is not a 2N rebid|pg||
nt|ugis: DA, Club A and a club = |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: in some situations like this, i think that opener's cue should not be strong|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: it should just say "i have no bid"|pg||
nt|athene: typically a weak notrump with no stop|pg||
pc|d6|nt|djneill:  well North could have the @sK, but cannot establish it|pg||
nt|hajru:  South gives up ;)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wboer: This will be 9 or 11 imp's back to japan|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ugis: but it is double dummy of course :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: the trump play is more or less clearcut , when opps have ten diamonds and never bid|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: let's say for example you open 1@D, 1@S overcall, 2@H from your pd|pg||
nt|veistikke:  now 12|pg||
mc|9|nt|pelu: nice try - but no succes|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: 4@S not so bad here but hard to find with two balanced hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|athene: west will super-accept spades i guess despite nasty 4333|pg||
nt|athene: you have to do something with 17 count and 4 trumps don't you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 17 with 4 is enough|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: EW won't be nearly sure enough that 4@H is making|pg||
nt|athene: even if it gets bid, which is not certain|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H in the other room was showing a good hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|oosb: Ferro and Scanavino stopped in 2NT on board 9, while the other table in the final also played 4@H-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wubbo; 2Nt?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bash the game in|pg||
nt|oosb: is it just me or the 1NT overcall is scary?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wboer: I can take a nap now|pg||
nt|athene: even if you play that 2nt is a scramble in that sort of position, you can still use that as "good bad" in the highest-ranking suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: which is very useful|pg||
nt|hajru:  Gazilli again, 2N showing a strong 5-5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards seem very NS this set, and to be fair NS are doing vey well with them|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and down they will go :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Helmich has a cleardouble now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 hands really ARE that evil|pg||
nt|djneill:  North asks for the 2nd suit, expecting @d...|pg||
nt|wboer: I like that S hand in. Especially in rubber bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Simon may be charged with treason, because the fact that he opened 2C rather than 2D suggests that he has turned his back on the classic French methiods wherein 2D is GF and 2C is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: almost GF. yes, it is true that is classic french standard, which means you should never play rubber brudge against the french becauyse if they developed that system they must be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the best card holders in the galaxy|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: 2NT is limit+ with @s support|pg||
nt|ricky86: construct?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here:)|pg||
nt|athene: because if south had a weak 3@H bid he would bid 2nt scramble and pull whatever his partner bid, to 3@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  but..|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk5: Could be a Fantunes gadget, limit with 3|pg||
nt|athene: so a direct 3@H always shows something|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ricky86: bad choice bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d bit a bit over the top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that nowadays penalty doubles do not exist below 7@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure no @C lead and @S guess will let it make|pg||
nt|athene: yeah you can get two clubs away on the hearts - but why should you play the spades right?|pg||
nt|bobholl: or no @C switch now |pg||
nt|oosb: One probably cant afford to pass but against a passed pd it is scary|pg||
mb|d|nt|wboer: Yes limit with 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 3@S pretty much forces NS into 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything is for take-out. The doubles just have various names, but 'penalty' is not among them|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer doesn't have easy communication, but he can make this if S ducks|pg||
nt|athene: even if south flies the ace, it's not obvious to play a club|pg||
nt|athene: could look very silly a lot of the time |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, but another @D is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer has the ace|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and diamond works ok|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: limit I can for sure see - and only 3 card @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  A of @D and a @H is dangerous for the defense|pg||
nt|wboer: Trump lead will end the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  should South have just bid RKC after 4@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: But that not fair with @hAK in hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS seem not be be in perfect harmony about the meaning of 4S here. if it is fast arrival denying any real values, 5C is doubtful at best|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: yes - an "optional" double these days means "you can pull it to your suit, or to my suit" :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  He is close, I think.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|veistikke:  most people would have :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on this sequence, North does not guarantee four trumps, I imagine - South is 5/5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|veistikke:  but 4@h is a good bid|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ricky86: another hand without story|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|veistikke:  nothing to play now :) 12 :P|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: should get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|athene: he knows west has a lot more diamonds than east|pg||
pc|h7|nt|warrens:  Now, declarer has to pitch 2 @C's and then play a @C to dummy |pg||
pc|hK|nt|hajru:  but doesn't have to make a foreward move on, say, xx/Qxx/Axxx/xxxx? over 3@h|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, no miracles|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: is the @D8 discouraging in diamonds?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: west certainly doesn't want a diamond lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: but the convention work better when opening = 14+|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: he can count declarer for only 4 trumps, 3 clubs and the spade|pg||
nt|athene: so he will have to develop diamonds himself|pg||
nt|athene: yes he needed the club as a scissors coup|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: no need for the defence to get busy in that suit|pg||
nt|athene: to prevent south cashing the @DA and getting a ruff|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  this time only one suit for slam|pg||

nt|ricky86: the problems of these hands is stay awake :)|pg||
nt|pelu: here 2@S ask: do u have a opening hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You would also bid 2@H with one spade more and one diamond less|pg||
nt|wboer: In 6@s S has a natural @cQ lead for 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: not sure about "excellent", but "successful" it certainly is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is too funny for words if it is true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Optimism?|pg||
nt|oosb: straight forward 6@H here, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|oosb: although|pg||
nt|oosb: with KQ@H missing they might not bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i think S should bid it, especially since he has chosen to sue KC|pg||
nt|oosb: Is a 7 card fit though, but could be missing AQ@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: use|pg||
nt|oosb: I meant 9 card fit|pg||
nt|oosb: 7 card suit!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, if he bids 5H here, he is saying he wanted to be in slam only if facing AK|pg||
nt|oosb: I guess it depends to some extent on preempt styles too? vul against not 3@H might be on the heavy side and atlesat have a decent suit?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a way a result like that is a good thing, because there is a chance EW may have slightly reduced focus  if part of their mind is still chasing the massive plus that got away ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: and this West hand is considerably better|pg||
nt|athene: the italians do prefer opening the major on these|pg||
nt|djneill:  think it asks partner to bid your doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't know why they hate 1nt so much|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wboer: exactly. Therefore this 2@s relay|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 6+ suit GF. 3NT = serious slamtry|pg||
nt|kakashi84: it's funny|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have 13 cards, partner, do you have a long suit?|pg||
nt|hajru:  Well, I do play X as @S and a 2nd suit, though I dont think I'd use it on this hand|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe :p my system it show same strenght|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: guess they play 12-16 rebid otherwise i don't understand|pg||
nt|oosb: Well judged in the end|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: they use gazzilli to solve some of the problems after 1M - 1NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, it's a partnership agreement issue|pg||
nt|athene: but those are not problems that you need in the first place :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good auction, though 2D by S would be a more popular choice|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|oosb: 75% or so to pick up trumps?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|warrens:  so,did this sequence show an invitational hand by S?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: many flat bords here in 2. segment - in the other 3 matches max swing is 7 IMP|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this is a good convention. You are good in the slamzone, but you tell much to defenders if you are in the limitzone|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk5: Yes, but I think you need it if you allow 3-card raises|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I do with a 5431 hand for example|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok East has a good idea where all the HCP are, esp since South did not lead a club (so North has a top club and @sQ)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|athene: i am assuming this was a 2-way checkback auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like a reasonable way to overcome the problem|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: go lebatteux!|pg||
nt|bobholl: despite 26 points not so easy :)|pg||
nt|athene: @H10 comes down|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wboer: 4NT = optional Blackwood. So 5@c=min, 5@d = 1/4, 5@h= 0/3, 5@s= 2 no @sQ, 5NT= 2 with @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 8 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 400 is cheap|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes it's good|pg||
nt|athene: ...and laughing at every 50, as we used to say at university|pg||
nt|kakashi84: -9 possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah, he has 2 tricks already, but was indeed possible|pg||
nt|athene: it's still not that huge a gain, but worth a lot psychologically|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: but still - if east leads a spade after the @HK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|warrens:  yes, with the J of @h's not, this should be easy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you are ok|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|athene: the defence might get the red kings and two spades but that is all|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|warrens:  West just didn't have enough to X for a @S lead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: 3 card raise for me only if i dont have a better bid - with Hx in @S and 3 card @H I bid 1NT every time|pg||
mc|8|nt|ricky86: too much defeatist France here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry - he doesn't even need the diamond finesse if he gets a spade|pg||
pg||
