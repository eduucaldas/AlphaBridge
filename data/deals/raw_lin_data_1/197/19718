nt|mdgraham: last segment of this semi-final, and a close match|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  no multi apparently|pg||
nt|kakashi84: DBL is minor 5 and 4 in major|pg||

mb|4S|nt|andyv:  N has a 3@d bid available for lead directional purposes|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The Woolsey convention, also known as Multi-Landy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolsey_(convention)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The modern trend is to open the North hand 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2-2 in the majors and a 6-card minor not unusual nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's fine with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I have also seen it misused|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hop still thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either he passes or doubles, but it should not take that long|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: For what we don't know yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ricky86: welcome to this 2nd session of quarter final|pg||

nt|athene: interesting hand here|pg||

mb|1S|nt|wboer: !|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  this can make 3NT EW|pg||

nt|santyclz: Weak 2 or 5/4+?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C for NS - will EW sac with two aces?|pg||
nt|ugis: now S will bid hearts :)|pg||
nt|ugis: on actual layout NS can make 6d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: of course :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing hearts i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: and that will not delight south|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think i would want to stress the hearts with north|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: is 4@H now a cue bid or re-transfer?|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 5@s-4+ in a minor 5-10hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is practical bridge, I'm all for that|pg||
nt|athene: he has more a balanced hand with scattered strength, than a heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: but i imagine 1nt was not available (probably showed clubs)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  This will probably end in 3N, making |pg||
nt|mdgraham: always depressing to see partner pass as delaer when all you hold is three jacks |pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: raising clubs might work well now|pg||
nt|athene: people rarely do that, though, in this day and age|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  2@d is GF checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: maybe re transfer|pg||
nt|athene: :(|pg||
nt|athene: well north will go 4@C or 4@S now|pg||
nt|athene: *south sorry|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will NOT cover @D10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: chioces would seem to be 2NT or 3@c  |pg||
nt|leao:  hello all from cold, although sunny, SÃ£o Paulo|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: east thinking about a diamond sac?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: 5@h??|pg||
nt|ricky86: 5@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: Good lead. @cK and @s switch is diff for decl|pg||
nt|athene: takes a club lead to beat 6@S i guess?|pg||
nt|wboer: It's a deep view by S not converting 2@h to 2@s or 3@d|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: This is the last round in the Swiss - 8 best to KO - Japan no 7 with 152 and Australia 1 + 2 + France No 8 with 145|pg||
nt|athene: stops declarer cashing one spade then finessing|pg||
nt|athene: because you don't have the entry to dummy when you need it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: If Poulat has one more to play, diamonds are 4-3 and no worries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a duck caters for a 5-2 split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2nT presumably denies three spades, and also four hearts|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome to lovely opatija|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we are having some of the warmest days of the year|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont disagree, but certainly 2H might be the right spot....for example if N has:   x   QJT9xx   xx   Kxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: no comments please.:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: the 5 IMP - in B2 EW stopped in 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess he was playing for e to be 5/5 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|athene: now if it goes 1@S - 1NT from EW, south can't really double, as that is t/o of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@c = min, 5@D = 1/4, 5@H = 0/3, 5@s = 2+@sq + tx Wubbo|pg||
nt|wboer: Ofcourse 2@h could be the right spot, but not likely. |pg||
mb|2N|nt|ricky86: ty :)|pg||
nt|ugis: once again NS can reach 6 diamonds, only that this time it is down 1 after spade ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: but the @dQ holds the trick so east had the @dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT? looks odd|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will pass and Lebatteux can't really bid again|pg||
nt|athene: north can bid 2@D now |pg||
nt|hajru:  I think they play Gazilli (1M-1N-2@c) for strong balanced hands, freeing up 1M-1N-2N for special hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told Gazzilli, strong 5/5....thanks|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess N will bid 3@c and S will specifiy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D or 2NT in S being non-vul or pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wecan see that 2NT is makeable, but there is a risk that declarer goes wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the question is not really "does 2H rate to be the best spot?" but rather "which is more likely to be best: 2H or whichever correction i will choose?" the fact that 2H is less ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to be right than the BETTER choice of corrections  doesnt automatically make pass the wrong bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has an interesting decision over 2H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: N has decisions now|pg||
nt|ugis: will N bid over 3nt? if S bids 3nt :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hajru:  4@c cuebid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would not be good to get to slam here |pg||
pc|s9|nt|MolvaM: Opatija fotos http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
nt|wboer: some partnerships play 2NT as good/bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has to guess which finesse to take, and if he chooses spades, he must guess who has A and Q|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|leao:  hard to find the @c lead here|pg||
nt|leao:  9 tricks now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: i think this is a bit of a sucker double from south in fact|pg||
nt|athene: north clearly has a hand too weak to raise diamonds over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and that is a very weak hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|athene: say, 2 points or so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might well beat 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not a sure thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the straightforward bid, but 2H could also be effective, with the plan of bidding 4D if partner  bids 3N at some point|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|wboer: 2NT in S for the minors was not poss, because west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: your spades are not exactly well-placed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would get the idea of promary diamond support across while emphasizing hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|leao:  but BAM...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  E can create some opportunities by playing the A@s and @s|pg||
nt|kakashi84: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: and east didn't have to bid 2nt|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am impressed if he gets this right|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: here is looks as if 4N was RKC. many top class pairs use a different call than 4N for KC in the minors, because there is insufficient space between 4N and 5 of the trump suit. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: various forms of this method ar e called "kickback" or "redwood" or other labels. it is a very good idea in principle, but it is essential to have firm agreements on which call is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: KC and WHEN that call is KC|pg||
nt|leao:  north had a second chance, and now declarer has 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ugis: they did indeed bid 6d in open room, so France will almost tie the match after board 17|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  on 3rd @s, N will ruff with K@h and finesse for Q|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is a very good example of what s.j. simon talks about in his book|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy 11 tricks - should be flat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has extra offense and extra defense for a 4H bid. should he do something other than 4H to start with(eg 3S)? or should he bid 4H then double later to show extrras (if that is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: their agreement)?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: "why you lose at bridge"|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Wubbo de Boer, world champion 1992|pg||

nt|andyv:  @s vs @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, EW probably will buy it in 3@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: what a pity, declarer did well since 2 of @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My misguesses never gain IMPs. Hop's do|pg||
nt|athene: north refused to raise clubs in the other room as well on board 2 :(|pg||
nt|athene: so they play 6@S rather than 6@C :(|pg||
nt|leao:  they found the @s game in board 2 at the other room, so the riskyplay in the 3NT contract was important|pg||
nt|leao:  another probable @s partial for EW (former NS) here|pg||
nt|leao:  NS may compete in @h, they can make 9 tricks if with proper defence|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ricky86: 5 imps to japan|pg||
nt|athene: actually i am not sure the endplay was so useful anyway because when east cashes the hearts, dummy gets squeezed anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so i think it was just a case of guessing spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt all pass is a possible auction here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: people have to stop ignoring the club suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|leao:  letÂ´s see how hogh this goes|pg||
nt|leao:  hogh=high (and bad typing skills)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: An unfortunate start for Japan.|pg||
nt|wboer: I would overcall 1@h with the N hand|pg||
nt|athene: if EW stagger into 4@S, will south try another double?|pg||
nt|athene: you might, if they have had an invitational sequence where west showed hearts|pg||
nt|athene: because you know the cards lie badly for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when EW bid 4H to make, NS generally shouldnt be allowed to play 4S undoubled|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ugis: NS should somehow get to 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: Here the good/bad again|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N showing 3S via X|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and probably more than minimum vaues, as that is the French style with support doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: another chance for Holland. 3nt will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably PPP now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: quite popular in England for 1@d-(1NT)-2@c to show both majors|pg||
nt|hajru:  Comfortable partial for ns|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, that is played here as well but apparently not by NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this should be ok|pg||
nt|leao:  oops|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: now for sure 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate 4@S less likely to draw a double|pg||
nt|athene: this is one more reason why inviting is a bad idea |pg||

mb|1C|nt|pelu: with 9 toptricks he did risk the contract for an overtrick???|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: yes, but however was a good contract too|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: and not Ws style :)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 3@C is the straightforward call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3-level overcall on AJ9xx is againt my religion|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes 3@c isn't a good bid, but he knows his part can't reopening and he thinks he must bid|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wondering about the likelihood of north having @DJ10?|pg||
nt|ugis: but, once again, it is not so straightforward at he table  |pg||
nt|ugis: well, or is it? 4c - asks for aces?|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h possible|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Five hands in a row for South to declare |pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: disciplined pass by S over 1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: With 1 zillion entries it seems strange that Kido does not lead a club|pg||
nt|wboer: still time to switch for defence|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@c is a big bid for that hand.|pg||
nt|ugis: not familiar with their system, 4c might be natural, sets clubs as trumps...or it might be ace asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: 3NT is high but has play if @d are 3/2|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you can guarantee to keep south off lead, your best chance of a double stop in diamonds is to rise the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to cut down on ruffs against the likely 44 fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can scare declarer with spade queen lead:)|pg||
nt|wboer: Not a hand that will be published. prob @c lead, @hT ducked to E and 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and this one is comfortable as well|pg||
nt|leao:  board 4 achieved the same result in the other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ricky86: a good choice 3nt when you have few points and two balanced hand|pg||

nt|leao:  singleton @d lead not a success|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk5: This defence beats me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S will start with 2 top Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W shd cover heart ten if S leads it|pg||
nt|wboer: or @h4, @h5 @h6 to E|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|wboer: no he will make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ugis: looks as though 4c was natural, followed by a couple of cue bids|pg||
nt|ugis: 4nt ace asking in clubs|pg||
nt|ugis: 5c=4aces|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ugis: but may be I am completely wrong :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ugis: in any case, they managed to reach the top spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow great predicition|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|leao:  with Dxx its hard to see why W wants a ruff... maybe we wanted 2 ruffs?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: I dont understand N - passiv defense cant help him. He can gice decl 2 @C-tricks and still defeat 3NT - blind spot|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs to take the @s finesse quickly...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared that Hop had clubs stopped|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: in the other room declarer got a heart lead, played a diamond to the queen himself, and then ran the clubs, and the defenders threw enough things that he felt confident about ...|pg||
nt|athene: trying a small spade for some overtricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a riveting deal, but even juniors have some quiet boards|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong - @C would defeat|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s2|pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: missed that chance. |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ricky86: S didn't guess the 2@c a friendly play :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's play of A@c was predicated on the need for him to run 9 tricks immediately|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: now West will win on a endplay|pg||
nt|wboer: That is good play. With this @s break he can make it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ruffing declarer's loser with a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S had no good choices there.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wboer: W had the @h9 so he should cover|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wboer: If S played a @s (best) then N still could be endplayed in @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's so easy for us when we can see that there was no danger in this contract|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 (std) bit costly sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: upside down carding is just better|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 10x playing std you are better off just not giving count, most of the time; even high from 9x can be costly quite often|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  he hoped to pick up the @s suit, + 3 @d and A@c for his game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should cover heart ten because if S has AJT he is virtually certain to make 3N|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  why E refuses to continue on the @h suit is an entire mystery that only he can answer|pg||
nt|ricky86: surely not a good def here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ricky86: friendly def here, but well played by declarer|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: @SK the 7. trick - could S have signal better?|pg||
nt|athene: with the cards as they are here, you duck in diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Only chance for North is to unblock @HK when the ace is cashed; no luck there|pg||

nt|hajru:  I think we'll see another declarer than s on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this hand can actually make 6@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good time to get a cuppa, brb|pg||
nt|athene: called "tempo or elopement dilemma" in "adventures in card play"|pg||
nt|ugis: bidding and making a grand allways puts extra pressure on opponents, even when there are 16 tricks available :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H? 4H? |pg||
nt|wboer: What you open with S? 1@h, weak 2 or 3@h?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|pelu: no comment - I try to be nice :)|pg||
nt|ricky86: lol|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ugis: lets see how the rumanians handle it|pg||
nt|wboer: I go for 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: @HJ the problem - in Cr S tryed @h9 but also @S here - only @h2/3 will give the message to N|pg||
nt|andyv:  you need to pick up the @s suit...only play that will do that is the J@s lead from S hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: i don't think 3@D can achieve so much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree, but if you need a swing 4H is fine too|pg||
nt|leao:  EW can make 4@h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: might just get partner off to the wrong lead against hearts|pg||
nt|athene: north might double this for takeout|pg||
nt|leao:  this wont make too many tricks :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: 3@S now - as in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his side has slightly more than half the deck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D might be short, so maybe West cannot raise to 2@D (could be inverted) |pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: if partner has a heart stack there could be a number on offer|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s probably shows 4@s|pg||
nt|ricky86: shows 4 @s and a maximum hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same lead in OR.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this where it's overwhelmingly likely that the opponents are going to play it, your bids should probably be mostly lead-directing|pg||
nt|athene: mostly you expect pd to pull it but that will hopefully be ok|pg||
nt|ugis: most probably 4h on NS here|pg||
nt|leao:  thinking pard has something in @h|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: ok, he feels that south bidding spades or diamonds is too likely, and too likely to be wrong|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: perfect EW distribution, but with only 8 HCP difficult for W to invite for slam|pg||
nt|wboer: Sure 4@h is a nice swinging bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i had assumed NS play 2/1, in which case 2D is quite a stretch, but N may be looking for a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  1@d as 3+ in standard French style?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: for me S sh pass over 3@s x - 4@D for extra values and no @S-stop|pg||
nt|athene: it seems declarer has the rest here but he can't do it easily with 3-0 trumps|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: I play a gadget when 3@S is doubled. Redouble two or three small|pg||
nt|wboer: i think he wanted to make clear that he had a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Mancoff convention|pg||
nt|ricky86: 1 imps to ned for sure here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and likely same result.|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a very unattractive hand to lead from|pg||
nt|leao:  shud go -2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: and too likely to just exchange a small positive for a small negative|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: NS could have gotten a much needed swing in here if N had not gotten "cold feet"|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|wboer: He had the feeling they were getting to high if he bids 3@h. Right he was, because that is F|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like 420 to me|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|Walddk5: Playing Mancoff, 4@D would show a singleton spade|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: hello & welcome:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ricky86: 4@s very preservative|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Anyway, they reached top spot|pg||
nt|leao:  well done|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: anyway even if one is right on one particular board, the practice of not respecting game forces (if 2D was one, and if not then 2D followed by 2N surely was?) is a longterm recipe ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for disaster|pg||
nt|wboer: Guessing @h's is not obvious|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: West could try 4@C - sh be singleton after the D in N|pg||

nt|marlowepi: approach is that W has too much strength, so E will not be contributing much in high cards. it may be the best strategy to lead a club, planning toi lead another when declarer ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leads a spade, and then maybe W will get a club ruff later|pg||

nt|athene: but he can't be that strong after only 2@D |pg||

pc|d5|nt|andyv:  W needs to preserve the K@h in dummy.  He should tackle the @s suit now|pg||
nt|athene: NS in the other room gave their opponents some chances to swing the axe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am impressed with the standard I must say. Excellent players, bright future|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it was hard|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: not sure 2@H over 2@D in the other room was a very good bid|pg||

nt|warrens:  hi all|pg||

pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||

nt|marlowepi: that can go down a lot|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wboer: In this case you are so right (a en b). In some cases you bid the lead that beats 3NT from opp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is true. but if that is the benefit, we only get to count it when: a) we wouldnt have been on lead ourselves    and/or    b) we wouldnt have gotten to overcall our suit if we ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: passed|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ricky86: Percario doesn't have many choice to do in this hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|athene: leading a big heart there so his partner is not tempted to play him for a singleton club, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: hop might lay down the @CK anyway for want of anything better to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are working hard to get many and good junior players all over the world. In Europe, the Netherlands, Poland and France are the strongest youth nations (then add Israel, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: playing in European events). No, I don't want to discuss politics, just stating a fact|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|leao:  ohhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: yes, and it would have allowed north to lead a LOW spade against 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and so avoid making the @S98xxx into a stopper|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but certainly the method has SOME successes, or even the most stubborn wouldnt play it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if north had been able to show the 5-5 (ghestem, say) then EW might have ended up defending|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, it's possible e-w will be in 3nt at the other table. they do have a @S stopper, but the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess if anyone is playing ghestem this match it will be france :)|pg||
nt|athene: in open events, we assume a break like this is a smoke break :)|pg||
nt|athene: but not in junior events, haha|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|wboer: Made easely after trick 2. @c by S in trick 4 would save a trick. Now 130|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Israel for example, around 1,000 kids are taught bridge in schools every year. Excellent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wish that would be the case everywhere|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sJ|pc|c8|pc|s9|pg||

nt|oosb: yes, A@D lead and defence can get 2 ruffs + 2 more @c|pg||
nt|wboer: They went for the beer after this board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i expect to see a glossy picture of that deal on the next promotional brochure for Muyderberg|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final, ARG URU are 3 up against NED RUM|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a good 4@h contract the EW may not get to|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, it is hard to see how to defeat this without getting a number of H tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Let's make a prediction - small swing to France on the 4@S-1 hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: down 400 when opps were going to go down 200 in 3N:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I wonder if 2@s is a one round force|pg||
nt|ricky86: maybe they can get if NS bid @ds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Absolutely one sided match so far.|pg||
nt|oosb: but without the dbl -400 actually gains against 650!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marginal opening bid by W, the French establishment might frown on it so perhaps not opened in the other room?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wboer: @d ruff will beat !3s on a ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  You're not looking at the other table, are you?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Since North jumped inn 3!n i would have played AKQ. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: 3@s is delicate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good spot reached by France in the other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, just this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@C/5@D will cost 300 against 4 major, but with all green u normal not go for this save - but sometimes u can push opp to 5-level!!|pg||
nt|pelu: both Ns broke Rolands rule No 1 : no weak to with 2 Aces :)|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows a balanced hand south may go for the nine-trick game|pg||

nt|oosb: not even marginal for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you may have a career awaiting you in France:)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: most of the players at this table are unknown to me, but i know E fairly well --  one of USA's most promising juniors, Marius is a Romanian living in the US  and playing here on a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: largely Dutch team. this kind of ecumenical transnationalism is very good for bridge |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Indeed|pg||
nt|hajru:  And then what?  You know that partner cannot have much and even if you set up a 4th heart, how can you cash it?|pg||
nt|leao:  or @h and minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather open 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D looks like an underbid if it isn't forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid 3NT, and they did in both rooms. Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to have no problem in bidding with marginal hands|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazzili. 2@d = 8+ hcp, 2@s = 5@h + 4@s 18+|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt could be a good hand, though, south might feel obliged to show the support in case they have slam|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt with north, certainly|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: as u understand, I dont agree with him :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Ricardo and Wubbo would u open 1@h or 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 3NT, have to bid.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  if north have A@c im hopeing to get inn on single @c K :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 1nt showing hearts and diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: 6@c is a beauty, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|athene: another trick is to avoid 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the double I wonder. He knows he will be on lead himself|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wboer: 4NT = NF, kanti|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed yes. with QJ@H falling.|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt - 3nt is a reasonable auction i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is itching to double, but the spectre of -470 is a forbidding vision|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wboer: quantitative|pg||
nt|athene: against diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I would rather be in 3nt than 4@S here, but they should make it either way|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|leao:  this can make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wboer: You have 11 toptricks with @c not 5/1. Enough entries to develop 5th @h or @dA good|pg||
nt|wboer: Well bid again by EW|pg||
pc|d8|nt|oosb: lively auction here|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this @c play is best.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wboer: I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: i play 2@h 10-12 with 6 cards, but here i think is weak.. i don't agree|pg||
nt|ricky86: i would open 1 @h|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have Ax of trumps you have to jump in with the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to get endplayed later|pg||
nt|veistikke:  to cash the last @H :P|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: but i think west should be able to see that is not the issue on this hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: made easy.:)|pg||
nt|athene: not clear to run this because if you lose to west's queen, you just incurred an extra loser and you don't have anything so useful to throw on dummy's clubs|pg||
nt|wboer: The @h lead could be from 5 and he didn't expect N to have 4 @c's |pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: even if he does, it's only an imp :)|pg||
nt|ugis: it is all about getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|ugis: must lead the diam Q from dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: and give N @Hj 10 and not the Q would u still open 1@h|pg||
nt|leao:  well...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|athene: but one of the more embarrassing ones to concede|pg||
nt|athene: pitching a red card might be useful but it might not be|pg||
nt|ugis: well OK, must find the trump Q too, but it should not be a problem|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wboer: Oops, no cover and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well W doesnt know that N has only 4 hearts, so the likelihood that N has Jxxx of clubs probably seemed small to him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i duplicated your remark:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: The only complaint I have regarding these youngsters is that they double (lead-directing) way too much. Most of the time it helps the opponents more than partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W would have done better not to double 2C. he is dead minimum for an opener (if that) and his clubs are not all that great  -- and meanwhile  2C is the contract that suits ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Simon was caught off guard for some reason|pg||
nt|leao:  not anymore|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oosb: Yes but after 1NT dbl, he perhaps expected 2@H to be dbled too?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should perhaps have led a trump, and W should perhaps have switched to diamonds at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but is it so clear that he wants to defend 2HX rather than 2C undoubled?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ugis: apparently I might be wrong again :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but I guess he will still play it from the top|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|s4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: yes, we have seen lots of lead doubles in the last few days|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sT|nt|oosb: that's a good question :)|pg||
nt|ugis: the more you think in those situations, the more likely it is that you will go for the percentage play|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ugis: I mean if you "feel" that the Q is with E, you do not think, you finesse in tempo :)|pg||
nt|ugis: after two non-vulnerable game swings we see France 1 IMPahead|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's a close call, since it's likely the @C 5 is from the queen|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ricky86: a litttle bit aggressive but Donati was right here. @h lead maybe would create a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: E led clubs in response to the double of 2C, but that means EW have the side suits locked up, so a trump is attractive  --  E would surely be ruffing clubs with natural trump ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricks. the  danger in a trumop klead is slight. NS are surely in a 52 fit, and even if NS do have AKJ the trick will probably come back|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosb: good point|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ricky86: well played|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: E undoubtedly felt, however, that S was unikely to have a ruffing value -- the 2C call could have been on 3235 shape. even so, the run from 1NX seems more likely to have been based ...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|pelu: There are problem with running score - prob so many try to enter, that the server cant manage|pg||

nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: does 1@C promise four clubs? rare these days|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wboer: my cc is secret|pg||
nt|kakashi84: no 1@c promise 3 @c|pg||

nt|kakashi84: I think, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then Poulat has to decide|pg||
nt|athene: west could have bid 3@D but he prefers to wait for his partner's second double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i played with him 4 days straight in the Open at Juan les Pins and he made no such mistakes. this event is far more grueling though:)|pg||
nt|leao:  so looks like 2@h is flannery|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Barbara|pg||
nt|leao:  hello Barbara|pg||
nt|barbyh: hello ,Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
mb|3C|nt|barbyh: hi Leao|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|andyv:  safest slam is 6N|pg||
nt|ugis: 2H certainly too pesimistic for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would be lebensohl i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is a reasonable punt|pg||
nt|bobholl: at other vulnarabilty he'd have passed i guess 98 are pretty :)|pg||
nt|athene: AK98 a lot nicer than AK87! one trick nicer in fact :)|pg||
nt|athene: guaranteed a double stop|pg||
nt|athene: sorry triple stop|pg||
nt|ugis: 6-4, a terrific 15 points....somewhere between 3 and 4 hearts for me..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though some would say that even a month-long tournament could not be more grueling than 4 sessions with me:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Did you give up on tournament bridge completely, Wubbo? We don't see you any more|pg||
nt|rnmalik: late:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to beat this|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by EW there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: dont be wrong - they can play bridge "down under" :)|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: lead @D :)|pg||
nt|wboer: I play the nice festivals in europe and some leage bridge in Holland Also coach/captain with my wife Agnes of this Dutch juniors|pg||
nt|hajru:  As I'm rooting for the Dutch, 16 flat boards is good for the result|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reasonable lead. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many players would open 2N on the S hand, but that would be ill-advised on a hand that is so well-sculpted for play in a suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|wboer: There is a loosing option in 6@h after @dA and @d. Enter dummy with @d ruff to play for @hQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we can see that it can be set, but it is very tough at the table|pg||
nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||
nt|wboer: Light opening and light take out double. |pg||
nt|leao:  that will not be a success|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so maybe switch to Israel closed room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: imo @C lead in that hand would create problems for 6@H.|pg||
nt|hajru:  but I guess the specs don't like it. |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ricky86: shared lead but there isn't a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|wboer: @h lead will beat it. Taking @sA and @h switch will make life diff for decl. He still makes it because the block in @h|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and now it's too late already|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: north, reasonably enough, excpected much better clubs for 3@C|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ricky86: yes, no problems here for NS. they have 6@c 6@h and 6NT :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but on the actual layout, declarer soon will have a big smile|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosb: Do you think this auction will be duplicated at all 4 tables?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wboer: Good defense|pg||
nt|oosb: do you bid 1@H as N too?|pg||
nt|ugis: in the open room S going 2 down in 4h dbld|pg||
nt|ugis: so 9 more imps to France|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: south might underlead the hearts i suppose but that still nets only four tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @H ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: When I was a junior boards with only a single-figure swing rated as flat|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wboer: Now easy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c7|pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: the double may have more going for it than the opening, but i am ok with either (or with pass)|pg||
nt|wboer: He knows W has @dKQ. So he could misguess the @h-suit|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but as for identical auctions, maybe someone will open 2N|pg||
nt|oosb: and end in 4@H as well|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|athene: so you might as well plod away at hearts and hope for a miracle|pg||
nt|hajru:  That is so long ago, that I can't remember|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I didn't really want to add that |pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if south had not raised clubs and it had gone, say, 1nt - 3nt, then north might lead the @HQ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: plod away at spades sry|pg||
