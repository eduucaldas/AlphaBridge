pc|d7|nt|granguru:  xx showed maximum so Sabine passed..a risky decision|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: NS probably don't even need the double for a top|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, mostly well placed, has 6 tricks & defense forced to give him 7th|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|granguru:  if S covers|pg||
nt|granguru:  usualy change of suit gives 1/2 away |pg||
nt|athene: if the @HA gets taken out declarer might have concerns with the diamond blockage|pg||
nt|chrisky: @D are blocked.|pg||
nt|mathat: now the @d is block play A and x @d|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|psyck: if @h continued, will likely take @d fin|pg||
nt|athene: the best shot to ensure 4 diamonds safely and yet retain best chances for five is to finesse right away|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||

mc|7|nt|psyck: so made now|pg||
nt|granguru:  any return|pg||
nt|athene: west might have considered doubling 1nt, t/o of diamonds|pg||

nt|chrisky: 4@S for e/w|pg||

nt|mathat: now 4 only|pg||
nt|athene: so didn't think it was worth while|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this gives them time to attack clubs|pg||
nt|athene: no point losing a tempo to draw the boss trump|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|athene: Sabine is a fine player, she was not going to throw her @SK away, so she will make it at some point anyway|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|c9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: even if sabine ducked again, east then plays a fourth heart so her partner can ruff away the queen|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no pitch for the club|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|c7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|athene: when trumps break badly, that's annoying - but when the singleton trump gets a ruff, it's an outrage!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|cJ|nt|athene: double squeeze now, indeed|pg||

nt|mathat: squeese is beter|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d9|pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: @D8 grows tall and strong|pg||
nt|psyck: if they were a lil younger it would be the 7 & not the 8 scoring the last trick|pg||
nt|athene: Sabine should of course have unblocked the 8 under the king, yes|pg||
nt|athene: but then the correct defence would be for west to throw the club|pg||
nt|athene: and let her score the @C4 rather than get a beer|pg||
nt|athene: (if any spectators are wondering what we are babbling about, there is a sub-culture around the "beer card", the @D7 - if you win the last trick with it, partner has to buy you a ...|pg||
nt|athene: beer)|pg||
nt|athene: most play that you have to make the contract (or defeat it if you are defending)|pg||
nt|athene: and diamonds can't be trumps|pg||

nt|chrisky: @D|pg||
nt|mathat: 5 @d dificl to go|pg||
nt|granguru:  and might even win a beer|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|an|!|nt|granguru:  or 2 if it gets doubled!|pg||
nt|athene: some would open gambling 3nt with south|pg||
nt|athene: then north has an easy 5@D bid|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 7@D is in dummy.....:)|pg||
nt|psyck: no beer in @d contract, but maybe i should stop about swans & colognes & beers & try to get back to bridge|pg||
nt|athene: but gambling 3nt not that popular amongst top players these days|pg||
nt|athene: because it wrongsides 3nt about as badly as 3nt can be wrongsided|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|athene: and with the HCP requirements for 1-bids coming down all the time, most are happy to open 1 on AKQ seventh and nothing|pg||
nt|mcphee: the solution is to play 3@S as your gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if you play transfer pre-empts of some sort you can play 3@S as your solid minor|pg||
nt|mcphee: but that treatment may not be allowed in all events|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: Meckstroth and Rodwell used to do that back in their transfer pre-empt days|pg||
nt|granguru:  well 4@h is also a chance to win a beer|pg||
nt|granguru:  in the moysean fit|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mcphee: somehow John I doubt they will consider that spot:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  me either|pg||
nt|chrisky: well done for ns|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told NS are actually playing 3@S opener to show a solid minor - well it is most peculiar that he didn't use it, then|pg||

pc|d8|nt|athene: win, ruff spade high, draw trumps, 100%|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|athene: i suppose you might run some trumps and hope they forget to win their @HA|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mcphee: so long @S fit for ever|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i have been suggesting on lots of previous boards that people could have stuck in t/o doubles early in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: here we see that zia indeed wants to get in there with 44 in the unbid suits|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|granguru:  ooops we are in the moysean one|pg||
nt|mcphee: fortunate Sabine is able to control 3rd round of @D|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: if EW can make 3@D+1 they have to beat this by three|pg||
nt|athene: they are never doing that|pg||
nt|athene: just one down|pg||
nt|mcphee: they might not beat it|pg||
nt|athene: that's no good even against 2@D tick|pg||
nt|granguru:  Moysean are good when short trump suit has the singleton, not the long one|pg||
nt|athene: that's why you have to bid at love all at pairs|pg||
nt|athene: don't look at your hand, just bid something|pg||
nt|granguru:  :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: this is going to play rather well|pg||
nt|athene: some people will pass 1@D|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: then south will double and NS will get into spades|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcphee: this @C shift was most welcome|pg||
nt|granguru:  defense is helping in @H.with @H10 and @HJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|athene: it's worth noticing not only the very aggressive double but also the free 2@H on three|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: Sabine knows it's love all at pairs as well|pg||
nt|granguru:  but even now @H9 and @HQ ia doesnt get  to establish the @H7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: i remember a hand in a book on helgemo where he bid TWO three-card suits in this sort of situation|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like +110|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|athene: he ended up in a 3-3 fit doubled and made it |pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|athene: apart from the simple mathematics of the scoring, which favours declaring at love all, there is another issue|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d7|nt|granguru:  remember the book because he published a hand we (Chile) played agaisnt him in 1993 BB|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: which is that it's very hard to defend low level contracts|pg||

nt|athene: ok|pg||

nt|athene: i have to say i am a bit surprised so few people play transfer pre-empts|pg||
