mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Yes, 4@H can be defeated|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ady: e/w  may get to 4@H    in danger of going down on a club lead|pg||
nt|jtr: although 4@h might make|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jtr: Likely 3@h raised to 4 now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is not such an easy contract to play, though|pg||
nt|jtr: Can be made on a @d lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It will get @CK lead of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am talking about 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure they will play 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|jtr: Now it can be made|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: this should make   as the spades lay with the long trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure I would lead my singleton with Qxxx in hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: @c switch makes it more interesting|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Can't afford to duck this|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: he wont|pg||
nt|jtr: Not clear what to do|pg||
nt|ady: lucky lay if drawing just 2 trumps after A@C  coming back to K@S    then run the spades|pg||
nt|jtr: We can see that the @sJ drops with only 2@hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also the risk that he will finesse spades|pg||
nt|jtr: Still, that gives an overtrick in fact|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which could be right|pg||
nt|ady: would not matter if J@S did not drop  as long as 3 rounds stood up|pg||
nt|jtr: I thought about that but it cant be right|pg||
nt|jtr: He probably isnt sure about the @d single|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must be pretty sure that the diamond was a singleton|pg||
