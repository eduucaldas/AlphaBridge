pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|athene: interesting view to leave 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with three spades AND Jx|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: maybe @DQ missed a chance ther e - if you played low, west might cash @CK then underlead diamond hoping for @DQ with pd as entry|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately, no entry for trump finesse|pg||
nt|athene: quite common with 4333 but not with that hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: he has nine tricks so just exits a diamond trying to tighten up the position for a squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe hoping someone will lead something nice :)|pg||
nt|psyck: not clear @d's should be 44|pg||
nt|athene: no, but 5-3 are ok too|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|pc|dK|nt|athene: he still isn't going down|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|psyck: this kills dummy|pg||
nt|blewah: reasonable contract for EW but probably only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|nt|athene: drop the @HK there for entry to finesse trumps then run hearts, but of course, he doesn't want to alert them to the club weakness (he thinks)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: now it is beginning to look a  bit as though he is in 4@S :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c4|nt|athene: or maybe he thinks he is :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would not be unreasonable for West to bid 3NT over 2@S and it would have worked well here if North leads a spade. Not so well if a heart is led because you can't take your nine ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: top tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|granguru:  gia sou |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: In theory you have 9 tops, but you can't cash them all|pg||
nt|granguru:  Bridge Encyclopedia (p448) AKQxx vs xx 52% from top AKQ10 xxx also 2% better from top than a third round finess. if you have the nine it increases to 54%|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: we had only two boards in this round because of the mistake in the change of the couples|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would be a bit of a gamble - not sure AK109xx counts as a solid suit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course AKQ10x / xx you play from the top, but that is because Jx dropping is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't MP a gamble for a start?|pg||
nt|athene: but AKxxx / Q10 is not at all the same thing|pg||
nt|athene: because if you play from the top you have to crush your own ten|pg||
nt|athene: so Jx dropping does not help you|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think a D after 3@S is ok from w|pg||
nt|granguru:  the 9 makes a difference right|pg||
nt|athene: well dummy did have the 8 on the last trick|pg||
nt|athene: on the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but not sure that changes things enough|pg||
nt|athene: my book only had AKxxx / Q10  or  AK9xx / Q10, didn't mention the 8|pg||
nt|granguru:  a little because of J9 fallling is a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 5 minutes to the next round|pg||
nt|athene: that south hand would be too weak for 2@S for many pairs; depends on methods of course|pg||
nt|psyck: it is the same w/o the 8 Bill|pg||
nt|psyck: 8 does not change the line of the %|pg||
nt|psyck: *or the|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As for AKQ10xx   xxx, a priori, a 4-2 break is more common than 3-3 (48-35%), but odds change when the jack does not fall whan you cash A and K. Then you can eliminate the 4-2 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: breaks with Jx in either hand, and a play for the drop on the thrird round is slightly better than a finesse of the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AKQ10x     xx        I mean|pg||
nt|granguru:  Y Roland but they are right in the sense that being the 10 in the short hand it help less to run the suit without loss|pg||
nt|chrisky: how can you finesse on the third round?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AKJxx     xxxx        go for the drop or finesse?  3-1 break more likely than 2-2 (50-40). Still, odds change when the queen does not drop when you cash one top honour|pg||

nt|athene: west would surely open in third seat with @DAKxxx and a side king|pg||
nt|athene: but the issue was whether clubs were breaking|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  4+ cards transfer is another|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|granguru:  fantoni Delle Cave are using the principle of the Fast arrival here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: that is probably it|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|granguru:  fantoni-nunes system doesnt promess absolutely 5 cards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|granguru:  get as much IMPS early in the match so you can rely on them and play easily the rest of the hands :) |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|granguru:  Martens had a better @C than @s but gave preference to the major suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  was the price for bidding 3@s too steep for W?|pg||
nt|athene: i think most would bid 3@S over 3@C here with west yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  the loss was shared by both pairs |pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul seems pretty automatic|pg||
nt|athene: west is only worth 2@S if south had passed but you should usually be prepared to go up a level in competition to show a fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  the main loss was for staying in 2NT instead of 3@D in the other table|pg||
nt|athene: interesting here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|athene: declarer may refuse the club finesse on the grounds of trying to avoid a heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: only to find that refusing the club finesse is the play that incurs the ruff :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  my bet is he will get it right|pg||
nt|granguru:  it is very painful when this occurs|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: of course if east does get a heart ruff, the @HK is still there anyway for a diamond pitch|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|athene: well, that makes life easier|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, not much of a fight there|pg||
nt|eleni: this makes things easy|pg||
nt|granguru:  specially when at the other side they play the simple finesse...|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|granguru:  Fantoni maximized his chances atttacking with the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: no point covering unless you can promote something for your side|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|athene: duck the @HQ was a possible play|pg||
nt|psyck: more risk of throwing @c tricks than @s tricks if pd has nothing in the suit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: north might then do something friendly|pg||
nt|athene: how many clubs does east think his partner has? @C10xx?|pg||
nt|andyv:  seeing Q in dummy, there really can be no reason to cover J unless E thinks N overcalled on Jxxxx of @cs and play pd fof 10x|pg||
nt|granguru:  @c2 would not have been covered for sure.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni may or may not have been intending to finesse clubs but it doesn't cost to lead the jack|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s9|nt|athene: trying to persuade someone to cover|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  so now should make 4|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|granguru:  even if E does not cover N might decide according to the timing spent if it was best to finesse or go up|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: well, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: in my experience people always pause there with three small|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of 3@s bid by W may have led Fantoni astray in the @c suit|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: very surprising that south didn't raise clubs in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: even 3@C is a bit of an underbid maybe|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|mcphee: now the discard hurts|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|athene: now duck the next diamond|pg||
nt|athene: and west never makes a club trick|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should lead the @DJ here NOT the queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: the point is, declarer would never duck with KQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: Ithink Q perfect|pg||
nt|athene: so if you lead the jack partner knows you have another and can duck easily|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess she will duck anyway |pg||
nt|granguru:  oh oh|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 duck too many |pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't believe that really happened|pg||
nt|mcphee: odd not to win K@D|pg||

pc|c4|nt|athene: when weak two bids were first used, people thought the single raise should be pre-emptive with 3-card support and a weakish hand  - but these days many people realise if you ...|pg||
nt|athene: actually bid it on that, and opps KNOW you have that, you are basically saying "bid something opps, it is guaranteed to be right"|pg||

nt|psyck: good try, unfortunately will cost a trick|pg||

nt|athene: here martens knows that if west has a "normal" 3@S raise, his partner is guaranteed to be short in spades with some useful cards, so double is a lot easier|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  only with both majors they may bid a 1 opening with a "weak" hand, say 11-13|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|granguru:  sorry forgot |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north decides to maintain a diplomatic silence rather than tell everyone about the distribution|pg||
nt|athene: passed partner, no suit quality - he doesn't think he is winning this auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N is going down|pg||
nt|granguru:  by Law limit I try to say that in competitive auctions with 8 cards you should compete up to 8 tricks(2-level) with 9 cards uptothe 3-level, etc.  |pg||
nt|granguru:  a mini moysean fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  now 1NT showing nat 1NT opening|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: only 8 tricks on @h lead with opps having 6 before you can enjoy them|pg||
nt|athene: the problem here is the lack of aces on the side|pg||
nt|granguru:  if you open with 5 cards probabilities are that you find 2.66 suport cards in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: when you are in 3nt based on a long suit, you really want "hard" side tricks|pg||
nt|athene: one ace is more use than KQJ10|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have their suit all dressed up and ready to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: the good thing about aces, is they prevent the opps from having a quick entry to the suit the establish|pg||
nt|athene: well the good thing is they are a trick which you don't need to lose the lead to establish|pg||
nt|athene: EW have @DKQJ and @SKQ and they are no use at all|pg||
nt|athene: so even if declarer had an entry to run the clubs he would still only have 8 tricks|pg||
nt|blewah: upgrade?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blewah: or do they play 12-14 nt?|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|athene: yes you can see there can never be any need for count in clubs|pg||

pc|sK|pc|c2|pg||

nt|athene: well, i don't know what that means|pg||
nt|athene: but it certainly wasn't either big or small|pg||
nt|athene: so it looks a bit of a "torture partner" card whatever their methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  the good thing of these contracts that the defense doesnt know the true normally till it is too late|pg||
nt|granguru:  @C10 play was wrong but confused the defense also|pg||
