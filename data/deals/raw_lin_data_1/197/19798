nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|kjadams: Since west is the danger hand for a heart shift, a spade finesse taken first would be safer than the club.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kjadams: but with no heart shift, all was well.|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||
