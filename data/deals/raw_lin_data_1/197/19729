nt|athene: but east had denied any heart fit at all|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should just lead a safer diamond|pg||
nt|athene: some play that in these cramped auctions with clubs agreed, 4nt is "regressive" and 5@C just says "I have a decent hand"|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 4@H looks like the go here with a bonud for picking the @HQ|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidstern: Neither EW have anything to disturb the opponents from getting there|pg||
nt|athene: i can't see any other explantion for 4nt, unless was unusual|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i.e. offering 5@C or 5@D|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|bobholl: @H against @S as soo often abd @S will gain i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: and|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe he thought 4S was kickback|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: tricky problem now for north|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you scramble  with 2@H and hope to come out alive|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might pass this|pg||
nt|athene: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: south might pass this|pg||
nt|athene: seeing "wackwitz E" is confusing :) he isn't east!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C probably an artificial GF, perhaps in a framework where 2D shows five|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|davidstern: I am "guessing" that 3@C showed normal opening and 3@D showed shortage|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6H makeable without low club lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would take an inspired guess on that lead...or to make that lead:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you are going to bid on, i prefer something other than 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south's problem is that anything sounds constructive|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2nt or 3@C sound MORE constructive|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: 2@S possible i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at BAM of course one does not strain to bid slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or even try for one if there is a danger of risking the plus|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: in BAM missing a game is not that bad but i guess they will loose at this one|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: difficult hand to play|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide whether to go for club pitches immediately on the @SK and @DQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: always hard when your best fit is in the fourth suit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: very brave switch :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|davidstern: Making six in another match (as shown on screen) seems like a very good score for somebody|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: iu think u take yr two pitches and play hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|davidstern: Got a club lead and picked hearts throwing the losing spade on the 13th club  - voila easy game|pg||
nt|davidstern: As noted West opened the bidding (certainly not my taste) leading declarer to take the finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: In fact it would take some serious threat to make me open the West hand even as a youth player|pg||
nt|davidstern: And I guess the result is a good indication of why it isnt such a good idea|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: referee at the table, the player had said the gap with spades, then changed the club|pg||

nt|bobholl: but is only 1 point (BAM)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I should point out that the tables are not linked despite there showing a result from the other room. The Other room in this case are not team mates|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: there was a case for east ducking the spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i kind of prefer trying to cash the 3rd diamond for another club discard. it has more winning outcomes than losing ones|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: not clearcut but these tricks often come back|pg||
nt|davidstern: Thanks to our host I am informed: TD and a referee is the same in English, because there is only one word for both in Italian|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: do we know if 2@H promises specifically black suits? or could it be spades and diamonds as well?|pg||
nt|athene: unless 4@H is very narrowly defined it doesn't really help EW|pg||
nt|athene: the point is, you know south is going to bid 4@S over it, every hand|pg||
nt|athene: so|pg||
mb|5D|nt|davidstern: I am not a big fam of the 3NT rather than a simple 2@C bid unless their system doesnt allow it. |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if it might be very weak, west just has to pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S clearly intermediate, in light of the 4H call|pg||
mb|6S|nt|bobholl: west will "know" it is @C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but then east is committed to bidding 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: you might miss this game quite easily if you start with a 15-17 notrump as west|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Best lead by West which probably wouldnt have happened had South bid 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: i bet KnR thinks west has more than 17, though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you will miss a lot if you start with 1N on a hand like that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump needed i think|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: declarer was going to have a lot of trouble getting to hand in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: @HA lead and it doesn't look so easy|pg||
nt|athene: east really bid 2nt with a heart fit and no club stop?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "unfortunate lead, Abbott", quoth Brother Xavier:)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: 5@H was certainly very weird|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dT|nt|davidstern: South Has 4-4-1-1 tricks so perhaps should have taken the second club hoping to manufacture an 11th trick|pg||
nt|athene: all aces and kings and 1098s :) just the thing to make KnR wriggle with happiness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one wonders if W was prepared to pass 3H if that were all E had bid|pg||

nt|athene: i don't think this will win the board|pg||

nt|athene: i imagine so - they play strong club, 14-16, don't they?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: then we get an interesting battle of the majors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: if S shows one undisclosed major, W may not bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: a "strong" NT to scare opponents away :)|pg||
nt|athene: does east take the "3 over 3" push?|pg||
nt|athene: it's love all so he surely will|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: even if you open 1@D with 44 minors and a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: it's better to open 1@C with the strong balanced hands|pg||
nt|athene: firstly because you get your transfers going|pg||
nt|athene: secondly because you are not so worried about intervention|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surprising pass by North on this hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W went with the probabilities|pg||
nt|athene: not at all obvious that 3@C shows a heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: i think north should just bid 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: he's on lead against spades anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: chances are you are just going to end up playing it in 3nt or 4 of a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south would rebid 1@H with any weak notrump with 2 or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not as though you are worried that 3@H will get partner off to the wrong start|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: so 1nt is the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: that means you have 2nt available for something else|pg||
nt|athene: and it also means you can respond safely with nothing with a major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N was a very aggressive call|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: west should suspect a misunderstanding here and stick a red card on this|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: well, i think south just thought his partner would have a lot more for 3@C|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if there is a serious misunderstanding double may not be necessary|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: well - "more safely"|pg||
nt|athene: the main worry when you respond on a 2 count or so is that partner will jump to 2nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @S iguess but @C unfriendly :(|pg||
nt|athene: west maybe thinks "ok, partner didn't bid 3@S over 3@C, so we might not even have a 3@S partscore to protect"|pg||
nt|athene: but you have half the deck - they are very unlikely to reach this in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so if it makes, chances are, you lost the board anyway|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: (playing standard methods)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: this lead suggests very strongly that the @SA is right|pg||
nt|athene: as west would lead a spade most of the time without the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer will not be sure enough of that to risk his contract|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|athene: haha, south intending to finesse the @H10?|pg||
nt|athene: basically a victory here for the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would not be so great - on a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: but now declarer plays in the best available spot of 4@H and scores 620 for a loss|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well obviously he thought N had more, but the point is that S does not have much to spare after 2H, and his club holding is nothing to get aroused about|pg||

nt|athene: if you finesse for the @HQ here and it loses, you then have a problem in diamonds, as you can't let someone get a ruff with a small trump as well|pg||
nt|athene: cashing @HAK simplifies things as you are safe on a 3-2 trump break|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 is not such a big deal|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't beat your partscore anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's when they are vul that you have to double for one down - as we saw several times earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@H i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: it's not certain to be right (for example east might have @HQxxx) but it often is best to refuse the finesse for the queen in this sort of situation|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: i have seen Hamman opening these 2@H|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|an|!H|mb|p|nt|athene: but 1@H more common i think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: some play that 1@S here shows the weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: some play it shows exactly three spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: many people would be frightened by the redouble into bidding only 1@S with the east hand|pg||
nt|athene: but 2@S is definitely right|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S just lets NS sort their hands out much easier|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives them a problem|pg||
nt|athene: now north doesn't know how strong his partner is|pg||
nt|athene: he might very well not even know if 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|athene: easy to say he should - i bet most partnerships would not be on firm ground here|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H 2! S all pass ?|pg||
nt|athene: playing 2@D as hearts in this sort of situation gives you the advantage of forcing AND non-forcing free bids|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|athene: south might now offer 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|athene: useful to have a second commentator as i might be ranting nonsense at any moment and no-one would know|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|athene: of course it does make life harder when you have diamonds and a good hand :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i think west should double 1@S for takeout|pg||
nt|athene: get in there fast whilst it's relatively safe|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H says "i would have passed a non-forcing 2@H bid" i guess|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: like this at least 1 person is reading your comments!|pg||
nt|hedyg: here we see no Muiderberg 2@H opening with a 6 card major|pg||
nt|bobholl: IF (big if) this makes will be good|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: the problem with 5@c is it has at least 3 losers|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: 4@H just might sneak home|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: however, it might be OK to lie down to 1nt with your 5-4 heart fit, if you can get some hundreds out of it|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: i think you might as well offer 4@H with south but of course it is easier seeing all the cards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: Drijver a bit too optimistic?|pg||
nt|athene: there was a similar hand a couple of days ago where one of the netherlands players had 6 hearts and 5 clubs and ended in 5@C-1 where 4@H could have made|pg||
nt|hedyg: he raised @c so he assumes S has 5 @cs. in that case the hcps he has outside @c are pretty useless|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly the winning line in 4@H on that hand involved a really bizarre squeeze so it might have failed anyway in practice|pg||
nt|athene: well this is what i was saying earlier|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nice methods for many hands, but here natural bidding has excellent chance of 110 iin D partial|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S was a good bid and made it very hard for NS to sort out how strong they were|pg||
nt|athene: no-one knows what 3@C shows on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: hard for north to pass it|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in 1NT which is luckier and bad defence (@D lead)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: but they'll go down anyway so may be a push|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|athene: that is how you rack up 3@C+3 and other embarrassing scores|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: sorry about that Bill, i was not here . but again...if S is 5-5 how much is N worth?|pg||
nt|athene: east felt the heart underlead was wanting a club ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: well, if NS find diamonds then surely EW would wake up and say "hey, we have a 5-4 fit, and it is higher-ranking than diamonds"|pg||
nt|athene: that is one thing about 1nt - it buries your fit, and the opponents' too|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: sometimes that is good, sometimes not so good|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: well if south has a 5-5 16 count he is worth quite a bit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is N 7th trick which will decide (guess he'll go 2 down)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: or they might say "NS are in diamonds instead of NT, why should that be right for them?"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: and if he has............9hcps?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|hJ|nt|athene: are we all happy in our own partnerships that 3@C denies a good hand here?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|h7|nt|athene: maybe west should have shifted to a  bigger small heart (the @H7)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: to get the spade back|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: then he should have bid a good/bad 2NT!|pg||
nt|athene: or even the @HJ in fact|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair though east did make the play which would always take the contract off|pg||
nt|athene: he can see that if his partner has the @SA it is not going away|pg||
nt|athene: but if west had a club void and not the @SA, the ruff might be necessary to beat|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: yes, but that issue is irrelevant once they are actually there - the issue is just whether hearts EW is better than diamonds NS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: 3@H would be touch and go - just a matter of whether declarer can get two spade ruffs in the west hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in natural bidding EW might never get in, if N takes an aggressive second call:  1D - 1S -1N - 3D|pg||
nt|athene: well, i think west should double 1nt on that sequence |pg||
nt|athene: to show the other two suits|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree he might not|pg||
nt|athene: so -100 might win the board for NS|pg||
nt|athene: against 140 in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: which sort of illustrates what i was saying about doubling for one down|pg||
nt|athene: it can make a whole board's difference when it turns 100 into 200|pg||
nt|athene: in 3@H declarer guessed diamonds right|pg||
nt|athene: but then went a bit astray i think|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
pc|hT|mc|9|nt|athene: 4@H in the other room a bit of an overbid |pg||

nt|bobholl: could have made in the end by ruffing a @C and give E a placing with @H :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry not made 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: East's @CK a good card to try and avoid an endplay|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@C EW or 4@H NS it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: So if NS get to 4@H EW should sacrifice in 5@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK so they made three on the previous board|pg||
nt|davidstern: I must leave you now - thanks for your company and keep safe. All the best to those in the North-East of the USA nunkering down for a Hurricane. See you soon|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: the play in 3@H was actually really interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer made the mistake of playing trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lets see whether they play Muiderberg at all...no they dont|pg||
nt|athene: NS given a MUCH easier ride in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: some would double 2@S with the west hand|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it's a little bit light with basically a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: now if you want to gamble you bid 3NT with the north hand i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: when he should have just gone for the crossruff|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: but he could have recovered with an entry-shifting squeeze|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: a bit wet of EW not to get involved somehow|pg||
nt|athene: whether you gamble or not might depend on what useful information you can find out|pg||
nt|athene: if south goes 4@C now, north isn't stopping below six, surely|pg||
mb|d!|nt|athene: at the key point he has to concede a club to prepare the crossruff and south has to play ace and a trump to stop that|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: some use 3nt in these situations as a "save suggest" i.e. saying "I have a raise to 4@D and you can sacrifice in 5 unless you have a really bent overcall with lots of defence"|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: ok, so opener shows the shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now clubs less likely to be very bad for 3nt but on the other hand the diamonds not running|pg||
nt|athene: of course passing 3@D is a gentle way to have fun with partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: but then north gets squeezed in the black suits and declarer can ruff one good, winning the third trump in the appropriate hand|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all ancient history now|pg||
nt|athene: whereas 4@D would not invite any further action from partner|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble is it gives the opponents more room|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: i guess EW here play that double of 1@H would deny spades?|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@S is 4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes X= i have no bid|pg||
nt|athene: west may now offer spades en route to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe that is én route :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no en was fine|pg||
nt|athene: (3@S would be forcing showing three spades on this sort of auction, saying "do we play 3nt or 4@S?")|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 5 cards in @s E would bid 2@c|pg||
nt|athene: well, maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what would be the purpose of 4D then, if opps are in a GF?|pg||
nt|athene: just to use up some space|pg||
mb|6C|nt|athene: raising 3@D to 4@D takes away a lot of useful bids from NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H a strong heart raise, but EW, like most serious pairs these days, have abandoned the old jacoby 2nt continuations|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT a strong heart raise sorry|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: west is not afraid but luckily his P has no @S control either|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt might make in practice|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C shows a good hand and 3@D asking for further information - probably about shortages etc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems as if N bid 6C directly over the double|pg||
nt|athene: well, she does have quite a nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: now she just has to get the hearts right for a diamond pitch|pg||
nt|athene: actually even ace and queen of hearts throwing the @d7 is ok, isn't it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it depends on what double showed of course, but S had many options over 4D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: if 2nt categorically denied five spades, then yes i guess no point showing them|pg||
nt|athene: south has the opponents' suits stopped|pg||
nt|athene: no, sorry, you can set up one long heart but you still don't get all the spades away|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wont she lose a spade then?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: and he thinks his partner has a 1@H overcall :) well, maybe he does, maybe he doesn't|pg||
nt|athene: the @DKQ are not well-placed so i think this is an aggressive double|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's lead-directing, suggesting spade?|pg||
nt|athene: NS have a lot of tens which are working hard|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd overcalled and he has hcps and stops both suits bid by opps|pg||
nt|athene: a good example here of just how bad 4333 shapes are - EW have 25 hcp and they are going to need every single one|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: someday most serious pairs will undoubtedly abandon these treatments also|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|athene: although even on a heart lead, when declarer sets up diamonds east gets to make some discards|pg||
nt|athene: so that and the combination of the heart spot led initially...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: also he wanted a @s lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobholl: @S ruff small and 1 with the ace and 4@H makes|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: well, he has 8 tricks fairly easily with the @DAJ well placed|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's clear that opener's rebids in traditional jacoby auctions are not best|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|d7|nt|athene: but it's not clear what IS best|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: can he build a third trick in spades by leading towards the A8?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|athene: or perhaps squeeze south in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: spade shift now breaks up the squeeze i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: what good is ducking the @H trick?|pg||
nt|athene: west might be finding the little club|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: well he is just trying to tighten up the position to bring pressure to bear on south|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: most theoreticians are mostly concerned with not disclosing information to the defence unnecessarily|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough decision, but i think the heart lead is suspect. what is there about the auction that would suggest to an E who lacks the heart king that a heart lead is necessary from the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: gun or else declarer's hypothetical heart loser will go away? without heart king E would want to build a trick -- perhaps in spades -- before heart king or ace is knocked out|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d5|nt|athene: interesting battle for tempo here|pg||
nt|hedyg: the switch to @s shows that KQ@D are in S|pg||
nt|athene: south has to lead a spade back and then if west sets up a long spade, south can set up HIS long spade|pg||
nt|athene: and use the @DKQ as an entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: with an entry to his hand N would have continued @H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer knows where the diamonds are|pg||
nt|athene: from the bidding and north's line of defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should know|pg||
nt|hedyg: CR S opened a Muiderberg 2@s, N bid 3@c pass or correct and 3@d was not a success|pg||
nt|athene: can south work out what to do here? leading a big spade is not at all obvious|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: ok, now the tempo is gone|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: of course it's very hard at BAM because if declarer has the @CQ, you might want to just cash out with the @CAK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my point was not judgmental, only that the times are always changing. having said that, plus ca change plus c'est la meme chose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i said that in a convoluted way. i am trying to say that E probably has the heart king|pg||

nt|athene: and b) if you give people lots of chances to double for the lead, that is in theory a big drawback|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: i like teammates who save the board when i go down in makeable slam:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i buy them a beer, if we are all old enough:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: although in practice people's lead-directing-double judgement is so bad, that often isn't the case|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hedyg: usually 1NT over 1@d is 7+|pg||
nt|athene: 14 facing 10 often produces swings|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|athene: it goes 1nt [14-16] - 3nt pass|pg||
nt|athene: or 1minor - 1nt - pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the traditional Jacoby continuations revealed facts about declarer's hand, but not responder's so that the second point was not a flaw. and any methods are going to reveal ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: something about somebody's hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N would not be a universal choice, especially in france. i hope simon has a second passport:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobholl: but other room in 3@D X so no difference for extra trick|pg||
nt|athene: east hoping to catch a 4-4 major fit and outscore 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: when he hears 2@D he probably wishes he passed 1nt :)|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to do a little something more now - i doubt 2@C promised a pure 5-5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe this is not the right diagram|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: maybe double was best, but partner might just take that as showing extra HCP, rather than extra distribution|pg||
nt|athene: he sort of has a balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N implausible, pass over 1N also, stayman odd etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: it did go 1NT-3NT in CR|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west upgraded to 15-17|pg||

mb|6S|nt|marlowepi: odd, schmodd, EW have done well here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it all makes a sort of sense if you accept EW play non-standard methods over 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: or maybe they play 14-16|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: another situation here that can cause misunderstandings - if opps have shown two suits, do your cue-bids SHOW a stopper or ASK for one?|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the standard was they showed|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|Walddk3: It's worth 16.15 on the KnR|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: although that can cause problems because if opps only showed one suit, your cue bid asks for a stop, of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: where i come from the norm is as you say|pg||
nt|athene: west was a bit stuck in the other room - clearly 4@S is a slight underbid but he didn't want to commit to the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: that's a very serious step to take|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C is believable on those grounds yes, but the pass over 1N by N still seems remarkably docile|pg||

nt|athene: people sometimes pass over a 1nt opener with a very good suit, hoping it will become a Surprise Weapon vs. 3NT later|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes they do, and they almost invariably end up with results like that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: S has a perfect weak NT|pg||
nt|babs59: perhaps it is a little different when one player has already opened 1NT though Bill|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|babs59: as opposed to when you are looking for 3NT as a final contract, without NT having been bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that might make things worse though - if you now have three different ways to play it :) lots more to remember|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: all pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: sry was away|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C is a transfer to diamonds, i assume|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 1nt rebid rather than 2@C no doubt prompted by the form of scoring|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good for E, opening that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes that is what i mean|pg||
nt|athene: west had 14 but with aces and kings|pg||
nt|athene: so KnR will love it|pg||
nt|athene: he is intending to follow up with 4@H of course|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's a little bit optimistic to assume you will get a chance to rebid 4@H, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and think it's about a 16 count|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all he had 2 10s in his longer suits|pg||
nt|athene: favourable-vulnerability opponents have a habit of being in 4@S by the time it comes round to you again|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: K@D lead asks for unblock or count|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be on non @D lead 1 up trick |pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may also need a second passport:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: the strategy appears to be: "if we play in a minor i want thge NT opener to play it, but if we play in a major i should be from my side":)|pg||
nt|athene: if you open light maybe you can't game-force with west|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|athene: @SJ surely now|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@s now is good|pg||
nt|athene: ducked by eas|pg||
nt|athene: east|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|athene: and now declarer is a bit stuck|pg||
nt|babs59: would you consider transferring to hearts and planning to rebid 5@D over the expected 4@S instead?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: i am not sure i understand the bidding though|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: on board 5 north responded 1@D (surely a transfer)|pg||
nt|hedyg: both @H and @c were unattractive switches|pg||
nt|athene: but here in exactly the same situation he bids 1@H naturally?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: i mean it's ok at imps where you don't really care about going down in game|pg||
nt|athene: but at BAM, different story|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: however, if you open hands like that, you have to be careful as responder about forcing to game. taking LTC seriously is essential, and downgrading 3 small trumps as support is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also a good idea. really W just has a very good 3 card invitation|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: not sure what the double was about  -- probably just "i dont want to sell to 4H, so do something"|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|athene: west transfers and north has a bit of a problem|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: now spades get raised and north has an easy double|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: Dobar Dan|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: in imps this is a non interesting hand but in BAM this is equally important as a grand slam hand :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: and the issue for NS then is whether lebensohl applies|pg||
nt|hedyg: and E XX|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: in theory, redouble is not a good idea in these positions, as it makes it much easier for NS |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he has the mastersuit|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow no @S contract costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: the table are all very happy|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|athene: but i guess it can help to tell partner you have a good hand so he can co-operate in penalizing the opps or whatever|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: 4@H is best|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt opener would have found hearts :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for many pairs, S would be free to bid out without showing extra values -- in that case S would have a lot to tll about|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tell|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: as what would you have taken the 3@H bid?|pg||
nt|athene: i think 1nt with that sort of hand is so much better than 1@S it's just not close |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely it is length, no?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|bobholl: but ew won't stay that way :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: of course there are many other treatments for the 2H rebid also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N presumably had options over 2H, and some would choose 2N to protect the heart king (but that may not have been available to N)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|athene: yes 3@H must surely be length|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: then why bid 4@s?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: even if it isn't, what harm can come from bidding 4@H?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  this makes 6NT with the favorable @D finesse and @S break, but I expect it to be 4@S X|pg||

nt|warrens:  always has 7 @S's and 1 @H, so as long as the defense doesn't give him a @D trick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  playing 2@h's making 4 wasn't good enough on the last hand.  2NT making 4 at the other table|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||

nt|athene: but i lost it|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1?|pg||
nt|athene: nasty KJ guess at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: declarer 's trouble is that even if the @DQ drops doubleton the diamonds would be blocked so you could never get to cash them|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm, ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a chance N wont lead a club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: huge chance now:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair, this is reasonable - north does not expect to find much club length in partner's hand on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C is second negative?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: must be|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|athene: north has a pretty good hand, in context :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at IMPs one shd lead a club -- unlikely to beat it via club but even more unliekly to beat it any other way|pg||
nt|athene: so with no entries you don't really expect to get the clubs going|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at BAM nonclub is very reasonable, especially if you have a clear sense of which alternative suit to lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: and since A@H is the normal lead he makes 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|athene: declarer steals some tricks in the majors|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|athene: ok, just the one|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: i thought he might try the @HK too|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: sometimes, though, dummy has stiff club king and declarer has Jxx, with partner holding AX|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding Ax, and soon holding (and wielding) AX|pg||
nt|athene: true, but on that layout, partner might get in and play ace and a club later anyway|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: one hopes so:)|pg||

nt|athene: 2@C 2@D 2@S and north bid a somewhat creative 4@S|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: 1nt shows 4 spades 5 minor for NS?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is intending to follow it up with something cunning to show his extra strength|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just a jump in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps a cue bid or something more interesting|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe a bid of notrumps in fact|pg||

nt|athene: saying "solid suit, heart stop, but 4 spades on the side"|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 4@S is a bit much with the north hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at BAM maybe, but at IMPs all the N cards look like working hard|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: once hearts are raise N is very close to 4S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: 2@H must mean something or other - now he will surely bid 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: EW play bergen raises on over intervention?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|athene: or maybe they play some system of transfers there so 3@D is just transfer to hearts, i.e. good raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are you suggesting they are no bargen in such auctions? :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|athene: west can see the lead is a singleton so no temptation to duck, playing his pd for another heart and a club entry|pg||
