nt|mr murray: sabbine might tend to be aggressive with Zia as he delares fairly well :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
mc|9|nt|mcphee: was that not down 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: yesterday Zia and Sabbine were in the 14th place with 59,07%|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: in a total of 103 pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice tournout|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 1st place for Schwartz R. and Fisher L. with 70,52%|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 2nd place with 68,2% for Sincair A. and Karamanlis M.|pg||
nt|psyck: Elie, please recheck deal 2, was probably 4HS-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: and 3rd place for Kachams G. and Sinno R. |pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is just not a good bid in my opinion - you really need the fourth heart for it|pg||
nt|mcphee: leaders I am advised are European and wolrd jr champs|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D promises that short of hand but with 4 trumps for most people|pg||
nt|athene: *that sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: so partner is going to over-compete and you will go down when opps couldn't make anything|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 3@d was indeed inexplicable here, one would not consider it even at imps i think|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Sabine wanted to push EW too high in clubs|pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SAKHA8762DKJ6CJ97,SQT9652HK9DQ8CT53,SJ84HQJ53D53CKQ64,S73HT4DAT9742CA82|sv|e|nt|athene: the trouble with that is, partner won't be in on the joke|pg||
nt|eleni: 2nd place William, Miltos Karamanlis was the winner in 2000 in the Juniors Generali Masters. He is 27 now:) (an old boy :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: the fourth trump would have made her bid much better and contract would have some play generally|pg||
nt|athene: should be 4@H here whether he starts with 1nt or 1@H|pg||
nt|eleni: It is so encouraging that youngsters are so "hot" with Bridge!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: declarer could be put to a @d guess here|pg||
nt|athene: east is presumably going to win the @CA and play a small diamond at some point|pg||
nt|athene: zia may get the guess right if he has discovered enough about the hand by then - for example if he knows west has six decent spades and @HKx, he might think he would have ...|pg||
nt|athene: overcalled with the @DA as well|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ah, ok, i was assuming west *wouldn't* overcall of course|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcphee: west 2@S quite risky at these colors|pg||
nt|psyck: I have learnt that i have to type very short to get something out before Bill, he is fast & thorough :)|pg||
nt|athene: the problem on this sort of auction is that it's fine for the double of 2@D to just show "values", which is what most people agree|pg||
nt|athene: but you can run into a lot of trouble if you don't know what your NEXT double means|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: they might not be on same page about meaning of Sabines dbl|pg||
nt|athene: sabine didn't want to double 2@S because that might sound more like penalties|pg||
nt|athene: "double then double"|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: i think it's much better for the second double to be takeout from both sides anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mr murray: they apparently havent spent a lot of time discussing this|pg||
nt|mcphee: most play the dble of 2@D (art) is at least a good raise to 2NT|pg||
nt|psyck: or they found their way through it at the table, wd anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: oh oh|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but then when opps run away to their real suit, is your next double penalties or takeout, and is pass forcing? if you don't know these things then doubling the artificial bid ...|pg||
nt|athene: is worse than useless|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcphee: Pass should be F to dble or 2NT|pg||
nt|mr murray: with the interference easy to misguess in diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: I suppose she took a view to lie low at NV  MP's|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||

nt|mr murray: most will be in game but some will go down for sure. I think very average|pg||
nt|athene: it surely can't have been necessary to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes west player got a bit too busy this hand|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: 3N from the E seat will attract the @D lead|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mr murray: spade 10 is my guess|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|athene: it's not clearcut to lead a broken four-card suit on this sort of auction - especially a minor|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|eleni: a chance for 12 even there:)|pg||
nt|athene: if you did lead a diamond, declarer finesses the queen and knocks out the @hA and you knock out the @DA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|athene: now declarer has to decide whether to take the spade finesse for 12|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
mc|11|nt|mr murray: no 12 tricks unless zia leads fourth best diamond  ducked] around to 9|pg||
nt|athene: yes of course it wouldn't work :) i am just saying some people might go for it|pg||
nt|athene: if you run the clubs first north has an interesting MP decision|pg||
nt|mr murray: that could be the flattest board of set.|pg||
nt|athene: whether to bare the @SK to keep a diamond|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3ST9HA86DJ86CJ9842,S54HKJ97DKQ4CAT63,SKQ873HQ2D975CKQ5,SAJ62HT543DAT32C7|sv|n|nt|mr murray: this is a good 4 hearts which probably makes. Not sure to bid|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@S-P-1N-double by W?|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes a little thin for a pairs game to reach 4@H|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: pass of 1nt is a bit wet in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: so much for considering 4@H contract:)|pg||
nt|athene: you have to get in there, and earlier is safer|pg||
nt|mr murray: will they even get in auction?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West must double 1NT. That is a take-out double of spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcphee: wow, call the cops|pg||
nt|mr murray: terrible result for e-w|pg||
nt|psyck: it was an easy double this time too, with no wastage in @s's, NV, 4 card other N, etc.|pg||
nt|athene: defending 1nt when you have a 4-4 fit (particularly a major) is almost always very bad|pg||
nt|athene: because even if you find your 4-4 fit and get it going against 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: which is not certain|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|athene: it still is not worth many tricks in notrumps|pg||

nt|mr murray: one of kibbitzers said +200 is better than 170.  Very true|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c9|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|athene: this is why you don't defend 1nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suspect that will be a near top for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: because you WILL misdefend it|pg||
nt|mr murray: :)|pg||

nt|athene: no use saying "we could have got it for 200, so we bid right, it was just we misdefended"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: you have to budget for dropping at least one trick in defence to 1nt |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mcphee: if that allows for your calculations the declarer will blow a trick you are back to 50-50:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@c probably 2 way checkback|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C forcing 2@D to show an invitational hand now i guess|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|psyck: with 2@d denying 3 card @h|pg||
nt|mr murray: 2c forces 2 diamonds ffor start of inv sequence|pg||
nt|athene: zia now has to choose whether to play the 5-2 or convert to 2nt, or show the spades along the way to 2nt|pg||
nt|psyck: oh|pg||
nt|mr murray: does not deny 3 hearts|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mr murray: I think xyz. I could be wrong|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: is zia really confident his partner can't have 4-5 majors for this auction, or does he just not care because he wants that spade lead?|pg||
nt|athene: he has certainly bypassed enough chances to show spades :)|pg||
nt|psyck: likely a MP decision|pg||
nt|eleni: Zia's gavorit play:)|pg||

nt|mcphee: wow, popping ace was odd|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|athene: jumping in with the ace there slightly panicky|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|mr murray: what kind of def is this?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm, he coult not go wrong, unfortunately defense could|pg||
nt|mr murray: Is Zia paying them off or they just afraid of him?:)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|psyck: varying|pg||
mc|10|nt|mr murray: they should be more afraid of the "mean" commentators around the table:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: and that's the reason psyck that we had some couples under 30% |pg||
nt|mr murray: That is very true|pg||
nt|psyck: and also the reason that 59% is only 14th spot|pg||
