mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: The safety play in spades, a low from dummy, guarantees 10 tricks in 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many inexperienced players would lead the king from hand, but that is not the best way to tackle the suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: both german pairs are no regular partnerships in German open events but find together as partners for the senior events for quiet a long time now|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It normally does not matter because the suit breaks 3-2, but by leading a small from dummy you also cater for singleton ace with South|pg||
