pc|dA|nt|dslee: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ianmcc: looks like 6 losers|pg||
nt|psridhar: ty|pg||
nt|dslee: can we have the top 6 positions mak?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: pls see the weblink as above |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|dslee: thanks mak|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sunit thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: It is rare that 2C is passed,  2C can be a big hand, just short of a jumpshift or 2NT bid as it was here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzjh: pls check scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  with an opening hand and 3@d, 2N is a bit of an underbid but E was able to raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders have changed now it is Jaggy and Dalal|pg||
nt|patricck: The difference of 416 can really be divided by 13 because each score is matched with every one of the other 13 tables, so it is like being about 32 imps behind the leaders|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi welcome NK|pg||
nt|dslee: none of these folks except sunit is very spontenous - i wonder why this bid happened|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is headed for 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: oh yes, sorry typo, already said 9 earlier|pg||
nt|patricck: 20 points each|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ianmcc: looks like -100, with care|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi in long trance |pg||
nt|nkgupt: did not understand seeking pd's opinion and then overrule him :)|pg||
nt|patricck: which I guess is why West doubled, but wasn't he fortunate to find that  both the AK of @S were in the South hand?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: av sud be about 120 to N so 5@sX-1 translates to about -65/70|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dslee: well there you see|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|strike12: we have every round updates at the above link, so keep urself posted |pg||
nt|dslee: difficult to crack|pg||
nt|dslee: -1|pg||
nt|animeshraj: becoz 6S . should come with HA.J sort of|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  how high would they stop? even grand is makeable|pg||
pc|sA|nt|patricck: 2 spades and 2 trump losers unless declarer is a genius|pg||
nt|patricck: 2 spade losers and 2 heart losers on the face of it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzjh: 7 claimed|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gm all.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzjh: After this round will be lunch break and we shall be back at 1345 i.e. after 1 hr 45 minutes |pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT probably would also have been 1 light|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 10 should score well continuing clubs pays off|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, this certainly is safe enough|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  but to bid it, E has to imagine exactly such a hand by partner - with long side suit|pg||
nt|peachy: W needs to have control of the auction, E described his in opening and then 3S, I assume|pg||
nt|peachy: This is still makeable if declarer is careful|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s8|nt|psridhar: Anil will lose 2@h and 4 trumps for d1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi makarand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hello again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT was possible, not 5@c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: one of the flatest i suppose 4@h-1 all round?|pg||
nt|patricck: can be hard to guess the average on a board like this|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: or has X-ray eyes :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: discussion about if 3nt shud have been passed |pg||
nt|nkgupt: std people will not come to know there 6/6 fit so early to block all the way|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: close to 6@c here|pg||
nt|babs59: PS, how come you aren't playing here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: my partner is not free|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: both Venky and Sreedharan also have played for INdia the BB|pg||
nt|peachy: Venky also an international level player|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome |pg||
nt|patricck: I am told the difference is 330 imps, as the website is a round behind, so Gupta and Venky are effectively about 25 imps behind the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thats why i announced the scores after 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this vul they play 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: no results put up as yet|pg||

nt|sga1: 5  832  Ashok Goel - Sudhir - Suhas Vaidya|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  with Aces and Kings, 1@h might have been a better choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: nothing much will make|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: So the lower N/S stop the better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS aren't strong enough to reach the game but EW may push them|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S might be a pre-blocking bid|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ah! there u go.|pg||
nt|patricck: should just reach a club partscore here|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: the page is still to be updated|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I am informed of a change in the lunch times and next round will start at13 30 i.e after 1 hr 30 minutes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: but trump leads break it|pg||
nt|nkgupt: X=4M+longer m|pg||
nt|dslee: trick is to lead @H|pg||
nt|dslee: lets opps struggle to get the tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 3@d will be the right spot to play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Germ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi all |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, looks like preempt, but N will be surprised with result|pg||
nt|sga1: Scores are available till last round on this website :  http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d expensive|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 1@c-1@s-2@c-4@s-5@c now N wud hav had his word in @s and free to X now|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT by West probably would have made, but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|nkgupt: kb surely not passing 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he is dep in thought|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|nkgupt: he hasnt come all the way from home to pass:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: 3NT alway OK, overtricks if @d not led|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to reach a slam on 5-2 |pg||
nt|strike12: do we have the current results after round 8 Mak?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to X|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can do quite well in hearts but not so easy to come into the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: losing 1 in each suit. average|pg||
nt|babs59: this is one of those hands where the transfer doesn't exactly improve the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: please check out the running scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: open room did well|pg||
nt|animeshraj: well bid N-S|pg||
nt|dslee: good lead anil|pg||
nt|panja: the question is, can he make 12 tricks...|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Prakash, glad to see you volunteering your expertise for the kibs|pg||
nt|panja: 11 should be easy..but with @DK off..12 will be difficult...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and hello Srini|pg||
nt|strike12: Hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm, I don't like that on such a ragged suit, AJ10xxx maybe|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: and to our operator, Makarand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks folks ;) I am doing the netcast first time so pls execuse for any mistakes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes it is|pg||
nt|nkgupt: quite a position to take to defend 1ntX when pd did not open even 3rd seat|pg||
nt|nkgupt: other table bidding brd 2 on almost anticipated line for std ew:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: brd|pg||
nt|patricck: probably 0 or 2 higher lead. That is going to help declarer more than the defence|pg||
nt|nkgupt: brd1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: a litill better in fact...pin pointing def to 5@c w/ 3@h bid on the way|pg||
nt|nkgupt: little|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|strike12: The @s position is favourably placed, so dec has good chances for scoring it|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Sveta|pg||

nt|patricck: why not lead partners suit when you have Jx?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|strike12: np Mak u r doing great|pg||

nt|psridhar: wise|pg||
nt|panja: hi Raija, thx|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ianmcc: faster|pg||
nt|ianmcc: reprieve|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|strike12: N has got the tempo now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: Sunit can smoke out the trump ace now |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: live scores can be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will make 90|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  E will get his 4 tricks and that seems to be it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psridhar: in the air|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may anticipate difficulties with rebid after 1@h opening, but this time both 1NT and @h partscore -  no play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not much worse in NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  true as to play of hand...and 1N usually fine with a 5 card major...here, however, the major is top heavy and the outside points are in Aces...those cards belong in a suit contract.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not a @d|pg||
nt|patricck: that is the end of the defence|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzjh: claims 7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzjh: the running scores can be seen on the link http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psridhar: he then has 8 ?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|strike12: @s 10 vital card|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a correct guess in diamonds probably brings 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting position appears after 6 @h tricks, let's see|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: looks like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: about 15 kibitzers around the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Rajesh dep in thought|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzjh: all smiling on the table |pg||
nt|babs59: yes - I had the hearts inverted in my mind (defensive hearts)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|patricck: oops|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: yes 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  costly switch by S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psridhar: that misguess however spells doom|pg||
nt|patricck: now the heart loser goes on the spades|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  or so may be the case - playing W not to have last spade |pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer is taking a line that will allow making.  Ordinarily 5-3 fit in trump contract is preferred, but with enough for game+, NT often better|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|strike12: This will be home soon|pg||
nt|sga1: Really expensive sacrifice by Kiran|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|nkgupt: +1?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: In a 20-21 context, North's hand was an absolute supermax, luckily they do not have slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he plays too fast :( |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: for me to follow all cards |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: at the same pace|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  still set it one|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c7|pc|s8|pg||

nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: I think that will be some imps in there for making 3NT, much harder on a heart lead|pg||
nt|patricck: both sides can make 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Sunit 's first seat preempts are not bonded by Llyods of London :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 4@H will need careful handling|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be a snacks break and the next match would start at IST 1745 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: alerted|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good stuff where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: @h6 is a powerful card after j7 drops|pg||
mb|1N|nt|strike12: a big pickup for NS as they gain in terms of Total Imps|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N made good decision - knowing partner has good @h fit, N sees 6 tricks in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, so declarer gets 2 hearts 2 clubs 3 diamonds and a spade before EW get 3 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|patricck: hard to know about the first board, but that was definitely a few imps for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: another trouble hand, but not big trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N balanced in passout seat over 1N, E dbld and W played in 2@d, making|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@C Precision|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome back |pg||
nt|sga1: 1@C - 17+, dbl 5-7 HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can have two heart tricks, I believe a heart lead from east is awkward too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzjh: it is IMP pairs |pg||
nt|strike12: 6@s is on if bid|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not familiar with NS system, sorry|pg||
nt|peachy: Standard, with transfers over 1C opening, I was told|pg||
nt|peachy: If anyone interested to see what K & R hand evaluator says about it, here http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@hX -1 or -2 looks about right|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 1@H is a transfer style response|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: The Pair of A Goel and Suhas Vaidya will be playing for Indian in this BB|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: all play all each pair plays 6 boards against each other barometer|pg||

mb|d|nt|strike12: is N still thinking for a Save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could go down 4|pg||
nt|panja: if W gets to underlead the @CA sometime..it could get interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should duck this|pg||
nt|patricck: takeout double from Soth?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: and pass from North|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but success!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||

mb|2S|nt|psridhar: Anil knows it alright-but his 5@d was calculated to test Arun -he knows he has long @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|strike12: no X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes was a pause |pg||
nt|ianmcc: how do we get a score so fast?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this score is only a comparison of the two vugraph tables|pg||
nt|psridhar: +300|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: bad bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: the game is tooo fast to make all explanations of alerted bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: It is no problem, Mak.  Let me quote somebody: Operator is like a long tailed cat in a small room of rocking chairs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|babs59: hi Ian.  Kiran had to find the lead of a small Diamond|pg||
nt|nkgupt: but is a good save:)|pg||
nt|patricck: it is true eats woud have to pitch a heart if declarer started with two rounds of clubs vs 3NT on a heart lead, but what declarer would cash 2 club tricks at the start of that ...|pg||
nt|patricck: hand?|pg||
nt|patricck: ah yes I said both sides make 11 tricks, but I was wrong, the @D ruff holds spades to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: South was planning on bidding spades twice before bidding @H|pg||
nt|patricck: the transfer response means South is playing this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 H was transfer positive response|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that pull to 2@s never crossed my mind i must admit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: could have been lucrative, but it went so quickly it seemed North wasn't even slightly interested in defending|pg||

nt|nkgupt: about 20hcp each ...odd breaks vul opps only 7@s per say cant see a logic for the pull|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: Club lead, or club now, will give declarer plenty trouble making|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ianmcc: wrong guess|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: he might make if he doesn't touch hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: of course Subhash could make but only if he flies the DK immediately|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: the black suits were lying quite well for declarer and he still wouldn't have been close to making 2@H|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and dont expect dummy to turn up w/ good @hs (afterall just 4/5 hcp there at most) do well placed 5@h's|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nkgupt: so well...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzjh: yes sorry my fault|pg||

nt|andyv:  in mp, you have to be...but in teams, best contract wins most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claim|pg||
nt|patricck: After the duck if Declarer had foolishly played a 2nd trump then a 3rd trump would have trapped him in dummy|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will be -200 - could have done better|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is easy to be careless on such hands|pg||
nt|patricck: maybe they recently conceded -670 in another match, you would have thought at least it was worth considering the pass|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|babs59: would I fly the DK?  I doubt it - but I would wonder why they'd led dummy's suit (such a lead is usually a singleton)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims 10|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: South decided to try sqz|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if so you are dead anyway|pg||
nt|babs59: however, everyone at this table knows each other's game and style very well, so it might depend on that|pg||
nt|nkgupt: was a 99.99999% pass for me|pg||
nt|patricck: not sure of the exact percentage for me, but something close to that :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|buddyshah: trying 11 |pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||

nt|patricck: this will be difficult to make on a @H lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ianmcc: certainly not 5@d|pg||

nt|babs59: 2D by Subhash won't pose any difficulties tho|pg||
nt|panja: this will be difficult..|pg||

nt|babs59: the club at trick 2 was a tidy play, despite the CA offside|pg||

nt|andyv:  16 imps almost impossible to recover in a short match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: two more boards for the match |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S may be hard to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: next match is leaders Subhash Gupta and Venky Vs KIran and Satya |pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggy has finished his set and passing bye the home game ;)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: last two boards for the day . |pg||

nt|patricck: bidding is slightly wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry for last seven rounds |pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: yes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: North/south better silent here|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS dont have values for 3N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think @d9 promotes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably about 95% responsible for that disaster|pg||
nt|sga1: As per latest running scores, Raju Tolani and Ajay Khare have overtaken Subhash - Venky|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, thats better, pass then 1C, 1s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: to open S or not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html is the exact webpage for running scores |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for E/W but not in clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: X looks brave - will he pass 5@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya in a trance|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
nt|peachy: East hand is much too good for any sort of premptive action, 1S is normal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: where are the present pairs running?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all scores may be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@d shows hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tomorrow the tourney starts at 9 AM IST |pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sga1: Transfers in Intervention - a good tool|pg||
nt|sga1: Now slam chances with aggressive bidding by S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too hard for the elderly|pg||
nt|babs59: pick a slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: is this Match Points or IMPS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd suggest 2@s bid by W|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S can make 3 of a major amd EW can make 4 of a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I thank on behalf of the Sponsers and Organisers BBO and BFI for allowing this transmission|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C might be transfer, in competition|pg||
nt|peachy: transfer to 2D, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was alerted by Satya |pg||
nt|sga1: Now 5@c cue should take them to slam|pg||
nt|patricck: Sorry, table collapsed there for a moment.... presume players are just picking the cards up off the floor and reorganising :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board?  yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  low level bid and acceptable doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: one more after this |pg||
nt|babs59: now 6D by Satya, and 6H by Kiran|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzjh: IMPS Total|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@H showing 4+ @s, 1NT - denies 3@S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: 6 boards per rd, Total IMPs scoring (Pairs)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D will go one down for sure...two likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: trying to correct the score of last deal|pg||
nt|panja: W is taking a huge gamble with that double, holding five of his HCP in @H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opportunity lost|pg||
nt|sga1: you never know, S may carry on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good sequence|pg||
nt|patricck: Any other vulnerability it would have been Ok to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|patricck: Thank you for operating the Vu Graph :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
nt|panja: ah..the lead solves one big problem for the Declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: He is following the pronciple that the person short in their fit suit must be aggressive, but I'm sure he too wishes his 5HCP in hearts were in another suit :)|pg||
nt|peachy: *principle|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|panja: GIB might show this as one down...but will likely be -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  only  point of interest on this hand is if N can guess the @hs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly without the lightner it is easier to beat slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S would have shown a small profit for NS -500 instead of -620|pg||
nt|patricck: North will eliminate the spades and diamonds and then run the J@C for an endplay, but as one of the club honours is onside the endplay will have been unnecessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome :) and I thank you all commentetors for bearing with my errors and undos :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|babs59: and board 1 reflects that policy too|pg||
nt|patricck: ??|pg||
nt|patricck: not making 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: corrected :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was 11|pg||
nt|patricck: ty|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ianmcc: 1NT gets him into @h|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|psridhar: rt|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must like to live dangerously....leaving the dbl in is not to be recommended to the faint of heart|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA, @dA, @d ruff, @h finesse, @d ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ianmcc: it will be North who carries on|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: quick work by Anand to claim after cross ruffing and finally playing a spade to K|pg||
mc|10|nt|panja: if East is smart enough to bring in Clubs to discard a loser...it will be -1...|pg||
nt|panja: but he does not know @C are 33...|pg||

nt|sga1: Exclusion RKCB in @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: sandeep in a trance|pg||
nt|babs59: Venky has a great hand opposite Majors|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is Drury...@H fit...|pg||
nt|panja: gives a chance to North to have some say|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes min 4card as announced|pg||
nt|twcho: north could double|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some X|pg||
mb|3D|nt|babs59: pity the splinters are the same suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sunit has gr8 support for @d too -but 500 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so Rajesh after exlaation took his bid back |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, he doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders before this round are |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should N bid better minor this time? I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S Gupta Venky are current leaders|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should S introduce 6th- heart or 3-cards @s support - a problem indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Aah, we get to watch the leaders next round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 12 tricks here...with @S 32..and @C finesse in|pg||
nt|sga1: Satya showing one @s honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggy Dalal 1313|pg||
nt|sga1: 6@c - Zero|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: again explanations been written down|pg||
nt|patricck: a moderate slam which can make with the @CQx onside|pg||
nt|patricck: one of  Bob Hamman's Bols Tips was always concentrate extra hanrd on the first board of a set and the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: it is not a good slam to bid...with @D values, most of them, wasted|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry for the scoring error on board 34 I am not able to correct it .Kindly bear|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: too many|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the results have been posted on the Results link on webpage http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: at the bottom of the page there is a hyperlink to results |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing ordinary 1NTF, North's rebid is 2C|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: inquiry from declerer about the lead |pg||
nt|strike12: 10 tricks now |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing support doubles, the decision is pretty easy = Dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  N good enough to bid 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2Raju Tolani Ajay Khare 1186|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 Subhash Gupta Venky 1036|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was a chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzjh: Ajay thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the rare exception when it could only be 2-card suit, normally longer minor or 2C with 3-3 minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a bid by S!|pg||
nt|peachy: South's bid is much too frisky, given their methods, but he is probably attempting to get something back from the unfortunate -930.  I dont like that strategy though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder what was the reason|pg||
nt|peachy: But that is an "if" because I dont know if they have Support Dbl on card|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and with @c shortness the choice could be dbl|pg||
nt|panja: similarly, @H values in N hand are wasted...|pg||
nt|patricck: Partner didn't double 6@C so South shouldn't be tempted to lay down the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: crowd gathering around the table|pg||
nt|nkgupt: MrSG must be baffled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he is sitting with crossed hands deep in thought|pg||
nt|nkgupt: i suppose a save in 6@h coming:)|pg||
nt|patricck: 8@H?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nkgupt: dont think 4@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and to win it - an easy deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: transfer?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he shrugs and passes |pg||
pc|hK|nt|babs59: thanks Makulky - seems the top 3 just keep shifting around :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@H  sorry typo|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3 level toxic|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 VM lal Bhiwandkar 980|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last deal of the match |pg||
nt|patricck: mind you declarer can go wrong in trumps, small to the K@C works when the @CAx on side and also @CAxx, bit not against @CAQx so finessing against the queen is better by a few ...|pg||
nt|patricck: percent|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: nothing much exciting in the set :(|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: North over the top|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Subhash Gupta + Venky |pg||
nt|nkgupt: fit jump/nfj/or trf to 3@d but surely a ilmsv bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ianmcc: but not impossible - well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2 Ashok Goel Sudhir Aggrawal Suhas Vaidya|pg||
nt|babs59: the 4S/5H hand went badly for Raju and Ajay (currently 2nd place) at the other table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: when is restart? I need dinner|pg||
nt|babs59: they over-reached to 5S, -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on  15|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 5 Ashok Goel  Suhas Vaidya Siudhir Aggarwal 681|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzjh: director called |pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will win a couple of IMPs in the wash here|pg||
nt|panja: S knows North's shape now...but he does not know where the honours are..|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so this match shud pull them back up |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u after 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I regret the errors in broadcasting |pg||
pc|d8|nt|strike12: but N might get fished by the lead and try something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 R Venkatesh A Srinivasan|pg||
nt|peachy: At least whenever I tried that , I just get more minus.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 round of @h let declarer with no chance|pg||
nt|nkgupt: to much values to miss the slam!!:)|pg||
nt|peachy: South has good controls everywhere so he is going for it|pg||
nt|panja: N could have @CK instead of @HQJ..and the bidding would have been the same|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ianmcc: this needs care|pg||
nt|twcho: how about trump lead and @d shift?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjh: about the explanation of the meaning of 2S now all ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 'slam' effect from last deal perhaps|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good auction for partnership|pg||
nt|peachy: This would have been a working sacrifice, had either N or S been void in clubs|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims 12|pg||
nt|patricck: true, a fairly quiet affair, there were a lot of good ones in the previosu set though, and they are probably saving the best ones for the last set :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: we shall be back after 15 :)|pg||
nt|patricck: OK, see you soon|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzjh: 4 Jaggy Rajesh |pg||
nt|peachy: Surely was not bid to make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh!|pg||
nt|peachy: This is not a great slam, however|pg||
nt|panja: A guessed slam.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sreedhar making inquiries|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mak and Sveta|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all for joining in and look forward to see u after 45 minutes .Tx Andy and TX Sveta |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: quick claim made|pg||
nt|patricck: running the 9@C and then the 8@C plays clubs for one loser, but I don't think declarer will seriously consider it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzjh: Subhsh in deep thought|pg||
nt|panja: N could also play on @H finessed...then ruff two Hearts....that will work too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: a priori about 42/45/5 i wud say|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 42/45%|pg||
