mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|zebutin: or if you are interested on critic towards LOT you could read I Fought the Law of Total Tricks (by Mike Lawrence), those two in compination should give good starting point for that ...|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobholl: imo E hasn't got an overcall but NV defendable :)|pg||
