nt|mrdct: for people struggling with the WBF website i heard they decise to do an "upgrade" today|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: but the mirror site kind of works|pg||

nt|mrdct: i'm told there was a problem with the hand file with brd 1|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|mrdct: and north didn't hold 8 solid @h and a bullet in dummy|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|c3|pc|h8|pg||

nt|gsper:  That went very fast. Didn't declarer have 9 on top at one stage?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i thought so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: conservative pass by north|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s isn't such a bad spot|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: at favourable vul the style by this NS is for weak two could be anything goes so on balance north takes a gamble that south has zippo|pg||

mc|9|nt|mrdct: on the previous board, 3NT-1 is looking quite good for EW as both of the other vugraph tables played in 4@sx-2|pg||
nt|gsper:  A kib points out that on board 2 decl only had 3 @S tricks and thus only 8 in all.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm sorry i have no access to the current standings|pg||
nt|gsper:  Dave knows all about EW. Any information about NS metods?|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|gsper:  This can get expensive for NS if they believe in the Law.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s is better than 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2NT will be asking|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: and 3@s showing 5@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: w has shown 5@s 4@d|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||

nt|mrdct: probably a delay now as some tables are still on the previous round|pg||
nt|mrdct: operator - can we get some standings while we wait for the move?|pg||
nt|mrdct: another melbourne pair NS here :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS are both originally from New Zealand but have moved to Australia|pg||
nt|mrdct: south 2 years ago and north followed about 1 year ago|pg||
nt|mrdct: great additions to the australian youth bridge scene|pg||
nt|gsper:  No.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i predict 2@h EW here|pg||
nt|gsper:  That No was a misdirected private message:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: or possibly 1NT EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: break is ending|pg||
