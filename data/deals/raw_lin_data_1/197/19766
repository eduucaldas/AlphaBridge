nt|veistikke:  or 4@H :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at the bidding any reason to put ace or j of clubs on table? |pg||
nt|henryb:  You are rooting for E-W? You are rooting against N-S? Commentators (imo) are not supposed to let nationalistic or personal biases affect their commenting neutrality|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, a good round for the Norwegian pair. And youthful exuberance is always welcome|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Ty Henry :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I gather they changed the order of play and did seven rounds in the first session instead of the last?|pg||
nt|sybarra: for the specs,  this is pairs, as noted.  3 bds per round |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure Henry |pg||

mc|10|nt|henryb:  North would probably beat 4@h by starting 3 rounds of @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is the Oz club system?   |pg||
nt|henryb:  but he put himself in 500 territory by bidding 2@d|pg||
nt|henryb:  Which one, Shirley? Moscito?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Moscito that is one I was trying to remember name |pg||
nt|babs59: not played very much anymore - played more by the Kiwis|pg||

nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm fairly sure that almost nobody plays that anymore|pg||
nt|babs59: plenty of home-grown systems or modifications of existing systems - the sort of thing not acceptable in the US|pg||
nt|sybarra: I remember commenting it a few years ago,   challenging and wild at same time |pg||
nt|henryb:  Depends on the home-grownedness of the weak openings|pg||
nt|henryb:  We aren't that restrictive on most strong or intermediate actions|pg||
