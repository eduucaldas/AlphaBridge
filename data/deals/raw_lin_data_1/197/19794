mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|rv: I like 3@h rebid by West to show bal 18+ with 4@s and direct 4@s as distributional raise with less values|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|rv: @ST is stand-out and best lead as suggested already by Bob|pg||
nt|rv: even on @ST lead, both declarer and defense will have further opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: horror hand for east to lead from at mps|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S as well as @C make E confortable|pg||

pc|c6|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: that will score very well ew |pg||

nt|rv: even 10 tricks should score approx 60% for E-W|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|roswolf: 6@C would be cute |pg||

nt|roswolf: 1@H|pg||

nt|roswolf: 1@H=@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: BUT too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: East has splinter option available in 2 suits, hence decided to just raise to 3@c and await developments|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: do you have 2 trump queens and 6 aces in this sequence ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead of @SA is logical here|pg||
nt|rv: normally when folks have fit in 2 suits, they play RKC for major even if minor fit was agreed first|pg||
nt|rv: a few others play DKC (double key card blackwood) where there are 6 aces (kings of both suits) and 2 queens|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: Esplin by E|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's 3@S BID HAS PAINTED A PICTURE|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Belive others also would lead @D here, but fatal.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer imo should get the spades right|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: if @cs were 2-2 or even 3-1, declarer could have still have got home inspite of @s misguess by eliminating red suits and losing trick to stiff @SQ, here that line doesn't work|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to guess @s right here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

nt|roswolf: 4@H looks the spot here|pg||

nt|rodal f: wd|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: is this match being telecast on a delayed basis, we seem to have all scores in movie already:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this may be feisty|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rv: don't like East's pass of 1@s with 6 hcp and doubleton @s to boot|pg||
nt|roswolf: the website for the event is http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0219/2011-09-03-foss1.htm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: East @ST is crucial for game, that is only sure entry for taking @h finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: south doubles?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard for NS to come in now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: definitely south being conservative|pg||

nt|rodal f: ?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: the @H9 is a huge card|pg||

nt|rodal f: Small?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: ??????????|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely the 10 was played|pg||
nt|rv: in MPs, it doesn't pay to bid 35-40% games unlike at IMPs where odds favor bidding such games esp if your side is red (Vul)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: sry 11 trikk|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: at MPs, you compete vigorously for part-scores, but don't bid thin games|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless they make of course:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a break before the next round starts!?|pg||
nt|rv: in my view BAM scoring is toughest to play followed by MPs, IMPs is comparatively easier to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is very true|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, you will get a few deals to relax when only OTs/UTs at stake, unlike at MPs and BAM where you can't afford to relax at any moment|pg||
nt|roswolf: in england there is another form of very tough scoring - a combination of BAM + a vp spread based oon total aggregate swing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0219/2011-09-03-foss1.htm |pg||

nt|ssbux: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the competitive bidding starts - where will it stop?|pg||
nt|rv: 2@h by South, East might bid 2@s in balancing seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South has taken a vow of silence|pg||
nt|roswolf: but is westcontemplating something exotic?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east must not get too carried away|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gracelin: Hi SS, close match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ssbux: China team start coming in the middle of the second segment|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's double showed 4+ of spade, and when West bid 3D he denied 3-card spade.  So 3S now is 2-card aalso seeking H stopper for 3NT|pg||
nt|ssbux: Indonesia team found their best denomination but may be 1 level too high|pg||
nt|gracelin: East of course cannot bid 3NT, he will probably pass 3S if he trust his partner's bidding|pg||
nt|gracelin: if East choose the safe 4D, south is waiting there|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might though|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ssbux: as you said|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: West trying to be too cute, he should have passed 2@c|pg||

nt|rv: this should help declarer and West should trot up his contract now|pg||
nt|roswolf: for what it is worth -assuming 4nt natural with extras -east should pass because of the void heart|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: holding this to 8 tricks should be a good score|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: Johnson (North) was possibly afraid of threat of @c suit in dummy, once South returned a @s he should have realised that @cs are bottled-up|pg||

nt|rv: 3n for other side here, more interesting play problem at MPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has various possibilities|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ssbux: 36 imps with 7 boards to go|pg||
nt|gracelin: not much chances for the Indonesian when every result from closed room is nearly optimum|pg||

nt|rv: this deal would be fairly boring at IMPs, holds plenty of promise at MPs|pg||

nt|rodal f: Well bidded|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w brush their opps aside|pg||
nt|geot: Hi, a normal 4@S, making 4 or 5 depending on the spade guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: west should have passed imo|pg||

nt|rodal f: Re hi Geo:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi geo|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|gracelin: I may try 3Nt with the West hand, his hand is very No trump oriented |pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: Hi:) may be tempting to play for the king to drop, but the best way to play the spades isolated is to finesse|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|rv: some folks play West's pass of redouble to show @ds?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|roswolf: and now n/s have found their best contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Hi all.|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand not suitable for defense and I might have bid 2@d instead of passing redouble in earlier round of bidding|pg||
nt|geot: Good lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|geot: only two heart losers in 4@S, the diamond loser should disappear on the clubs |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: south in the jacuzzi|pg||
pc|c8|nt|geot: If declarer takes the club finesse (remember, East made the t/o double) he will go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer imitates the rueful rabbit and bolts for home - great guardian angel|pg||
nt|roswolf: heh!?|pg||
nt|geot: oh well, this is a good one for E/W, for sure|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Bit strange the W @C drop.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|rv: I suspect North will not take another @c finesse:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is x-rated play - the guardian angel should get hazard pay|pg||
nt|geot: I think South was a bit soft, yes. |pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: what!?|pg||
nt|geot: Why would not declarer take another finesse in clubs? |pg||
nt|roswolf: well east would show out|pg||
nt|roswolf: magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: 3 down after d dec risked c- finesse!|pg||
nt|geot: if it was 3 down, declarer must have taken another finesse in clubs early|pg||
nt|geot: can we blame him? the first finesse held, he is playing MP? |pg||
nt|rv: North could have settled for 10 tricks since he already got a bonus trick once opps didn't lead @hs, also @c7 should be suspicious|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the guardian angel got bored it seems - greed doesnt pay - but a double grosvenor coup is a bit special i suppose|pg||
nt|geot: I see your point Venky, but......that is so easy to say when we see West ducked the first club|pg||
nt|rv: another aspect North didn't consider if East had 4@cs, West will have 1 or both 4M and would have bid 1M|pg||
nt|rv: West's pass of redouble is an important aspect for North to consider in play|pg||
nt|rv: in addition to @C7 lead as well as non @h lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think we should draw a veil over that hand to protect the guilty|pg||
nt|rodal f: The pairs playing is....    But miss the result page. http://home.online.no/ svenpran/2011-09-03-foss1.htm?Resultatside=home.online.no%2F svenpran%2F2011-09-03-foss1.htm|pg||

nt|Vugraphzkn: Still Aarebrekk- Uran NS and good old friends from Ski BC EV. :)|pg||
nt|geot: On the last board the 4@D bid was a winner, in a way, but I think North would have passed 3@S.. so it gave South another chance really|pg||
nt|geot: on the other hand, West did not really think N/S was cold for 5@S after this bidding, so 4@D was maybe fair enough...|pg||
