nt|bobholl: hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: i think 2@H might be quite common bid over 1@S with Wests cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|mc|4|nt|zebutin: over 2@S bidding 3@H is somewhat more uncomfortable|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4@H comes in but not biddable except by opening it|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|zebutin: West might bid something with AJ|pg||
nt|zebutin: and after that could blast 4@H/etc...|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: now he will i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: opponents might compete to 4@S, which seems to be 2 down, can see them selling out for 3@S with Easts cards|pg||
mb|4C|nt|zebutin: can = can't|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: partially because of being in nonvul...but maybe thats just me :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: getting to 5@C though isn't good score for E/W, most likely close to being bottom|pg||
nt|bobholl: w can see his @C and @S losers :)|pg||

nt|zebutin: jumping up with @C K wouldn't have been succes...usually bad idea to jump up with Hxx in this situation when declarer plays small towards table without any top cards|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
mc|10|nt|zebutin: Hxx being Axx, Kxx or even Qxx in this situation|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|zebutin: yes, wasn't too difficult this time...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: no support possible i guess|pg||
nt|zebutin: 2@C is agressive bidding, like usual many times in junior games|pg||
nt|bobholl: support doub le i meant :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: yes, support double really popular nowadays, so i'm little surprised they don't play it|pg||
