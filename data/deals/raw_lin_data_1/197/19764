nt|mrdct: hard to avoid 3NT at matchpoints though|pg||
nt|barbyh: the lead of the queen asks for drop of the jack|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT by east will dodge the @c lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: one of the vugraph tables stoped in 3@d so they will earn at least 2 match points|pg||
nt|mrdct: they must be running low on copies of board 25 in this part of the room|pg||
