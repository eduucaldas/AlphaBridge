nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|chrisky: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: good start for dec, he now has 6 tricks as cards are & opps likely to give 7th|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: will likely end with 3@s, 3@c, 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: south certainly can't avoid getting endplayed in the red suits|pg||
nt|psyck: dec will not touch @d on this bidding & S can be endplayed in @h|pg||
nt|athene: zia just has to play hearts early enough to take out north's entry before he has black-suit winners set up|pg||

nt|psyck: *now|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe she is thinking this long? - cash heart must be right, declarer can't have four hearts for the 1nt bid|pg||
nt|athene: cash heart, cash @DK if you want to see for sure, then just exit club, wait for @DKJ|pg||
nt|psyck: if dec has 3@d & 4@c, cashing @hq will still work|pg||

nt|granguru:  defense can get only 3 trump tricks and @CA it seems|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|athene: declarer wants time to get trumps drawn so she can run the spades and throw three clubs from dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: and avoid the club guess|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: will Sabine balance 2@S? she can't really; west still unlimited|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: i suppose you might consider 3@D as you are in the pre-balancing seat, but you think partner has four spades, so maybe there is not so much reason|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: oh hmmm ok i was assuming it would go 1@S 2@S there|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well, this is all very weird|pg||
nt|psyck: this it not the time to rebid xxxxxx instead of bidding Aqxx...|pg||
nt|athene: west just got lucky i think|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: ya must have put black suit values with dec & hence @dA underled|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|psyck: however they land right |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: Sabine really played the king?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Auken did not play the king unless the queen was played from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if that is because she thought declarer would definitely rise queen with Ax in her hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Bridge is too difficult for me if I am to assume that partner has underled an ace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eleni: @h@hwelcome Roland|pg||
nt|athene: so she thought ok, declarer has the jack and partner underled the ace|pg||
nt|chrisky: hi Roland|pg||
nt|athene: in which case, she will be sadder and wiser now |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck: only reason for it one can think of anyway|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: top players might sometimes get wrongfooted assuming people will do the "normal" thing as declarer|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: so if they play against someone very inexperienced, they can look a bit silly on occasion|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|granguru:  specially if 21+|pg||
mb|r|mb|1H|nt|granguru:  here 18 only|pg||
nt|psyck: some use multi for weak major or 17+4441 hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|granguru:  both majors dont split|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|athene: west could have balanced with 1@S or 1NT - if she doubles, she has to bid 1NT over 1@H, i think|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|granguru:  N has to swallow a pretty strong hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|athene: north should be doubling clubs for takeout|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck: 1N would have been my choice assuming 11-15|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: this is the problem with the amorphous redouble - people are scared to double next time because they think it might be penalty|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i doubt martens is exactly scared|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|chrisky: now x@S and n is end played|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: but still, when you have 4441, you really want to double for takeout the minute opps bid your suit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|athene: sorry the minute they bid your singleton|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: it's really a good idea to play "XXX" as it's sometimes called; i.e. even after you show strength, your next double is still for takeout|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o6|st||md|4SQJ7HQTDAQJ8CKQ65,SK4HK64DT6543CJT4,ST6H983DK972C8732,SA98532HAJ752DCA9|sv|e|nt|athene: i guess martens decided it wasn't worth getting involved at this vulnerability with his partner known to be very weak|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|granguru:  well if you were short of opps suit the first time it is hard to have lenght the next round of the same hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: east balances this with a gentle 2@H, and now Sabine can double for takeout, maybe|pg||
nt|eleni: we have all met Spyros Maglaras, our usual operator:) well time to see him in bridge action too:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: i wouldn't want to pass 2@H with the south hand - it's just too likely it gets passed out, which will almost always be bad|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, Martens is right there|pg||
nt|granguru:  well if he does here as well as an operator he should win easily|pg||
nt|athene: obviously a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: martens said sorry after the lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|psyck: he will not be sorry once he sees thy score only -150 instead of a lot more they lose in @h contract|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: one of those situations that a new partnership are going to have trouble with|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW are near 6@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: yes, balancing 2@H is just such a good idea at MP that even when you have a misunderstanding it's not so bad|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|granguru:  so any number of down cant be so bad|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|athene: as well as "double is always takeout" it's good to play "2nt is never natural" :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|granguru:  I said almost 6...only 5 because N overuffs the @S |pg||
pc|s9|pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: looking at it from EW's point of view, this is why you simply can't let people get away with non-vul sacrifices undoubled|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: if you can make anything, you never get enough in 50s|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||

nt|athene: east might have bid 3@H over 3 of a minor, but she would have been told by north that 2nt was minors|pg||
nt|athene: so doesn't realise it's going to get passed out :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: still i bid 3@H..|pg||
nt|granguru:  a good lesson|pg||
nt|athene: there might - *might* - be a case for playing this sort of 2nt as natural if the colours are reversed|pg||
nt|athene: at MP|pg||
nt|granguru:  but even double is a loser action|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|psyck: 3N in practice|pg||
nt|granguru:  3NT seems to be the prefered one|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt on a heart lead - what's the best play in diamonds?|pg||
nt|granguru:  e should bid NT now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even when playing 2/1 you need an agreement as to whether you can reverse with a minimum|pg||
nt|chrisky: and 11 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  @DAKQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a little better than finessing|pg||
nt|psyck: low to T is % in @d|pg||
nt|athene: finesse the @D10 is best for 5 tricks and best for max expectation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The world is divided. Does 2@S show extra values or not|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: 42% according to suitplay.exe|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|athene: but here of course there is the little matter of getting to dummy enough times|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|psyck: entries to be considered though|pg||
nt|athene: you don't know spades are 3-3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|athene: (or @S10 coming down) so must be better to play diamonds from the top|pg||

mc|12|nt|vugraphzjf: a really bad score for N-S|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s does not show extras as i play it, but there are different styles there|pg||
nt|athene: maybe South decided that her partner ought to rise with @CK to clear hearts|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @DQ missed a chance ther e - if you played low, west might cash @CK then underlead diamond hoping for @DQ with pd as entry|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately, no entry for trump finesse|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|psyck: this kills dummy|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: drop the @HK there for entry to finesse trumps then run hearts, but of course, he doesn't want to alert them to the club weakness (he thinks)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: It would not be unreasonable for West to bid 3NT over 2@S and it would have worked well here if North leads a spade. Not so well if a heart is led because you can't take your nine ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: top tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|c7|pc|s4|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: In theory you have 9 tops, but you can't cash them all|pg||
nt|granguru:  Bridge Encyclopedia (p448) AKQxx vs xx 52% from top AKQ10 xxx also 2% better from top than a third round finess. if you have the nine it increases to 54%|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: we had only two boards in this round because of the mistake in the change of the couples|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would be a bit of a gamble - not sure AK109xx counts as a solid suit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course AKQ10x / xx you play from the top, but that is because Jx dropping is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't MP a gamble for a start?|pg||
nt|athene: but AKxxx / Q10 is not at all the same thing|pg||
nt|athene: because if you play from the top you have to crush your own ten|pg||
nt|athene: so Jx dropping does not help you|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think a D after 3@S is ok from w|pg||
nt|granguru:  the 9 makes a difference right|pg||
nt|athene: well dummy did have the 8 on the last trick|pg||
nt|athene: on the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but not sure that changes things enough|pg||
nt|athene: my book only had AKxxx / Q10  or  AK9xx / Q10, didn't mention the 8|pg||
nt|granguru:  a little because of J9 fallling is a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 5 minutes to the next round|pg||
nt|athene: that south hand would be too weak for 2@S for many pairs; depends on methods of course|pg||
nt|psyck: it is the same w/o the 8 Bill|pg||
nt|psyck: 8 does not change the line of the %|pg||
nt|psyck: *or the|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As for AKQ10xx   xxx, a priori, a 4-2 break is more common than 3-3 (48-35%), but odds change when the jack does not fall whan you cash A and K. Then you can eliminate the 4-2 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: breaks with Jx in either hand, and a play for the drop on the thrird round is slightly better than a finesse of the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AKQ10x     xx        I mean|pg||
nt|granguru:  Y Roland but they are right in the sense that being the 10 in the short hand it help less to run the suit without loss|pg||
nt|chrisky: how can you finesse on the third round?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AKJxx     xxxx        go for the drop or finesse?  3-1 break more likely than 2-2 (50-40). Still, odds change when the queen does not drop when you cash one top honour|pg||

nt|athene: actually bid it on that, and opps KNOW you have that, you are basically saying "bid something opps, it is guaranteed to be right"|pg||

pc|h6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: so many good pairs try double-crossing opps, making these single raises with doubleton support and good hand|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: here martens knows that if west has a "normal" 3@S raise, his partner is guaranteed to be short in spades with some useful cards, so double is a lot easier|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe @d5 instead of the beer card to make it clear no @s honor|pg||
nt|chrisky: it is a good play at imps but at mps|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mcphee: if W had just led @S this was going to be a tuff hand for Auken|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  Fantoni Nunes open all two with 9/10-13 points and a 5+ card suit, so opponents cant deduct "it is all right to enter"|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|granguru:  only with both majors they may bid a 1 opening with a "weak" hand, say 11-13|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north decides to maintain a diplomatic silence rather than tell everyone about the distribution|pg||
nt|athene: passed partner, no suit quality - he doesn't think he is winning this auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N is going down|pg||
nt|granguru:  by Law limit I try to say that in competitive auctions with 8 cards you should compete up to 8 tricks(2-level) with 9 cards uptothe 3-level, etc.  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: only 8 tricks on @h lead with opps having 6 before you can enjoy them|pg||
nt|athene: the problem here is the lack of aces on the side|pg||
nt|granguru:  if you open with 5 cards probabilities are that you find 2.66 suport cards in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: when you are in 3nt based on a long suit, you really want "hard" side tricks|pg||
nt|athene: one ace is more use than KQJ10|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have their suit all dressed up and ready to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: the good thing about aces, is they prevent the opps from having a quick entry to the suit the establish|pg||
nt|athene: well the good thing is they are a trick which you don't need to lose the lead to establish|pg||
nt|athene: EW have @DKQJ and @SKQ and they are no use at all|pg||

nt|mcphee: well lets talk about your erros so we can avoid discussing mine:)|pg||
nt|mathat: sabina bid 3 @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: we will have to wait about half an hour to see if Zia and Sinclair managed to keep their advantage from yesterday|pg||
nt|mcphee: well most play after weak 2, 3 of the suit asks stop to try 3N|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps not most, many better wording|pg||
nt|mathat: 3@s is 3 suit |pg||
nt|psyck: Results will be added here later: http://www.hellasbridge.org/apotelesmata/club/13|pg||
nt|athene: many specs are saying south should bid clubs second time rather than 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course, we can see it's better|pg||
nt|athene: but there are many hands north might have with, say, two hearts, where you score more in 4@H than 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: you can't bid 4@C to offer the choice because that isn't forcing|pg||
nt|athene: and you have way too much playing strength|pg||
nt|athene: even when partner has only one heart, 4@H will often be fine|pg||
nt|athene: it's just that it isn't here|pg||
nt|mathat: martens dbl promises 1005 other color|pg||
