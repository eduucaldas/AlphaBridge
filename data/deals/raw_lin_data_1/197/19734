nt|vugraphzjh: pls see the weblink as above |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|dslee: thanks mak|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sunit thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: It is rare that 2C is passed,  2C can be a big hand, just short of a jumpshift or 2NT bid as it was here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzjh: pls check scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  with an opening hand and 3@d, 2N is a bit of an underbid but E was able to raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders have changed now it is Jaggy and Dalal|pg||
nt|patricck: The difference of 416 can really be divided by 13 because each score is matched with every one of the other 13 tables, so it is like being about 32 imps behind the leaders|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nkgupt: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi welcome NK|pg||
nt|dslee: none of these folks except sunit is very spontenous - i wonder why this bid happened|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is headed for 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: oh yes, sorry typo, already said 9 earlier|pg||
nt|patricck: 20 points each|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ianmcc: looks like -100, with care|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi in long trance |pg||
nt|nkgupt: did not understand seeking pd's opinion and then overrule him :)|pg||
nt|patricck: which I guess is why West doubled, but wasn't he fortunate to find that  both the AK of @S were in the South hand?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: av sud be about 120 to N so 5@sX-1 translates to about -65/70|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dslee: well there you see|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Anal Shah has been two times Commonwealth Teams winner|pg||
pc|d7|nt|strike12: we have every round updates at the above link, so keep urself posted |pg||
nt|dslee: difficult to crack|pg||
nt|dslee: -1|pg||
nt|animeshraj: becoz 6S . should come with HA.J sort of|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  how high would they stop? even grand is makeable|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|patricck: 2 spades and 2 trump losers unless declarer is a genius|pg||
nt|patricck: 2 spade losers and 2 heart losers on the face of it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 7 claimed|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gm all.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzjh: After this round will be lunch break and we shall be back at 1345 i.e. after 1 hr 45 minutes |pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT probably would also have been 1 light|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ianmcc: 10 should score well continuing clubs pays off|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, this certainly is safe enough|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  but to bid it, E has to imagine exactly such a hand by partner - with long side suit|pg||
nt|peachy: W needs to have control of the auction, E described his in opening and then 3S, I assume|pg||
nt|peachy: This is still makeable if declarer is careful|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psridhar: Anil will lose 2@h and 4 trumps for d1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi makarand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzjh: hello again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT was possible, not 5@c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: one of the flatest i suppose 4@h-1 all round?|pg||
nt|patricck: can be hard to guess the average on a board like this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: or has X-ray eyes :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|babs59: placed currently 4th and 22nd|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|psridhar: RV in lead still?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|babs59: but only 9 ahead of Ashok Goel trio|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a matter of overtricks only|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|strike12: if S can steal a @c trick he could had made 11 |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: looong way to go|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|strike12: too late nw|pg||
nt|babs59: I must admit to being somewhat unfamiliar with Invititational Pairs where threesomes play!|pg||
nt|psridhar: now even d2 ? kind of dummy reversal defense with long trump taking two ruffs?|pg||
nt|babs59: seems that way now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: venky in a trance|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: the J@H led from hand would have lost only one trump trick, but it only works on this layout and gives up on West holding Q10xx|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ianmcc: nice exit|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome |pg||
nt|patricck: I am told the difference is 330 imps, as the website is a round behind, so Gupta and Venky are effectively about 25 imps behind the leaders|pg||

nt|animeshraj: I THINK 1nt-2d-2h-3h-3nt...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S look to be OK in 4@s|pg||

mb|2S|nt|andyv:  with Aces and Kings, 1@h might have been a better choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: nothing much will make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: So the lower N/S stop the better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS aren't strong enough to reach the game but EW may push them|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S might be a pre-blocking bid|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ah! there u go.|pg||
nt|patricck: should just reach a club partscore here|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: the page is still to be updated|pg||

nt|sga1: Scores are available till last round on this website :  http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d expensive|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 1@c-1@s-2@c-4@s-5@c now N wud hav had his word in @s and free to X now|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT by West probably would have made, but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|nkgupt: kb surely not passing 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he is dep in thought|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|nkgupt: he hasnt come all the way from home to pass:)|pg||

nt|strike12: do we have the current results after round 8 Mak?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to X|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can do quite well in hearts but not so easy to come into the auction|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ianmcc: losing 1 in each suit. average|pg||

nt|nkgupt: other table bidding brd 2 on almost anticipated line for std ew:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: brd|pg||
nt|patricck: probably 0 or 2 higher lead. That is going to help declarer more than the defence|pg||

nt|ianmcc: will make 90|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  E will get his 4 tricks and that seems to be it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: in the air|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may anticipate difficulties with rebid after 1@h opening, but this time both 1NT and @h partscore -  no play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not much worse in NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  true as to play of hand...and 1N usually fine with a 5 card major...here, however, the major is top heavy and the outside points are in Aces...those cards belong in a suit contract.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ianmcc: maybe not a @d|pg||
nt|patricck: that is the end of the defence|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzjh: the running scores can be seen on the link http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: he then has 8 ?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|strike12: @s 10 vital card|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a correct guess in diamonds probably brings 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting position appears after 6 @h tricks, let's see|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: about 15 kibitzers around the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Rajesh dep in thought|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjh: all smiling on the table |pg||
nt|babs59: yes - I had the hearts inverted in my mind (defensive hearts)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|patricck: oops|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ianmcc: yes 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  costly switch by S|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: that misguess however spells doom|pg||

pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  or so may be the case - playing W not to have last spade |pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer is taking a line that will allow making.  Ordinarily 5-3 fit in trump contract is preferred, but with enough for game+, NT often better|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: both pairs playing some variations of precision|pg||
nt|psridhar: JM wasnt tested in other room|pg||
nt|peachy: E might have played the last spade when he was in with a diamond|pg||
nt|peachy: And declarer might not have pulled 2 trumps|pg||
nt|peachy: \|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as usually, a game of errors|pg||
nt|peachy: 6-3|pg||
nt|panja: y, N hand is worth way about 21 HCP|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably 3NT N/S and not good|pg||
nt|ianmcc: when is next|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u in 15 minutes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u after 15 minutes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: sif they lead 4th besst South should play @hQ at trick1|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: I think that will be some imps in there for making 3NT, much harder on a heart lead|pg||
nt|patricck: both sides can make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: For running scores please visit http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sandip is multiple Ruia Gold Cup winner |pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: Sunit 's first seat preempts are not bonded by Llyods of London :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 4@H will need careful handling|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be a snacks break and the next match would start at IST 1745 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: alerted|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good stuff where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: @h6 is a powerful card after j7 drops|pg||
mb|1S|nt|strike12: a big pickup for NS as they gain in terms of Total Imps|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N made good decision - knowing partner has good @h fit, N sees 6 tricks in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, so declarer gets 2 hearts 2 clubs 3 diamonds and a spade before EW get 3 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|patricck: hard to know about the first board, but that was definitely a few imps for EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: another trouble hand, but not big trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N balanced in passout seat over 1N, E dbld and W played in 2@d, making|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@C Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: W might just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: that puts Arun in a fix|pg||
nt|ianmcc: noone told Anil Padhy|pg||
nt|peachy: Was fortunate they had the agreement to show max with good supp|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: Isn't this pairs?|pg||
nt|panja: 25 HCP..this should be a routine game..10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this foursome have played for INdia so many times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome back |pg||
nt|sga1: 1@C - 17+, dbl 5-7 HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can have two heart tricks, I believe a heart lead from east is awkward too|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: it is IMP pairs |pg||
nt|strike12: 6@s is on if bid|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not familiar with NS system, sorry|pg||
nt|peachy: Standard, with transfers over 1C opening, I was told|pg||
nt|peachy: If anyone interested to see what K & R hand evaluator says about it, here http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@hX -1 or -2 looks about right|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 1@H is a transfer style response|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: The Pair of A Goel and Suhas Vaidya will be playing for Indian in this BB|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: This will be costly for EW|pg||

nt|ianmcc: OK tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: total 28 contestanting pairs |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all play all each pair plays 6 boards against each other barometer|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Modified Precision|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N opens with the end-contract possible, but both sides here have to tell something|pg||
pc|d4|nt|strike12: is N still thinking for a Save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could go down 4|pg||
nt|panja: if W gets to underlead the @CA sometime..it could get interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should duck this|pg||
nt|patricck: takeout double from Soth?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: and pass from North|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: but success!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|andyv:  I mean N|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psridhar: Anil knows it alright-but his 5@d was calculated to test Arun -he knows he has long @s|pg||

nt|psridhar: +300|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ianmcc: bad bad|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzjh: the game is tooo fast to make all explanations of alerted bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: It is no problem, Mak.  Let me quote somebody: Operator is like a long tailed cat in a small room of rocking chairs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|babs59: hi Ian.  Kiran had to find the lead of a small Diamond|pg||
nt|nkgupt: but is a good save:)|pg||
nt|patricck: it is true eats woud have to pitch a heart if declarer started with two rounds of clubs vs 3NT on a heart lead, but what declarer would cash 2 club tricks at the start of that ...|pg||
nt|patricck: hand?|pg||
nt|patricck: ah yes I said both sides make 11 tricks, but I was wrong, the @D ruff holds spades to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: South was planning on bidding spades twice before bidding @H|pg||
nt|patricck: the transfer response means South is playing this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 H was transfer positive response|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that pull to 2@s never crossed my mind i must admit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: could have been lucrative, but it went so quickly it seemed North wasn't even slightly interested in defending|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzjh: ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after a long thought|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  the best way - try to reach the table with @s|pg||
nt|sga1: seems like 4 losers 2@d, 1@h and 1@c|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: about 20hcp each ...odd breaks vul opps only 7@s per say cant see a logic for the pull|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: Club lead, or club now, will give declarer plenty trouble making|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: wrong guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now the roof falls in|pg||
nt|psridhar: plenty of tricks , can make for sure |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  got this experience few times (fortunately) commentator's job looks better :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he might make if he doesn't touch hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: of course Subhash could make but only if he flies the DK immediately|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: the black suits were lying quite well for declarer and he still wouldn't have been close to making 2@H|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and dont expect dummy to turn up w/ good @hs (afterall just 4/5 hcp there at most) do well placed 5@h's|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nkgupt: so well...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes sorry my fault|pg||
nt|psridhar: np|pg||
nt|psridhar: tough job|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think 5@s quite wrong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: cant be |pg||
nt|psridhar: @d king for @h pitch|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  in mp, you have to be...but in teams, best contract wins most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claim|pg||
nt|patricck: After the duck if Declarer had foolishly played a 2nd trump then a 3rd trump would have trapped him in dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West will be endplayed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi sees it ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: in a trance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  troubles are over now |pg||
nt|panja: @D9, what else now?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|peachy: Kib says Raju not yet awake :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Raju =  E|pg||
nt|panja: and a Club after that...from W....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ianmcc: will be -200 - could have done better|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is easy to be careless on such hands|pg||
nt|patricck: maybe they recently conceded -670 in another match, you would have thought at least it was worth considering the pass|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|babs59: would I fly the DK?  I doubt it - but I would wonder why they'd led dummy's suit (such a lead is usually a singleton)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims 10|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: South decided to try sqz|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if so you are dead anyway|pg||
nt|babs59: however, everyone at this table knows each other's game and style very well, so it might depend on that|pg||
nt|nkgupt: was a 99.99999% pass for me|pg||
nt|patricck: not sure of the exact percentage for me, but something close to that :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|buddyshah: trying 11 |pg||
nt|peachy: He has contract made of course, just for the 11th|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|strike12: NS will pare all gains earned before on this deal |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: amarnath in a pause|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Mrs Nadar played the hand for 11 on a squeeze ;)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|nt|strike12: -2 would had been par score|pg||
nt|nkgupt: ok 99.99998% i wud agree to|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nkgupt: hi panja.makrand/ll|pg||
nt|panja: of course, against careful defenders...this is not a choice for the Declarer..|pg||

pc|s3|pg||

nt|psridhar: but if he tries @h to queen....|pg||

nt|babs59: cashing spades will put pressure on West hand, but may give useful information via North's discards?|pg||
nt|babs59: oops, I took too long (rare)|pg||

nt|ianmcc: 4@h for N/S|pg||
nt|nkgupt: adv brd 26/equaled in 27:)|pg||
nt|patricck: this won't be the only table to score 5@H doubled I am sure, but still a very good board for EW|pg||
nt|patricck: that should be flat across the room|pg||
nt|nkgupt: tnt wise 7@s+7+@h=14+tricks if u can make 8 tricks they make 6 and if u r -1 they r -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: should be an easy 3 NT due to favourable locations of @SJ and @CA|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: can NS find 3N here?|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be the lunch break and next match will start at 1400 Hrs IST i.e about an hr from now|pg||
nt|babs59: Kiran and Satya play transfer responses to 1C, so this shows spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: this one interesting Little for anyone|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opponents are guessing and the 5-level too expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: but She has played for India in BB several times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: in the open catagory |pg||
nt|peachy: Hearts play remarkably well|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: subhash writing explanation|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzjh: pls visit http://royale.hpage.com for running scores |pg||
nt|babs59: it might go 1H  1S  2D  P?|pg||

nt|panja: this must be @H and @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Venky explaing to Sreedhar subhasgh 2S|pg||
nt|peachy: 4D could fit jump apparently, promising nice diamonds _ heart fit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: counting carefully I see 5@c should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: Kokish relay on 2@c going on here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@c was an underbid, lucky|pg||
nt|ianmcc: perhaps they will reach 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggi  + Dalal|pg||
mb|2C|nt|strike12: undo pls|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - he's more likely to downgrade than upgrade that hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing small @h E expectes exactly the @hK, Ace could have been better, as for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hut off!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|babs59: and 2D could be on a 3532 hand shape too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N played by Subhash may be in trouble on @s lead|pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.com/ website with info and results after Round 9|pg||
nt|babs59: that North hand is remarkably similar to Kiran's hand last board!|pg||
nt|patricck: this will be difficult to make on a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: certainly not 5@d|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner's strength is unknown and the decn to bid 5@s is making an unwarranted assumption tht they can make and we shd save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@d better|pg||
nt|babs59: 2D by Subhash won't pose any difficulties tho|pg||
nt|panja: this will be difficult..|pg||
nt|patricck: @C offside and @S onside, with one pitch forom the diamonds there should be 10 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: North has a beautiful hand in this auction, the auction made it even beter than it initially is|pg||

nt|peachy: Playing Precision, N might not be sure of South's diamond length though|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  bloody rain|pg||
pc|h8|nt|panja: hi Pramod, all|pg||
nt|panja: 7@D better than 7Nt here..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi this is Makarand ;)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N could be hardly blamed for this opening lead|pg||
nt|sga1: Heading towards 6NT|pg||
nt|sga1: He will bid 5NT, choose lsam or can be 6NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psridhar: on correct defense yes they can beat it by 1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not enough entries |pg||
nt|sga1: slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: now seems to be doomed after H lead |pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: or, rather, 7@S..|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@S cue, he has assumed @D as cue in support of @Cs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jeetu in a trance|pg||
nt|patricck: praying for a singleton Q@C, things wer ethat desperate|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nkgupt: n    |pg||
nt|panja: and the play will go...remove trumps, ruff a Club...cash last trump discarding Dummy @S, and then @HAK..black suit squeeze if @S don't break|pg||
nt|twcho: 7@d is probably the best contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  was it @sK indeed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can only imagine S's desperation|pg||
pc|hA|nt|patricck: were that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: with squeeze possibility|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm still looking to understand why K might have worked/under what circumstances|pg||
nt|peachy: Good play, tring to make and if the 8 didnt work, didnt matter because it was going down anyway without it|pg||
nt|babs59: the club at trick 2 was a tidy play, despite the CA offside|pg||
nt|sga1: 1-4 key card assuming @C as suit|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sga1: Ashok finally makes the bid.|pg||

nt|psridhar: for eg RHo wins King and continues @d ?|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|babs59: would you dream of opening 2@D as West?|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: whatever, it seems to have left plenty of room to find the slam easily!|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: two more boards for the match |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S may be hard to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: next match is leaders Subhash Gupta and Venky Vs KIran and Satya |pg||
nt|sga1: If S opens the hand, then may reach|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: usual team mates |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggy has finished his set and passing bye the home game ;)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: even after the first @h play this hand could still be made...@d to hand and a @s towards dummy and eventually endplay S with the 3rd trump...as per junaid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last two boards for the day . |pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure there is some discussion about whether South should have ducked the A@C :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: sorry for last seven rounds |pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|strike12: yes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: North/south better silent here|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS dont have values for 3N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think @d9 promotes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably about 95% responsible for that disaster|pg||
nt|sga1: As per latest running scores, Raju Tolani and Ajay Khare have overtaken Subhash - Venky|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, thats better, pass then 1C, 1s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: to open S or not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html is the exact webpage for running scores |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for E/W but not in clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: X looks brave - will he pass 5@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya in a trance|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
nt|peachy: East hand is much too good for any sort of premptive action, 1S is normal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: where are the present pairs running?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all scores may be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@d shows hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tomorrow the tourney starts at 9 AM IST |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|sga1: Transfers in Intervention - a good tool|pg||
nt|sga1: Now slam chances with aggressive bidding by S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too hard for the elderly|pg||
nt|babs59: pick a slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: is this Match Points or IMPS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd suggest 2@s bid by W|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S can make 3 of a major amd EW can make 4 of a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I thank on behalf of the Sponsers and Organisers BBO and BFI for allowing this transmission|pg||
mb|6C|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C might be transfer, in competition|pg||
nt|peachy: transfer to 2D, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was alerted by Satya |pg||
nt|sga1: Now 5@c cue should take them to slam|pg||
nt|patricck: Sorry, table collapsed there for a moment.... presume players are just picking the cards up off the floor and reorganising :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board?  yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  low level bid and acceptable doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: one more after this |pg||
nt|babs59: now 6D by Satya, and 6H by Kiran|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: IMPS Total|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@H showing 4+ @s, 1NT - denies 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 6 boards per rd, Total IMPs scoring (Pairs)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D will go one down for sure...two likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: trying to correct the score of last deal|pg||
nt|panja: W is taking a huge gamble with that double, holding five of his HCP in @H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opportunity lost|pg||
nt|sga1: you never know, S may carry on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good sequence|pg||
nt|patricck: Any other vulnerability it would have been Ok to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|patricck: Thank you for operating the Vu Graph :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: The slam looks easy on any lead |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
nt|panja: ah..the lead solves one big problem for the Declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: He is following the pronciple that the person short in their fit suit must be aggressive, but I'm sure he too wishes his 5HCP in hearts were in another suit :)|pg||
nt|peachy: *principle|pg||
pc|s7|nt|panja: GIB might show this as one down...but will likely be -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  only  point of interest on this hand is if N can guess the @hs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly without the lightner it is easier to beat slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S would have shown a small profit for NS -500 instead of -620|pg||
nt|patricck: North will eliminate the spades and diamonds and then run the J@C for an endplay, but as one of the club honours is onside the endplay will have been unnecessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome :) and I thank you all commentetors for bearing with my errors and undos :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|babs59: and board 1 reflects that policy too|pg||

nt|patricck: ty|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ianmcc: 1NT gets him into @h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: rt|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must like to live dangerously....leaving the dbl in is not to be recommended to the faint of heart|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA, @dA, @d ruff, @h finesse, @d ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ianmcc: it will be North who carries on|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: quick work by Anand to claim after cross ruffing and finally playing a spade to K|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|panja: if East is smart enough to bring in Clubs to discard a loser...it will be -1...|pg||
nt|panja: but he does not know @C are 33...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: a@c lead shd do|pg||
nt|ianmcc: in reality I'd say hopeless|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: any other lead makes -at least dbl dummy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i mean any lead other than @c lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sga1: S after very aggressive bidding didn't cur his singleton @c the most imp information for N|pg||
nt|sga1: cue|pg||

nt|sga1: I wud say Lucky for Satya-Kiran|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzjh: Raju Ajay in discussion about the board how to get to 6 after 4H open|pg||
nt|peachy: He has club losers no matter what, might as well try it as he does|pg||

nt|babs59: Venky has a great hand opposite Majors|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is Drury...@H fit...|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: yes min 4card as announced|pg||
nt|twcho: north could double|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some X|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: pity the splinters are the same suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sunit has gr8 support for @d too -but 500 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so Rajesh after exlaation took his bid back |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, he doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders before this round are |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should N bid better minor this time? I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S Gupta Venky are current leaders|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should S introduce 6th- heart or 3-cards @s support - a problem indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Aah, we get to watch the leaders next round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 12 tricks here...with @S 32..and @C finesse in|pg||
nt|sga1: Satya showing one @s honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggy Dalal 1313|pg||
nt|sga1: 6@c - Zero|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: again explanations been written down|pg||
nt|patricck: a moderate slam which can make with the @CQx onside|pg||
nt|patricck: one of  Bob Hamman's Bols Tips was always concentrate extra hanrd on the first board of a set and the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: it is not a good slam to bid...with @D values, most of them, wasted|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: too many|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the results have been posted on the Results link on webpage http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: at the bottom of the page there is a hyperlink to results |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing ordinary 1NTF, North's rebid is 2C|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzjh: inquiry from declerer about the lead |pg||
nt|strike12: 10 tricks now |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing support doubles, the decision is pretty easy = Dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  N good enough to bid 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2Raju Tolani Ajay Khare 1186|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 Subhash Gupta Venky 1036|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was a chance|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzjh: Ajay thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the rare exception when it could only be 2-card suit, normally longer minor or 2C with 3-3 minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a bid by S!|pg||
nt|peachy: South's bid is much too frisky, given their methods, but he is probably attempting to get something back from the unfortunate -930.  I dont like that strategy though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder what was the reason|pg||
nt|peachy: But that is an "if" because I dont know if they have Support Dbl on card|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and with @c shortness the choice could be dbl|pg||
nt|panja: similarly, @H values in N hand are wasted...|pg||
nt|patricck: Partner didn't double 6@C so South shouldn't be tempted to lay down the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: crowd gathering around the table|pg||
nt|nkgupt: MrSG must be baffled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he is sitting with crossed hands deep in thought|pg||
nt|nkgupt: i suppose a save in 6@h coming:)|pg||
nt|patricck: 8@H?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|nkgupt: dont think 4@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and to win it - an easy deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: transfer?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he shrugs and passes |pg||
pc|sA|nt|babs59: thanks Makulky - seems the top 3 just keep shifting around :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@H  sorry typo|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3 level toxic|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 VM lal Bhiwandkar 980|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last deal of the match |pg||
nt|patricck: mind you declarer can go wrong in trumps, small to the K@C works when the @CAx on side and also @CAxx, bit not against @CAQx so finessing against the queen is better by a few ...|pg||
nt|patricck: percent|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: nothing much exciting in the set :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: North over the top|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Subhash Gupta + Venky |pg||
nt|nkgupt: fit jump/nfj/or trf to 3@d but surely a ilmsv bid|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but not impossible - well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2 Ashok Goel Sudhir Aggrawal Suhas Vaidya|pg||
nt|babs59: the 4S/5H hand went badly for Raju and Ajay (currently 2nd place) at the other table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: when is restart? I need dinner|pg||
nt|babs59: they over-reached to 5S, -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on  15|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 5 Ashok Goel  Suhas Vaidya Siudhir Aggarwal 681|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzjh: director called |pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will win a couple of IMPs in the wash here|pg||
nt|panja: S knows North's shape now...but he does not know where the honours are..|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzjh: so this match shud pull them back up |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u after 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I regret the errors in broadcasting |pg||
pc|sK|nt|strike12: but N might get fished by the lead and try something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 R Venkatesh A Srinivasan|pg||
nt|peachy: At least whenever I tried that , I just get more minus.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 round of @h let declarer with no chance|pg||
nt|nkgupt: to much values to miss the slam!!:)|pg||
nt|peachy: South has good controls everywhere so he is going for it|pg||
nt|panja: N could have @CK instead of @HQJ..and the bidding would have been the same|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this needs care|pg||
nt|twcho: how about trump lead and @d shift?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzjh: about the explanation of the meaning of 2S now all ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 'slam' effect from last deal perhaps|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good auction for partnership|pg||
nt|peachy: This would have been a working sacrifice, had either N or S been void in clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzjh: claims 12|pg||
nt|patricck: true, a fairly quiet affair, there were a lot of good ones in the previosu set though, and they are probably saving the best ones for the last set :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: we shall be back after 15 :)|pg||
nt|patricck: OK, see you soon|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzjh: 4 Jaggy Rajesh |pg||
nt|peachy: Surely was not bid to make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh!|pg||
nt|peachy: This is not a great slam, however|pg||
nt|panja: A guessed slam.....|pg||
