mb|2N|nt|april7: if N doesn't finesse for the Q ofcourse|pg||

nt|warrens:  Hi Henry. On Board 14, East needed to consider exiting with the club 10, don't you think?  His play was right with stiff J or 5, but wrong with stiff 8 or 9.|pg||
nt|warrens:  whoops, meant that as private.  Hi all.|pg||
nt|henryb:  since 7@d is off an ace, it was not among the contracts I was considering|pg||
nt|bobholl: it was a good remark anyway :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  thanks, Bob.  :)|pg||
