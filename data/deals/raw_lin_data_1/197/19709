nt|mdgraham: last segment of this semi-final, and a close match|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  no multi apparently|pg||
nt|kakashi84: DBL is minor 5 and 4 in major|pg||
mb|d|nt|ricky86: hi all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  N has a 3@d bid available for lead directional purposes|pg||
nt|andyv:  E dbl is responsive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Woolsey convention, also known as Multi-Landy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolsey_(convention)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The modern trend is to open the North hand 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2-2 in the majors and a 6-card minor not unusual nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's fine with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I have also seen it misused|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hop still thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either he passes or doubles, but it should not take that long|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You there Giusy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TD has been summoned I am told|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: For what we don't know yet|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ricky86: welcome to this 2nd session of quarter final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1NT is presumably some sort of conventional bid|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||

nt|wboer: EW are overboard now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ugis: hello everyone |pg||
nt|MolvaM: welcome ugis jansons|pg||
nt|ugis: 4h is a sensible contract, but the actual trump split will not make declarer happy|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ricky86: aggressive bid just to start|pg||
nt|kakashi84: 10 for ned juniors|pg||

nt|athene: but east had denied any heart fit at all|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should just lead a safer diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 4@H looks like the go here with a bonud for picking the @HQ|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidstern: Neither EW have anything to disturb the opponents from getting there|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: @H against @S as soo often abd @S will gain i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: and|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: tricky problem now for north|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you scramble  with 2@H and hope to come out alive|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|athene: east might pass this|pg||
nt|athene: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: south might pass this|pg||
nt|athene: seeing "wackwitz E" is confusing :) he isn't east!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|davidstern: I am "guessing" that 3@C showed normal opening and 3@D showed shortage|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: if you are going to bid on, i prefer something other than 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south's problem is that anything sounds constructive|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2nt or 3@C sound MORE constructive|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: 2@S possible i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: in BAM missing a game is not that bad but i guess they will loose at this one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|athene: always hard when your best fit is in the fourth suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobholl: very brave switch :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davidstern: Making six in another match (as shown on screen) seems like a very good score for somebody|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|davidstern: Got a club lead and picked hearts throwing the losing spade on the 13th club  - voila easy game|pg||
nt|davidstern: As noted West opened the bidding (certainly not my taste) leading declarer to take the finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: In fact it would take some serious threat to make me open the West hand even as a youth player|pg||
nt|davidstern: And I guess the result is a good indication of why it isnt such a good idea|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: referee at the table, the player had said the gap with spades, then changed the club|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: he doesn't have to play on @C any more but trying :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|c3|nt|davidstern: I am guessing VG may not be a bridge player referring to the director as referee|pg||

nt|athene: interesting hand here|pg||
nt|ugis: 1h from W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: !|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  this can make 3NT EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: this slæam is better :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Weak 2 or 5/4+?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C for NS - will EW sac with two aces?|pg||
nt|ugis: now S will bid hearts :)|pg||
nt|ugis: on actual layout NS can make 6d|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ricky86: of course :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing hearts i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: and that will not delight south|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think i would want to stress the hearts with north|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: is 4@H now a cue bid or re-transfer?|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 5@s-4+ in a minor 5-10hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is practical bridge, I'm all for that|pg||
nt|athene: he has more a balanced hand with scattered strength, than a heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: but i imagine 1nt was not available (probably showed clubs)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hajru:  This will probably end in 3N, making |pg||
nt|mdgraham: always depressing to see partner pass as delaer when all you hold is three jacks |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: raising clubs might work well now|pg||
nt|athene: people rarely do that, though, in this day and age|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  2@d is GF checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: maybe re transfer|pg||
nt|athene: :(|pg||
nt|athene: well north will go 4@C or 4@S now|pg||
nt|athene: *south sorry|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will NOT cover @D10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: chioces would seem to be 2NT or 3@c  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: east thinking about a diamond sac?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@h??|pg||
nt|ricky86: 5@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: Good lead. @cK and @s switch is diff for decl|pg||
nt|athene: takes a club lead to beat 6@S i guess?|pg||
nt|wboer: It's a deep view by S not converting 2@h to 2@s or 3@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: This is the last round in the Swiss - 8 best to KO - Japan no 7 with 152 and Australia 1 + 2 + France No 8 with 145|pg||
nt|athene: stops declarer cashing one spade then finessing|pg||
nt|athene: because you don't have the entry to dummy when you need it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: If Poulat has one more to play, diamonds are 4-3 and no worries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a duck caters for a 5-2 split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2nT presumably denies three spades, and also four hearts|pg||
nt|hajru:  I think so.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi all pictures from Opatija http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143 !/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: if S knew which correction to make, probably he would:)|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|wboer: After @sJ defense had the tempo to develop 5th trich by playing @c|pg||
nt|wboer: At least he could try for a correction.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|nt|ricky86: declarer doesn't have problem to maintain this contract.. +1|pg||

nt|bobholl: but is only 1 point (BAM)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I should point out that the tables are not linked despite there showing a result from the other room. The Other room in this case are not team mates|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: there was a case for east ducking the spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not clearcut but these tricks often come back|pg||
nt|davidstern: Thanks to our host I am informed: TD and a referee is the same in English, because there is only one word for both in Italian|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: do we know if 2@H promises specifically black suits? or could it be spades and diamonds as well?|pg||
nt|athene: unless 4@H is very narrowly defined it doesn't really help EW|pg||
nt|athene: the point is, you know south is going to bid 4@S over it, every hand|pg||
nt|athene: so|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I am not a big fam of the 3NT rather than a simple 2@C bid unless their system doesnt allow it. |pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: if it might be very weak, west just has to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: west will "know" it is @C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but then east is committed to bidding 5@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|davidstern: Best lead by West which probably wouldnt have happened had South bid 2@C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: declarer was going to have a lot of trouble getting to hand in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: @HA lead and it doesn't look so easy|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|athene: 5@H was certainly very weird|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|davidstern: South Has 4-4-1-1 tricks so perhaps should have taken the second club hoping to manufacture an 11th trick|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|athene: i thought west just had a choice between pass and double|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome to lovely opatija|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we are having some of the warmest days of the year|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont disagree, but certainly 2H might be the right spot....for example if N has:   x   QJT9xx   xx   Kxxx|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: no comments please.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 5 IMP - in B2 EW stopped in 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess he was playing for e to be 5/5 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|athene: now if it goes 1@S - 1NT from EW, south can't really double, as that is t/o of spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: 5@c = min, 5@D = 1/4, 5@H = 0/3, 5@s = 2+@sq + tx Wubbo|pg||
nt|wboer: Ofcourse 2@h could be the right spot, but not likely. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: ty :)|pg||
nt|ugis: once again NS can reach 6 diamonds, only that this time it is down 1 after spade ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: but the @dQ holds the trick so east had the @dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT? looks odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will pass and Lebatteux can't really bid again|pg||
nt|athene: north can bid 2@D now |pg||
nt|hajru:  I think they play Gazilli (1M-1N-2@c) for strong balanced hands, freeing up 1M-1N-2N for special hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told Gazzilli, strong 5/5....thanks|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess N will bid 3@c and S will specifiy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D or 2NT in S being non-vul or pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wecan see that 2NT is makeable, but there is a risk that declarer goes wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the question is not really "does 2H rate to be the best spot?" but rather "which is more likely to be best: 2H or whichever correction i will choose?" the fact that 2H is less ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to be right than the BETTER choice of corrections  doesnt automatically make pass the wrong bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has an interesting decision over 2H|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has decisions now|pg||
nt|ugis: will N bid over 3nt? if S bids 3nt :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hajru:  4@c cuebid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would not be good to get to slam here |pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: Opatija fotos http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
nt|wboer: some partnerships play 2NT as good/bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has to guess which finesse to take, and if he chooses spades, he must guess who has A and Q|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: i think this is a bit of a sucker double from south in fact|pg||
nt|athene: north clearly has a hand too weak to raise diamonds over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and that is a very weak hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|athene: say, 2 points or so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might well beat 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not a sure thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the straightforward bid, but 2H could also be effective, with the plan of bidding 4D if partner  bids 3N at some point|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wboer: 2NT in S for the minors was not poss, because west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: your spades are not exactly well-placed|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would get the idea of promary diamond support across while emphasizing hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|andyv:  E can create some opportunities by playing the A@s and @s|pg||
nt|kakashi84: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: and east didn't have to bid 2nt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: I am impressed if he gets this right|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here is looks as if 4N was RKC. many top class pairs use a different call than 4N for KC in the minors, because there is insufficient space between 4N and 5 of the trump suit. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: various forms of this method ar e called "kickback" or "redwood" or other labels. it is a very good idea in principle, but it is essential to have firm agreements on which call is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: KC and WHEN that call is KC|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ugis: they did indeed bid 6d in open room, so France will almost tie the match after board 17|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  on 3rd @s, N will ruff with K@h and finesse for Q|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is a very good example of what s.j. simon talks about in his book|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy 11 tricks - should be flat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has extra offense and extra defense for a 4H bid. should he do something other than 4H to start with(eg 3S)? or should he bid 4H then double later to show extrras (if that is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: their agreement)?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: "why you lose at bridge"|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Wubbo de Boer, world champion 1992|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: he gives a hand almost exactly like this|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  E not aware of hand's potential|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1993, sry|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|wboer: So good/bad 2NT in west meaning a compatative weak 3@c bid with 6-card suit. 3@c in stead off 2NT = 14-16 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If hearts are 5-2, he could have won the first trick and endplayed East with a heart after a few rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N does not know which black king S has, so it may seem that 7D is a dangerous risk. in my view it is the correct call, though, because:  a) S might have heart queen     b)  S might ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have spade king -- he is about a 60% favorite to have that king rather than the club king        c) S might have S jack in which case it is a five-or-seven hand anyway|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: this hand should prove a fruitful source of discussion for EW in finetuning their competitive arsenal |pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: However, that would look silly if East started with six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east putting in the @HJ at trick 1 forced him to commit himself immediately|pg||
nt|athene: much easier if east plays ace and a heart|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|andyv:  @s vs @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, EW probably will buy it in 3@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: what a pity, declarer did well since 2 of @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My misguesses never gain IMPs. Hop's do|pg||
nt|athene: north refused to raise clubs in the other room as well on board 2 :(|pg||
nt|athene: so they play 6@S rather than 6@C :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: 5 imps to japan|pg||
nt|athene: actually i am not sure the endplay was so useful anyway because when east cashes the hearts, dummy gets squeezed anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so i think it was just a case of guessing spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt all pass is a possible auction here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: people have to stop ignoring the club suit|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|santyclz: An unfortunate start for Japan.|pg||
nt|wboer: I would overcall 1@h with the N hand|pg||
nt|athene: if EW stagger into 4@S, will south try another double?|pg||
nt|athene: you might, if they have had an invitational sequence where west showed hearts|pg||
nt|athene: because you know the cards lie badly for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when EW bid 4H to make, NS generally shouldnt be allowed to play 4S undoubled|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ugis: NS should somehow get to 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: Here the good/bad again|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N showing 3S via X|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and probably more than minimum vaues, as that is the French style with support doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: another chance for Holland. 3nt will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably PPP now|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: quite popular in England for 1@d-(1NT)-2@c to show both majors|pg||
nt|hajru:  Comfortable partial for ns|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, that is played here as well but apparently not by NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this should be ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: now for sure 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate 4@S less likely to draw a double|pg||
nt|athene: this is one more reason why inviting is a bad idea |pg||
nt|ugis: S had no good bid over dbl, he elected to go for 2c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ricky86: hi all sorry for late :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: welcome riccardo :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Riccardo|pg||
nt|wboer: What a result in the open room. 3NT is making with @dK right?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: some work for East, but @SK sh give him the 9. trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wboer: He played for the @dK drop.|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D makes.|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|marlowepi: when S passes 5C, i think N should also|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|pelu: so more IMPs for Japan|pg||
nt|ricky86: good contract here, not finded in the other room|pg||
nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Helmich chose to open his major|pg||
nt|athene: this is the problem with opening these hands 1 of a suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill and I, among others, got a similar problem on a bidding panel|pg||
nt|athene: you are tempted to make another move after a weak-ish response|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  both E and W overbid their hands slightly|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The difference was the 1@S response as opposed to 1@D in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: and you get too high|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|ugis: 4S looks easy when you see all the cards, in  reality it ain't easy at all|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  E hand really isn't that good...only the A@s is a plus...the 5 hearts are not all that useful|pg||
nt|wboer: In the other room Japan is swinging already|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1@S makes the North hand stronger and a jump was in order|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whetherto open 1M or 1NT, but it was a different hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: especially if N already showed a bit extra with the double|pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: E is marked with lots of clubs and hearts|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: even if you open 1@D with 44 minors and a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: it's better to open 1@C with the strong balanced hands|pg||
nt|athene: firstly because you get your transfers going|pg||
nt|athene: secondly because you are not so worried about intervention|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surprising pass by North on this hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: chances are you are just going to end up playing it in 3nt or 4 of a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south would rebid 1@H with any weak notrump with 2 or 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 1nt is the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: that means you have 2nt available for something else|pg||
nt|athene: and it also means you can respond safely with nothing with a major|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: well - "more safely"|pg||
nt|athene: the main worry when you respond on a 2 count or so is that partner will jump to 2nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @S iguess but @C unfriendly :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: (playing standard methods)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|athene: this lead suggests very strongly that the @SA is right|pg||
nt|athene: as west would lead a spade most of the time without the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer will not be sure enough of that to risk his contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: haha, south intending to finesse the @H10?|pg||

nt|athene: with his -400|pg||
nt|athene: he'll hope his teammates find a double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW got a lot of mileage out of their trump holding here, but N still slid in with 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: with 9 toptricks he did risk the contract for an overtrick???|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ricky86: yes, but however was a good contract too|pg||
nt|ricky86: junior bridge :)|pg||
nt|athene: tricky choice of overcall for east|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The weak two in diamonds creates a problem for Lebatteux|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  a partial in @ss seems most likely|pg||
nt|ricky86: surely 4@s now|pg||
nt|pelu: is that the dutch style Wubbo?|pg||
nt|ugis: 7nt here...no partscores in this set of boards :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 2nt from s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rnmalik: 36 IMPs in 4 boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2N is limit raise or better|pg||

nt|ricky86: :) junior bridge|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may be right|pg||

mb|p|nt|wboer: it seems so, it is not my style|pg||
nt|athene: there is really nothing that isn't horrible :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: and not Ws style :)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 3@C is the straightforward call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3-level overcall on AJ9xx is againt my religion|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes 3@c isn't a good bid, but he knows his part can't reopening and he thinks he must bid|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wondering about the likelihood of north having @DJ10?|pg||
nt|ugis: but, once again, it is not so straightforward at he table  |pg||
nt|ugis: well, or is it? 4c - asks for aces?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: Five hands in a row for South to declare |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: disciplined pass by S over 1S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: With 1 zillion entries it seems strange that Kido does not lead a club|pg||
nt|wboer: still time to switch for defence|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@c is a big bid for that hand.|pg||
nt|ugis: not familiar with their system, 4c might be natural, sets clubs as trumps...or it might be ace asking|pg||
mb|d|nt|wboer: 3NT is high but has play if @d are 3/2|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you can guarantee to keep south off lead, your best chance of a double stop in diamonds is to rise the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to cut down on ruffs against the likely 44 fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can scare declarer with spade queen lead:)|pg||
nt|wboer: Not a hand that will be published. prob @c lead, @hT ducked to E and 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and this one is comfortable as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: a good choice 3nt when you have few points and two balanced hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N has a chance...after 4 rounds of @hs, W will have to be passive|pg||
nt|andyv:  E must be friends with declarer|pg||

nt|athene: and tries to conceal his holding as much as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: This defence beats me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S will start with 2 top Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W shd cover heart ten if S leads it|pg||
nt|wboer: or @h4, @h5 @h6 to E|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|wboer: no he will make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ugis: looks as though 4c was natural, followed by a couple of cue bids|pg||
nt|ugis: 4nt ace asking in clubs|pg||
nt|ugis: 5c=4aces|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ugis: but may be I am completely wrong :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ugis: in any case, they managed to reach the top spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow great predicition|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont understand N - passiv defense cant help him. He can gice decl 2 @C-tricks and still defeat 3NT - blind spot|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs to take the @s finesse quickly...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared that Hop had clubs stopped|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: in the other room declarer got a heart lead, played a diamond to the queen himself, and then ran the clubs, and the defenders threw enough things that he felt confident about ...|pg||
nt|athene: trying a small spade for some overtricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a riveting deal, but even juniors have some quiet boards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: wrong - @C would defeat|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: missed that chance. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|ricky86: S didn't guess the 2@c a friendly play :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's play of A@c was predicated on the need for him to run 9 tricks immediately|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: now West will win on a endplay|pg||
nt|wboer: That is good play. With this @s break he can make it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ruffing declarer's loser with a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S had no good choices there.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|wboer: W had the @h9 so he should cover|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wboer: If S played a @s (best) then N still could be endplayed in @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's so easy for us when we can see that there was no danger in this contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: @S10 (std) bit costly sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: upside down carding is just better|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 10x playing std you are better off just not giving count, most of the time; even high from 9x can be costly quite often|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  he hoped to pick up the @s suit, + 3 @d and A@c for his game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should cover heart ten because if S has AJT he is virtually certain to make 3N|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  why E refuses to continue on the @h suit is an entire mystery that only he can answer|pg||
nt|ricky86: surely not a good def here|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ricky86: friendly def here, but well played by declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: @SK the 7. trick - could S have signal better?|pg||
nt|athene: with the cards as they are here, you duck in diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk5: Only chance for North is to unblock @HK when the ace is cashed; no luck there|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|athene: because you know you can keep north off lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 1@H i suppose|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: i have seen Hamman opening these 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: but 1@H more common i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: many people would be frightened by the redouble into bidding only 1@S with the east hand|pg||
nt|athene: but 2@S is definitely right|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S just lets NS sort their hands out much easier|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives them a problem|pg||
nt|athene: now north doesn't know how strong his partner is|pg||
nt|athene: he might very well not even know if 3@C is forcing|pg||

nt|bobholl: IF (big if) this makes will be good|pg||

pc|cK|nt|athene: 4@H just might sneak home|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|athene: i think you might as well offer 4@H with south but of course it is easier seeing all the cards|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: Drijver a bit too optimistic?|pg||
nt|athene: there was a similar hand a couple of days ago where one of the netherlands players had 6 hearts and 5 clubs and ended in 5@C-1 where 4@H could have made|pg||
nt|hedyg: he raised @c so he assumes S has 5 @cs. in that case the hcps he has outside @c are pretty useless|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|athene: admittedly the winning line in 4@H on that hand involved a really bizarre squeeze so it might have failed anyway in practice|pg||
nt|athene: well this is what i was saying earlier|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|athene: 2@S was a good bid and made it very hard for NS to sort out how strong they were|pg||
nt|athene: no-one knows what 3@C shows on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: hard for north to pass it|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in 1NT which is luckier and bad defence (@D lead)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: but they'll go down anyway so may be a push|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|athene: that is how you rack up 3@C+3 and other embarrassing scores|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: sorry about that Bill, i was not here . but again...if S is 5-5 how much is N worth?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|athene: well if south has a 5-5 16 count he is worth quite a bit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is N 7th trick which will decide (guess he'll go 2 down)|pg||

nt|hajru:  I think we'll see another declarer than s on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this hand can actually make 6@s|pg||

nt|athene: called "tempo or elopement dilemma" in "adventures in card play"|pg||

mb|p|nt|ugis: lets see how the rumanians handle it|pg||
nt|wboer: I go for 1@h|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: @HJ the problem - in Cr S tryed @h9 but also @S here - only @h2/3 will give the message to N|pg||
nt|andyv:  you need to pick up the @s suit...only play that will do that is the J@s lead from S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think 3@D can achieve so much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree, but if you need a swing 4H is fine too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: might just get partner off to the wrong lead against hearts|pg||
nt|athene: north might double this for takeout|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 3@S now - as in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his side has slightly more than half the deck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D might be short, so maybe West cannot raise to 2@D (could be inverted) |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if partner has a heart stack there could be a number on offer|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s probably shows 4@s|pg||
nt|ricky86: shows 4 @s and a maximum hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same lead in OR.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this where it's overwhelmingly likely that the opponents are going to play it, your bids should probably be mostly lead-directing|pg||
nt|athene: mostly you expect pd to pull it but that will hopefully be ok|pg||
nt|ugis: most probably 4h on NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, he feels that south bidding spades or diamonds is too likely, and too likely to be wrong|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: perfect EW distribution, but with only 8 HCP difficult for W to invite for slam|pg||
nt|wboer: Sure 4@h is a nice swinging bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i had assumed NS play 2/1, in which case 2D is quite a stretch, but N may be looking for a swing|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hajru:  1@d as 3+ in standard French style?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: for me S sh pass over 3@s x - 4@D for extra values and no @S-stop|pg||
nt|athene: it seems declarer has the rest here but he can't do it easily with 3-0 trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk5: I play a gadget when 3@S is doubled. Redouble two or three small|pg||
nt|wboer: i think he wanted to make clear that he had a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Mancoff convention|pg||
nt|ricky86: 1 imps to ned for sure here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and likely same result.|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a very unattractive hand to lead from|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: and too likely to just exchange a small positive for a small negative|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: NS could have gotten a much needed swing in here if N had not gotten "cold feet"|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|wboer: He had the feeling they were getting to high if he bids 3@h. Right he was, because that is F|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like 420 to me|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|Walddk5: Playing Mancoff, 4@D would show a singleton spade|pg||
nt|athene: if he draws trumps he has only one club ruff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: hello & welcome:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ricky86: 4@s very preservative|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Anyway, they reached top spot|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: anyway even if one is right on one particular board, the practice of not respecting game forces (if 2D was one, and if not then 2D followed by 2N surely was?) is a longterm recipe ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for disaster|pg||
nt|wboer: Guessing @h's is not obvious|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pelu: West could try 4@C - sh be singleton after the D in N|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: in one sense there is a motivation for a trump lead. but om the other hand partner may be able to  overruff dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: 4H is a poor game, but it has the virtue of making|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ricky86: good attempt of N, he has got a strong hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|hajru:  E had to return a H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: now the heart goes - needs to guess the spades |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ricky86: but again a good choice here.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe. safety play seems attractive, but i suppose you could play E for J9x|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: hasn't|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hajru:  but he didn't get the S right|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am told that the NS auction was indeed not GF, veen after 2N, so we can erase everything i said about it|pg||

nt|athene: well, maybe good/bad 2nt rides to the rescue, yes|pg||
nt|athene: with bugles calling|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it doesn't |pg||
nt|athene: it didn't for Wackwitz anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe they dont play that|pg||
nt|bobholl: could have made in the end by ruffing a @C and give E a placing with @H :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry not made 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: East's @CK a good card to try and avoid an endplay|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@C EW or 4@H NS it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: So if NS get to 4@H EW should sacrifice in 5@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK so they made three on the previous board|pg||
nt|davidstern: I must leave you now - thanks for your company and keep safe. All the best to those in the North-East of the USA nunkering down for a Hurricane. See you soon|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|hedyg: lets see whether they play Muiderberg at all...no they dont|pg||
nt|athene: NS given a MUCH easier ride in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|athene: a bit wet of EW not to get involved somehow|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess EW here play that double of 1@H would deny spades?|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@S is 4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes X= i have no bid|pg||
nt|athene: west may now offer spades en route to 3nt|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: maybe that is én route :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no en was fine|pg||
nt|athene: (3@S would be forcing showing three spades on this sort of auction, saying "do we play 3nt or 4@S?")|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 5 cards in @s E would bid 2@c|pg||
nt|athene: well, maybe|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: west is not afraid but luckily his P has no @S control either|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: if 2nt categorically denied five spades, then yes i guess no point showing them|pg||
nt|athene: south has the opponents' suits stopped|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: and he thinks his partner has a 1@H overcall :) well, maybe he does, maybe he doesn't|pg||
nt|athene: the @DKQ are not well-placed so i think this is an aggressive double|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's lead-directing, suggesting spade?|pg||
nt|athene: NS have a lot of tens which are working hard|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd overcalled and he has hcps and stops both suits bid by opps|pg||
nt|athene: a good example here of just how bad 4333 shapes are - EW have 25 hcp and they are going to need every single one|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: also he wanted a @s lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|bobholl: @S ruff small and 1 with the ace and 4@H makes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: well, he has 8 tricks fairly easily with the @DAJ well placed|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: can he build a third trick in spades by leading towards the A8?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h7|nt|athene: or perhaps squeeze south in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: spade shift now breaks up the squeeze i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: what good is ducking the @H trick?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: well he is just trying to tighten up the position to bring pressure to bear on south|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|athene: interesting battle for tempo here|pg||
nt|hedyg: the switch to @s shows that KQ@D are in S|pg||
nt|athene: south has to lead a spade back and then if west sets up a long spade, south can set up HIS long spade|pg||
nt|athene: and use the @DKQ as an entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: with an entry to his hand N would have continued @H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer knows where the diamonds are|pg||
nt|athene: from the bidding and north's line of defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should know|pg||
nt|hedyg: CR S opened a Muiderberg 2@s, N bid 3@c pass or correct and 3@d was not a success|pg||
nt|athene: can south work out what to do here? leading a big spade is not at all obvious|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now the tempo is gone|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|c6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: and now squeeze|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|athene: yes now south just gets crushed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: well played by west|pg||

nt|athene: very, very difficult to find that defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: said squeeze :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: approach is that W has too much strength, so E will not be contributing much in high cards. it may be the best strategy to lead a club, planning toi lead another when declarer ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leads a spade, and then maybe W will get a club ruff later|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hajru:  Hop is probably wondering how he could have become declarer, so far, he averaged about an overtrick on the hands he played.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, he might have expected West to have more than a singleton spade for his 1NT |pg||
mb|2C|nt|veistikke:  Hei all.|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: good start to this auction for NS here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: Hi out there - I am so alone - come and help me :):)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|wboer: partscore deal in @s for NS. EW can compete with 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT and perhaps 3@D after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is a sign-off|pg||
nt|athene: that's fine provided 3@D is known to be a sign-off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If West had extras, he would raise to 3NT and not show his 5th diamond|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|oosb: reasonable auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: now another good game, 3nt are unbeatable|pg||
nt|wboer: again a board that won't be published in the bulletin|pg||
nt|hajru:  Hi Hassan|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 5@s and 4+ minor. 3@c = p/c|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: or if he has a really strong 5-5 he can bid 3@C or something|pg||
nt|athene: but he can't be that strong after only 2@D |pg||
nt|athene: interesting no redouble from south|pg||
nt|athene: i thought most played that as top honour in overcall suit, probably doubleton|pg||
nt|wboer: EW will score plus on a board were they won't make 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, he shows his @SK now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi|pg||
nt|veistikke:  3!n would be standar here I guess :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes E was in a difficult spot. he is sick when he sees the opening lead thouygh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and he will be sicker very soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though it's time for east to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, coffee time|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2S is a 3-way bid:  (a) why should they go down when we can?   (b) let's push them to a game they might not bid and show them how to make it     (c) once in a while, a good result:)...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  W needs to preserve the K@h in dummy.  He should tackle the @s suit now|pg||
nt|athene: NS in the other room gave their opponents some chances to swing the axe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am impressed with the standard I must say. Excellent players, bright future|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it was hard|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: not sure 2@H over 2@D in the other room was a very good bid|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding has gone, the hand looks like a misfit|pg||

pc|d2|nt|warrens:  X of 2@S allows N to lead the J, in case dummy has the Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that can go down a lot|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wboer: In this case you are so right (a en b). In some cases you bid the lead that beats 3NT from opp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is true. but if that is the benefit, we only get to count it when: a) we wouldnt have been on lead ourselves    and/or    b) we wouldnt have gotten to overcall our suit if we ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: passed|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ugis: declarer will duck diamond to E at some point and claim 10|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ricky86: Percario doesn't have many choice to do in this hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: leading a big heart there so his partner is not tempted to play him for a singleton club, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: hop might lay down the @CK anyway for want of anything better to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are working hard to get many and good junior players all over the world. In Europe, the Netherlands, Poland and France are the strongest youth nations (then add Israel, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: playing in European events). No, I don't want to discuss politics, just stating a fact|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|nt|athene: yes, and it would have allowed north to lead a LOW spade against 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and so avoid making the @S98xxx into a stopper|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but certainly the method has SOME successes, or even the most stubborn wouldnt play it|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north had been able to show the 5-5 (ghestem, say) then EW might have ended up defending|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, it's possible e-w will be in 3nt at the other table. they do have a @S stopper, but the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess if anyone is playing ghestem this match it will be france :)|pg||
nt|athene: in open events, we assume a break like this is a smoke break :)|pg||
nt|athene: but not in junior events, haha|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h6|pc|c9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|wboer: Made easely after trick 2. @c by S in trick 4 would save a trick. Now 130|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final, ARG URU are 3 up against NED RUM|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a good 4@h contract the EW may not get to|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, it is hard to see how to defeat this without getting a number of H tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Let's make a prediction - small swing to France on the 4@S-1 hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: down 400 when opps were going to go down 200 in 3N:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  I wonder if 2@s is a one round force|pg||
nt|ricky86: maybe they can get if NS bid @ds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Absolutely one sided match so far.|pg||
nt|oosb: but without the dbl -400 actually gains against 650!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marginal opening bid by W, the French establishment might frown on it so perhaps not opened in the other room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: @d ruff will beat !3s on a ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  You're not looking at the other table, are you?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Since North jumped inn 3!n i would have played AKQ. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: 3@s is delicate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good spot reached by France in the other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, just this one|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 5@C/5@D will cost 300 against 4 major, but with all green u normal not go for this save - but sometimes u can push opp to 5-level!!|pg||
nt|pelu: both Ns broke Rolands rule No 1 : no weak to with 2 Aces :)|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows a balanced hand south may go for the nine-trick game|pg||
nt|oosb: not an opening for me|pg||
nt|oosb: not even marginal for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you may have a career awaiting you in France:)|pg||
nt|oosb: :)|pg||
nt|wboer: true, no pr for Muiderberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would, with 4333 and strength in all side suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most of the players at this table are unknown to me, but i know E fairly well --  one of USA's most promising juniors, Marius is a Romanian living in the US  and playing here on a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: largely Dutch team. this kind of ecumenical transnationalism is very good for bridge |pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk5: Indeed|pg||
nt|hajru:  And then what?  You know that partner cannot have much and even if you set up a 4th heart, how can you cash it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather open 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D looks like an underbid if it isn't forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid 3NT, and they did in both rooms. Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to have no problem in bidding with marginal hands|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazzili. 2@d = 8+ hcp, 2@s = 5@h + 4@s 18+|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt could be a good hand, though, south might feel obliged to show the support in case they have slam|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt with north, certainly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: as u understand, I dont agree with him :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Ricardo and Wubbo would u open 1@h or 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 3NT, have to bid.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  if north have A@c im hopeing to get inn on single @c K :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 1nt showing hearts and diamonds|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wboer: 6@c is a beauty, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|athene: another trick is to avoid 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the double I wonder. He knows he will be on lead himself|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wboer: 4NT = NF, kanti|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed yes. with QJ@H falling.|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt - 3nt is a reasonable auction i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is itching to double, but the spectre of -470 is a forbidding vision|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|wboer: quantitative|pg||
nt|athene: against diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I would rather be in 3nt than 4@S here, but they should make it either way|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|wboer: You have 11 toptricks with @c not 5/1. Enough entries to develop 5th @h or @dA good|pg||
nt|wboer: Well bid again by EW|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|oosb: lively auction here|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this @c play is best.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wboer: I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: i play 2@h 10-12 with 6 cards, but here i think is weak.. i don't agree|pg||
nt|ricky86: i would open 1 @h|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have Ax of trumps you have to jump in with the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to get endplayed later|pg||
nt|veistikke:  to cash the last @H :P|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: but i think west should be able to see that is not the issue on this hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: made easy.:)|pg||
nt|athene: not clear to run this because if you lose to west's queen, you just incurred an extra loser and you don't have anything so useful to throw on dummy's clubs|pg||
nt|wboer: The @h lead could be from 5 and he didn't expect N to have 4 @c's |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: even if he does, it's only an imp :)|pg||
nt|ugis: it is all about getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|ugis: must lead the diam Q from dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|pelu: and give N @Hj 10 and not the Q would u still open 1@h|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but one of the more embarrassing ones to concede|pg||
nt|athene: pitching a red card might be useful but it might not be|pg||
nt|ugis: well OK, must find the trump Q too, but it should not be a problem|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|wboer: Oops, no cover and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well W doesnt know that N has only 4 hearts, so the likelihood that N has Jxxx of clubs probably seemed small to him|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i duplicated your remark:)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only complaint I have regarding these youngsters is that they double (lead-directing) way too much. Most of the time it helps the opponents more than partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W would have done better not to double 2C. he is dead minimum for an opener (if that) and his clubs are not all that great  -- and meanwhile  2C is the contract that suits ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Simon was caught off guard for some reason|pg||
pc|s9|nt|oosb: Yes but after 1NT dbl, he perhaps expected 2@H to be dbled too?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should perhaps have led a trump, and W should perhaps have switched to diamonds at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but is it so clear that he wants to defend 2HX rather than 2C undoubled?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ugis: apparently I might be wrong again :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but I guess he will still play it from the top|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|athene: yes, we have seen lots of lead doubles in the last few days|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|oosb: that's a good question :)|pg||
nt|ugis: the more you think in those situations, the more likely it is that you will go for the percentage play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ugis: I mean if you "feel" that the Q is with E, you do not think, you finesse in tempo :)|pg||
nt|ugis: after two non-vulnerable game swings we see France 1 IMPahead|pg||
mc|10|nt|warrens:  it's a close call, since it's likely the @C 5 is from the queen|pg||

nt|athene: so KnR will love it|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: and think it's about a 16 count|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all he had 2 10s in his longer suits|pg||

mb|p|pc|dK|nt|athene: i am not sure i understand the bidding though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: on board 5 north responded 1@D (surely a transfer)|pg||
nt|hedyg: both @H and @c were unattractive switches|pg||
nt|athene: but here in exactly the same situation he bids 1@H naturally?|pg||

nt|wboer: nothing to be ashamed off. Two aces in defense. This is better then a flat 12 hcp|pg||
nt|ricky86: y|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italian top guns hardly ever double, and there is a good reason for it|pg||
nt|athene: i think i have seen one of about eight that was useful for the defence|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, the French picked up 5 on the 4@s -1 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT making by South on 22 - 5 to France|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  our first slam|pg||
nt|pelu: so u open on 9+ - is that on your CC?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better check my lottery numbers|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wboer: I hears this beautifull 6@c will losse 2 imps, because the open room are in 6@h. With bare @hQJ this makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a very strong result for the Dutch|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: There are problem with running score - prob so many try to enter, that the server cant manage|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR board 8 the contract is 6@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For a start, you have to bid 3NT, and then make it if you do|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: does 1@C promise four clubs? rare these days|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wboer: my cc is secret|pg||
nt|kakashi84: no 1@c promise 3 @c|pg||
nt|ugis: 3h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I would upgrade to 10, so yes, 10-21 is on my CC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another double coming|pg||
nt|kakashi84: I think, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then Poulat has to decide|pg||
nt|athene: west could have bid 3@D but he prefers to wait for his partner's second double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i played with him 4 days straight in the Open at Juan les Pins and he made no such mistakes. this event is far more grueling though:)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  safest slam is 6N|pg||
nt|ugis: 2H certainly too pesimistic for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would be lebensohl i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is a reasonable punt|pg||
nt|bobholl: at other vulnarabilty he'd have passed i guess 98 are pretty :)|pg||
nt|athene: AK98 a lot nicer than AK87! one trick nicer in fact :)|pg||
nt|athene: guaranteed a double stop|pg||
nt|athene: sorry triple stop|pg||
nt|ugis: 6-4, a terrific 15 points....somewhere between 3 and 4 hearts for me..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though some would say that even a month-long tournament could not be more grueling than 4 sessions with me:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk5: Did you give up on tournament bridge completely, Wubbo? We don't see you any more|pg||
nt|rnmalik: late:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to beat this|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: wd by EW there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: dont be wrong - they can play bridge "down under" :)|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: lead @D :)|pg||
nt|wboer: I play the nice festivals in europe and some leage bridge in Holland Also coach/captain with my wife Agnes of this Dutch juniors|pg||
nt|hajru:  As I'm rooting for the Dutch, 16 flat boards is good for the result|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reasonable lead. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many players would open 2N on the S hand, but that would be ill-advised on a hand that is so well-sculpted for play in a suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|wboer: There is a loosing option in 6@h after @dA and @d. Enter dummy with @d ruff to play for @hQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we can see that it can be set, but it is very tough at the table|pg||
nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||
nt|wboer: Light opening and light take out double. |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo @C lead in that hand would create problems for 6@H.|pg||
nt|hajru:  but I guess the specs don't like it. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|ricky86: shared lead but there isn't a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|wboer: @h lead will beat it. Taking @sA and @h switch will make life diff for decl. He still makes it because the block in @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: and now it's too late already|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: north, reasonably enough, excpected much better clubs for 3@C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ricky86: yes, no problems here for NS. they have 6@c 6@h and 6NT :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but on the actual layout, declarer soon will have a big smile|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oosb: Do you think this auction will be duplicated at all 4 tables?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|wboer: Good defense|pg||
nt|oosb: do you bid 1@H as N too?|pg||
nt|ugis: in the open room S going 2 down in 4h dbld|pg||
nt|ugis: so 9 more imps to France|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: south might underlead the hearts i suppose but that still nets only four tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @H ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: When I was a junior boards with only a single-figure swing rated as flat|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wboer: Now easy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: the double may have more going for it than the opening, but i am ok with either (or with pass)|pg||
nt|wboer: He knows W has @dKQ. So he could misguess the @h-suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: but as for identical auctions, maybe someone will open 2N|pg||
nt|oosb: and end in 4@H as well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well plod away at hearts and hope for a miracle|pg||
nt|hajru:  That is so long ago, that I can't remember|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I didn't really want to add that |pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: if south had not raised clubs and it had gone, say, 1nt - 3nt, then north might lead the @HQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: plod away at spades sry|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: I like the D + 3@D by East - in CR E just jump to 3@D - that dont show a running suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: say hi to our operator http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143 !/photo.php?fbid=264131686949677&set=a.264130690283110.81315.263033693726143&type=1&theater|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|oosb: via puppet or regular stayman|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to her for the wonderful job she is doing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you reverse the majors in the S hand the double is a bit less attractive. with 4 spades there is a bit of  edge in finding that fit right away to  put yourself in a better ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: position later|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s9|pc|d5|nt|warrens:  S needs to pitch a @H to avoid an overtrick|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes, otherwise declarer could cash three rounds of clubs and then play a heart towards dummy|pg||
nt|warrens:  since I'm assuming East will play 3 rounds of clubs.  |pg||
nt|oosb: fair enough|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||

nt|athene: west transfers and north has a bit of a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now spades get raised and north has an easy double|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bobholl: in imps this is a non interesting hand but in BAM this is equally important as a grand slam hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and the issue for NS then is whether lebensohl applies|pg||
nt|hedyg: and E XX|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|athene: in theory, redouble is not a good idea in these positions, as it makes it much easier for NS |pg||

nt|bobholl: wow no @S contract costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: the table are all very happy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|athene: but i guess it can help to tell partner you have a good hand so he can co-operate in penalizing the opps or whatever|pg||

nt|athene: 1nt opener would have found hearts :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|hedyg: as what would you have taken the 3@H bid?|pg||
nt|athene: i think 1nt with that sort of hand is so much better than 1@S it's just not close |pg||

nt|athene: since the @HK is overwhelmingly likely to be in dummy|pg||
nt|warrens:  but E might have claimed a little early|pg||
nt|athene: that is a 1@H opener for most in this event, i suspect|pg||
nt|veistikke:  South can also duck the @H |pg||
nt|hajru:  Rehi, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: on raw loser count, it is a 3H bid, but with 3 aces and only one queen, it is adjusted to a 4H call. unless of course one has alternative ways to show a hand worth 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  got disconnected but it looks as if I didn't miss much.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: After all, game is on a finesse|pg||
nt|athene: what will east rebid after 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 3@s?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  anyone got link to the results?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ricky86: Donati-Percario play a very good bridge for their age. I should mention that Donati is 13 yo and Percario is 16 yo :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East had @CJ instead of the 10, 4@S can be defeated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as it is, 5@C is a correct save|pg||
nt|athene: NS do well to "take the money" here since pressing on to 5@S would lead to a negative score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many french players have various calls available as opener to distinguish different types of raises to 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would go for 2nt i think|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you misdescribe you hand always :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course, agonized pause and self-recrimination for opening in the first place is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|athene: and it looks as though east is going for that :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would open 1N with E hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wboer: What should N bid? Pass is ok imo|pg||
nt|athene: you might not be too happy taking a probable 500 against your vul game, but you don't want to go for "650 or maybe -100" instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in other lands too as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: strange but winning because @dA is wrong. Do they play a strong @c system?|pg||
nt|pelu: they prob play 2@S contructiv and he didnt like to bid 1NF (forsing - semiforcing)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has no choice.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a very pure hand here and imagines short spades with partner so will sac i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: also 5@C takes blackwood away from north|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: because it uses up SO much room|pg||
nt|athene: when the auction gets icky like this, it's a good idea to favour the cheaper bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: but Australia need 19-11 to pass Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If they do, West'|pg||
nt|Walddk5: s hand is worth a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: which might be what he is about to bid|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qtournid=897&qphase=SF&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|ugis: 6clubs on a finesse...down 1 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and possibly reach 4H|pg||
nt|wboer: yes, I can imagine 1NT. But that would mean EW could get to 4@h making.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, surprised|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be getting old - prefer 2@c to 2@d|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt also down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so this could be an opportunity for france, except that in general the french are even more unlikely to open 1N than their opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: W deterred fronm mentioning hearts by the X|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  the other option is 2nt, which is tough on Jxx.  I actually don't like 1@H very much, unless playing a strong club.|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is 2NT but with Jxx i can't like that too :)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec comments that if you can't stomach 2nt, 3@S must be better than 3@H, which seems right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that the vulnerability here has been an inhibiting factor. for example, at favorable colors N (though not a french N) might overcall 1D|pg||
nt|ugis: 4h an interesting contract, 5c = nothing interesting :)|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  that is good to know|pg||

pc|s9|nt|oosb: good contract with the double fit|pg||
nt|ugis: 6h = too much luck needed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: 21-count 3NT - and it looks like it will make |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the ace, diamond ruff, club to the jack, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  5 clubs and 4 red suit winners.|pg||
nt|ugis: after the diamond lead 6h makes I guess :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: possibly open room could get to 4H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|h4|nt|hajru:  N will probably run a C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though there is some work to do|pg||
pc|h3|nt|veistikke:  5@c and 5@h and 1 @d :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and EW can't take three spade tricks, unless North misguesses - unlikely|pg||
nt|djneill:  seems like West can only hope that North has at most 5@c, 2@d, and one @h, so continuing diamonds might be best|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be normal. but north is getting 11 if west continues inn @d |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: no update on running score after 3 boards of this match|pg||

nt|ugis: DA, Club A and a club = |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|athene: in some situations like this, i think that opener's cue should not be strong|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: it should just say "i have no bid"|pg||
nt|athene: typically a weak notrump with no stop|pg||
pc|h5|nt|djneill:  well North could have the @sK, but cannot establish it|pg||
nt|hajru:  South gives up ;)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|wboer: This will be 9 or 11 imp's back to japan|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ugis: but it is double dummy of course :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: the trump play is more or less clearcut , when opps have ten diamonds and never bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: let's say for example you open 1@D, 1@S overcall, 2@H from your pd|pg||
nt|veistikke:  now 12|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: nice try - but no succes|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|d9|nt|oosb: 4 more boards in the first session of this final. Total 4 sessions of 14 boards each|pg||
nt|oosb: or is it different for 3/4?|pg||

nt|oosb: Ah and the room title reads 1/3 dohh|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||

nt|wboer: Roland and Peter are right. E thought he would get to high when answering 2@s|pg||
nt|wboer: nice clow contract in open by japan|pg||
nt|hajru:  Great result for the dutch on that one.|pg||
nt|ugis: have to run, thx all|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S not so bad here but hard to find with two balanced hands|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ricky86: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|athene: west will super-accept spades i guess despite nasty 4333|pg||
nt|athene: you have to do something with 17 count and 4 trumps don't you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 17 with 4 is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW won't be nearly sure enough that 4@H is making|pg||
nt|athene: even if it gets bid, which is not certain|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H in the other room was showing a good hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|oosb: Ferro and Scanavino stopped in 2NT on board 9, while the other table in the final also played 4@H-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wubbo; 2Nt?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bash the game in|pg||
nt|oosb: is it just me or the 1NT overcall is scary?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: I can take a nap now|pg||
nt|athene: even if you play that 2nt is a scramble in that sort of position, you can still use that as "good bad" in the highest-ranking suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: which is very useful|pg||
nt|hajru:  Gazilli again, 2N showing a strong 5-5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards seem very NS this set, and to be fair NS are doing vey well with them|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: and down they will go :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Helmich has a cleardouble now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 hands really ARE that evil|pg||
nt|djneill:  North asks for the 2nd suit, expecting @d...|pg||
nt|wboer: I like that S hand in. Especially in rubber bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Simon may be charged with treason, because the fact that he opened 2C rather than 2D suggests that he has turned his back on the classic French methiods wherein 2D is GF and 2C is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: almost GF. yes, it is true that is classic french standard, which means you should never play rubber brudge against the french becauyse if they developed that system they must be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the best card holders in the galaxy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wboer: 2NT is limit+ with @s support|pg||
nt|ricky86: construct?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here:)|pg||
nt|athene: because if south had a weak 3@H bid he would bid 2nt scramble and pull whatever his partner bid, to 3@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  but..|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Could be a Fantunes gadget, limit with 3|pg||
nt|athene: so a direct 3@H always shows something|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|ricky86: bad choice bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d bit a bit over the top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that nowadays penalty doubles do not exist below 7@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure no @C lead and @S guess will let it make|pg||
nt|athene: yeah you can get two clubs away on the hearts - but why should you play the spades right?|pg||
nt|bobholl: or no @C switch now |pg||
nt|oosb: One probably cant afford to pass but against a passed pd it is scary|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wboer: Yes limit with 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 3@S pretty much forces NS into 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything is for take-out. The doubles just have various names, but 'penalty' is not among them|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer doesn't have easy communication, but he can make this if S ducks|pg||
nt|athene: even if south flies the ace, it's not obvious to play a club|pg||
nt|athene: could look very silly a lot of the time |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, but another @D is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer has the ace|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and diamond works ok|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: limit I can for sure see - and only 3 card @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  A of @D and a @H is dangerous for the defense|pg||
nt|wboer: Trump lead will end the match|pg||
pc|sT|nt|djneill:  should South have just bid RKC after 4@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: But that not fair with @hAK in hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS seem not be be in perfect harmony about the meaning of 4S here. if it is fast arrival denying any real values, 5C is doubtful at best|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: yes - an "optional" double these days means "you can pull it to your suit, or to my suit" :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  He is close, I think.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|veistikke:  most people would have :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on this sequence, North does not guarantee four trumps, I imagine - South is 5/5+|pg||
pc|s2|nt|veistikke:  but 4@h is a good bid|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|c7|nt|ricky86: another hand without story|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|veistikke:  nothing to play now :) 12 :P|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: should get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|athene: he knows west has a lot more diamonds than east|pg||
pc|h4|nt|warrens:  Now, declarer has to pitch 2 @C's and then play a @C to dummy |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hajru:  but doesn't have to make a foreward move on, say, xx/Qxx/Axxx/xxxx? over 3@h|pg||
pc|s7|nt|warrens:  ok, no miracles|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: is the @D8 discouraging in diamonds?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: west certainly doesn't want a diamond lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: but the convention work better when opening = 14+|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|athene: he can count declarer for only 4 trumps, 3 clubs and the spade|pg||
nt|athene: so he will have to develop diamonds himself|pg||
nt|athene: yes he needed the club as a scissors coup|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: no need for the defence to get busy in that suit|pg||
nt|athene: to prevent south cashing the @DA and getting a ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: asking too much|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c3|nt|pelu: and not 9+ as u play :)|pg||
nt|wboer: 1 imp to Japan|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk5: :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east should play the @D7 there|pg||
nt|athene: the highest outstanding spot|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk5: We are all juniors in your hearts, Peter|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, it's what he would do if he thought he needed to start trumps from dummy (but there's no compelling reason to do that)|pg||
nt|athene: you can start trumps with small from hand|pg||

nt|Walddk5: our  rather|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

nt|athene: 2@C 2@D 2@S and north bid a somewhat creative 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: unsurprisingly south went on and they stopped in 5 and made it - i would have thought that bidding DID call for a trump lead, maybe|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: last few boards of the 3/4th playoff here now|pg||
nt|athene: one more set starting shortly in the main final|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: 1nt shows 4 spades 5 minor for NS?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is intending to follow it up with something cunning to show his extra strength|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just a jump in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps a cue bid or something more interesting|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe a bid of notrumps in fact|pg||
nt|athene: that sort of expresses it very well|pg||
nt|athene: saying "solid suit, heart stop, but 4 spades on the side"|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H must mean something or other - now he will surely bid 3nt|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe 2@H is just a general force|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|athene: west can see the lead is a singleton so no temptation to duck, playing his pd for another heart and a club entry|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: ..or maybe there is :)|pg||
nt|athene: now west would get squeezed in the red suits for 13 except declarer doesn't have a diamond :) so will have to settle for 12|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H psyche is possible there|pg||
nt|kakashi84: may be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the surface you make slam with this fortunate trump split, but a diamond lead puts an end to that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent psyche if it is|pg||
nt|bobholl: the old problem with 15-17 and 5 high :)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  whats the dbl?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: board 26 next in the Open Room. That result could be vital|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this time only one suit for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: our friend from japan could jump to 3@H in OR|pg||
nt|wboer: I think !2s asks for number of @h, shape and strength|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Not a gross overbid|pg||
nt|ricky86: the problems of these hands is stay awake :)|pg||
nt|pelu: here 2@S ask: do u have a opening hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You would also bid 2@H with one spade more and one diamond less|pg||
nt|wboer: In 6@s S has a natural @cQ lead for 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: not sure about "excellent", but "successful" it certainly is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is too funny for words if it is true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Optimism?|pg||
nt|oosb: straight forward 6@H here, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|oosb: although|pg||
nt|oosb: with KQ@H missing they might not bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i think S should bid it, especially since he has chosen to sue KC|pg||
nt|oosb: Is a 7 card fit though, but could be missing AQ@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: use|pg||
nt|oosb: I meant 9 card fit|pg||
nt|oosb: 7 card suit!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, if he bids 5H here, he is saying he wanted to be in slam only if facing AK|pg||
nt|oosb: I guess it depends to some extent on preempt styles too? vul against not 3@H might be on the heavy side and atlesat have a decent suit?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a way a result like that is a good thing, because there is a chance EW may have slightly reduced focus  if part of their mind is still chasing the massive plus that got away ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: and this West hand is considerably better|pg||
nt|athene: the italians do prefer opening the major on these|pg||
nt|djneill:  think it asks partner to bid your doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't know why they hate 1nt so much|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wboer: exactly. Therefore this 2@s relay|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 6+ suit GF. 3NT = serious slamtry|pg||
nt|kakashi84: it's funny|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have 13 cards, partner, do you have a long suit?|pg||
nt|hajru:  Well, I do play X as @S and a 2nd suit, though I dont think I'd use it on this hand|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe :p my system it show same strenght|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: guess they play 12-16 rebid otherwise i don't understand|pg||
nt|oosb: Well judged in the end|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: they use gazzilli to solve some of the problems after 1M - 1NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, it's a partnership agreement issue|pg||
nt|athene: but those are not problems that you need in the first place :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good auction, though 2D by S would be a more popular choice|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|nt|oosb: 75% or so to pick up trumps?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|warrens:  so,did this sequence show an invitational hand by S?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: many flat bords here in 2. segment - in the other 3 matches max swing is 7 IMP|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this is a good convention. You are good in the slamzone, but you tell much to defenders if you are in the limitzone|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk5: Yes, but I think you need it if you allow 3-card raises|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I do with a 5431 hand for example|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok East has a good idea where all the HCP are, esp since South did not lead a club (so North has a top club and @sQ)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|athene: i am assuming this was a 2-way checkback auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like a reasonable way to overcome the problem|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: go lebatteux!|pg||
nt|bobholl: despite 26 points not so easy :)|pg||
nt|athene: @H10 comes down|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wboer: 4NT = optional Blackwood. So 5@c=min, 5@d = 1/4, 5@h= 0/3, 5@s= 2 no @sQ, 5NT= 2 with @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 8 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 400 is cheap|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes it's good|pg||
nt|athene: ...and laughing at every 50, as we used to say at university|pg||
nt|kakashi84: -9 possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah, he has 2 tricks already, but was indeed possible|pg||
nt|athene: it's still not that huge a gain, but worth a lot psychologically|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but still - if east leads a spade after the @HK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|warrens:  yes, with the J of @h's not, this should be easy|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you are ok|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|athene: the defence might get the red kings and two spades but that is all|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|warrens:  West just didn't have enough to X for a @S lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: 3 card raise for me only if i dont have a better bid - with Hx in @S and 3 card @H I bid 1NT every time|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ricky86: too much defeatist France here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry - he doesn't even need the diamond finesse if he gets a spade|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|djneill:  or not|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  if W sticks in the 8 now, he can get endplayed |pg||
nt|athene: he can afford to take it though - the defence can't cash three more spades when starting from west|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk5: What do you bid with   x  Axx  AQJ10x  xxxx|pg||
nt|wboer: True, you should, but leading for opp is easier now.|pg||
nt|athene: he might simply run the hearts now and hope to endplay west in the pointed suits|pg||
nt|warrens:  whoops.  why wont North ever lead @C's?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: lead the @DQ was better|pg||
nt|athene: more likely to smoke out the king|pg||
nt|athene: if east doesn't cover the jack that doesn't mean much|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|warrens:  but the finesse is also reasonable, since now W has to cash out to prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|athene: if he doesn't cover the queen - that is a stronger indication|pg||
