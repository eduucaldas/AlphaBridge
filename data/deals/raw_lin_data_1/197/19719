nt|athene: but east had denied any heart fit at all|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should just lead a safer diamond|pg||
mb|1S|nt|davidstern: 4@H looks like the go here with a bonud for picking the @HQ|pg||

nt|athene: seeing "wackwitz E" is confusing :) he isn't east!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|davidstern: I am "guessing" that 3@C showed normal opening and 3@D showed shortage|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to bid on, i prefer something other than 3@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: south's problem is that anything sounds constructive|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2nt or 3@C sound MORE constructive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: 2@S possible i think|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobholl: in BAM missing a game is not that bad but i guess they will loose at this one|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|sJ|nt|davidstern: Got a club lead and picked hearts throwing the losing spade on the 13th club  - voila easy game|pg||
nt|davidstern: As noted West opened the bidding (certainly not my taste) leading declarer to take the finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: In fact it would take some serious threat to make me open the West hand even as a youth player|pg||
nt|davidstern: And I guess the result is a good indication of why it isnt such a good idea|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: referee at the table, the player had said the gap with spades, then changed the club|pg||

mc|9|nt|twcho: if 2N is intended for invitation, no reason for west to reject the invite with his absolute maximum hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  my only guess: East thought 2@H after the X promised a club stopper, so he bid NT with his 4333 hand and West passed 2NT because he didn't have a stopper.  but it still seems strange to me.|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1S92HJTD865CKQ7642,SKQ5HKQ53DAK32C83,SA8643H742DT94CAJ,SJT7HA986DQJ7CT95|sv|e|nt|athene: he certainly didn't expect to make that :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but is only 1 point (BAM)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I should point out that the tables are not linked despite there showing a result from the other room. The Other room in this case are not team mates|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: there was a case for east ducking the spade lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: not clearcut but these tricks often come back|pg||
nt|davidstern: Thanks to our host I am informed: TD and a referee is the same in English, because there is only one word for both in Italian|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: do we know if 2@H promises specifically black suits? or could it be spades and diamonds as well?|pg||
nt|athene: unless 4@H is very narrowly defined it doesn't really help EW|pg||
nt|athene: the point is, you know south is going to bid 4@S over it, every hand|pg||
nt|athene: so|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidstern: I am not a big fam of the 3NT rather than a simple 2@C bid unless their system doesnt allow it. |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if it might be very weak, west just has to pass|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobholl: west will "know" it is @C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but then east is committed to bidding 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Best lead by West which probably wouldnt have happened had South bid 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: declarer was going to have a lot of trouble getting to hand in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: @HA lead and it doesn't look so easy|pg||
nt|athene: east really bid 2nt with a heart fit and no club stop?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: 5@H was certainly very weird|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|davidstern: South Has 4-4-1-1 tricks so perhaps should have taken the second club hoping to manufacture an 11th trick|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think this will win the board|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: i thought west just had a choice between pass and double|pg||

nt|twcho: your sole purpose is to beat the other table score|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|twcho: 1N|pg||
nt|twcho: but south can use checkback if he wants|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, this should be a terrific result, since they can score 4 @H's, 4@D's and either 2@C's or 1@C and 1@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|warrens:  need to make 4 if 4@H's is making|pg||
nt|warrens:  so he should take the @C finesse if one is played now|pg||
nt|twcho: what is your choice for north rebid then?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would raise to 2@H.  I have Aces, which are good for suit play, and I have only 2 @S's, good for ruffing.  but, I admit, maybe not in B-A-M|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: even if you open 1@D with 44 minors and a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: it's better to open 1@C with the strong balanced hands|pg||
nt|athene: firstly because you get your transfers going|pg||
nt|athene: secondly because you are not so worried about intervention|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surprising pass by North on this hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: chances are you are just going to end up playing it in 3nt or 4 of a major|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: south would rebid 1@H with any weak notrump with 2 or 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 1nt is the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: that means you have 2nt available for something else|pg||
nt|athene: and it also means you can respond safely with nothing with a major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|athene: well - "more safely"|pg||
nt|athene: the main worry when you respond on a 2 count or so is that partner will jump to 2nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @S iguess but @C unfriendly :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: (playing standard methods)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: this lead suggests very strongly that the @SA is right|pg||
nt|athene: as west would lead a spade most of the time without the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer will not be sure enough of that to risk his contract|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: haha, south intending to finesse the @H10?|pg||
nt|athene: basically a victory here for the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would not be so great - on a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: but now declarer plays in the best available spot of 4@H and scores 620 for a loss|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|s3|nt|athene: ok, not now|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: to rectify the count for a squeeze in case no suit is behaving|pg||

nt|twcho: so NS has whitewashed their opponents in this round|pg||
nt|twcho: and we have two new teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: yes noe 3 each|pg||

nt|athene: if you finesse for the @HQ here and it loses, you then have a problem in diamonds, as you can't let someone get a ruff with a small trump as well|pg||
nt|athene: cashing @HAK simplifies things as you are safe on a 3-2 trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@H i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: it's not certain to be right (for example east might have @HQxxx) but it often is best to refuse the finesse for the queen in this sort of situation|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: i have seen Hamman opening these 2@H|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: but 1@H more common i think|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|athene: many people would be frightened by the redouble into bidding only 1@S with the east hand|pg||
nt|athene: but 2@S is definitely right|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S just lets NS sort their hands out much easier|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives them a problem|pg||
nt|athene: now north doesn't know how strong his partner is|pg||
nt|athene: he might very well not even know if 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|athene: easy to say he should - i bet most partnerships would not be on firm ground here|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H 2! S all pass ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|athene: south might now offer 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|athene: hi Hedy :))|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|athene: useful to have a second commentator as i might be ranting nonsense at any moment and no-one would know|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|hedyg: like this at least 1 person is reading your comments!|pg||
nt|hedyg: here we see no Muiderberg 2@H opening with a 6 card major|pg||
nt|bobholl: IF (big if) this makes will be good|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with 5@c is it has at least 3 losers|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: 4@H just might sneak home|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|athene: i think you might as well offer 4@H with south but of course it is easier seeing all the cards|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: Drijver a bit too optimistic?|pg||
nt|athene: there was a similar hand a couple of days ago where one of the netherlands players had 6 hearts and 5 clubs and ended in 5@C-1 where 4@H could have made|pg||
nt|hedyg: he raised @c so he assumes S has 5 @cs. in that case the hcps he has outside @c are pretty useless|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|athene: admittedly the winning line in 4@H on that hand involved a really bizarre squeeze so it might have failed anyway in practice|pg||
nt|athene: well this is what i was saying earlier|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|athene: 2@S was a good bid and made it very hard for NS to sort out how strong they were|pg||
nt|athene: no-one knows what 3@C shows on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: hard for north to pass it|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in 1NT which is luckier and bad defence (@D lead)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bobholl: but they'll go down anyway so may be a push|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s7|nt|athene: that is how you rack up 3@C+3 and other embarrassing scores|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: sorry about that Bill, i was not here . but again...if S is 5-5 how much is N worth?|pg||
nt|athene: east felt the heart underlead was wanting a club ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h7|pc|s2|nt|athene: well if south has a 5-5 16 count he is worth quite a bit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is N 7th trick which will decide (guess he'll go 2 down)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c9|nt|hedyg: and if he has............9hcps?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hK|nt|athene: are we all happy in our own partnerships that 3@C denies a good hand here?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|athene: maybe west should have shifted to a  bigger small heart (the @H7)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: to get the spade back|pg||
mc|9|nt|hedyg: then he should have bid a good/bad 2NT!|pg||
nt|athene: or even the @HJ in fact|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair though east did make the play which would always take the contract off|pg||
nt|athene: he can see that if his partner has the @SA it is not going away|pg||
nt|athene: but if west had a club void and not the @SA, the ruff might be necessary to beat|pg||

nt|athene: but maybe it doesn't |pg||
nt|athene: it didn't for Wackwitz anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe they dont play that|pg||
nt|bobholl: could have made in the end by ruffing a @C and give E a placing with @H :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry not made 1 down|pg||
nt|davidstern: East's @CK a good card to try and avoid an endplay|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@C EW or 4@H NS it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: So if NS get to 4@H EW should sacrifice in 5@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK so they made three on the previous board|pg||
nt|davidstern: I must leave you now - thanks for your company and keep safe. All the best to those in the North-East of the USA nunkering down for a Hurricane. See you soon|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: lets see whether they play Muiderberg at all...no they dont|pg||
nt|athene: NS given a MUCH easier ride in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: some would double 2@S with the west hand|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it's a little bit light with basically a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: now if you want to gamble you bid 3NT with the north hand i suppose|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|athene: a bit wet of EW not to get involved somehow|pg||
nt|athene: whether you gamble or not might depend on what useful information you can find out|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, so opener shows the shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now clubs less likely to be very bad for 3nt but on the other hand the diamonds not running|pg||
nt|athene: of course passing 3@D is a gentle way to have fun with partner :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i guess EW here play that double of 1@H would deny spades?|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@S is 4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes X= i have no bid|pg||
nt|athene: west may now offer spades en route to 3nt|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: maybe that is én route :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no en was fine|pg||
nt|athene: (3@S would be forcing showing three spades on this sort of auction, saying "do we play 3nt or 4@S?")|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 5 cards in @s E would bid 2@c|pg||
nt|athene: well, maybe|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|bobholl: west is not afraid but luckily his P has no @S control either|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt might make in practice|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt categorically denied five spades, then yes i guess no point showing them|pg||
nt|athene: south has the opponents' suits stopped|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: and he thinks his partner has a 1@H overcall :) well, maybe he does, maybe he doesn't|pg||
nt|athene: the @DKQ are not well-placed so i think this is an aggressive double|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's lead-directing, suggesting spade?|pg||
nt|athene: NS have a lot of tens which are working hard|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd overcalled and he has hcps and stops both suits bid by opps|pg||
nt|athene: a good example here of just how bad 4333 shapes are - EW have 25 hcp and they are going to need every single one|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: although even on a heart lead, when declarer sets up diamonds east gets to make some discards|pg||
nt|athene: so that and the combination of the heart spot led initially...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: also he wanted a @s lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|bobholl: @S ruff small and 1 with the ace and 4@H makes|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has 8 tricks fairly easily with the @DAJ well placed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|nt|athene: can he build a third trick in spades by leading towards the A8?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps squeeze south in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: spade shift now breaks up the squeeze i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: what good is ducking the @H trick?|pg||
nt|athene: west might be finding the little club|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: well he is just trying to tighten up the position to bring pressure to bear on south|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: interesting battle for tempo here|pg||
nt|hedyg: the switch to @s shows that KQ@D are in S|pg||
nt|athene: south has to lead a spade back and then if west sets up a long spade, south can set up HIS long spade|pg||
nt|athene: and use the @DKQ as an entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: with an entry to his hand N would have continued @H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer knows where the diamonds are|pg||
nt|athene: from the bidding and north's line of defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should know|pg||
nt|hedyg: CR S opened a Muiderberg 2@s, N bid 3@c pass or correct and 3@d was not a success|pg||
nt|athene: can south work out what to do here? leading a big spade is not at all obvious|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: ok, now the tempo is gone|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: of course it's very hard at BAM because if declarer has the @CQ, you might want to just cash out with the @CAK|pg||

mb|p|nt|warrens:  yes, if declarer plays a @S to the 10.  but they played in 3@D with better defense|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|hedyg: maybe 1@d was simply a relay bid|pg||

nt|athene: a tricky hand; declarer could have played differently to try to ensure 8 tricks, but if the overtrick is there, you want to make it|pg||
nt|athene: giving up on the trump finesse could be very costly if the king were actually onside|pg||
nt|athene: although as the play went after north showed up with @SA @HK @CQ he isn't going to have the @DK (he passed first time)|pg||
