nt|mcphee: the @D ruff is not really a major rush|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcphee: for example if a player were to take trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: ending on the table they can lead low to the Q@C|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||

nt|athene: interesting view to leave 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with three spades AND Jx|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|athene: maybe @DQ missed a chance ther e - if you played low, west might cash @CK then underlead diamond hoping for @DQ with pd as entry|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately, no entry for trump finesse|pg||
nt|athene: quite common with 4333 but not with that hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: he has nine tricks so just exits a diamond trying to tighten up the position for a squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe hoping someone will lead something nice :)|pg||
nt|psyck: not clear @d's should be 44|pg||
nt|athene: no, but 5-3 are ok too|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: he still isn't going down|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: this kills dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sK|nt|athene: drop the @HK there for entry to finesse trumps then run hearts, but of course, he doesn't want to alert them to the club weakness (he thinks)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: now it is beginning to look a  bit as though he is in 4@S :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c5|pc|d8|nt|athene: or maybe he thinks he is :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: It would not be unreasonable for West to bid 3NT over 2@S and it would have worked well here if North leads a spade. Not so well if a heart is led because you can't take your nine ...|pg||

nt|chrisky: also the AK of @D from w|pg||

nt|athene: west would surely open in third seat with @DAKxxx and a side king|pg||
nt|athene: but the issue was whether clubs were breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|granguru:  fantoni Delle Cave are using the principle of the Fast arrival here...|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  get as much IMPS early in the match so you can rely on them and play easily the rest of the hands :) |pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru:  Martens had a better @C than @s but gave preference to the major suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  was the price for bidding 3@s too steep for W?|pg||
nt|athene: i think most would bid 3@S over 3@C here with west yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  the loss was shared by both pairs |pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul seems pretty automatic|pg||
nt|athene: west is only worth 2@S if south had passed but you should usually be prepared to go up a level in competition to show a fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  the main loss was for staying in 2NT instead of 3@D in the other table|pg||
nt|athene: interesting here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer may refuse the club finesse on the grounds of trying to avoid a heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: only to find that refusing the club finesse is the play that incurs the ruff :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  my bet is he will get it right|pg||
nt|granguru:  it is very painful when this occurs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: of course if east does get a heart ruff, the @HK is still there anyway for a diamond pitch|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: well, that makes life easier|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, not much of a fight there|pg||
nt|eleni: this makes things easy|pg||
nt|granguru:  specially when at the other side they play the simple finesse...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  Fantoni maximized his chances atttacking with the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: no point covering unless you can promote something for your side|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|nt|athene: duck the @HQ was a possible play|pg||
nt|psyck: more risk of throwing @c tricks than @s tricks if pd has nothing in the suit|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: north might then do something friendly|pg||
nt|athene: how many clubs does east think his partner has? @C10xx?|pg||
nt|andyv:  seeing Q in dummy, there really can be no reason to cover J unless E thinks N overcalled on Jxxxx of @cs and play pd fof 10x|pg||
nt|granguru:  @c2 would not have been covered for sure.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: fantoni may or may not have been intending to finesse clubs but it doesn't cost to lead the jack|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|athene: trying to persuade someone to cover|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  so now should make 4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|granguru:  even if E does not cover N might decide according to the timing spent if it was best to finesse or go up|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: well, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: in my experience people always pause there with three small|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of 3@s bid by W may have led Fantoni astray in the @c suit|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: very surprising that south didn't raise clubs in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: even 3@C is a bit of an underbid maybe|pg||

nt|granguru:  too strong?|pg||
nt|mcphee: a bit heavy but why not|pg||
nt|andyv:  I pause because I always wonder what card will I play that partner will read much more into it than is intended|pg||
nt|granguru:  when I pause with 3 small I tell declarer "I do not have to cover"|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|psyck: vul i'd certainly chose 2@s, don't particularly mind it 1st seat NV either|pg||

pc|h6|nt|andyv:  everything sits well for declarer except the @c suit|pg||
nt|athene: Q9xx in a minor isn't really very appealing against 3nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. when NT bidder has denied a major|pg||
nt|granguru:  interesting that Fulvio selected @h instead of @s|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|psyck: yes, so perfect, 4@s does not make if you remove @hT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcphee: better to trump @D before taking trumps|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|granguru:  some kib say "he is a beginner"|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|athene: well, the heart is not going to give a trick away|pg||
nt|granguru:  but most probably he didnt want to give away a trick if partner has @SQxx or similar|pg||
nt|athene: the spade certainly could|pg||
nt|athene: give partner @SQxx and declarer @SA10x, say|pg||
nt|athene: something sick like that :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|granguru:  @HQ serves as @Hk @dK serves as @DA...therefore both hands together increased in value|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|granguru:  we have to take into account that now we are playing teams..giving away a trick is not important at all|pg||
nt|athene: also, some play that a double of 3nt when no suits have been shown, asks for a spade|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: so maybe if you have a close decision you lead a heart, when partner DIDN'T double|pg||
nt|granguru:  is the lead giving away THE CONTRACT?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h2|nt|granguru:  considering N bidding|pg||
pc|d8|nt|granguru:  what if MQ10xxx|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|pc|c8|nt|mcphee: i do not feel many pairs will bid this game|pg||
nt|mcphee: where do our audience find results from mixed pairs, anyone know?|pg||
nt|psyck: http://www.hellasbridge.org/apotelesmata/club/13|pg||
nt|granguru:  a 2@S opening permits to describe well distribution but fails in the strenght area|pg||
nt|psyck: allresults there, & new results updated everyday|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: the other scores in this room are -200, -200,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 2h-2|pg||
nt|athene: some will overcall 2@H with the north hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|athene: but double is much more sensible, to my mind|pg||
nt|granguru:  after 2@S (x) E can better see 9 tricks, but hard to see 10|pg||
nt|mcphee: some will open 2@S in which case N/S are in erious issues|pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 2@H and hearts are not the right suit, you can be in big trouble, never able to find your good minor fit|pg||
nt|athene: if west opened 2@S, of course it would be even more clear to double, rather than overcall hearts|pg||

nt|athene: @HJ10 doubleton for a start|pg||

pc|s3|nt|athene: after the double of 3@H that is - so you know south hasn't got @HKQ|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|athene: no way declarer was taking that deep finesse|pg||
nt|granguru:  @HQ or @s?|pg||

nt|granguru:  @HQ seems better|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: here martens knows that if west has a "normal" 3@S raise, his partner is guaranteed to be short in spades with some useful cards, so double is a lot easier|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe @d5 instead of the beer card to make it clear no @s honor|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|granguru:  only with both majors they may bid a 1 opening with a "weak" hand, say 11-13|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  any 54 except both majors|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to maintain a diplomatic silence rather than tell everyone about the distribution|pg||
nt|athene: passed partner, no suit quality - he doesn't think he is winning this auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N is going down|pg||
nt|granguru:  by Law limit I try to say that in competitive auctions with 8 cards you should compete up to 8 tricks(2-level) with 9 cards uptothe 3-level, etc.  |pg||
nt|granguru:  a mini moysean fit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: only 8 tricks on @h lead with opps having 6 before you can enjoy them|pg||
nt|athene: the problem here is the lack of aces on the side|pg||
nt|granguru:  if you open with 5 cards probabilities are that you find 2.66 suport cards in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: when you are in 3nt based on a long suit, you really want "hard" side tricks|pg||
nt|athene: one ace is more use than KQJ10|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have their suit all dressed up and ready to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: the good thing about aces, is they prevent the opps from having a quick entry to the suit the establish|pg||
nt|athene: well the good thing is they are a trick which you don't need to lose the lead to establish|pg||
nt|athene: EW have @DKQJ and @SKQ and they are no use at all|pg||
