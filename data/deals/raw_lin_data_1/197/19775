nt|marlowepi: yes, declarer could hardly have Axx of clubs|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|pelu: but it has been 10 hards days for the young players|pg||
mb|r|nt|marlowepi: pretty strong for Multi, even at these colors, but as i mentioned earlier, the national tendency in france is to be solid|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of play - and prob some party'es :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: I would also open 2@D :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even within the context of French standards, 2D is marginal I think because of the playability in spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: obviously a style thing|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here all roads lead to 4S, though the D lead would probably be somewhat harder to read had the opening bid been 1H|pg||
nt|pelu: to day - spec in Europe - a lot of playeres know very well how to defend against Multi, so there are "many" who play Multi a little more contructiv that before |pg||
nt|marlowepi: here declarer can afford to suffer a ruff and it might well simplify the play for him by drawing a half-round of trumps:)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: indeed, they are working hard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unlike us:)|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure, and the job is hard just to follow bidding and play - there have bene some very fine operators in Croatia (with some help form Italy :))|pg||
