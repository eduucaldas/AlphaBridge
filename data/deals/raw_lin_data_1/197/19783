nt|vugraphzjf: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Auken did not play the king unless the queen was played from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if that is because she thought declarer would definitely rise queen with Ax in her hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Bridge is too difficult for me if I am to assume that partner has underled an ace|pg||

nt|chrisky: hi Roland|pg||

nt|bmkl: trying the cross ruff way |pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: only reason for it one can think of anyway|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer needs to ruff all @H to make the contract|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: one of those situations that a new partnership are going to have trouble with|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW are near 6@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes, balancing 2@H is just such a good idea at MP that even when you have a misunderstanding it's not so bad|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: fantoni didn't cash his @DA because he wanted west to win a diamond and play a heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|granguru:  so any number of down cant be so bad|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|athene: as well as "double is always takeout" it's good to play "2nt is never natural" :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't strictly necessary as the cards lie - east could, for example, give a ruff-and-discard when in with the @SK, and it wouldn't cost - but this is sensible defence anyway|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  I said almost 6...only 5 because N overuffs the @S |pg||
pc|s6|nt|eleni: the moment of truth :)|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might run this, in which case east gets the ruff too|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|eleni: good decision by Nick|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: looking at it from EW's point of view, this is why you simply can't let people get away with non-vul sacrifices undoubled|pg||

nt|athene: it's so rare that 2nt will be your best spot|pg||
mb|1S|an|!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting - many would not use a support double there, as 1@S promises five|pg||
nt|granguru:  use them as lebensohl or mouse or rubensohl or some adjunct or whatever...|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe NS play it doesn't, or maybe they think it's still useful to differentiate between 3- and 4-card support |pg||
nt|psyck: some play 1@s as 4+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 1@S only shows 4+ for that pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't know their agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: wrong couple sat on the table so the board will be canceled?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: let's start and see|pg||
nt|athene: they shouldn't be sitting on the table at all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sitting on the table is really not nice no matter what|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|granguru:  pity for declarer that @S8 is not in his hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  another @S will establish the @SJ if taken, but also potencially promoting a @s for the defense |pg||
nt|granguru:  up to now we can count 2@c 2@S 2@d 2@h|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|granguru:  ducking imporuves a little declarer position as the suit became freezed now |pg||
nt|mathat: now x@h to K and x @H|pg||
nt|athene: declarer lacks the entries to bring in spades, but he doesn't know whether they are 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: that is one advantage for the defence of ducking the second spade|pg||
nt|athene: if they won the ace and shifted, declarer could keep the spades in reserve|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer knows @s position perfectly well|pg||
nt|athene: but now, if he wants to take advantage of a 3-3 break he has to risk setting up another trick for the defence|pg||
nt|granguru:  because W threw @S7 instead of the @S6|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni couldnt know W @s cards when he started playing 9 and 10|pg||
nt|mathat: ansd cave 2@s first|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's true|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni plays usually SLAVINSKY leads and udca in middle game|pg||
nt|athene: @S7 was a better card then|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|d2|nt|athene: sorry @S6 was better|pg||
nt|athene: because fantoni would be able to drop the big ones if he had the 7|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|granguru:  anyhow these are honest players..so the very long thought on taking or not with the @SA gives declarer a picture of what is happening|pg||
nt|athene: east can't afford a red card, but declarer is short of entries to use a long club of course|pg||
pc|d3|nt|granguru:  Fulvio is having trouble keeping stoppers in 3 suits|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|c2|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Manos and everyone|pg||
nt|athene: can still make|pg||
nt|athene: it's really a cute position though i think|pg||
nt|mathat: hi andy|pg||
nt|athene: let's say east exits a club|pg||
nt|athene: and west does NOT unblock|pg||
nt|granguru:  @c looks best because you see stiff @CA|pg||
nt|granguru:  but is it really?|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can cash @HAK and throw west in with a spade|pg||
nt|granguru:  a complex position|pg||
nt|athene: west cashes @SA, @Ck but then must lead into the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: now|pg||
nt|granguru:  as you see Fulvio is taking his time|pg||
nt|athene: if west DOES unblock the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: instead declarer can throw east in with the club!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: and make him lead into the hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eleni: @hwelcome Andy|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Eleni@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play by W|pg||
nt|athene: right now @DAK, small heart and duck when east splits|pg||
nt|athene: IF you read the cards|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @HK first|pg||
nt|andyv:  easy for us to see here...much tougher at table|pg||
nt|granguru:  a good play ..W doesnt want to be triple squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: well, declarer knows the black suit layout doesn't he|pg||
nt|granguru:  he transfered the @c responsability to his partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok, as specs are pointing out, east can't lead a diamond of course either|pg||
nt|athene: so you don't need to cash the @DAK to strip his cards there|pg||
nt|granguru:  to keep @s and @d|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: splinter (not @S)|pg||

nt|chrisky: play the j and a small @H...|pg||
nt|mcphee: if he plays J i will be very surprised|pg||

nt|mcphee: brb\|pg||
nt|vugraphzjg: israel-greece 0-1 for the euro 2012 qualify|pg||
nt|mcphee: the closed room is playing the same 3NT on  7 and have a chance to make|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer managed 9 tricks in teh 3N contract  for a 1 imp loss|pg||
nt|mcphee: in the other room i believe they are going to stop in 4@h|pg||
nt|mcphee: on the 8th board, so a few more imps to Fantoni|pg||
nt|mcphee: they also climbed to 6@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: so it seems a push or a possible make with a bit better line of play|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N could have made on deal 7 other table, but declarer misguessed the ending|pg||
nt|mcphee: same opening lead of a @C in the closed room|pg||
nt|psyck: the good news is that Fantoni is not playing it, so we don't have too long a wait now|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6@H is going to fail at the other table at least 1 trick, declarer crossed to the K@S and led a @h to the K|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: he was down the way the play was given|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psyck: 3N in practice|pg||
nt|granguru:  3NT seems to be the prefered one|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt on a heart lead - what's the best play in diamonds?|pg||
nt|granguru:  e should bid NT now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even when playing 2/1 you need an agreement as to whether you can reverse with a minimum|pg||
nt|chrisky: and 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: did he get it right?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|eleni: Last board of this segment. 2 more to follow today and tomorrow broadcast starts 2 hours earlier:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|granguru:  @DAKQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a little better than finessing|pg||
nt|psyck: low to T is % in @d|pg||
nt|athene: finesse the @D10 is best for 5 tricks and best for max expectation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The world is divided. Does 2@S show extra values or not|pg||
mb|4C|nt|psyck: 42% according to suitplay.exe|pg||
nt|athene: according to my big, boring, dusty tome of suit combinations|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Apparently not for EW here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|psyck: for 5 tricks, & 93% for 4|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|athene: but here of course there is the little matter of getting to dummy enough times|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: entries to be considered though|pg||
nt|athene: you don't know spades are 3-3|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|athene: (or @S10 coming down) so must be better to play diamonds from the top|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|mathat: sam e lead|pg||
nt|mathat: in other room|pg||
nt|granguru:  need some guesses..mainly in trump suit|pg||
nt|athene: no-one likes to go down at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: so unless it's hugely the best odds play, no finesse!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: you have to decide:- set up clubs, set up diamonds, or crossruff?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|psyck: yes, from top best with only 1 sure entry|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: crossruff looks reasonable to me|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzjf: a really bad score for N-S|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s does not show extras as i play it, but there are different styles there|pg||
nt|athene: maybe South decided that her partner ought to rise with @CK to clear hearts|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d2|mc|10|nt|granguru:  -1 or -2 is not so important at imps|pg||
nt|athene: in some situations you much prefer -2 :)|pg||
nt|athene: for example if you bid a grand, -2 might be ok, against 6-1 in the other room|pg||
