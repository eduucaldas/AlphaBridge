nt|athene: unless 4@H is very narrowly defined it doesn't really help EW|pg||

nt|pelu: tx - u are great :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: or - as I play - 2@D - |pg||
nt|kakashi84: me too|pg||
nt|kakashi84: the hand is too weak|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  Would you then as south have driven on to game ?|pg||
nt|kakashi84: me, I think pass is an option possible|pg||
nt|kakashi84: on the opening|pg||
nt|pelu: not for me - I only pass if I have a weak 2 with 4 card in other major|pg||
nt|kakashi84: me in 1/2 position, if have not 2 on 3 big honnor, I pass|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  Me to Peter. But I think I would have driven to game as south 2s - 2 nt - 3 h (good points bad suit) - ? Or a similar sequence|pg||
nt|kakashi84: but on the opening 2@s I think, they go to game|pg||
nt|pelu: I would have the contract on Ss hand|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  That would make the defence harder Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: but prob I would also be in 4@s|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|athene: even if you open 1@D with 44 minors and a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: it's better to open 1@C with the strong balanced hands|pg||
nt|athene: firstly because you get your transfers going|pg||
nt|athene: secondly because you are not so worried about intervention|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: chances are you are just going to end up playing it in 3nt or 4 of a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south would rebid 1@H with any weak notrump with 2 or 3 hearts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: so 1nt is the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: that means you have 2nt available for something else|pg||
nt|athene: and it also means you can respond safely with nothing with a major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|athene: well - "more safely"|pg||
nt|athene: the main worry when you respond on a 2 count or so is that partner will jump to 2nt|pg||

pc|s8|nt|athene: (playing standard methods)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: this lead suggests very strongly that the @SA is right|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: many people would be frightened by the redouble into bidding only 1@S with the east hand|pg||
nt|athene: but 2@S is definitely right|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S just lets NS sort their hands out much easier|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives them a problem|pg||
nt|athene: now north doesn't know how strong his partner is|pg||
nt|athene: he might very well not even know if 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|athene: easy to say he should - i bet most partnerships would not be on firm ground here|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H 2! S all pass ?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|athene: south might now offer 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|athene: hi Hedy :))|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|athene: useful to have a second commentator as i might be ranting nonsense at any moment and no-one would know|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: like this at least 1 person is reading your comments!|pg||
nt|hedyg: here we see no Muiderberg 2@H opening with a 6 card major|pg||
nt|bobholl: IF (big if) this makes will be good|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: the problem with 5@c is it has at least 3 losers|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: 4@H just might sneak home|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: i think you might as well offer 4@H with south but of course it is easier seeing all the cards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: Drijver a bit too optimistic?|pg||
nt|athene: there was a similar hand a couple of days ago where one of the netherlands players had 6 hearts and 5 clubs and ended in 5@C-1 where 4@H could have made|pg||
nt|hedyg: he raised @c so he assumes S has 5 @cs. in that case the hcps he has outside @c are pretty useless|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly the winning line in 4@H on that hand involved a really bizarre squeeze so it might have failed anyway in practice|pg||
nt|athene: well this is what i was saying earlier|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S was a good bid and made it very hard for NS to sort out how strong they were|pg||
nt|athene: no-one knows what 3@C shows on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: hard for north to pass it|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in 1NT which is luckier and bad defence (@D lead)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: but they'll go down anyway so may be a push|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|athene: that is how you rack up 3@C+3 and other embarrassing scores|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: sorry about that Bill, i was not here . but again...if S is 5-5 how much is N worth?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: well if south has a 5-5 16 count he is worth quite a bit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is N 7th trick which will decide (guess he'll go 2 down)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|hedyg: and if he has............9hcps?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess EW here play that double of 1@H would deny spades?|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@S is 4+|pg||

nt|athene: west may now offer spades en route to 3nt|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: maybe that is én route :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no en was fine|pg||
nt|athene: (3@S would be forcing showing three spades on this sort of auction, saying "do we play 3nt or 4@S?")|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 5 cards in @s E would bid 2@c|pg||
nt|athene: well, maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: west is not afraid but luckily his P has no @S control either|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: if 2nt categorically denied five spades, then yes i guess no point showing them|pg||
nt|athene: south has the opponents' suits stopped|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: and he thinks his partner has a 1@H overcall :) well, maybe he does, maybe he doesn't|pg||
nt|athene: the @DKQ are not well-placed so i think this is an aggressive double|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's lead-directing, suggesting spade?|pg||
nt|athene: NS have a lot of tens which are working hard|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd overcalled and he has hcps and stops both suits bid by opps|pg||
nt|athene: a good example here of just how bad 4333 shapes are - EW have 25 hcp and they are going to need every single one|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: also he wanted a @s lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S ruff small and 1 with the ace and 4@H makes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: well, he has 8 tricks fairly easily with the @DAJ well placed|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|h2|nt|athene: can he build a third trick in spades by leading towards the A8?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: or perhaps squeeze south in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: spade shift now breaks up the squeeze i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: what good is ducking the @H trick?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: well he is just trying to tighten up the position to bring pressure to bear on south|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: interesting battle for tempo here|pg||
nt|hedyg: the switch to @s shows that KQ@D are in S|pg||
nt|athene: south has to lead a spade back and then if west sets up a long spade, south can set up HIS long spade|pg||
nt|athene: and use the @DKQ as an entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: with an entry to his hand N would have continued @H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer knows where the diamonds are|pg||
nt|athene: from the bidding and north's line of defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should know|pg||
nt|hedyg: CR S opened a Muiderberg 2@s, N bid 3@c pass or correct and 3@d was not a success|pg||
nt|athene: can south work out what to do here? leading a big spade is not at all obvious|pg||
