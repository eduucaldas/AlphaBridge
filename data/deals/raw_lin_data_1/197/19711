pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|dslee: thanks mak|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sunit thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: It is rare that 2C is passed,  2C can be a big hand, just short of a jumpshift or 2NT bid as it was here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: pls check scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  with an opening hand and 3@d, 2N is a bit of an underbid but E was able to raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders have changed now it is Jaggy and Dalal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nkgupt: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi welcome NK|pg||
nt|dslee: none of these folks except sunit is very spontenous - i wonder why this bid happened|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is headed for 3NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ianmcc: looks like -100, with care|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi in long trance |pg||
nt|nkgupt: did not understand seeking pd's opinion and then overrule him :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dslee: well there you see|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|strike12: we have every round updates at the above link, so keep urself posted |pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: After this round will be lunch break and we shall be back at 1345 i.e. after 1 hr 45 minutes |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ianmcc: 10 should score well continuing clubs pays off|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, this certainly is safe enough|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  but to bid it, E has to imagine exactly such a hand by partner - with long side suit|pg||
nt|peachy: W needs to have control of the auction, E described his in opening and then 3S, I assume|pg||
nt|peachy: This is still makeable if declarer is careful|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|psridhar: Anil will lose 2@h and 4 trumps for d1|pg||

pc|d4|nt|strike12: too late nw|pg||
nt|babs59: I must admit to being somewhat unfamiliar with Invititational Pairs where threesomes play!|pg||
nt|psridhar: now even d2 ? kind of dummy reversal defense with long trump taking two ruffs?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  not much worse in NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  true as to play of hand...and 1N usually fine with a 5 card major...here, however, the major is top heavy and the outside points are in Aces...those cards belong in a suit contract.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: another trouble hand, but not big trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N balanced in passout seat over 1N, E dbld and W played in 2@d, making|pg||
mb|2S|an|alerted|nt|strike12: W might just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: that puts Arun in a fix|pg||
nt|ianmcc: noone told Anil Padhy|pg||
nt|peachy: Was fortunate they had the agreement to show max with good supp|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ianmcc: Isn't this pairs?|pg||
nt|panja: 25 HCP..this should be a routine game..10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this foursome have played for INdia so many times|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: it is IMP pairs |pg||
nt|strike12: 6@s is on if bid|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not familiar with NS system, sorry|pg||
nt|peachy: Standard, with transfers over 1C opening, I was told|pg||
nt|peachy: If anyone interested to see what K & R hand evaluator says about it, here http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@hX -1 or -2 looks about right|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|strike12: This will be costly for EW|pg||
nt|strike12: Very Costly now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: OK tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: total 28 contestanting pairs |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all play all each pair plays 6 boards against each other barometer|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Modified Precision|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N opens with the end-contract possible, but both sides here have to tell something|pg||
mb|4S|nt|strike12: is N still thinking for a Save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could go down 4|pg||
nt|panja: if W gets to underlead the @CA sometime..it could get interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should duck this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but success!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|andyv:  I mean N|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Anil knows it alright-but his 5@d was calculated to test Arun -he knows he has long @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: we will do without those snacks but pl provide us coffee :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: that is abut 45 minutes from now |pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you kibs and Mak|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: no X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes was a pause |pg||
nt|ianmcc: how do we get a score so fast?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ianmcc: bad bad|pg||

nt|psridhar: it is easy to be careless on such hands|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|babs59: would I fly the DK?  I doubt it - but I would wonder why they'd led dummy's suit (such a lead is usually a singleton)|pg||

mc|10|nt|peachy: South decided to try sqz|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if so you are dead anyway|pg||

mb|4H|nt|strike12: Kokish relay on 2@c going on here|pg||

mb|p|nt|strike12: undo pls|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - he's more likely to downgrade than upgrade that hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hut off!|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: and 2D could be on a 3532 hand shape too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N played by Subhash may be in trouble on @s lead|pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.com/ website with info and results after Round 9|pg||
nt|babs59: that North hand is remarkably similar to Kiran's hand last board!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: certainly not 5@d|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner's strength is unknown and the decn to bid 5@s is making an unwarranted assumption tht they can make and we shd save|pg||

nt|babs59: 2D by Subhash won't pose any difficulties tho|pg||

nt|twcho: 7@d is probably the best contract|pg||

nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board?  yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  low level bid and acceptable doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: one more after this |pg||

mb|6H|nt|vugraphzjh: IMPS Total|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 6 boards per rd, Total IMPs scoring (Pairs)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D will go one down for sure...two likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: trying to correct the score of last deal|pg||

nt|ianmcc: opportunity lost|pg||
nt|sga1: you never know, S may carry on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
nt|panja: ah..the lead solves one big problem for the Declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: He is following the pronciple that the person short in their fit suit must be aggressive, but I'm sure he too wishes his 5HCP in hearts were in another suit :)|pg||
nt|peachy: *principle|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: GIB might show this as one down...but will likely be -2|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: will be S Gupta Venky Vs Sreedharan Daxindas|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzjh: sandeep in a trance|pg||
nt|babs59: Venky has a great hand opposite Majors|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is Drury...@H fit...|pg||
nt|panja: gives a chance to North to have some say|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes min 4card as announced|pg||
nt|twcho: north could double|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some X|pg||
mb|d|nt|babs59: pity the splinters are the same suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sunit has gr8 support for @d too -but 500 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so Rajesh after exlaation took his bid back |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, he doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders before this round are |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should N bid better minor this time? I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S Gupta Venky are current leaders|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should S introduce 6th- heart or 3-cards @s support - a problem indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Aah, we get to watch the leaders next round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 12 tricks here...with @S 32..and @C finesse in|pg||
nt|sga1: Satya showing one @s honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggy Dalal 1313|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: it is not a good slam to bid...with @D values, most of them, wasted|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry for the scoring error on board 34 I am not able to correct it .Kindly bear|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ianmcc: too many|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: at the bottom of the page there is a hyperlink to results |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing ordinary 1NTF, North's rebid is 2C|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: inquiry from declerer about the lead |pg||
nt|strike12: 10 tricks now |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing support doubles, the decision is pretty easy = Dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  N good enough to bid 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2Raju Tolani Ajay Khare 1186|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 Subhash Gupta Venky 1036|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was a chance|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzjh: Ajay thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the rare exception when it could only be 2-card suit, normally longer minor or 2C with 3-3 minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a bid by S!|pg||
nt|peachy: South's bid is much too frisky, given their methods, but he is probably attempting to get something back from the unfortunate -930.  I dont like that strategy though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder what was the reason|pg||
nt|peachy: But that is an "if" because I dont know if they have Support Dbl on card|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and with @c shortness the choice could be dbl|pg||
nt|panja: similarly, @H values in N hand are wasted...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nkgupt: dont think 4@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and to win it - an easy deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: transfer?!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|babs59: thanks Makulky - seems the top 3 just keep shifting around :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3 level toxic|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 VM lal Bhiwandkar 980|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North over the top|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Subhash Gupta + Venky |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but not impossible - well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2 Ashok Goel Sudhir Aggrawal Suhas Vaidya|pg||
nt|babs59: the 4S/5H hand went badly for Raju and Ajay (currently 2nd place) at the other table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: when is restart? I need dinner|pg||
nt|babs59: they over-reached to 5S, -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on  15|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 5 Ashok Goel  Suhas Vaidya Siudhir Aggarwal 681|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzjh: director called |pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will win a couple of IMPs in the wash here|pg||
nt|panja: S knows North's shape now...but he does not know where the honours are..|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzjh: so this match shud pull them back up |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u after 15 minutes|pg||
