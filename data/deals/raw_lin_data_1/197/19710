nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: alerted|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good stuff where will the music stop?|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: a big pickup for NS as they gain in terms of Total Imps|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N made good decision - knowing partner has good @h fit, N sees 6 tricks in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ianmcc: another trouble hand, but not big trouble|pg||

nt|peachy: If anyone interested to see what K & R hand evaluator says about it, here http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@hX -1 or -2 looks about right|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzjh: The Pair of A Goel and Suhas Vaidya will be playing for Indian in this BB|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: This will be costly for EW|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: all play all each pair plays 6 boards against each other barometer|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Modified Precision|pg||

mb|4H|nt|strike12: is N still thinking for a Save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could go down 4|pg||
nt|panja: if W gets to underlead the @CA sometime..it could get interesting|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but success!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|andyv:  I mean N|pg||

nt|ianmcc: how do we get a score so fast?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this score is only a comparison of the two vugraph tables|pg||
nt|psridhar: +300|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: bad bad|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzjh: the game is tooo fast to make all explanations of alerted bids here|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he might make if he doesn't touch hearts|pg||

nt|psridhar: it is easy to be careless on such hands|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|babs59: would I fly the DK?  I doubt it - but I would wonder why they'd led dummy's suit (such a lead is usually a singleton)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims 10|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: South decided to try sqz|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if so you are dead anyway|pg||
nt|babs59: however, everyone at this table knows each other's game and style very well, so it might depend on that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|buddyshah: trying 11 |pg||

nt|ianmcc: 4@h for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: can NS find 3N here?|pg||

nt|peachy: South is a She, sorry all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: np my fault of entering names :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: East should have bid 4@h fast|pg||

mb|2D|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|andyv:  tough call for S|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h could go for 800|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be the lunch break and next match will start at 1400 Hrs IST i.e about an hr from now|pg||
nt|babs59: Kiran and Satya play transfer responses to 1C, so this shows spades|pg||
mb|2S|an|alerted|nt|ianmcc: this one interesting Little for anyone|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opponents are guessing and the 5-level too expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: but She has played for India in BB several times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: in the open catagory |pg||
nt|peachy: Hearts play remarkably well|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: subhash writing explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: pls visit http://royale.hpage.com for running scores |pg||
nt|babs59: it might go 1H  1S  2D  P?|pg||

nt|ianmcc: counting carefully I see 5@c should fail|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|strike12: Kokish relay on 2@c going on here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@c was an underbid, lucky|pg||
nt|ianmcc: perhaps they will reach 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggi  + Dalal|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: undo pls|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - he's more likely to downgrade than upgrade that hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing small @h E expectes exactly the @hK, Ace could have been better, as for me|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|sfoxa:  hut off!|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: and 2D could be on a 3532 hand shape too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N played by Subhash may be in trouble on @s lead|pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.com/ website with info and results after Round 9|pg||
nt|babs59: that North hand is remarkably similar to Kiran's hand last board!|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|ianmcc: certainly not 5@d|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner's strength is unknown and the decn to bid 5@s is making an unwarranted assumption tht they can make and we shd save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@d better|pg||
nt|babs59: 2D by Subhash won't pose any difficulties tho|pg||
nt|panja: this will be difficult..|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North has a beautiful hand in this auction, the auction made it even beter than it initially is|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: Suhas thinking|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@s likes @h, pass or correct|pg||
nt|sga1: 2NT = 24-25 HCP|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ianmcc: maybe only 100|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: 3@c = Puppet Stayman, 3@D = one major|pg||

mb|4D|nt|peachy: Playing Precision, N might not be sure of South's diamond length though|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: hi Pramod, all|pg||
nt|panja: 7@D better than 7Nt here..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi this is Makarand ;)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N could be hardly blamed for this opening lead|pg||
nt|sga1: Heading towards 6NT|pg||
nt|sga1: He will bid 5NT, choose lsam or can be 6NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: on correct defense yes they can beat it by 1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not enough entries |pg||
nt|sga1: slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: or, rather, 7@S..|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@S cue, he has assumed @D as cue in support of @Cs|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ianmcc: @h now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jeetu in a trance|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: n    |pg||
nt|panja: and the play will go...remove trumps, ruff a Club...cash last trump discarding Dummy @S, and then @HAK..black suit squeeze if @S don't break|pg||
nt|twcho: 7@d is probably the best contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  was it @sK indeed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can only imagine S's desperation|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|twcho: with squeeze possibility|pg||
mb|6N|nt|peachy: I'm still looking to understand why K might have worked/under what circumstances|pg||
nt|peachy: Good play, tring to make and if the 8 didnt work, didnt matter because it was going down anyway without it|pg||
nt|babs59: the club at trick 2 was a tidy play, despite the CA offside|pg||
nt|sga1: 1-4 key card assuming @C as suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: Ashok finally makes the bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: suhas explaining the auction to Rajeev|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: of course @S are 32...so there are easy 13 tricks..|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: google says Scott, but apol accepted|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  still has to lose 1@c and 4@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nkgupt: did not even try for @dkj stiff|pg||
nt|panja: now..this might go two down...@C ruff too early wasn't all that useful|pg||
nt|nkgupt: ?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: did he do that?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|peachy: No entries to do it AND return to dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: marked most of the outside values with West...  but East's diamond return was kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|peachy: Still prob will, though, N and S in no trouble following suit or discarding|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya claimiing|pg||

nt|ianmcc: I think @d9 promotes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably about 95% responsible for that disaster|pg||
nt|sga1: As per latest running scores, Raju Tolani and Ajay Khare have overtaken Subhash - Venky|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: to open S or not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html is the exact webpage for running scores |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for E/W but not in clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: X looks brave - will he pass 5@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya in a trance|pg||
mb|1H!|an|trf|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
nt|peachy: East hand is much too good for any sort of premptive action, 1S is normal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: where are the present pairs running?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all scores may be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@d shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sga1: Transfers in Intervention - a good tool|pg||
nt|sga1: Now slam chances with aggressive bidding by S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too hard for the elderly|pg||
nt|babs59: pick a slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: is this Match Points or IMPS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd suggest 2@s bid by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C might be transfer, in competition|pg||
nt|peachy: transfer to 2D, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was alerted by Satya |pg||
nt|sga1: Now 5@c cue should take them to slam|pg||
mb|2D|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board?  yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  low level bid and acceptable doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: one more after this |pg||
nt|babs59: now 6D by Satya, and 6H by Kiran|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: IMPS Total|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@H showing 4+ @s, 1NT - denies 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 6 boards per rd, Total IMPs scoring (Pairs)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D will go one down for sure...two likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: trying to correct the score of last deal|pg||
nt|panja: W is taking a huge gamble with that double, holding five of his HCP in @H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opportunity lost|pg||
nt|sga1: you never know, S may carry on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good sequence|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
nt|panja: ah..the lead solves one big problem for the Declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: He is following the pronciple that the person short in their fit suit must be aggressive, but I'm sure he too wishes his 5HCP in hearts were in another suit :)|pg||
nt|peachy: *principle|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: GIB might show this as one down...but will likely be -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  only  point of interest on this hand is if N can guess the @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly without the lightner it is easier to beat slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: and board 1 reflects that policy too|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ianmcc: 1NT gets him into @h|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: rt|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must like to live dangerously....leaving the dbl in is not to be recommended to the faint of heart|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA, @dA, @d ruff, @h finesse, @d ruff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ianmcc: it will be North who carries on|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|panja: if East is smart enough to bring in Clubs to discard a loser...it will be -1...|pg||
nt|panja: but he does not know @C are 33...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: a@c lead shd do|pg||
nt|ianmcc: in reality I'd say hopeless|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: any other lead makes -at least dbl dummy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i mean any lead other than @c lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|babs59: pity the splinters are the same suit|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  should N bid better minor this time? I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S Gupta Venky are current leaders|pg||

nt|peachy: Aah, we get to watch the leaders next round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 12 tricks here...with @S 32..and @C finesse in|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphzjh: inquiry from declerer about the lead |pg||
nt|strike12: 10 tricks now |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing support doubles, the decision is pretty easy = Dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  N good enough to bid 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2Raju Tolani Ajay Khare 1186|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 Subhash Gupta Venky 1036|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: Ajay thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the rare exception when it could only be 2-card suit, normally longer minor or 2C with 3-3 minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a bid by S!|pg||
nt|peachy: South's bid is much too frisky, given their methods, but he is probably attempting to get something back from the unfortunate -930.  I dont like that strategy though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder what was the reason|pg||
nt|peachy: But that is an "if" because I dont know if they have Support Dbl on card|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and with @c shortness the choice could be dbl|pg||
nt|panja: similarly, @H values in N hand are wasted...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nkgupt: dont think 4@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and to win it - an easy deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: transfer?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: thanks Makulky - seems the top 3 just keep shifting around :)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: but not impossible - well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2 Ashok Goel Sudhir Aggrawal Suhas Vaidya|pg||
nt|babs59: the 4S/5H hand went badly for Raju and Ajay (currently 2nd place) at the other table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: when is restart? I need dinner|pg||
nt|babs59: they over-reached to 5S, -1|pg||

nt|babs59: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: director called |pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I regret the errors in broadcasting |pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: but N might get fished by the lead and try something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 R Venkatesh A Srinivasan|pg||
nt|peachy: At least whenever I tried that , I just get more minus.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 round of @h let declarer with no chance|pg||
nt|nkgupt: to much values to miss the slam!!:)|pg||
nt|peachy: South has good controls everywhere so he is going for it|pg||
nt|panja: N could have @CK instead of @HQJ..and the bidding would have been the same|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ianmcc: this needs care|pg||
nt|twcho: how about trump lead and @d shift?|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzjh: about the explanation of the meaning of 2S now all ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 'slam' effect from last deal perhaps|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good auction for partnership|pg||
nt|peachy: This would have been a working sacrifice, had either N or S been void in clubs|pg||
