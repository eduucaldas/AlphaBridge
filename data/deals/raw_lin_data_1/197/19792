nt|Vugraphzkn: compete by bidding and play. Here, near the shore of river Glomma, the longest river in Norway, we can even hope to get sight of a swan or two when being outside having fresh air ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|rv: @ST is stand-out and best lead as suggested already by Bob|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6@C would be cute |pg||

mb|3C|nt|bobholl: 6@S is best pairs contract but will / migth fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes most players would i think|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: good time to have a bidding misunderstanding|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|rv: East has splinter option available in 2 suits, hence decided to just raise to 3@c and await developments|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: do you have 2 trump queens and 6 aces in this sequence ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead of @SA is logical here|pg||
nt|rv: normally when folks have fit in 2 suits, they play RKC for major even if minor fit was agreed first|pg||
nt|rv: a few others play DKC (double key card blackwood) where there are 6 aces (kings of both suits) and 2 queens|pg||

nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||

nt|roswolf: ??????????|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely the 10 was played|pg||
nt|rv: in MPs, it doesn't pay to bid 35-40% games unlike at IMPs where odds favor bidding such games esp if your side is red (Vul)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: sry 11 trikk|pg||
mc|11|nt|rv: at MPs, you compete vigorously for part-scores, but don't bid thin games|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless they make of course:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a break before the next round starts!?|pg||
nt|rv: in my view BAM scoring is toughest to play followed by MPs, IMPs is comparatively easier to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is very true|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, you will get a few deals to relax when only OTs/UTs at stake, unlike at MPs and BAM where you can't afford to relax at any moment|pg||
nt|roswolf: in england there is another form of very tough scoring - a combination of BAM + a vp spread based oon total aggregate swing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0219/2011-09-03-foss1.htm |pg||

mb|2D|nt|gracelin: Hi SS, close match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ssbux: China team start coming in the middle of the second segment|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's double showed 4+ of spade, and when West bid 3D he denied 3-card spade.  So 3S now is 2-card aalso seeking H stopper for 3NT|pg||
nt|ssbux: Indonesia team found their best denomination but may be 1 level too high|pg||
nt|gracelin: East of course cannot bid 3NT, he will probably pass 3S if he trust his partner's bidding|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|rv: if West had bid 2@s to show 5@h+5m, East might have still have bid 3n|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should have passed imo|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: yes agree, if he had to bid I prefer 2@s especially if it is played as split range|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: I may try 3Nt with the West hand, his hand is very No trump oriented |pg||
nt|roswolf: effectively he psyched and deserves a poor score|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d9|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|gracelin: south's trump shift is trying to find out whether he has a trump winner to help him decide the course for defense|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|rv: West in pre-balancing situation on South's 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is this? this guarantees a bottom|pg||

nt|roswolf: same fifference|pg||
nt|roswolf: difference|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rv: some folks play West's pass of redouble to show @ds?|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: dbl after a passed pard on a flat 10 hcp - the world has gone mad|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: exactly the same bidding in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and now n/s have found their best contract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: Hi all.|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand not suitable for defense and I might have bid 2@d instead of passing redouble in earlier round of bidding|pg||
nt|geot: Good lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|geot: If declarer takes the club finesse (remember, East made the t/o double) he will go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer imitates the rueful rabbit and bolts for home - great guardian angel|pg||
nt|roswolf: heh!?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|c4|nt|rv: I suspect North will not take another @c finesse:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: this is x-rated play - the guardian angel should get hazard pay|pg||
mc|6|nt|roswolf: what!?|pg||
nt|geot: Why would not declarer take another finesse in clubs? |pg||
nt|roswolf: well east would show out|pg||
nt|roswolf: magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: 3 down after d dec risked c- finesse!|pg||
nt|geot: if it was 3 down, declarer must have taken another finesse in clubs early|pg||
nt|geot: can we blame him? the first finesse held, he is playing MP? |pg||
nt|rv: North could have settled for 10 tricks since he already got a bonus trick once opps didn't lead @hs, also @c7 should be suspicious|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the guardian angel got bored it seems - greed doesnt pay - but a double grosvenor coup is a bit special i suppose|pg||
nt|geot: I see your point Venky, but......that is so easy to say when we see West ducked the first club|pg||
nt|rv: another aspect North didn't consider if East had 4@cs, West will have 1 or both 4M and would have bid 1M|pg||
nt|rv: West's pass of redouble is an important aspect for North to consider in play|pg||
nt|rv: in addition to @C7 lead as well as non @h lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think we should draw a veil over that hand to protect the guilty|pg||
nt|rodal f: The pairs playing is....    But miss the result page. http://home.online.no/ svenpran/2011-09-03-foss1.htm?Resultatside=home.online.no%2F svenpran%2F2011-09-03-foss1.htm|pg||

mb|5S|nt|gracelin: when south didn't open in 3rd hand, North should admit that the hand belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|rodal f: New invit for slam by S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|gracelin: declarer better ducks this|pg||

nt|roswolf: may not score as badly as it looks|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: unfortunately for Indonesia, the last board can create little swing.  The closed room result of 3D -1 seems normal.|pg||
