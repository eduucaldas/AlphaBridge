mb|p|mb|1N|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision for Sabine right out|pg||
mb|d|an|5miner-4major|nt|eleni: @h hello John, welcome and yes, Efie our operator told us so last night|pg||
nt|athene: she might have some way to show 4M and longer minor|pg||
nt|athene: or she might not...|pg||
nt|granguru:  Sabine has been 3 times in the podium of the Word mixed pairs championship |pg||
nt|eleni: the Green lines ARE in english|pg||
nt|psyck: woolsey stype x i guess|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: many use double to show that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  so she is pretty well accustomed to it.|pg||
nt|athene: she is one of them by the look of it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: looks like a misunderstanding for EW right away|pg||
nt|mcphee: he thot itwas xfer|pg||
nt|athene: "system on" over double or not|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|granguru:  hi william and Bob|pg||
nt|athene: sabine might just keep the pot bubbling with 3@D and not worry about defending a possibly silly 2@S in a non-fit|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day John|pg||
nt|granguru:  Claudio "natural" system has nothing to do with what he is playing today|pg||
nt|athene: if the vulnerability were different, i suspect Sabine might pass 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|psyck: I Martens knows opps have a misunderstanding based on the alert, he knows S has a better hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantunes uses all 1-openings as 14+ unlimited!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and hope to get a decent penalty even non-doubled|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  all 2-openings are 9-13 |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh boy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: one thing worth a mention about the NS tactics here|pg||
nt|granguru:  first blood is going to run|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a borderline decision whether to go for a penalty or push on|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost always right to push on|pg||
nt|athene: because you so often get the chance to double them even higher|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: W should have passed 3@s with 3 card @s hoping they will not x|pg||
nt|eleni: @hWelcome Krishna :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h3|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|granguru:  Nunes is playing standard 2/1 today|pg||
nt|athene: what to do after you open 1nt and next hand doubles is pretty high up on the list of things to discuss|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: it ranks only slightly behind "where shall we go for dinner" on list of priorities at any bridge congress|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: the common treatment is to play system on after non penalty x of 1N or 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of changing your methods depending on the meaning of opps' bids|pg||
nt|athene: it just makes it all the easier to have misunderstandings|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you have to of course|pg||
nt|athene: but you should try to minimize it|pg||
nt|granguru:  (very) modern philosophy has changed all the rules|pg||
nt|athene: i see for example people agreeing one defence to a weak notrump and another to a strong notrump|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: then opps sit down and open a 14-16 NT and confusion ensues|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|d2|nt|granguru:  the main thing is that the overcaller should be the one who leads|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: those who agree on different treatments generally agree on average of 15 & higher to be trated as strong NT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|granguru:  so all interventions are now treated in such a way that the overcaller leads...thus many transfers sequences are in the modern arsenal |pg||
nt|athene: yes, it's true that many pairs gear their methods towards rightsiding contracts, which means putting the overcaller on lead|pg||
nt|athene: that is especially useful after a 1NT opener|pg||
nt|granguru:  f.i. 1@c (1@H) x = @s (nothing new) |pg||
nt|athene: that's one reason (not the only one) why some sort of transfer lebensohl is better than standard lebensohl after 1nt (overcall)|pg||
nt|granguru:  but 1@C (1@d) 1@H = @s suit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|granguru:  1@C (1@D) 1@S= no major suit|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, Rubensohl & Rumpelsohl have significant advantages over Lebensohl|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d5|pc|cJ|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: the main advantage of Rumpelsohl is, of course, its name|pg||
nt|granguru:  not so popular only because they are not symetric|pg||
pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4S6H654DAK9CA87652,SKQ842HT983D5CQJ9,SAJT7HQJ2D7432CK4,S953HAK7DQJT86CT3|sv|n|nt|psyck: those transfers are useful not just for right siding but also for showing more habd types|pg||
nt|granguru:  meaning that the rule doesnt work the same on all cases|pg||
nt|psyck: *hand types|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  right|pg||
nt|athene: might go 1@C 1@S 3NT here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|mcphee: 3N would be a big bid I think|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcphee: 2 closer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe 2nt is enough, but @SAJ10x is more than a five count|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: many treat 2N in that spot as a full hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: Sabine doesn't think of her hand as an 11-count, she thinks of it as a 6-card trick source with entries and fast side tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|athene: i.e. ideal for those low-HCP 3NT contracts!|pg||
nt|granguru:  points are only for 1st round of bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  then any expert uses a card-positioning and hand evauation method|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: we saw yesterday in the open pairs, Zia and Sabine played a very "busy" game, always doing things, creating tricky situations,  trusting that (often weak) opponents would not solve ...|pg||
nt|athene: the problems as well as they did themselves|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: it will be interesting to see if NS do the same thing today|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru:  reason is that points work well only in bal hands...the moment you start going wild they help you each time less|pg||
nt|psyck: the had a great set on the 2nd day & started y'day well, but faltered towards the end|pg||

nt|athene: many people feel obliged to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's very often right to lead something else - something the opponents are not prepared for|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is a fact, but if you have 2 entries to a decent 5 card suit not any reason not to consider leading it|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|mb|p|nt|psyck: pd's bid is a suggestion which you can decide not to accept when you have a clear alternative|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|3H|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C some sort of artificial ask, i guess|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: singleton ask maybe|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: or suit & point range|pg||
nt|athene: many play 2@D [multi] - 4@C as asking partner to transfer to his suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@C here is the same thing|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: Multi-2@D seems to be all the thing in Europe these days|pg||
nt|athene: it was pretty much standard in Poznan in June|pg||
nt|psyck: quite popular all around the world |pg||
nt|eleni: In this first session of mixed pairs, 24 boards will be played, 3 X 8 rounds|pg||
nt|granguru:  zia is a very imaginative and creative player...it is hard to think Martens could play the same style...it is a matter of personality. |pg||
nt|psyck: Sabine was just playing her normal game with Zia & will continue to do so in this pdship i presume|pg||
nt|granguru:  and bridge philosophy. Zia goes with the ACOL style..the point is not to make no errors. the winner is the one who makes less errors.|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SQ2HAQT8DAJ52CA95,S964HKJ2DQT83CJT7,SAKT853H74D974C84,SJ7H9653DK6CKQ632|sv|b|nt|granguru:  so he makes the opponents make errors ..usually he wins but sometimes he also loses with this strategy|pg||
nt|athene: certainly playing pairs in a big field of mixed standard, there is much more to be gained from inducing errors|pg||
nt|athene: it's a question of who can beat up the weaker pairs most successfully|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: and of course a little more luck than usual in such a field in getting to paly the tricky deals against weaker opps|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|granguru:  a Multi again|pg||
nt|athene: as Hamman put it:- teams of 4 is like the two best boxers in the world going 15 rounds.... matchpoints is more like, you blindfold them both and put them in a room full of drunks, ...|pg||
nt|athene: and the first one to knock down 100 drunks wins|pg||
nt|athene: (Hamman not a big MP fan)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|granguru:  we can deduct it|pg||
nt|psyck: Open Pairs Results: http://www.hellasbridge.org/apotelesmata/36386|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: standard methods these days to ensure the stronger hand plays it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: in the bad old days people used methods after 2nt like "3minor shows a good weak two, 3major is natural with a poor weak-two" which wrongsides your contracts half the time|pg||
nt|psyck: E can only come in once to play @d here|pg||
nt|psyck: so dec can set up @h to take care of a @d loser|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|psyck: true|pg||

pc|c5|pg||

pc|s5|nt|granguru:  new threat What is the best defense against a Multi opening bid?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: now sabine can hook the heart and it's fine|pg||
nt|athene: even if it loses, both diamonds go away|pg||

pc|d5|nt|athene: no harm in playing some trumps, see what west throws|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: wow a BBO first|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north has the shape to double 2@H but i guess it's a bit thin|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  everything is well placed for EW>|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't really happy if partner passes, bids clubs, or bids notrumps, and you sort of expect that to happen a lot of the time|pg||
nt|mcphee: martnes did not care to risk dble showing @S and @D with his lack of values and @C support|pg||
nt|granguru:  except @h distribution|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: fi he *had* doubled, would sabine pass or bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: if he |pg||
nt|mcphee: or possibly 3@C|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser i each suit here i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@S but we will never know :)|pg||

nt|psyck: looks like upside down carding for NS|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: Sabine would not like her carding being described like that|pg||
nt|psyck: better than wrong side up|pg||
nt|athene: in some parts of the world (Poland for example) then standard means low from even|pg||
nt|athene: so she prefers just to say "low means even or encouraging" rather than "upside down" or "standard"|pg||
nt|mcphee: some table will open E hand 1N|pg||
nt|athene: yes, then south will double if playing the 4M5m gadget|pg||
nt|athene: or bid 2@C if playing meckwell or DONT|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N has chances|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|h3|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|granguru:  it might be too late or too dangerous|pg||
nt|psyck: those @c plays cost a trick|pg||
nt|granguru:  or both|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes @C cost but it was going to endplay her in anycase|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 2@D coming rather than 1|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|d6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|granguru:  due to the difficulty for not so experienced players to defend against, Multi is prohibited in USA at various levels of tournaments.|pg||

nt|granguru:  if you are in a 3 level contract, lets say for 110|pg||
nt|granguru:  and opponents bid 3@d |pg||
nt|granguru:  as here..the willing to double them must be maximum, even there is a great risk of being made|pg||

nt|granguru:  because 3@D might be -50 or -100|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 @c made 110 3 @d -1|pg||

nt|granguru:  so you lose heavily against the room if the defense is not so normal|pg||
