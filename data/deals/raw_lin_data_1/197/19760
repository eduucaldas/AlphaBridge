nt|wboer: two off was difficult to avoid. If N duckes @hK what can decl then do?|pg||
nt|wboer: If N takes @hK then one off is the likely result by finnessing @hJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash 3 rounds of @d and lead @h to Q10 in hand...that should get him 6 tricks|pg||
nt|wboer: That play will give defense 8 tricks (4@s's, 1@h, 1@d and 2@c's)|pg||
nt|andyv:  but as you pointed out, E has a better chance by attacking @hs before @cs...in fact his Q@c lead does not really advance his cause at all.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW still playing at table  a  so it will be a while until we resume here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No running scores I'm afraid. Not much fun without them in a pairs event|pg||
nt|wboer: Decl will go down two if he leads @hK, ducked by N in trick 2. He is in hand and can't do anything|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 98@h in dummy, he can get 3@h tricks, along with 3@d tricks and @s trick|pg||
