nt|desinka: EW playing precision|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|desinka: In this hand, 4@S will be not the final contract, i think|pg||
nt|desinka: but lets see the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 1st hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s likelyto play 2@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D transfer response showing hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|desinka: now 2@S|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi all|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tez: merhaba:)|pg||
nt|desinka: Hi Momchil|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desi :)|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  just 1 down in 3@D  if they can balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: merhabaa:) takýmýza bolþans|pg||
mb|3N|nt|james_h: 1@h could be 11-13 bal or big both with 4+ support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
nt|star6ija: we have Bulgarian pair, playing precision here|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h e 2 sanzatuyu davet oynuyorlar..fit 4 lü|pg||
nt|ady: east has balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: hi all|pg||
nt|star6ija: sems like a good board for Bulgarians to start with|pg||
nt|star6ija: seems|pg||
pc|d8|nt|desinka: Hello, Barry:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: request for link to running scores please|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a 2/1 style with lots of gadgets and 12-14NT |pg||
pc|c3|nt|geot: Hi Jon, and kibs. Welcome.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hello all, Hei Geir and Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
pc|c7|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|star6ija: yes...this way avoiding trump queen guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|nt|poohbear: Didnt see that North dbled the final contract. This is somethign that modern bidding has frowned upon|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
pc|c8|nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: If they make overtricks..........|pg||
nt|desinka: h tables starts from 1st board..|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|poohbear: thats how they do things here|pg||

nt|tez: 3 ya da 4lü imiþ|pg||
nt|ady: well played    |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 6 imps for Bulgaria for the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the play would have been interesting|pg||
nt|geot: to take 2 down I mean|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||
nt|ady: so in fact 6 imps to Bulgaria   Hanlon played 10@S  in the end game  ttrying to give impresion of Q10 left I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: and another Bulgarian pair in the OR, whose agressive style misleaded Swedes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is very aggressive|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mihov has taken good decision in the OR|pg||
nt|desinka: this one looks like flat to me...|pg||
nt|james_h: tough position for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: diðer masada 3@d oynanýyordu bu el|pg||
nt|tez: @h ataðýna batacak burda|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4-3 e 4@s iyi kontrat ama bulmak zor|pg||
nt|tez: nafiz abi diyor ki @h asýyla al küçük @d yý oyna..batýr bakalým:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|james_h: I like Fantunes defence to Multi ... X shows @h|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have 3NT   with their 28 hcp   not in the bidding yest|pg||
nt|james_h: it counters this situation here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|star6ija: as Shwartz did here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Can never tell with these big distribution hands|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yusufb: 2@d tek renkli major eli|pg||
nt|ady: south should certainly have taken some action first round|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon did well to recover|pg||
nt|ady: North has taken a gamble balancing at that level|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|star6ija: these 4 @h are little tricky|pg||
nt|jbgood: and at the other table a heart was lead - since E opened 1 @h|pg||
nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in trouble now if south re-doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: S asked about 3NT  and shrugged|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: but now flat|pg||
nt|desinka: Running Scores for Group A http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: north will not be displeased with dummy|pg||
nt|james_h: Cheeky stuff by North and East|pg||
nt|james_h: East will have the bloody nose though|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jbgood: good start for the Italians|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  1@c is 14+ or a good 12/13 with 5 card suit|pg||
nt|desinka: Running scores for Group B http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=917&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is not a good bid in my opinion. Wont stop opps from bidding 4S . And you have weak trumps and defense|pg||
nt|desinka: Running scores for LADIES http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=914&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|star6ija: as our friend from Pakistan Oosman Bashir pointed out...both Souths did also well not trying slam over 4th level overcall|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
pc|h7|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  1@h = 0-11hcp w 4@h or 4@s|pg||
nt|geot: Second seat opening. Nice hand though.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: Who would open with norths hand at board 1?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  sorry, mistyped..1@h denied 4@h and has 4@s|pg||
nt|james_h: + 1 I expect|pg||
nt|ady: should make an overtrick end playing east|pg||
pc|c9|nt|geot: i wonder if Boye would have doubled if West had rebid 2@D on this hand? Probably.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: looks like 1 off?|pg||
nt|andyv:  as per spec (all help appreciated): 1S is 4cards , 2hearts GF relay, 2spades balanced other natural|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|xenya: hello Andy|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H made in OR   though it appears 1 spade and 3 clubs to lose|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  hi, yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: 3N offers more chances as the cards lie -- still likely down|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  NS 1@c 1@s sequence is 0-11 with no 4 card major|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|xenya: and i'm told 3N was made other table|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@c 1N is 10+|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|s4|nt|james_h: ok just made|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|james_h: ok, it must not have happened like that + 2|pg||
nt|ady: in 4@H  in OR   again east was end played|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Director called by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Sorry got cards wrong in endplay|pg||
nt|james_h: East looking to have his cake and eat it?|pg||
nt|james_h: np Dermot|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Hanlon defending his position vigourously: never passing vul with a 15 count|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks looks maximum   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: In their system there are some hands with 5 hearts that S cannot bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 11 tricks claimed|pg||

nt|ady: spades|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|yusufb: hýzlý oynarlarda bu kadar degil:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  if they did make 3N that would be 13 imps|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|star6ija: easy to be made when we see all the cards|pg||
nt|geot: +140 is a fine result for N/S on board 2. E/W has 8-9 tricks in diamonds. Depending on the lead.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4+ @d, 6-9|pg||
nt|tez: @d as atak edilmedi tabiki|pg||
nt|tez: her eli böyle claim etmez inþallah:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: (3 @c)|pg||
nt|geot: 3@D = good raise in hearts I guess.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: tez hocam sen gidince 3nt ye donmüþüz|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  at this vul, EW will stretch as much as possible to get to 4@h|pg||
nt|james_h: I think the double will weaken Easts case(assuming he has one) on the last hand|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@c is a Tx to @d|pg||
mb|2S|nt|star6ija: I appreciate Mihov's overcall in the OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT depends on who bids it. Safe from West not from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 1@d is natural and unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||
nt|geot: Declarer can finesse clubs to get rid of the diamond loser, so only four top losers in 3@H, but....|pg||
nt|tez: 11 e 11..iyi durdular 1 nt de|pg||
nt|ady: this makes on the nose|pg||
nt|ady: cant work out only 1@D made in OR|pg||
nt|ady: also how did the contract stay so low?|pg||
nt|james_h: curious|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yusufb: 1@s X 2-3@s gosteriyor heralde|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: we have caught up they are in the middle of playing this hand|pg||

nt|poohbear: now club lead beats it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tez: 2 nt @s tutuþu iyi el|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  good brakes by EW as 4@h has virtually no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 2, 3N went off 1 so only 3 imps exchanged|pg||
nt|geot: he will finesse|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they overcalled 1H with North so a @H was led|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tez: 3@h tekrar transfer|pg||

nt|james_h: -2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|baardolav: 10 trick was not right though|pg||
nt|baardolav: max 140|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10 tricks? No way - unless there was a revoke|pg||
nt|geot: Not 10, and N/S could have set declarer as the play went|pg||
nt|jbgood: revokes are not permitted on BBO:) (and therefore cannot be recorded)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good lead but not enough of them|pg||
nt|tez: ah þurada @d yardýmý sorabilseydim diyordur salvo:)|pg||
nt|james_h: 3 more imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: very aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|desinka: sry, 2@C 1+|pg||
nt|star6ija: some misbalanced auction|pg||
nt|star6ija: and the penalty will be as severe as possible|pg||
nt|star6ija: with both red suits broken unevenly|pg||
nt|poohbear: not much hope for this contract. Even with 3-3 @hs only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: but no guarantee that the other room goes plus. Cards dont lay well for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: East could have easily just bid 2H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|poohbear: no fitting honors and minimum point count|pg||

nt|star6ija: this is a style|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder what it shows|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5 card side suit necessary|pg||
nt|poohbear: Shows @ds and a 5 card major I am told|pg||
nt|poohbear: gives South a HUGE headache :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess he has to dbl |pg||
nt|poohbear: or pass|pg||
nt|poohbear: pass actually best I think. Partner is a passed hand and you know about the bad break in one major|pg||
nt|desinka: pass looks normal to me.. when 4@D is @D+M|pg||

nt|james_h: ok, there are some recording mistakes at the other table|pg||
mb|2S|nt|poohbear: I have never been a fan of 4m bids that show an undisclosed 5 card major. Too hard to find it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oleberg:  Kibz are more than welcome send messages to me about the meaning of bids, Im not familiar with the systems|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But wests double looks like take-out|pg||

nt|baardolav: Yes, the Q of @d is the 500 |pg||

pc|h5|nt|xenya: can declarer go wrong here? i don't see how|pg||
nt|jbgood: this sequence should mean that S has a preemptive han with good spade support... guess operator just denominated the final contract|pg||
nt|star6ija: Stefanov will probably make 12 tricks...|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|oleberg:  Or maybe @HA less in spades and a misdefence|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: @s  ataðýna hemen karar vermek zorunda kalacak|pg||
nt|tez: yerde rua vale varsa küçük çýkmak lazým deðil mi hocam?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: If 3@C still could be 5-5 S have a very good hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive he need some sort of endplay if defence is correct|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: if S keeps at least 4@D can be 1 down and a push|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs stunned the Gold passed|pg||

nt|arvidsson: unlucky break (can you say so, after W did say he got some @H by double)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|geot: If he goes down, which not at all is unlikely now, he will really regret not trying the spade 8 in the first trick.|pg||
nt|geot: Oops|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h7|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||

nt|arvidsson: 6-4 distrubution makes it a 1@s for me to, but if 6331 I would go for 2@S in this vulnerbilities|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 4@s te dururuz|pg||
nt|james_h: I saw on a recent BridgeTopics.com atricle Bocchi thinks Kibitizers should be charged|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tez: ama @h rua atak edilecek ve olacak|pg||
nt|james_h: he also objects to major tournaments being played in the summer when he wants holidays|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 3@C mixed raise in @D|pg||
nt|james_h: its tough when your a bridge professional|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: @c cýkýlmasý imkansýz gibi naturel @h atagýda klasik hiç oynamazlar claim gelir:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: NS close to game in Hearts or NT. Depends on lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|star6ija: yes only spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: herkese merhaba|pg||
mb|2S|nt|baardolav: live scores here http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|geot: This looks costly|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d demeyi düþünüyordu sanýrým..lauria..atak için|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT is preparing for weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: but only @s is the suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: slight raise of eyebrow from McGann on seeing dummy|pg||
nt|ady: did not expect the Irish to miss this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices from West|pg||
nt|geot: Normal overcall. Normal decision by North.|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like|pg||
nt|arvidsson: as we can see all cards we see that EW will not make 4@H, but guess the whole field will play game on this hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: bugün kaç maç yapýldý bilen varmý sanýyorum 5 maç|pg||
nt|kbitzer: 6. cý el ilginç.  6 da  oluyor  4 de gitmekte  zor.  d.bakýr  zona bile gidemedi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if he had a way to differentiate 4@H as guess vs  "it's our hand - this will make"|pg||
nt|tez: Diðer odada 7. board 1@h 2@d    2@h 3@d    3NT  4@d       4 NT  6 NT  South oynuyor|pg||
pc|hT|nt|star6ija: 6@h will go down with @s lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: small??|pg||
nt|geot: But not all will re-open with a double as South on that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: ok play gone ahead at this stage|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: boye is on lead and NS have 3 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: @c ataðýna 6 oluyor|pg||
nt|2celik1: iceride 5@C dendi,tam|pg||
nt|poohbear: kind of like Lebensohl|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: 3N is best here of course as the cards lie -- 4@S is a bit trickier...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Lots of thinking at this table|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sengulerz: 2 imp olsun bizim olsun|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ahhhh another way to beat 4 . kill the entry to the @d|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzgp: one round of hearts have been played so far|pg||
nt|jbgood: so maybe Norway will get off the schneid now|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 6@D on this hand, but only double dummy. Has to drop the @DK|pg||
nt|geot: Madala did not re-open with a double at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: second trick won by EW so logic tells me a diamond queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: from there on it is quessswork sorry|pg||
nt|jbgood: just wait for the final result and give us that, Tos|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|star6ija: actually it would have been more interesting to see wheter Aronov would have found the lead against 3 N played by South|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|geot: there they stopped in 5@D, will make 600 or 620|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  J@s played hoping to give declarer the illusion a bad split|pg||
nt|jbgood: well done to take the 800|pg||
nt|geot: Norway's first IMPs in this match will come here, 5 of them|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panosk: if you go a 20 hcp game and 5 are useless its not gd news, but i also think many will venture 4@H|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes hard to stop, but west may see that his 2 queens do not carry much weight|pg||
nt|arvidsson: normally when you realise your hand is not as good as you thought it is to late :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tez: @c e @d kayýplarý gidecek..ve artý 1 haneye|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|xenya: what about @S8?|pg||
nt|andyv:  as you noticed, I didn't say anything about the 8 because the less said the better|pg||
nt|2celik1: kesinlikle Zafer Hocam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yusufb: 114 borddan 5 maç 70 bord baya fazla |pg||
nt|yusufb: 14 bord|pg||

pc|h7|nt|james_h: E/W made maximun nuisance of themselves there, well done to them|pg||
nt|ady: but I think Hanlon should still have stretched 1 more  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Director has ruled (I think) that Bd 2 revised to 3@sX. Didnt quite catch it and dont like to ask Tom!|pg||
nt|james_h: A good maxim is to leave the last guess to the opponents|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield's philosophy was  "thinking about bidding 5-over-5?  DON'T"|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: 3@C tx to @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: this seems interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Luks also opened 2@C, but his promised @C as longest suit|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1h -4h now|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 @h seems reasonable|pg||
nt|arvidsson: many players would choose a 3@H raise with east cards|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kbitzer: 4 kiþilik tkm yok|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baardolav: brogeland know the 7-3 fit... and he make a splinter instead|pg||
nt|arvidsson: what does the panel say?|pg||
nt|panosk: i wud too with a singleton |pg||
nt|ady: the auction shown on hand 2  south did not double 3 spades   but passed throughout  which does seem strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Yes not certain ruling given in whisper|pg||

nt|sengulerz: @s ataðýna problem olur|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure there will be follow up on board 2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: the Dutch big club system = Ultimate Canape   the Estonian big club = Relay Precision|pg||

nt|andyv:  N has a pretty good hand here for 3@s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|poohbear: so a normal 1NT|pg||

nt|ady: 7 imps for Ireland|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those specs who want 3@c to be doubles...it ain't happening|pg||
nt|yusufb: 1 sefer cakarsak alýcý @h yada @c ye batardý|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: 4@S can be beaten with precise defence i think -- against 3C, the defence needn't be so precise |pg||
nt|poohbear: defense can take 5 tricks now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yusufb: anlaþmaya baglý fakat normalde X üzerine 2@d non forcing oynanýyor|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we see that perfect defense defeats 3N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if defense does NOT take first 5 -- then declarer takes first 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did rebid 3N with east hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner was unpassed and unlimited East would bid 2NT and give partner room to describe|pg||
nt|panosk: this might get expensive|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kbitzer: 600  cepte görmek  dbl ý tutmak..|pg||
nt|yusufb: rakip 1nt dedikten sonra 3nt ye ulaþmak ve yapmak cok nadir olan bi durum|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a very good double by E and this might be whats needed for norway to get back in the lead |pg||

nt|rodvenn: a good stop here unless u get a hart lead:)|pg||
nt|james_h: so 4@h looked like the more promising spot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|poohbear: and Fisher doesnt even try the 5 level. Good judgement|pg||
nt|panosk: or a club for that matter :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: well is it not always cold?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: as long as you get the @C correct|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta also stopped in 3@s at board 15. But doobled! :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: always better to go down in 3N than going down in 2N|pg||
nt|2celik1: Harun Bey'in notu:sanýrsam 6d de batmýyor|pg||
nt|yusufb: þimdi |pg||
nt|tez: alacak çünkü @c ten korkuyor|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: if the double on hand 15 showed hearts  could north have passed 3 spades  could 1 club have been a weaker hand?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|poohbear: slam needs either 3-3 @cs or dbl finesse in @h|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yusufb: @s cekip @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: makes it about 50%|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this is a hand were atleast I would like to be in a slam, @C 3-3 or a @H finesse ?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|2celik1: bravo Harun Bey ama tabii ki soz konusu degil 6 demek|pg||
nt|tez: rakip nt açtýktan sonra fit yokken zon oynamak yeterli|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: He may win 1NT now by ducking the diamond shift that will come after the clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodvenn: as long as the black suits behave, 12 tricks is likely|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|baardolav: yes... ha can actually make to contract now... but no time for testing spade 3-3 before finessing heart|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|baardolav: Vesace have to play the K of @d |pg||
nt|geot: He can set up hearts after duking the diamond switch. But will he play like that? Depend on diamonds 6-2...rather than try for spades to be 3-3?|pg||

nt|2celik1: Ismail Bey hic olmaz diyor 6@d,hakli,yerden kup alinamiyor|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: dunno which card was discarded on the Spade K in North|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: it may have been a heart|pg||
nt|2celik1: board 14 ten 8 sayi gitti|pg||

nt|james_h: North had to X (takeout) for show the big hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: bu da kadýnlarýn|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or spades 2-2 and clubs 4-2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|geot: oh he had ditched a diamond of course|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: links to running scores available at  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess hye goes down - hope to be proved wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Director called - claim may be faulty - @Ds blocked|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Declarer said he could discard a @S on the @Ds but they are blocked|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzes: ty all |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tez: masada neler oluyor gerçekten emin deðilim..dam verdiðini sanmýyorum|pg||
nt|james_h: pass would show 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|ady: so 1 club  not always 16 or 17plus|pg||
pc|h8|nt|geot: so now he must chose, spade 3-3 or heart finesse|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: a priori heart finesse better|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzes: ty all |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|baardolav: J could fall... or if not spade 3-3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|geot: yes, but what about Jx in hearts + spades 3-3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|geot: double chance|pg||
