mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: yes, but as I said, S was afraid of @H, so he did not bid on|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|geot: Ireland got a grip on this now, and fully deserved. they have not done anything wrong, and Norway has got a few hands where I do not really recognise my good friends to be honest|pg||
nt|geot: It is the first match only, do not worry Norwegian fans:)|pg||

mb|d|mb|4H|nt|geot: As my fellow commentater disappeared i am alone here and supposed to be neutral. Difficult, and I am afraid my NZ flag will not help me hiding. Go Norway:)|pg||

nt|geot: But mind you, Ireland is still leading this match:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C a game inv stayman|pg||
nt|blum1956: nothing may stop North from making 11 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|geot: or to be honest :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: xx probably lacks a @C stop? not sure|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, another help says no stop, no 4M|pg||
nt|gulyas: so maybe no @Ds shown yet|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so @Ds found after all|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|geot: that is how it is, and it will be 10 IMPs whether he gets 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|kdr_fm: losing 2@h, one @C ruff and the @SA, no guess unless N underleads the @S now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|hT|nt|baldfriede: percentage play in @s wrong this time, but that's why it is percentage only|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|geot: Defenders have got four top tricks. Declarer most solve both the spades and the clubs it seems, to win 3@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|idc:  Bd 16 in other room was 6@s - but other room gone for now|pg||

mb|1D|nt|geot: some kind of come back for Norway in this match, and there are still 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|1H|nt|geot: min NT again|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they reversed this board in their haste - Mesbur is actually N for this hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, computer died for a while!|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: With maximal hand they open 2@c instead of 1@d|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gulyas: I hope we will not be playing that nice fit...|pg||
nt|gulyas: if Madala tries 3@D now, it would be the Italians for a change who declare the same contract in both rooms:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|geot: South opened in this room with 8HCP, mini NT. In the other room North opened the bidding in third seat with 9HCPs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coming up on final board of the match|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: if left to his own devices, declarer will go down|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|baldfriede: well done to find 6@c|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: vugraph schedule showing viewer's local timezone  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes reading magazine again.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're acutally NOT the slowest vugraph table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores under  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our match is from Group B|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, he was not|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well actually on that lead it maybe possible to set up the 4th @D (duck the @S entry to the N hand)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: he may still go down if S, upon winning the @HK, plays the @DQ for N to discard his @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs to play 2 rnds of @Hs eventually to ruff the 3rd|pg||
nt|gulyas: so either @HA-Q, or just Q, S wins and plays the @DQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is no duck N has a certain @s entry ...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|blum1956: The typical examle of multiple choices - the kind of hand which few declarers like|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the match   round 5 begins in about 1 hour|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|xfer to 2NT|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
mb|2N|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who were asking -- this is why Fantoni didn't need to continue @C immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- if Nunes original trump was @D9xx  then    oops|pg||
nt|jkotor: ruff high, play low @d, and makes|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is making now I think - the defence dont have the 2nd @d trick|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|gulyas: 1@D showed @Hs, was not alerted by the operator|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
pc|sA|mc|9|nt|blum1956: That was the last board of the set. Thanks all, the spectators and the vugraph operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thank you Michael|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well either way thats a swing to sweden|pg||
