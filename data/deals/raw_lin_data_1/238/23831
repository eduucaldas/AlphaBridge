nt|fabsayc: if willard had the diamond king and golin the queen, golin should have overtaken heart queen, so i am pretty sure oliveri should know to underlead diamond ace|pg||

mb|3D|nt|gulyas: he will be endplayed eventually (and we also know the 4th @S will be good, so no need for the @HA)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decent explanation of the leads on their submitted convention card|pg||
nt|bobholl: lucky lead for the netherlands (over tricks now)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: he can make this improbable contract now|pg||
nt|gulyas: how?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: This will be a pick up for Norway, a nice pick up actually|pg||
nt|james_h: I expect so|pg||

nt|blum1956: in fact the fate of the contract did not depend on the lead thanks to 2 aces in dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gulyas: too bad the 3rd is not high|pg||
nt|clinch: NS have a bid to show a hand with longer minor than major, but this hand must either be 2@s or pass|pg||

nt|blum1956: If the declarer uses the diamond suit correctly he will sooner or later win|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: it was the lucky 1nt opening - if it went 1@C-1@H overcall, they would never have gotten to this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Fantoni's DBL = same HCP as opener|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a fairly routine 3NT E/W ..|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score on board 7 is still wrong|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@H is down on a diamond lead - as 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club towards the jack|pg||

nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: 6@s gelinmesi zor fakat yapýlabiliyor|pg||

nt|ritong: really saying " you won t toy with me lorenzo"|pg||

nt|blum1956: the rest is simple|pg||
nt|james_h: throughout the tournament|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||

nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate " my @hs are fine"|pg||

mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c is probably a version of Drury showing 3 card fir|pg||
nt|geot: I think on board 10, the 3@S, it was something to be said for playing the Ace of trumps first. That is if East had KJ doubleton. So playing the ace and later play as he did was ...|pg||
nt|geot: acdtually ok|pg||
nt|james_h: fit|pg||
nt|james_h: 2s = min|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3@d = 4+ @c I am told|pg||
nt|psyck: so E shows his suits by not bidding them|pg||
nt|clinch: Might have been clobbered if N only had 4 @s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: interesting use of 4C as a kind of leaping michaels, kibitzers will no doubt say standard in France but new to me|pg||

nt|clinch: 4@d pretty comfortable losing 3 red tricks in all likelihood|pg||

nt|nevaio   _: after 2@h 3@H by w|pg||

nt|nevaio   _: i speak about led|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he has closed the screen and asked if 3@c was forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- let's play this again|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room as well in 3nt E, also medium club lead and 8 from north|pg||
nt|tomi2: let's see how Piekarek plays this|pg||
nt|psyck: should be interesting, a chance for Germany to catch up|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, versace is a superactive bidder|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are the best team in my opinon|pg||
nt|james_h: I seriously doubt that Monaci will win, while wishing them well at the same time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|blum1956: Gromov is an extremely fast player, Dubinin being no faster then average |pg||
mb|1N|nt|james_h: Monaco|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|geot: Italy favourites of course, then the World Champs the Netherlands|pg||
nt|james_h: y, throw Poland into the mix also|pg||
nt|geot: But I think Monaco has a chance|pg||
nt|geot: Polan is always in such a mix|pg||
nt|james_h: only 17 imps on that hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh big swing - played from the other hand and teh S lead gave declarer more options, went -2|pg||
nt|clinch: That's a pretty dire opening bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: well if sweden wins the europeans, maybe you get bragging rights for a year|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
mb|2S|nt|geot: Will be interesting to see how Israel goes|pg||
nt|james_h: They have shown no form dispite bursting with talent|pg||
nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  I am not sure they can bid either :P|pg||
nt|ritong: making friends is your strong points, true?|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
nt|clinch: Taking vulnerability into account|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|tomi2: in his room south did not overcall since he bid 1@H himself, so he does not know the @H layout|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not really hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||
nt|james_h: 3@h is a balanced slam try (I think)|pg||
nt|ritong: oohh|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcphee: now looks like on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Forrester must know that Gold is weak, and one assumes that must mean he has 5 @d at least. I'm just guessing this, but it's logical to me|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 2@C game force, 3@C relay, not sure about 3@D|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah apparently 1@d showed 5@d; thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: dont know if it will make any difference tho|pg||
nt|geot: Unusual to let E/W play 3@C I think|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel are a tough outfit, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Not enough from Karpov's point of view, needs some extra values (few)|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now cue bids (this partnership's favorite action)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In many systems East will be able to show short diamonds which would cool off West|pg||
nt|ritong: @s lead looks very possible after this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so they better stop lower than 6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nilsland:  At the other table it started 1N-3@D showing 4441 with a singleton minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that a whole lot better|pg||
nt|clinch: This looks to be on the @h guess; won't be much of a guess after Forrester turns up with AQ of trumps and a @d honour|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at least we know that they probably know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think they play turbo on this auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: perhaps E was a bit conservative|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or not|pg||
nt|ritong: i t would match  now, i m told they do play turbo, but restricted to minor fits|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: as expected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  easy lead from the sequence :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|clinch: Will have to play a @h early now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|geot: Myself I do not like 3@S the first time unless it is agreed to show some cards|pg||
nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa will return @h after winning @d, maybe Piekarek will have an idea then|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe it will be too late then, he is still thinking how to play the @D|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, too difficult a hand, even when looking at all cards :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ferlema: http://csbnews.org/my-way-iv-by-norberto-bocchi/?lang=en|pg||
pc|d6|nt|james_h: I have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|clinch: As otherwise Forrester will get a @c ruff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|geot: but I dont think it can be right to let opps play 3@C on Souths hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller will think again -- but it is too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes as dummy takes out a magazine to read|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Italy, Monaco or Ireland??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: that was  said, lemme see....21 lines ago|pg||
nt|ritong: but great minds drink alike:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Good defence, and would have been supernatural to find the counter-play|pg||
nt|clinch: Before knowing the @s position|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|clinch: Nothing about the bidding suggests Gold has such a weak hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|james_h: My bridge suffers from real life and vice versa|pg||
pc|c3|nt|blum1956: Certainly he could try some 5th level invitation (the 5@d cue probably being the best) but the 5th level was not safe from Maxim Karpov's point of view|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|mc|8|nt|fabsayc: actually east denied a spade control and west bid slam reluctantly so any lead but a spade would mean fredin was not listening|pg||

nt|nilsland:  1NT?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|geot: Ireland got a grip on this now, and fully deserved. they have not done anything wrong, and Norway has got a few hands where I do not really recognise my good friends to be honest|pg||

nt|ritong: no, i naively thought fredin would keep quiet|pg||
mb|r!|nt|gulyas: 1 lvl higher here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was definitely operating on this hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes only a couple of hands had some potential, maybe we will end with a bang with some fancy hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D would show 5 cards for me|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think FF use support doubles|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though EW have game on here, but can they bid it?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|geot: This might be a pick up for Norway|pg||
nt|gulyas: no dbl, no trouble:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: but there are still matches with more imps exchanged. some suprise is that pland is down 40 imps against Croatia|pg||
nt|clinch: Again, lots of bidding from NS|pg||
mb|3C|nt|blum1956: 2NT is more challenging than 2@d in the OR and will probably fail|pg||
nt|clinch: Dbl presumably support; not sure what rdbl was|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck: Poland has been doing surprisingly poor all rounds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: 4@S a good save|pg||
nt|tomi2: except of their win against France|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Fredin may even make this with a club finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes Bessis probably wrote that up in BBO news|pg||
nt|tomi2: if they get kicked out a new discussion will start about the way the team gets selected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or without|pg||
pc|cK|nt|geot: At the other table Boye Brogeland made this hand simple when he overcalled 4@H over Hanlon's 1@C|pg||

nt|tomi2: in Germany we had no trials but that was like in Italy, it was because there was no real doubt that the team playing is the strongest one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|clinch: Despite the @h misguess, Gold can't put Forrester in to lead a trump without establishing a @d winner for declarer|pg||

nt|clinch: will not be right to play a third one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blum1956: The declarer needs not to discard a diamond but he cannot be sure |pg||
nt|nilsland:  same lead|pg||
nt|ritong: my crystalball is broken  i ll abstain:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4c,3d,3s note clubs not running|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|baldfriede: percentage play in @s wrong this time, but that's why it is percentage only|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|clinch: or, indeed, he may think Forrester has 4 @s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kamyk: w tym 16. N otworzy³ mini 1BA i Buras mia³ problem, co powiedzieæ z tym 5-6; mozna grac, ¿e teraz 2BA to du¿a (dowolna) dwukolorówka, ale to trzeba ustalic w ramach przedmeczowych ...|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Upmark started with 3S and 3D and will go down|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
mc|9|nt|fabsayc: went down in open room by not testing clubs immediately|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i expect lauria will figure this out|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think testing clubs first is better. keeps entries fluid and tells you how many extra tricks you beed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but is still not clear|pg||
nt|nilsland:  now its the time to play hearts - you "know" spades is offside|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  presumably 3NT deined 3@h|pg||
nt|barnets: no probs with @hs 3-3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  useful in slam auctions to find out whether opener has heart support|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  payoff is that you get too high when responder is very weak and wanted to play in 3@h|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgg: director just said 15 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzgg: plenty time|pg||
nt|barnets: In this match England have played well and France both out of luck and form which often go together|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but might be wise not to take too long in a quest for overtricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in case last board is tricky|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's problem is that if WEst has the @sA, the @sK will not be an entry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and so there will be only 3@h tricks unless the suit breaks 3-3|pg||

mc|10|nt|vugraphzgg: they settled for 10 lol|pg||

nt|ritong: i guess lauria is already thinking something gross in italian:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or a double squeeze, but of course nothing works on actual hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so laurias line may not have been wrong, just unsuccesful|pg||
nt|clinch: Terribly tough to defend... sometimes double-dummy declrer play not necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: some kind of come back for Norway in this match, and there are still 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: min NT again|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they reversed this board in their haste - Mesbur is actually N for this hand|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2 chances left for some more action|pg||
nt|henryb:  except playing a heart to the ten after two rounds of clubs|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||
nt|psyck: this is not easy|pg||
nt|pauleger: lauria will pass I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||
nt|psyck: pass may work as 4@h may go down|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden in 7 here - without success|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, computer died for a while!|pg||
nt|clinch: Gold finally has a hand we'd all open|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|blum1956: With maximal hand they open 2@c instead of 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I hope we will not be playing that nice fit...|pg||
nt|gulyas: if Madala tries 3@D now, it would be the Italians for a change who declare the same contract in both rooms:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, we'd have opened his 21-count of course|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psyck: well 4@h can make too i suppose, esp as bidding marks cards|pg||
nt|psyck: making some endplay on North possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant nothing works after the heart pitch, we could all see how to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching anything but a heart on the third club gives up on various other chances|pg||
nt|clinch: on last hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|henryb:  But maybe playing a heart before playing the third club preserves some chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcphee: @D lead best|pg||
nt|psyck: best would be to set up a @d ruff here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South opened 1@C and thus was favourite to hold the @DK - so a little bit unlucky for sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room south opened so the grand odds were different than at this table, ie a bit unlucky the diamond king offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: y, but not exactly a claimer:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: with @sA wellplaced|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: well we covered that :)|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: dì a wald di mandare anche a te programma dirette bbo su tua mail|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: there is an hallucinant bid, other room|pg||
nt|ritong: bocchi's double of 4@h|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 2@d confirmed a 17-19 balanced hand in N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: South opened in this room with 8HCP, mini NT. In the other room North opened the bidding in third seat with 9HCPs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coming up on final board of the match|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gulyas: if left to his own devices, declarer will go down|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|clinch: As 1@c could have been a number of weaker hands|pg||

nt|ahollan1: scores under  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our match is from Group B|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: well, he was not|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well actually on that lead it maybe possible to set up the 4th @D (duck the @S entry to the N hand)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|gulyas: he may still go down if S, upon winning the @HK, plays the @DQ for N to discard his @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs to play 2 rnds of @Hs eventually to ruff the 3rd|pg||
nt|gulyas: so either @HA-Q, or just Q, S wins and plays the @DQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is no duck N has a certain @s entry ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: last hand now, thanks everybody, restart in about 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcphee: england gains lead in B I think if they push this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
nt|tomi2: cards could not be friendlier, I think 6@H could make if they bid it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden EW stopped in 3@S |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SK doubleton onside, clubs 4-4, hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|psyck: see, i told you cards will slowly get exciting towards the end :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S = any shortnes, weak or strong|pg||
mb|r|nt|psyck: 2@s=any spl 5-8 or 12-14|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: their notes say 4m = minor void|pg||
nt|tomi2: so I would think this bid would show @C void and no @D void in north|pg||
nt|pauleger: S won´t believe the @c void :)|pg||
nt|clinch: It's been good bridge, I think - not obviously swingy hands, but England have handled them very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
nt|clinch: To hold France to less than 2 IMPs per board is very well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: but they have sequences where "first step = high shortnes, 2nd step = lowest shortnes" could apply. Hope they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 dwn is likely here |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, this is what the notes say: If OPENER bids 2M over 2M-1, RESP can continue with 2NT asking, showing a side suit or  a splinter.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S is plain and simple an overbid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|clinch: Good lead; makes 4 on a @s lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3NT is defined as @S void, so 4@C could be @D void and 4@D club void|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they knew what they were doing anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: everybody knows the situation holding 2 aces against a bid slam :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: most of the time it is bad to lead one of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: N and E are sitting on the same screen side, so if N thinks his bidding shows @D void he will tell this to Lauria|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|clinch: Less than 1 IMP per board of course|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: versace has the worst possible diamond holding after the double|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and 3@S prob making in other room will be 8 imps to sweden|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a problem if the opening lead was on the other side and south would explain "i dont know what this shows"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks for watching|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
pc|d6|nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mcphee: i had a few specs suggest @D was best|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who were asking -- this is why Fantoni didn't need to continue @C immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- if Nunes original trump was @D9xx  then    oops|pg||
nt|jkotor: ruff high, play low @d, and makes|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is making now I think - the defence dont have the 2nd @d trick|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D showed @Hs, was not alerted by the operator|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
nt|clinch: So this looks to be a flat board... thanks everyone for bearing with me - see you tomorrow!|pg||
