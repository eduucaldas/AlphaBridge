pc|c7|nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
