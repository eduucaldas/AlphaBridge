nt|james_h: e/w ignoring and bidding natural|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: Sorry everyone for the delay. We are halfway through board 2. Return to normal service at board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: Bocchi is in 4@h on board 1. 1 off on a diamond lead|pg||

nt|geot: Normal to get to 4@S here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller play Tarzan Precision  but they open fewer hands at 1-level than most big clubbers|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|james_h: This match is likely to count as both teams likely to qualify for the 2nd week of action|pg||
pc|c6|nt|geot: 3NT would maybe better this time|pg||
nt|james_h: y|pg||
nt|geot: same contract at the other table|pg||
nt|james_h: prob both -1, lets see|pg||
nt|geot: Hard to win this one, have to solve both the clubs and the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: NS tell me the names are in wrong - Berg playing South, Svendsen North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most other rooms NS playing 2@S|pg||

nt|bobholl: good result for tarzan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 12-14  covers many distributions you might not expect|pg||
nt|james_h: it might be tempting for some souths to bid more over 4s but those @h honours are not as valuable as U might think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|tez: 1 sanzatu açar mý?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller will probably bid 2@D to ask for longer major|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: Mesbur did give it a look but took the low road|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: oni atakuj¹!!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: wheather N is going to bid 2nt for minors (doubt it) after 2@H ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened 1@C but i thought they also played weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that choice did allow North to enter the auction|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|tez: bu aralar moda herþeyle 1 sanzatu açmak|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: ahhhh  1st seat favorable  [not vul vs vul]  Brink-Drijver 1N=9-12|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|geot: I am told Norway reached 3NT on this one in the OR. |pg||
nt|james_h: robust bidding|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe hard to avoid game in a natural system, and even playing strong club (?)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: batacak|pg||
nt|geot: I can not see 4@H having any chances, but 3NT on a diamond lead is close|pg||
nt|james_h: e/w are not favourites to break the bridge land speed record|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so we are up and running at last|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|james_h: a simple auction compared to the open room|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|james_h: Martin worked a miracle, the names are right now|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary up by 5 by not bidding a game with 19 hcp and a 5-3 fit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzgn: there is always a way!|pg||
nt|james_h: Were you at the Eucharistic Congress this morning Martin?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Not my style, am a Protestant exile in Ireland!|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@H made, 4@H didn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: this time its a normal 3nt that looks doomed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tez: @d çaka alabilirlerse|pg||
nt|geot: Should be four losers in this contract|pg||
nt|james_h: I fear that last like will be lost on most kibs|pg||
nt|james_h: line|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer correctly guessed that S would put up an honor from HTx|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he has to have both honors to play low - or no chance anyway|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tez: zor deðil|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ken__: karoyu hiç açamayabilirler|pg||
nt|geot: North will not cover the spades, and from there the defence will come to four tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|tez: yerden alabilecekleri pek þey yok çünkü|pg||
mc|10|nt|james_h: North streached to get the @h lead, not a bad policy in general|pg||

nt|james_h: 1 IMP each ... were on the edge of our seats|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Both West players in this match opened 3@S here. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS spot card leads are  Slawinsky     hi = even with honor  or  odd with no honor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if willard had the diamond king and golin the queen, golin should have overtaken heart queen, so i am pretty sure oliveri should know to underlead diamond ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he will be endplayed eventually (and we also know the 4th @S will be good, so no need for the @HA)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decent explanation of the leads on their submitted convention card|pg||
nt|bobholl: lucky lead for the netherlands (over tricks now)|pg||

nt|gulyas: if he did, declarer can win the @H and put him in with @Ss - its a matter of figuring out the distributions really|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: east spots in hearts are not good enough to lose a trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 4 should make|pg||
nt|mathat: ?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|venedik: 5@D  enteresan |pg||
nt|james_h: this is not a plesant declaring experience|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: if QJ95x you could lose to K10 onside after a cover by finessing on the way back|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ken__: Berk in dbl ý çok anlamsýz bence|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: there was no need to play diamonds first since you basically need clubs to break and heart king onside to have any chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this line has complicated matter, she is aiming to pitch a club on diamond jack, but to gain a trick that way she needs four spade ruffs in hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ryskiel_: lepiej jakby jeszcze raz pusci³|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|james_h: Its a marginal decision either way|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: and a lot because he is not going to finesse @D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|james_h: the pre empt that is|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||

mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c is probably a version of Drury showing 3 card fir|pg||
nt|geot: I think on board 10, the 3@S, it was something to be said for playing the Ace of trumps first. That is if East had KJ doubleton. So playing the ace and later play as he did was ...|pg||

nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nunes didn't open with 4-Qs  so deWijs can't with only 4-Js|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- let's play this again|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are the best team in my opinon|pg||
nt|james_h: I seriously doubt that Monaci will win, while wishing them well at the same time|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|james_h: Monaco|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|geot: Italy favourites of course, then the World Champs the Netherlands|pg||
nt|james_h: y, throw Poland into the mix also|pg||
nt|geot: But I think Monaco has a chance|pg||
nt|geot: Polan is always in such a mix|pg||
nt|james_h: only 17 imps on that hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh big swing - played from the other hand and teh S lead gave declarer more options, went -2|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|geot: Will be interesting to see how Israel goes|pg||
nt|james_h: They have shown no form dispite bursting with talent|pg||
nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
mb|3H!|an|bal slam try, 4!Ss|mb|p|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||
nt|james_h: 3@h is a balanced slam try (I think)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|james_h: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: dont know if it will make any difference tho|pg||
nt|geot: Unusual to let E/W play 3@C I think|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel are a tough outfit, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
mb|5H|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
mb|5S|nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|geot: Myself I do not like 3@S the first time unless it is agreed to show some cards|pg||
nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ferlema: http://csbnews.org/my-way-iv-by-norberto-bocchi/?lang=en|pg||
pc|s4|nt|james_h: I have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
pc|s2|nt|geot: but I dont think it can be right to let opps play 3@C on Souths hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Muller will think again -- but it is too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes as dummy takes out a magazine to read|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Italy, Monaco or Ireland??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dT|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|james_h: My bridge suffers from real life and vice versa|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kdr_fm: people suggest a squeeze - but the squeeze card is the 4th @C and the @h9 ... not the J so west saves the day|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|james_h: @hj to transfer the manace (hoping that West has long clubs)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|james_h: cos he can t squeeze E|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|james_h: sry, its automatic|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|james_h: bye|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: laters James|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if west had held 4@C's declarer could have led the @HJ transferring the menace to West (@HT) and then the squeeze would have worked ... not today|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: problem loading the next board here, apologies. play continues, we will try to catch up|pg||
nt|psyck: other room vu gr operator could not load 17 eiter, even after restarting|pg||
nt|psyck: redeal to 17 was just not working|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Not the worse slam ever even @HQx in either hand lets it make but even with all the bits and pieces still below 50% I think - i'll let some statistican figure the actual odds|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: The S hand with the 4333 shape I think has bid enough with 5@h over 5@C both good bids ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: our BBO team is working on it apparently... in the meantime Mesbur Fitzgibbon power on to another slam!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whow no stopping them :>|pg||
