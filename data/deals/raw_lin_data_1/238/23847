pc|c2|nt|tomi2: was just going to type about the "fast play" from the point of view of an operator:|pg||
nt|eweber:  hello back, I fear there was a connection loss for everyone|pg||
nt|tomi2: following too fast tables is not possible with the BBO software. it always takes a little time until a card clicked on the operators PC is "played" in the software. If players play ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: faster than the information are transmitted between Dublin and the BBO servers and back, its simply impossible to record all tricks|pg||
