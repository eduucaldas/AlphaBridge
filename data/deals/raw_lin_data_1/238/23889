nt|barnets: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: but contract is written 3@H on bocchis record|pg||

nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||
pc|dT|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||

pc|s9|nt|star6ija: yes...this way avoiding trump queen guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, needed to avoid leading a @d from hand.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like defence should play trumps at every opportunity  even west give up a trump trick to stop any cross ruff|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back to -1 again...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: If they make overtricks..........|pg||
nt|desinka: h tables starts from 1st board..|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||

mb|p|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||

nt|ady: n/s   have 3NT   with their 28 hcp   not in the bidding yest|pg||
nt|james_h: it counters this situation here|pg||

nt|ady: south should certainly have taken some action first round|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon did well to recover|pg||
nt|ady: North has taken a gamble balancing at that level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 top tricks playing their 5-5 fit in 3nt, but  it's not likely...|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|eamongall: hi ..eamon galligan here ..I reconstructed play on board 1 here .. fairly close ..bidding I made up also |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|star6ija: these 4 @h are little tricky|pg||
nt|jbgood: and at the other table a heart was lead - since E opened 1 @h|pg||
nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||

nt|ady: 3@S  shows 4 hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: and they play in the predictable 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
nt|ady: west is aware of 4 spades with south    the 3@D response to puppet said no 5 card major  but promised at least 1 4 card major|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: the right decision taken by Upmark to pass for penalty brought 5 more IMPs to Swedes with Tsonchev - Marashev going down 1 on 4 @h in board 3|pg||

nt|ady: club lead to save a trick|pg||
nt|ady: otherside club could have been pitched on a diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond ace may disappear for defense|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: not clear what South should do. 4-4-4-1 with partner's suit your singleton is not a good recipe for NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fisher agrees|pg||
nt|james_h: We appreciate your at the table comments Dermot, keep up please|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  the NT can be 5-3-3-2, 5-4-2-2 (but not in the majors) and 4-4-4-1 besides three run  of the mill 4-3-3-3 and 4-3-4-2|pg||

nt|poohbear: Though I suspect if he was declaring he would bid it :P|pg||
nt|star6ija: this one looks like a chance for Bulgarians to shorten the gap|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think 3@C means?|pg||
nt|jbennet: he has passed initallly, showed both monors, and then all of u sudden a double comes.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|panosk: natural?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: they disregard Berg's double|pg||
nt|james_h: might do the same but I'll bring the netbook to the kettle|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h ataga batar|pg||
nt|yusufb: ama geeciþi bulmasý lazým|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oleberg:  The lower the partscore, the faster you lead a trump|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: already 8 tricks |pg||

pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: EW playing French Standard -- their convention card doesn't hint at why 2@C alerted|pg||

nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|sengulerz: Lauria @dyu bilemezse 1 imp kazanýrýz|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 6@C could be reached but EW double (I assume for majors) should warn NS |pg||
nt|jbennet: not 100% safe of course but indeed a good chance. of score big. |pg||
nt|yusufb: @h 10 suit preferans olabilir @d için|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: @s  ataðýna hemen karar vermek zorunda kalacak|pg||
nt|tez: yerde rua vale varsa küçük çýkmak lazým deðil mi hocam?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: If 3@C still could be 5-5 S have a very good hand|pg||
nt|ady: declarer not running the club as wants to set up discards of spades on diamonds  before east can switchto a spade|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive he need some sort of endplay if defence is correct|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: if S keeps at least 4@D can be 1 down and a push|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs stunned the Gold passed|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand E's pass either|pg||
nt|xenya: too refined for my taste|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s yapay..nedir bilmiyorum|pg||

nt|arvidsson: wow I did not expect that|pg||
nt|yusufb: ama @c A ceksede|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: edilirsede bilsin|pg||
nt|funtay: Salvonun burdaki 4ntsi oynamaya daha fazla gitmeyelim kötü elim var)|pg||
nt|panosk: so N cant be 5-5 since S wud have taken off|pg||
nt|arvidsson: unlucky break (can you say so, after W did say he got some @H by double)|pg||
nt|barnets: good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: seftesi burdan|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|geot: If he goes down, which not at all is unlikely now, he will really regret not trying the spade 8 in the first trick.|pg||
nt|geot: Oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: chatting 0 the old rule of eleven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is the safest line to avoid a spade loser|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: W thaought he was trying to bluff a trick for the @h king - with nothing in his hand'|pg||
nt|tez: @h vale vermesi iyi olmadý..ama defans zor deðil|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oleberg:  But if he keeps 3 diamonds, two hearts and two spades, it will be down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@dX was played in OR for -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N opened 1@h and E was able to bid @s and then double @ds for further takeout.  W was only too happy to leave it in.|pg||
nt|geot: On a club switch from West instead of that 1H10, declarer can still win|pg||
nt|baardolav: everything solved... with a @c can win with ace, spade to ace and jack of @h|pg||
nt|yusufb: gelme denince @d doner|pg||
nt|barnets: with no spot cards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|star6ija: Mihov will take 10 here|pg||
nt|tez: bilemezse de egale olsun:)|pg||
nt|tez: good point funtay:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: ostensibly  lead is 4th from JTxx or better|pg||
pc|hK|mc|11|nt|geot: yes, and he can also duck the club, then fly ace on a spade back, and set up the clubs with two entries to dummy in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: in the closed room perhaps n/s were lucky to avoid a X|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but now the club king disappears, i knew somehow one or the other would|pg||

nt|barnets: north overcalled 4@C in open and perhaps surprisingly south did not raid to 5|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room w treated his 7-5 as a 1 suiter and this time it didn't work out.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force -- a couple of different hand types |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen can ask [1@S] or start to describe his hand via 1N|pg||
nt|baardolav: first grandslam today|pg||
nt|james_h: The Bulgarians were quite agressive at both tables on the last hand and paid the price|pg||
nt|jbennet: bridge an easy game sometimes, Bid longest suit first and nest time the 2nd longest suit. |pg||
nt|barnets: really ?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|andyv:  2@h = p/c|pg||
nt|arvidsson: rdbl is just for strengt and the pass by west is probbebly forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@C more likely by south than west in my opinion :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2nt+2 lik eli bizimkiler 2@s oynuyor|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2C is checkback |pg||
nt|poohbear: looking for partner's majors|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|sengulerz: 2@c gazilli mi?|pg||
nt|barnets: now east is wondering what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|barnets: why didnt he bid diamonds before himself|pg||
nt|barnets: at the 4 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there any possibility this is a cue in support of @Ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: is this a natural bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west made a clever move; 4 clubs then removing 4 sp should tell his p "I have a massive red-suiter and think that the 5 level is safe"|pg||
nt|barnets: why do I have this problem ?|pg||
nt|barnets: he thinks it should be obvious to his partner but I assure you it is not|pg||
nt|jbennet: cue for spades?? 5 clubs would be cue for spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: or he would have bid already|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east has hands on head thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: east is wondering what is going on and probably should bid 6@D to cover all possiblities|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many are telling me (all for different reasons) that this "Can't" show @s support.  I agree, if you're looking at the w hand it's obvious it can't.|pg||
nt|barnets: you , I and west know that bit does east ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east have to work this out, but if he thinks that west is showing a red 2-suiter good enough to go to the 5 level. East just might raise to 6 d.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 12-14 HCP  and exact shape|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet yorgunluk var belli bide vugrafta cok oynuyoruz oda bi etken|pg||

nt|barnets: well done for reaching diamonds|pg||

nt|rodvenn: how is N going to set this?|pg||

nt|arvidsson: this will not be any trouble for EW they reached a good contract, and will take 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: now 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: this time north did well to ldraw conclusions from the bidding , ew were favourites at have at most 9 spades between them , ergo p har at most 1 heart.  and duly led one.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@C = maximum [in context]  3 keycards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in response to 4@D  'slave' can also describe  bad or medium hand for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held same hand with @DQ instead of @CQ   i wonder if he bids the same way or treats the hand as 15+ HCP|pg||

nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tez: 2 fazla oldu|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||

nt|barnets: lucky for e/w no X|pg||

nt|barnets: but swing earned by east for Italy in open by opening 4@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||

nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 5h can even be set -3. |pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: eamongall here for a few boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good contract, game on few HCPs and nice fit, but you can not expect to win such a board in an international championship, and especially playing against Italy|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lookes strange, might be some operating glitch?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we see that perfect defense defeats 3N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if defense does NOT take first 5 -- then declarer takes first 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did rebid 3N with east hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner was unpassed and unlimited East would bid 2NT and give partner room to describe|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  and the match is tied|pg||
nt|tez: @h dam al @s oyna|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he plays AK of @s then he might lose to 4-1 spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: south won the points here by bidding 3@H and tking away a constructive move from west|pg||
nt|jbennet: will he make it?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 sp+|pg||
nt|santyclz: While any team could win any match, you're not going to get rich betting against Italy...|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room south passed 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: likely spade lead    then easy|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|jbgood: Norwegian ladies way ahead against Germany! (without Auken - von Arnim on the team though)  |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ele çekerse @c dam|pg||

nt|tez: ya da as @s alýp @h empas yapar..tehlikesiz tarafa|pg||
nt|james_h: unfortunately there is no minor suit squeeze as north has to discard before east|pg||
nt|ady: now looking further     5@C seems ok    but 6 should fail    although only 1 top loser|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 6 will make actually|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks in clubs as A@D   comes down in 3   so can play diamond to king   and ruff the ace out   also ruff finesse k@S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|geot: Blind guess what to lead of H or S, and spade lead seems more appealing I guess|pg||
nt|james_h: so a likely -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: heralde salonun egale bordu olur|pg||
nt|poohbear: might not be able to do anything about that anyway|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: good cardsence from Odin Svendsen here, 4@c is a good bid, know his hand is of little value in NT, short on entrance, only one top trick, @c game looks more tempting, even 5@c ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: should make from South point of view|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ady: there is a squeeze on east |pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: bitti..bizim çalýþan hata yapamaz bu elde:)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: diamond to king and then ruffing spade finesse is one way to make|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|james_h: oh right its automatic sry|pg||
nt|ady: but west has found the switch to break the squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I do not believe Fredin switched in @cs in board 10|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9|pg||
nt|ady: not the greatest contract    but lets see|pg||

nt|jbgood: apart from the winning di finesse there is also a remote chance for a partial eliminatiin and club endplay - N will be fixed|pg||
nt|jbgood: depending on S NOT playing the @c jack of course|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still the di finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|sharkey: The difference on Bd 13 was the interference by EW at this table.  NS were left alone and arrived at 6@C CR|pg||
