nt|lechcold: w Ameryce mog³aby to byæ np. karta Ax, Kxxxx, xx, KDxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sp error or typing, you decide|pg||
nt|clinch: but...|pg||
nt|clinch: In theory 8-11 NV, though 12 here|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: ok, 3@C is 5@D+5!M, inv+|pg||
nt|gulyas: it could be several other hands, too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kamyk: chyba tak - 3@S by³ó lepsze|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm told they sometimes open 11 not-vul  but don't recall ever seeing that|pg||
nt|clinch: Will have shown his maximum, leaving Gold an interesting decision|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dolayýsý ile 5li majörü kaybetmemek daha önemli hale geliyor|pg||
nt|tez: pastan geldiði için rahatça kontr diyebiliyor..birde @d damýný almanýn en kolay yolu|pg||

mb|3H|nt|tez: benden size tavsiye hiçbirþey için hiç bir zaman demeyin:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: think it's either weak or GF|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 4@s will make in practice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nilsland:  4@H is a good sacrifice against 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  NS make 5C but not 5D!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: put the jack on this trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gayet atak bir deklare|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3 nt oynanacak|pg||
nt|tez: burada da|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2 imps to Ireland db 9 2@h-1 vs 3@d+1|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, or 12+|pg||
nt|clinch: With trumps breaking|pg||
mb|d|nt|ken__: 2@c attýðý için o opsiyon kalmadý tabi:)|pg||
nt|tez: ben beni gördüm çok: açarken:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Only lead to give cause for concern is @h K|pg||
nt|clinch: Although this is awkward in a way|pg||
nt|clinch: Will be saved by @d A position|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kör atak edildiðinde hemen olacak|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psyck: 3@h short suit try|pg||
nt|psyck: when N rejects try, S settles for game|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: no, forget that, its 5@D5M, limit or better|pg||
nt|fabsayc: close to making, in fact i think it makes|pg||
nt|reisig: Might make this|pg||
nt|gulyas: I can understand that double:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Madala has called TD|pg||
nt|james_h: I expected McGann-Hanlon to compete on that board|pg||

mb|5D|nt|tez: hiç kimse bilemedi 4@c oynanacaðýný|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2c not alerted at the time but later explained as Gazilli|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, this late to decide to bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s needs a correct club guess after the heart lead, being laydown after the diamond one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ken__: ve demiþler gerçekten|pg||
nt|ken__: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = South African Texas     standard Texas transfers with 4@D/@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is right of course, but unusual|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: not sure. play continues, but he has left the table. may only be looking for some1 to turn the cards|pg||
nt|blum1956: If the declarer uses the diamond suit correctly he will sooner or later win|pg||
nt|blum1956: But he does not know the advere distribution. The only thing he may be sure after the lead - 3rs spade trick|pg||
nt|tez: @h as @h as diye tezahurat yapmayýn..@s atak edecek|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: actually 3s is beatable|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he is back now explaining his absence - but in italian!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ace and ruff and second ruff when in with spade ace|pg||
nt|james_h: The difference on board 9 was Fitzgibbon deciding to upgrade his 13 count to a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7 tricks on top.  Possible overtrick in H, or long spade - but i doubt declarer will risk anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kötü deðil aslýnda. kör ruanýn uçmasýna baðlý |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|tez: 4lü @s im varken 2@h açmýþsam..@s imi @d larýn arasýna koymuþum pardon ortak diyorum|pg||

nt|pauleger: flat 3NT game here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 diamonds, 2 clubs and 1 heart for 9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama þlem için daha yüksek yüzde gerekir. %50 bile az. yani bir empasa þlem uynamak uzun vadede karlý deðil|pg||

mb|1N|nt|vugraphzeq: bu günün son eli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west hand automatic opener for most big clubbers -- not sure if deWijs will open 1N [good 12-15]|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@d is 4+ diamonds unbalanced|pg||
nt|begse: tek karo|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: X=majors|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|gulyas: it was the lucky 1nt opening - if it went 1@C-1@H overcall, they would never have gotten to this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Fantoni's DBL = same HCP as opener|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a fairly routine 3NT E/W ..|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score on board 7 is still wrong|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@H is down on a diamond lead - as 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club towards the jack|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South would like to X here - but it may show a hand with 4+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: Batman Briç Kulübü tüm takýmlara baþarýlar diliyor|pg||
nt|ken__: Batman Briç Kulübü tüm takýmlara baþarýlar diliyor|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: but Muller treating the DBL as artificial rather than Penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: 6@s gelinmesi zor fakat yapýlabiliyor|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: son bord herkese teþekkürler|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok board 7 finally correct|pg||
nt|ritong: really saying " you won t toy with me lorenzo"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see any reason to bid with fredin's hand|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@s probably preemptive, as X mainly disruptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|eyamut: sabah mý?|pg||
nt|blum1956: the rest is simple|pg||
nt|james_h: throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|nilsland:  surprisingly - but RD showed a good hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And Lauria is hoping for a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he expects the contract to be cold|pg||
nt|clinch: Well it's obviously preemptive... I mean by agreement|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn knows that Lauria is prepared for a club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate " my @hs are fine"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble=max hand probably|pg||
nt|ritong: has he?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|caruse57: Bu turnuvanýn hazýrlanmasýnda ve vugrap'da yayýnlamasý için ugraþýlarýný esirgemiyen Sayýn Erdoðan ÖZBEY arkadaþýmýza.Modern Briç Kulubu oyuncularý adýna teþekkür ederim|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South is playing 2NT with a heart lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not in my book|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@c is probably a version of Drury showing 3 card fir|pg||
nt|geot: I think on board 10, the 3@S, it was something to be said for playing the Ace of trumps first. That is if East had KJ doubleton. So playing the ace and later play as he did was ...|pg||
nt|geot: acdtually ok|pg||
nt|james_h: fit|pg||
nt|james_h: 2s = min|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3@d = 4+ @c I am told|pg||
nt|psyck: so E shows his suits by not bidding them|pg||
nt|clinch: Might have been clobbered if N only had 4 @s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: interesting use of 4C as a kind of leaping michaels, kibitzers will no doubt say standard in France but new to me|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1S shows @D i assume - 2@s anyone know what that means ?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@d pretty comfortable losing 3 red tricks in all likelihood|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: i blame it on the defenseless 3@S bid :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: when did that bid promise any defenses?:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: I first played against Tiit Laanemae in... probably 1979. |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: defenseless bids cause opponents to overbid|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, this may make|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: akþam pardon|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: no bonus points for being in 5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: N needs to cash his @HQ to beat it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: its true that his black suit holdings are not very promising|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: after 2@h 3@H by w|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: if pd has a @C honor, and only one @H honor, @HQ could be fatal|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: i speak about led|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he has closed the screen and asked if 3@c was forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||
nt|gulyas: but its attitude as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he cannot have Axxx|pg||

pc|h6|nt|geot: the 4@S I mean, reached and won by both teams|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|james_h: well denies a major anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D explained as 18-19 bal - hard to overhear, but I think 2@s was explained as denying major|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: or gives them a real lead, to put it that way. |pg||
nt|james_h: the 11-13 1@c gave Hanlon-McGann the opportunity to locate a double fitting hand|pg||

nt|gulyas: well, ok, 3nt is easy:)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 12 imps for sweden - stayed low in 3@h bd 10 and Ireland pushed to 3NT on bd 11|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|james_h: good judgement on the 3@h by NS in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Tough 3@S bid from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at other table nystrom doubled 2@H, a move i think should show a better overall hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: and North bids 3NT on the stiff king over his partner's t/o double|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that versace does not wander in doubling 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: All fine about the spades, but 3NT does not work very well anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C artificial game force, not sure about the rest|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No slam possible here.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and whats the TD verdict pls operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: still no ruling on board 3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|james_h: it maybe helped by the EW action|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: declarer will want to draw trumps may just cash the K+A and then play on D which works on all 3/2 splits.  If the trumps 4/1 though ...|pg||

nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||

pc|c5|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|nilsland:  It has come down to Lauria vs Upmark. Make you bets!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he only has 10 top tricks, so play is very complicated|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs to strip E of his @d s  then throw him in|pg||
nt|clinch: Also needed to play two trumps as now W can trump third @c|pg||
nt|clinch: Perhaps too double-dummy|pg||

nt|tomi2: if he lead from a doubleton it might be important to play another @D killing the dummy if south has two|pg||

nt|ritong: i guess lauria is already thinking something gross in italian:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or a double squeeze, but of course nothing works on actual hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so laurias line may not have been wrong, just unsuccesful|pg||
nt|clinch: Terribly tough to defend... sometimes double-dummy declrer play not necessary|pg||
mb|4H|nt|geot: some kind of come back for Norway in this match, and there are still 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|d|nt|geot: min NT again|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they reversed this board in their haste - Mesbur is actually N for this hand|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2 chances left for some more action|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bbo ile anlaþmamýza göre türkiyenin vugraf maçlarýnda kapalý oda yorumu türkçe yapýlacak þekilde|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||
nt|psyck: this is not easy|pg||
nt|pauleger: lauria will pass I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||
nt|psyck: pass may work as 4@h may go down|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden in 7 here - without success|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, computer died for a while!|pg||
nt|clinch: Gold finally has a hand we'd all open|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iþte hizmet :) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|blum1956: With maximal hand they open 2@c instead of 1@d|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: I hope we will not be playing that nice fit...|pg||
nt|gulyas: if Madala tries 3@D now, it would be the Italians for a change who declare the same contract in both rooms:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, we'd have opened his 21-count of course|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|psyck: well 4@h can make too i suppose, esp as bidding marks cards|pg||
nt|psyck: making some endplay on North possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant nothing works after the heart pitch, we could all see how to make it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching anything but a heart on the third club gives up on various other chances|pg||
nt|clinch: on last hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  But maybe playing a heart before playing the third club preserves some chances|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D lead best|pg||
nt|psyck: best would be to set up a @d ruff here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South opened 1@C and thus was favourite to hold the @DK - so a little bit unlucky for sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room south opened so the grand odds were different than at this table, ie a bit unlucky the diamond king offside|pg||
pc|c3|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||

nt|polpkeeper: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: there is an hallucinant bid, other room|pg||
nt|ritong: bocchi's double of 4@h|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 2@d confirmed a 17-19 balanced hand in N|pg||
pc|hA|nt|geot: South opened in this room with 8HCP, mini NT. In the other room North opened the bidding in third seat with 9HCPs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coming up on final board of the match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: if left to his own devices, declarer will go down|pg||
pc|h5|nt|clinch: As 1@c could have been a number of weaker hands|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|gulyas: he may still go down if S, upon winning the @HK, plays the @DQ for N to discard his @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs to play 2 rnds of @Hs eventually to ruff the 3rd|pg||
nt|gulyas: so either @HA-Q, or just Q, S wins and plays the @DQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is no duck N has a certain @s entry ...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bu maçtaki son ele geldik|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: last hand now, thanks everybody, restart in about 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: england gains lead in B I think if they push this one|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
nt|tomi2: cards could not be friendlier, I think 6@H could make if they bid it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden EW stopped in 3@S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: yorumlarýyla bizi aydýnlatan nafiz zorlu, tezcan þen, yusuf sohtorik e çok teþekkürler|pg||

mb|p|nt|yusufb: selamm levent bolþanss|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SK doubleton onside, clubs 4-4, hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|psyck: see, i told you cards will slowly get exciting towards the end :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S = any shortnes, weak or strong|pg||
nt|ozgull: önemli maçlarýmýzdan biri üstgruba skorumuz taþýnacaðý için kazanmak önemli umarýmson bord birþey olmaz 18 çok iyi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iyi oynayan millilerimize de|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks to our excellent operator MArtin|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: 2@s=any spl 5-8 or 12-14|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: their notes say 4m = minor void|pg||
nt|tomi2: so I would think this bid would show @C void and no @D void in north|pg||
nt|pauleger: S won´t believe the @c void :)|pg||
nt|clinch: It's been good bridge, I think - not obviously swingy hands, but England have handled them very well|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
nt|clinch: To hold France to less than 2 IMPs per board is very well done|pg||
nt|tez: 2d yý 18 19 dengeli oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet cýkacak olan takýmlardan alýnan puanlar onemli 18 iyi skor|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: but they have sequences where "first step = high shortnes, 2nd step = lowest shortnes" could apply. Hope they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 dwn is likely here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thank you|pg||
nt|ozgull: herkese iyi günler iyidilekleriniz  bizle olsun|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bugün baþka maç yok|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt oluyor|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: yes, this is what the notes say: If OPENER bids 2M over 2M-1, RESP can continue with 2NT asking, showing a side suit or  a splinter.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S is plain and simple an overbid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýnki 3 maçtan hangisinin yayýnlanacaðý akþam belli oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: @c dam 3lü|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
pc|s4|nt|clinch: Good lead; makes 4 on a @s lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bana iletiliyor ve ben de TBF web sayfasýnda yayýnlanmasý için bildiriyorum|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2: 3NT is defined as @S void, so 4@C could be @D void and 4@D club void|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they knew what they were doing anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: everybody knows the situation holding 2 aces against a bid slam :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: most of the time it is bad to lead one of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: N and E are sitting on the same screen side, so if N thinks his bidding shows @D void he will tell this to Lauria|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|clinch: Less than 1 IMP per board of course|pg||
nt|tez: diðer masada 1 nt oynanýyor|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: versace has the worst possible diamond holding after the double|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and 3@S prob making in other room will be 8 imps to sweden|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a problem if the opening lead was on the other side and south would explain "i dont know what this shows"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks for watching|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who were asking -- this is why Fantoni didn't need to continue @C immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- if Nunes original trump was @D9xx  then    oops|pg||
nt|jkotor: ruff high, play low @d, and makes|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is making now I think - the defence dont have the 2nd @d trick|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
nt|clinch: So this looks to be a flat board... thanks everyone for bearing with me - see you tomorrow!|pg||
