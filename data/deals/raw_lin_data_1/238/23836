pc|s2|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||

nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|d8|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||

nt|james_h: 2@c is a Tx to @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I appreciate Mihov's overcall in the OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT depends on who bids it. Safe from West not from East|pg||
mb|4S|nt|james_h: 1@d is natural and unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||

pc|c4|nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: @s  ataðýna hemen karar vermek zorunda kalacak|pg||
nt|tez: yerde rua vale varsa küçük çýkmak lazým deðil mi hocam?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: If 3@C still could be 5-5 S have a very good hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive he need some sort of endplay if defence is correct|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|panosk: so N cant be 5-5 since S wud have taken off|pg||
nt|arvidsson: unlucky break (can you say so, after W did say he got some @H by double)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|geot: If he goes down, which not at all is unlikely now, he will really regret not trying the spade 8 in the first trick.|pg||
nt|geot: Oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: chatting 0 the old rule of eleven|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: W thaought he was trying to bluff a trick for the @h king - with nothing in his hand'|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But if he keeps 3 diamonds, two hearts and two spades, it will be down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@dX was played in OR for -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N opened 1@h and E was able to bid @s and then double @ds for further takeout.  W was only too happy to leave it in.|pg||
nt|geot: On a club switch from West instead of that 1H10, declarer can still win|pg||
nt|baardolav: everything solved... with a @c can win with ace, spade to ace and jack of @h|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: Mihov will take 10 here|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ostensibly  lead is 4th from JTxx or better|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|geot: yes, and he can also duck the club, then fly ace on a spade back, and set up the clubs with two entries to dummy in diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|geot: will in that case depend on East holding the Q of hearts|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: beeing Bulgarian supporter I like what happens here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Which seems like the obvious cards to keep|pg||
nt|star6ija: as far as this is about to go down...and there are 2 options for Mihov - Karakolev in the OR (to stay at 1N or to bid 3) some IMPs might have been expected for Bg team|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: good example of a simple, straightforward auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 1N opener here caused some unexpected problems.  Hard to imagine that EW don'|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|vugraphzgp: one round of hearts have been played so far|pg||
nt|jbgood: so maybe Norway will get off the schneid now|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 6@D on this hand, but only double dummy. Has to drop the @DK|pg||
nt|geot: Madala did not re-open with a double at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: second trick won by EW so logic tells me a diamond queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: from there on it is quessswork sorry|pg||
nt|jbgood: just wait for the final result and give us that, Tos|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually it would have been more interesting to see wheter Aronov would have found the lead against 3 N played by South|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|panosk: if you go a 20 hcp game and 5 are useless its not gd news, but i also think many will venture 4@H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Drijver did rebid 3N with east hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner was unpassed and unlimited East would bid 2NT and give partner room to describe|pg||
nt|panosk: this might get expensive|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kbitzer: 600  cepte görmek  dbl ý tutmak..|pg||
nt|yusufb: rakip 1nt dedikten sonra 3nt ye ulaþmak ve yapmak cok nadir olan bi durum|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a very good double by E and this might be whats needed for norway to get back in the lead |pg||
nt|arvidsson: declarer need to cash out for -800 otherwise this could go for 1100|pg||
