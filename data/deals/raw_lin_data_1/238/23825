nt|kingcur: 10 now, and flat again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: either 3NT by NS or 3@H X by E|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks routine to bid|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|ritong: i would opt for the first one|pg||
nt|april7: what kind of a bid is 1@H??|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|ritong: because i have trouble imagining how the second can happen|pg||
nt|april7: not vuln. weak jump of 3@H, very easy|pg||
nt|kingcur: S opening red vz white on an 11 count, but it's not unusual these days, especially when holding the 'boss suit'|pg||
nt|pelu:  22-10 = 18-12, but 1IMP for Poland = 17-13|pg||
mb|d|nt|kingcur: Important then is to have the gear available to keep the bidding under control|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT only 8 tricks on @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: only 2 down though|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess that's rkc for @C but just a guess|pg||
nt|kingcur: since not every 12 count is going to be good for game anymore, and more stuff we are used to playing at our local bridge club|pg||
nt|kingcur: normal 4@S here, and reached swiftly|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt 4nt 6nt olabilir devamý|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: in 6@C you have to guess who has the @S K|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: good bidding 5@C much better than 3NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: and after @D lead, you have little option but to go right: @SA and @SQ, discarding @D if W doesn't cover|pg||

nt|santyclz: Particularly on that lead.|pg||
nt|kingcur: so, even when this is not a great slam, it will likely make if NS would be in it in the other room|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but 2@C and a simple finesse migth work too (but you go 1 down more if wrong so ??)|pg||
