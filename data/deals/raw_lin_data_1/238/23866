pc|sK|nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: request for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|tez: @h atak edebilir zorlu|pg||

nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tez: iddialý atak ediyorlar..eðer en küçüðüyse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes...this way avoiding trump queen guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||

nt|poohbear: Didnt see that North dbled the final contract. This is somethign that modern bidding has frowned upon|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
pc|d7|nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: If they make overtricks..........|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: 6 imps for Bulgaria for the dbl|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  the play would have been interesting|pg||
nt|geot: to take 2 down I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||
nt|ady: so in fact 6 imps to Bulgaria   Hanlon played 10@S  in the end game  ttrying to give impresion of Q10 left I would think|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d alsaydý oynayan entresan sekilde oluyordu @c lere nafiz abi kart tutamýyordu@h @s atamazdý @d atsada @d tahsil edilemiyordu|pg||
nt|tez: operator yanlýþ klikledi|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|star6ija: and another Bulgarian pair in the OR, whose agressive style misleaded Swedes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is very aggressive|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mihov has taken good decision in the OR|pg||
nt|desinka: this one looks like flat to me...|pg||
nt|james_h: tough position for NS here|pg||
nt|funtay: 12 ile açmadý Nafiz abi|pg||
nt|tez: 10 imp bize|pg||
nt|funtay: 4-4 major ile açardým, siz?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: diðer masada 3@d oynanýyordu bu el|pg||
nt|tez: @h ataðýna batacak burda|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4-3 e 4@s iyi kontrat ama bulmak zor|pg||
nt|tez: nafiz abi diyor ki @h asýyla al küçük @d yý oyna..batýr bakalým:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I like Fantunes defence to Multi ... X shows @h|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have 3NT   with their 28 hcp   not in the bidding yest|pg||
nt|james_h: it counters this situation here|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Shwartz did here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Can never tell with these big distribution hands|pg||
nt|tez: oynayanlar skoru görmüyor..masada oynuyorlar..yanlarýnda bilgisayar operatörü var..genelde isimleri kenan oluyor..onlar masada ne olduysa bize iletiyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: 2@d tek renkli major eli|pg||
nt|ady: south should certainly have taken some action first round|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon did well to recover|pg||
nt|ady: North has taken a gamble balancing at that level|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|star6ija: these 4 @h are little tricky|pg||
nt|jbgood: and at the other table a heart was lead - since E opened 1 @h|pg||
nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in trouble now if south re-doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: S asked about 3NT  and shrugged|pg||
nt|yusufb: bende kesin acardým 3 pozisyona gerek yok 1dende herkes acar nafiz abi ilk elin keyfini sürüyo olacak:)|pg||

nt|star6ija: as our friend from Pakistan Oosman Bashir pointed out...both Souths did also well not trying slam over 4th level overcall|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|geot: Second seat opening. Nice hand though.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: Who would open with norths hand at board 1?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  sorry, mistyped..1@h denied 4@h and has 4@s|pg||
nt|james_h: + 1 I expect|pg||
nt|ady: should make an overtrick end playing east|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|geot: i wonder if Boye would have doubled if West had rebid 2@D on this hand? Probably.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|xenya: looks like 1 off?|pg||

pc|s8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 4@H made in OR   though it appears 1 spade and 3 clubs to lose|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  hi, yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: 3N offers more chances as the cards lie -- still likely down|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  NS 1@c 1@s sequence is 0-11 with no 4 card major|pg||

mb|p|nt|yusufb: hýzlý oynarlarda bu kadar degil:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  if they did make 3N that would be 13 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: easy to be made when we see all the cards|pg||
nt|geot: +140 is a fine result for N/S on board 2. E/W has 8-9 tricks in diamonds. Depending on the lead.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andyv:  at this vul, EW will stretch as much as possible to get to 4@h|pg||
nt|james_h: I think the double will weaken Easts case(assuming he has one) on the last hand|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@c is a Tx to @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I appreciate Mihov's overcall in the OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT depends on who bids it. Safe from West not from East|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|james_h: 1@d is natural and unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: the right decision taken by Upmark to pass for penalty brought 5 more IMPs to Swedes with Tsonchev - Marashev going down 1 on 4 @h in board 3|pg||

nt|poohbear: Fisher agrees|pg||
nt|james_h: We appreciate your at the table comments Dermot, keep up please|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  the NT can be 5-3-3-2, 5-4-2-2 (but not in the majors) and 4-4-4-1 besides three run  of the mill 4-3-3-3 and 4-3-4-2|pg||

nt|poohbear: Though I suspect if he was declaring he would bid it :P|pg||
nt|star6ija: this one looks like a chance for Bulgarians to shorten the gap|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think 3@C means?|pg||
nt|jbennet: he has passed initallly, showed both monors, and then all of u sudden a double comes.|pg||

nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|sengulerz: Lauria @dyu bilemezse 1 imp kazanýrýz|pg||

nt|jbennet: not 100% safe of course but indeed a good chance. of score big. |pg||
nt|yusufb: @h 10 suit preferans olabilir @d için|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: @s  ataðýna hemen karar vermek zorunda kalacak|pg||
nt|tez: yerde rua vale varsa küçük çýkmak lazým deðil mi hocam?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: If 3@C still could be 5-5 S have a very good hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive he need some sort of endplay if defence is correct|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: if S keeps at least 4@D can be 1 down and a push|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs stunned the Gold passed|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand E's pass either|pg||
nt|xenya: too refined for my taste|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s yapay..nedir bilmiyorum|pg||

nt|tez: doðru taraftan oynamýþ olurduk|pg||

nt|arvidsson: wow I did not expect that|pg||
nt|yusufb: ama @c A ceksede|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tez: edilirsede bilsin|pg||
nt|funtay: Salvonun burdaki 4ntsi oynamaya daha fazla gitmeyelim kötü elim var)|pg||
nt|panosk: so N cant be 5-5 since S wud have taken off|pg||
nt|arvidsson: unlucky break (can you say so, after W did say he got some @H by double)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|geot: If he goes down, which not at all is unlikely now, he will really regret not trying the spade 8 in the first trick.|pg||
nt|geot: Oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: chatting 0 the old rule of eleven|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: W thaought he was trying to bluff a trick for the @h king - with nothing in his hand'|pg||
nt|tez: @h vale vermesi iyi olmadý..ama defans zor deðil|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oleberg:  But if he keeps 3 diamonds, two hearts and two spades, it will be down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@dX was played in OR for -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N opened 1@h and E was able to bid @s and then double @ds for further takeout.  W was only too happy to leave it in.|pg||
nt|geot: On a club switch from West instead of that 1H10, declarer can still win|pg||
nt|baardolav: everything solved... with a @c can win with ace, spade to ace and jack of @h|pg||
nt|yusufb: gelme denince @d doner|pg||
pc|hT|nt|star6ija: Mihov will take 10 here|pg||
nt|tez: bilemezse de egale olsun:)|pg||
nt|tez: good point funtay:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: ostensibly  lead is 4th from JTxx or better|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|geot: yes, and he can also duck the club, then fly ace on a spade back, and set up the clubs with two entries to dummy in diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|geot: will in that case depend on East holding the Q of hearts|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: beeing Bulgarian supporter I like what happens here|pg||
nt|tez: @c asý çek..bak ortak ne veriyor|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oleberg:  Which seems like the obvious cards to keep|pg||
nt|star6ija: as far as this is about to go down...and there are 2 options for Mihov - Karakolev in the OR (to stay at 1N or to bid 3) some IMPs might have been expected for Bg team|pg||
nt|yusufb: güzel defans oldu ama iþin iyi tarafý bana ulaþan bilgilere gore kandemir-kolatada ayný defansý yapmýþ:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: good example of a simple, straightforward auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 1N opener here caused some unexpected problems.  Hard to imagine that EW don'|pg||

nt|poohbear: Taking advantage of declarer's misguess in clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|star6ija: as I foreseen...hope Swedes will be silent in the OR too|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder if he didnt realize that the lead was 2nd highest|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the Norwegians show their distrib|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: the deciding round|pg||
nt|oleberg:  a diamond towards dummy is apossible ruse|pg||

nt|arvidsson: this will not be any trouble for EW they reached a good contract, and will take 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: now 10 tricks|pg||

pc|h5|nt|oleberg:  A little timing is needed, but he should get it right|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in response to 4@D  'slave' can also describe  bad or medium hand for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held same hand with @DQ instead of @CQ   i wonder if he bids the same way or treats the hand as 15+ HCP|pg||

nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tez: 2 fazla oldu|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|baardolav: the 13th trich on... 3 of heart|pg||
nt|baardolav: trick*|pg||
pc|h9|nt|geot: Here an eventual NT contract will be played by East|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|geot: And South knows what to lead:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Stefanov gonna try for crossruff?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... a heart seem safe even for me... but 7@s it is|pg||

nt|arvidsson: one have to decide if partner have good @C +@S there is a choice to play partner for good @D to|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|nt|geot: on the heart lead the double squeeze chances are gone, so declarer will go for a diamond ruff.|pg||

nt|xenya: to get back to hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: A very good grand slam... need to ruff e diamond before pichting the @h on @c K, |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: so much better to be in 6@S even if declarer can guess 13 tricks|pg||
nt|geot: Which probably is the best line in the spade contract anyway|pg||
