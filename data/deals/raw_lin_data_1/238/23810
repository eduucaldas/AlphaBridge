nt|gulyas: hello and welcome to rnd7|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: a huge match here, both teams could well end up in week2, and even in the top6 overall|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes should be a very good match|pg||
mb|1C|an| |mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S is likely here|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|roswolf: i assume a strong club|pg||
nt|gulyas: two very strong pairs here, the Herbst brothers always very good, and Mihov is simply a world champ (in pairs, with Nanev)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a weak jump shift|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: west mitght now be inhibited|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will cetainly hope for some fit from pd with that @H length|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and east may well be more passive|pg||
nt|gulyas: even a single raise from E will make him bid game I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: support with support is a good principle|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: with a side singleton, he does raise, and W will bid game now|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  NS play a 2/1 style with lots of gadgets and 12-14NT |pg||
pc|c2|nt|geot: Hi Jon, and kibs. Welcome.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hello all, Hei Geir and Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
pc|c4|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
pc|d8|nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|c6|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: I appreciate Mihov's overcall in the OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT depends on who bids it. Safe from West not from East|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vP has a lot of information, but still doesn't know if the hand belongs in @S, @D, NT  OR at what level|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: 7nt with no heart lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  ok, maybe they don't play xfers in this sequence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oleberg:  A little timing is needed, but he should get it right|pg||

nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|baardolav: the 13th trich on... 3 of heart|pg||

nt|poohbear: Stefanov gonna try for crossruff?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... a heart seem safe even for me... but 7@s it is|pg||

nt|yusufb: ama zordu karsýda minumum 8 oldunu bilse versace 16 da kendinde var|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: presumably this shows 4/5 @S/@H?|pg||
nt|baardolav: there where no squeeze with the heart lead... |pg||

pc|h2|nt|andyv:  their version of Smolen|pg||
nt|jbgood: shouldnt Boye pass 2@c?|pg||
