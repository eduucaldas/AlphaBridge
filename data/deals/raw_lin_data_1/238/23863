pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||

nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
pc|c3|nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is very aggressive|pg||

nt|james_h: 2@c is a Tx to @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I appreciate Mihov's overcall in the OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT depends on who bids it. Safe from West not from East|pg||
mb|d|nt|james_h: 1@d is natural and unbalanced|pg||

mb|2D|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||

nt|geot: yes|pg||

nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in response to 4@D  'slave' can also describe  bad or medium hand for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held same hand with @DQ instead of @CQ   i wonder if he bids the same way or treats the hand as 15+ HCP|pg||

pc|s4|nt|tez: 2 fazla oldu|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|baardolav: the 13th trich on... 3 of heart|pg||
nt|baardolav: trick*|pg||
pc|d5|nt|geot: Here an eventual NT contract will be played by East|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|geot: And South knows what to lead:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Stefanov gonna try for crossruff?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... a heart seem safe even for me... but 7@s it is|pg||
nt|tez: yazýnca bakalým kaç kiþi itiraz edecek|pg||
pc|dT|nt|geot: Good contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: not sure of declarers first discard may have been a heart|pg||

nt|arvidsson: depending on style E hand is either a weak 2 or 1@S opening|pg||
nt|panosk: i tend towards 1@S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta returned king of spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: in other room against 3@d|pg||
nt|jbennet: as the cards lie 4sp spade by south could only defeated by d lead and an immediate club switch at trick 2. wd.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1:  9  also 4@H on @D lead|pg||
nt|geot: but if West in on the @CA switch to a heart declarer is dead. It looks to me as if S got a chance but did not take it?|pg||
nt|tez: rakibi:)|pg||
nt|ady: another routine hand    more coffee?|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  multi 2@d|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like slam|pg||
nt|baardolav: if discard heart... can trumf diamond high and give away a trumph trick pulling all trumph away|pg||
nt|geot: ok, maybe the play was a little bit different from what we saw.|pg||
nt|tez: açýk kartla oluyor..@d larý derin geçirerek ama batar normalde|pg||
nt|panosk: because of the other major|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 6-4 distrubution makes it a 1@s for me to, but if 6331 I would go for 2@S in this vulnerbilities|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 4@s te dururuz|pg||

nt|tez: 3@d demeyi düþünüyordu sanýrým..lauria..atak için|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT is preparing for weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: but only @s is the suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: slight raise of eyebrow from McGann on seeing dummy|pg||
nt|ady: did not expect the Irish to miss this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices from West|pg||
nt|geot: Normal overcall. Normal decision by North.|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like|pg||
nt|arvidsson: as we can see all cards we see that EW will not make 4@H, but guess the whole field will play game on this hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: bugün kaç maç yapýldý bilen varmý sanýyorum 5 maç|pg||
nt|kbitzer: 6. cý el ilginç.  6 da  oluyor  4 de gitmekte  zor.  d.bakýr  zona bile gidemedi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if he had a way to differentiate 4@H as guess vs  "it's our hand - this will make"|pg||
nt|tez: Diðer odada 7. board 1@h 2@d    2@h 3@d    3NT  4@d       4 NT  6 NT  South oynuyor|pg||
pc|c3|nt|star6ija: 6@h will go down with @s lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: small??|pg||
nt|geot: But not all will re-open with a double as South on that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: ok play gone ahead at this stage|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: boye is on lead and NS have 3 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: @c ataðýna 6 oluyor|pg||
nt|2celik1: iceride 5@C dendi,tam|pg||
nt|poohbear: kind of like Lebensohl|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: 3N is best here of course as the cards lie -- 4@S is a bit trickier...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Lots of thinking at this table|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sengulerz: 2 imp olsun bizim olsun|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ahhhh another way to beat 4 . kill the entry to the @d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzgp: one round of hearts have been played so far|pg||
nt|jbgood: so maybe Norway will get off the schneid now|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 6@D on this hand, but only double dummy. Has to drop the @DK|pg||
nt|geot: Madala did not re-open with a double at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: second trick won by EW so logic tells me a diamond queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: from there on it is quessswork sorry|pg||
nt|jbgood: just wait for the final result and give us that, Tos|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|star6ija: actually it would have been more interesting to see wheter Aronov would have found the lead against 3 N played by South|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|geot: there they stopped in 5@D, will make 600 or 620|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  J@s played hoping to give declarer the illusion a bad split|pg||
nt|jbgood: well done to take the 800|pg||
nt|geot: Norway's first IMPs in this match will come here, 5 of them|pg||
pc|s7|nt|panosk: if you go a 20 hcp game and 5 are useless its not gd news, but i also think many will venture 4@H|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes hard to stop, but west may see that his 2 queens do not carry much weight|pg||
nt|arvidsson: normally when you realise your hand is not as good as you thought it is to late :)|pg||

nt|tez: senyörler|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: in 3rd/4th seat -- can have longer @C but not longer @H or @S in 2-suiter|pg||

mb|p|nt|yusufb: bencede|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4-3-3-3 still not slam force|pg||

nt|panosk: and no singleton|pg||
nt|arvidsson: E showes his stiff @H and was turned down by W|pg||
nt|rodvenn: a good stop here unless u get a hart lead:)|pg||
nt|james_h: so 4@h looked like the more promising spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: and Fisher doesnt even try the 5 level. Good judgement|pg||
nt|panosk: or a club for that matter :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: well is it not always cold?|pg||

mb|5H|nt|yusufb: @s cekip @d|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|baardolav: Vesace have to play the K of @d |pg||
