nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn knows that Lauria is prepared for a club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||

nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  I am not sure they can bid either :P|pg||
nt|ritong: making friends is your strong points, true?|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: in his room south did not overcall since he bid 1@H himself, so he does not know the @H layout|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not really hehe|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||

nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
mb|4D|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now cue bids (this partnership's favorite action)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In many systems East will be able to show short diamonds which would cool off West|pg||
nt|ritong: @s lead looks very possible after this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so they better stop lower than 6|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|nilsland:  At the other table it started 1N-3@D showing 4441 with a singleton minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that a whole lot better|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at least we know that they probably know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think they play turbo on this auction|pg||
mb|6H|nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: perhaps E was a bit conservative|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or not|pg||
nt|ritong: i t would match  now, i m told they do play turbo, but restricted to minor fits|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: as expected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  easy lead from the sequence :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||

nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa will return @h after winning @d, maybe Piekarek will have an idea then|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe it will be too late then, he is still thinking how to play the @D|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: Muller will think again -- but it is too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes as dummy takes out a magazine to read|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Italy, Monaco or Ireland??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||

nt|nilsland:  1NT?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|geot: Ireland got a grip on this now, and fully deserved. they have not done anything wrong, and Norway has got a few hands where I do not really recognise my good friends to be honest|pg||

mb|d!|nt|gulyas: 1 lvl higher here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was definitely operating on this hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes only a couple of hands had some potential, maybe we will end with a bang with some fancy hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D would show 5 cards for me|pg||

nt|tomi2: but there are still matches with more imps exchanged. some suprise is that pland is down 40 imps against Croatia|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: Poland has been doing surprisingly poor all rounds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: 4@S a good save|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: 15 has been finished in the OR, Piekarek made 8 tricks, 2 imps for Germany|pg||

mb|4N|nt|geot: that is how it is, and it will be 10 IMPs whether he gets 11 or 12 tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  It has come down to Lauria vs Upmark. Make you bets!|pg||

nt|fabsayc: or a double squeeze, but of course nothing works on actual hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: some kind of come back for Norway in this match, and there are still 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|1H|nt|geot: min NT again|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they reversed this board in their haste - Mesbur is actually N for this hand|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2 chances left for some more action|pg||
nt|henryb:  except playing a heart to the ten after two rounds of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||
nt|psyck: this is not easy|pg||
nt|pauleger: lauria will pass I think|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Sweden in 7 here - without success|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, computer died for a while!|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: With maximal hand they open 2@c instead of 1@d|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gulyas: I hope we will not be playing that nice fit...|pg||
nt|gulyas: if Madala tries 3@D now, it would be the Italians for a change who declare the same contract in both rooms:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: well 4@h can make too i suppose, esp as bidding marks cards|pg||
nt|psyck: making some endplay on North possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant nothing works after the heart pitch, we could all see how to make it|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching anything but a heart on the third club gives up on various other chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  But maybe playing a heart before playing the third club preserves some chances|pg||
mb|4D|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: @D lead best|pg||
nt|psyck: best would be to set up a @d ruff here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South opened 1@C and thus was favourite to hold the @DK - so a little bit unlucky for sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room south opened so the grand odds were different than at this table, ie a bit unlucky the diamond king offside|pg||
mb|6D|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: y, but not exactly a claimer:)|pg||

nt|polpkeeper: non sappiamo ancora se domani saremo su bbo|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Le ragazze più o meno pareggiano contro la Grecia, e i Senior perdono 7-26 vs Norvegia (11-19), ma mancano ancora alcune mani che come abbiamo visto postono spostare non poco|pg||
nt|vugraphzgg: Bocchi laughing about the jack oh hearts play|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: nel caso, si gioca un solo turno alle 11.00 italiane|pg||
nt|vugraphzgg: Bocchi claimed|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the match   round 5 begins in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|mcphee: a pretty entertaining set of cards|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal.  Nice job by our operator A Considine.  Thanks to my co-commentators Paul Orth, Thomas Gotard, & Dirk Schroeder and to the kibitzers for joining us here & for their ...|pg||
nt|psyck: inputs.|pg||
nt|tomi2: last board here|pg||
nt|pauleger: and to you, Krishna :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: last hand now, thanks everybody, restart in about 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
nt|tomi2: cards could not be friendlier, I think 6@H could make if they bid it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden EW stopped in 3@S |pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SK doubleton onside, clubs 4-4, hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|psyck: see, i told you cards will slowly get exciting towards the end :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S = any shortnes, weak or strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@s=any spl 5-8 or 12-14|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: their notes say 4m = minor void|pg||
nt|tomi2: so I would think this bid would show @C void and no @D void in north|pg||
nt|pauleger: S won´t believe the @c void :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: but they have sequences where "first step = high shortnes, 2nd step = lowest shortnes" could apply. Hope they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 dwn is likely here |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, this is what the notes say: If OPENER bids 2M over 2M-1, RESP can continue with 2NT asking, showing a side suit or  a splinter.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S is plain and simple an overbid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2: 3NT is defined as @S void, so 4@C could be @D void and 4@D club void|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they knew what they were doing anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: everybody knows the situation holding 2 aces against a bid slam :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: most of the time it is bad to lead one of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: N and E are sitting on the same screen side, so if N thinks his bidding shows @D void he will tell this to Lauria|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: versace has the worst possible diamond holding after the double|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and 3@S prob making in other room will be 8 imps to sweden|pg||
mc|8|nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a problem if the opening lead was on the other side and south would explain "i dont know what this shows"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks for watching|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
