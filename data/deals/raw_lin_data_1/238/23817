pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller play Tarzan Precision  but they open fewer hands at 1-level than most big clubbers|pg||

nt|bobholl: good result for tarzan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 12-14  covers many distributions you might not expect|pg||
nt|james_h: it might be tempting for some souths to bid more over 4s but those @h honours are not as valuable as U might think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|tez: 1 sanzatu açar mý?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller will probably bid 2@D to ask for longer major|pg||
nt|james_h: as some might think they are I should say|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Mesbur did give it a look but took the low road|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: oni atakuj¹!!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: wheather N is going to bid 2nt for minors (doubt it) after 2@H ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened 1@C but i thought they also played weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that choice did allow North to enter the auction|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|tez: bu aralar moda herþeyle 1 sanzatu açmak|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: ahhhh  1st seat favorable  [not vul vs vul]  Brink-Drijver 1N=9-12|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|geot: I am told Norway reached 3NT on this one in the OR. |pg||
nt|james_h: robust bidding|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe hard to avoid game in a natural system, and even playing strong club (?)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: batacak|pg||
nt|geot: I can not see 4@H having any chances, but 3NT on a diamond lead is close|pg||
nt|james_h: e/w are not favourites to break the bridge land speed record|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so we are up and running at last|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|james_h: a simple auction compared to the open room|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|james_h: Martin worked a miracle, the names are right now|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary up by 5 by not bidding a game with 19 hcp and a 5-3 fit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzgn: there is always a way!|pg||
nt|james_h: Were you at the Eucharistic Congress this morning Martin?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Not my style, am a Protestant exile in Ireland!|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@H made, 4@H didn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: this time its a normal 3nt that looks doomed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tez: @d çaka alabilirlerse|pg||
nt|geot: Should be four losers in this contract|pg||
nt|james_h: I fear that last like will be lost on most kibs|pg||
nt|james_h: line|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer correctly guessed that S would put up an honor from HTx|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he has to have both honors to play low - or no chance anyway|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: zor deðil|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ken__: karoyu hiç açamayabilirler|pg||
nt|geot: North will not cover the spades, and from there the defence will come to four tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h8|pg||
nt|tez: yerden alabilecekleri pek þey yok çünkü|pg||
pc|s7|nt|james_h: North streached to get the @h lead, not a bad policy in general|pg||
pc|s5|nt|zbilgin26: kenan eskiþehirde hala pasta varmý|pg||
nt|james_h: Its ok Martin, I actually have a friend who knows a Protestant|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D or 3@H ?|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: defense may have to yield last trick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|james_h: last hope is QJ@c tight|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: no more ducks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gulyas: S already feeling uneasy, so to say - declarer may squeeze and endplay S eventually|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: koza uyarken büyük küçük vererek çaka anlatýlabilir|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ken__: yapmasý için kör çekip pik verecek|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|gulyas: hm, now what?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ken__: 5@c oynarlar|pg||
nt|james_h: 1 IMP each ... were on the edge of our seats|pg||
mb|2H|nt|geot: Both West players in this match opened 3@S here. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS spot card leads are  Slawinsky     hi = even with honor  or  odd with no honor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if willard had the diamond king and golin the queen, golin should have overtaken heart queen, so i am pretty sure oliveri should know to underlead diamond ace|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4-1 @S just enough to stop 13 tricks for N/S|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: he will be endplayed eventually (and we also know the 4th @S will be good, so no need for the @HA)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decent explanation of the leads on their submitted convention card|pg||
nt|bobholl: lucky lead for the netherlands (over tricks now)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: w+N both think they have constructive raises|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems only a @C lead defeats the @D slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tez: cengizin eli ile 1 sanzatu amamak için her sebep var|pg||
nt|neco26: 6 diycektin heralde kenan|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: @dK içerde olunca sorun yok tref kontratýnda|pg||
nt|ken__: yok 6 oynamazlar|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: kýrmýzý biraz korkutabilir belki gençleri|pg||
nt|ken__: olaný deðil Necdett abi gelineceði söyledim:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: zon durumu|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: :)|pg||
nt|neco26: bu gençler tehlikeli her an diyebilirler:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: 5@D olabilir belki|pg||
nt|ken__: tabi karo iþin içine girince tref kontratý kayboldu|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: altuð düþünüyor|pg||
nt|geot: Not everyone's choice, maybe, but I do not mind 3@S to be honest. This time you pre-empt the opps from nothing really, but...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ken__: 4NT diyebilirdi|pg||
nt|ken__: söyle birini gibi as sorusu olmazdý sanýrým|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: yada 4sp?|pg||
nt|ken__: 4@s daha kafa karýþtýrýcý olurdu|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: 4nt as sorusu, 4sp @d fiti olarak ayrýlabilir belki|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so in reality madala should have come down to singleton heart keeping extra spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 4333..yanlýz iki da.14 puan.sadece 1 onlu var..puanlarýn çeþidi çok fena|pg||
mb|5C|nt|tez: yanlýz iki dam|pg||

nt|vugraphzeq: oo pasa   dikkat etmemiþim:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he did, declarer can win the @H and put him in with @Ss - its a matter of figuring out the distributions really|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: east spots in hearts are not good enough to lose a trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 4 should make|pg||
nt|mathat: ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|7S|nt|venedik: 5@D  enteresan |pg||
nt|james_h: this is not a plesant declaring experience|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if QJ95x you could lose to K10 onside after a cover by finessing on the way back|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|ken__: Berk in dbl ý çok anlamsýz bence|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: there was no need to play diamonds first since you basically need clubs to break and heart king onside to have any chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this line has complicated matter, she is aiming to pitch a club on diamond jack, but to gain a trick that way she needs four spade ruffs in hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: a reasonable spot, just not today|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: lepiej jakby jeszcze raz pusci³|pg||
pc|sA|nt|james_h: Its a marginal decision either way|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobholl: and a lot because he is not going to finesse @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|james_h: the pre empt that is|pg||

nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Not enough from Karpov's point of view, needs some extra values (few)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
pc|d6|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
pc|d4|nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|geot: As my fellow commentater disappeared i am alone here and supposed to be neutral. Difficult, and I am afraid my NZ flag will not help me hiding. Go Norway:)|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 12 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|gulyas: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|gulyas: for results and running scores|pg||
nt|blum1956: A paradox is that 4@s over Dubinin's possible immediate 4@h is more attractive than 3@s over 3@h|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@S the place to be|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|geot: And here we go!|pg||
nt|geot: At least they are in game now|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like Brogeland (East in the other room) have had a good time on the few last boards.|pg||
nt|geot: But mind you, Ireland is still leading this match:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C a game inv stayman|pg||
nt|blum1956: nothing may stop North from making 11 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|geot: or to be honest :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: xx probably lacks a @C stop? not sure|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, another help says no stop, no 4M|pg||
nt|gulyas: so maybe no @Ds shown yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sorry for losing 17 but slow auction on 18 lets me catch up|pg||

nt|geot: and he is of course not|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: all right, so @Ds found after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: 6@D is of course a terrible slam, 5@D is a good game|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: dummy: I think you may need these...:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: dubinin too many primes to pass|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lechcold: w 16 kolejna strata|pg||
nt|lechcold: troszkê nam siê smutno robi, no ale to pierwsze koty...|pg||
nt|blum1956: Dubinin has a choice of 3NT and 4@s, but his hand is not of NT nature|pg||
pc|d4|nt|geot: that is how it is, and it will be 10 IMPs whether he gets 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: losing 2@h, one @C ruff and the @SA, no guess unless N underleads the @S now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer needs not to discard a diamond but he cannot be sure |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|baldfriede: percentage play in @s wrong this time, but that's why it is percentage only|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|kamyk: w tym 16. N otworzy³ mini 1BA i Buras mia³ problem, co powiedzieæ z tym 5-6; mozna grac, ¿e teraz 2BA to du¿a (dowolna) dwukolorówka, ale to trzeba ustalic w ramach przedmeczowych ...|pg||

mb|1N|nt|geot: some kind of come back for Norway in this match, and there are still 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: min NT again|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they reversed this board in their haste - Mesbur is actually N for this hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, computer died for a while!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|blum1956: With maximal hand they open 2@c instead of 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I hope we will not be playing that nice fit...|pg||
nt|gulyas: if Madala tries 3@D now, it would be the Italians for a change who declare the same contract in both rooms:)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: @D lead best|pg||
pc|d3|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcphee: y, but not exactly a claimer:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: with @sA wellplaced|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|geot: South opened in this room with 8HCP, mini NT. In the other room North opened the bidding in third seat with 9HCPs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coming up on final board of the match|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: if left to his own devices, declarer will go down|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baldfriede: well done to find 6@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: vugraph schedule showing viewer's local timezone  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes reading magazine again.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're acutally NOT the slowest vugraph table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores under  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our match is from Group B|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gulyas: well, he was not|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well actually on that lead it maybe possible to set up the 4th @D (duck the @S entry to the N hand)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: he may still go down if S, upon winning the @HK, plays the @DQ for N to discard his @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs to play 2 rnds of @Hs eventually to ruff the 3rd|pg||
nt|gulyas: so either @HA-Q, or just Q, S wins and plays the @DQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is no duck N has a certain @s entry ...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the match   round 5 begins in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|mcphee: a pretty entertaining set of cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|d|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcphee: i had a few specs suggest @D was best|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who were asking -- this is why Fantoni didn't need to continue @C immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- if Nunes original trump was @D9xx  then    oops|pg||
nt|jkotor: ruff high, play low @d, and makes|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is making now I think - the defence dont have the 2nd @d trick|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D showed @Hs, was not alerted by the operator|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|blum1956: That was the last board of the set. Thanks all, the spectators and the vugraph operator|pg||
