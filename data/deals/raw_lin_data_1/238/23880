nt|santyclz: Good morning folks.  Looks as if we're getting underway.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Aha!  This looks like the same board being played in the other room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: will enter contract after play finishes ...we had wrong names b4|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all for this interesting match |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|desinka: In this hand, 4@S will be not the final contract, i think|pg||
nt|desinka: but lets see the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 1st hand|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ady: n/s likelyto play 2@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D transfer response showing hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: this not the correct bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in Open room|pg||
nt|barnets: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: but contract is written 3@H on bocchis record|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if e-w are limited to 2@hs if the defense gets all its tricks.|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure you can even make 1@H its close|pg||
mb|1N|nt|desinka: now 2@S|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: merhaba:)|pg||
nt|desinka: Hi Momchil|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desi :)|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  just 1 down in 3@D  if they can balance|pg||
nt|yusufb: herkese selammm|pg||
nt|yusufb: oncelikle milli takýmýmýza baþarýlarrrr|pg||
nt|funtay: slm Yusuf|pg||
nt|yusufb: slmmm Tayfun|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: merhabaa:) takýmýza bolþans|pg||
pc|dA|nt|james_h: 1@h could be 11-13 bal or big both with 4+ support|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt ye gelince @d atak en iyisi..ama zor çýkmak|pg||
nt|yusufb: 13 maç oynuyoruz milli takýmýmýz italya ile 2ligi paylaþmakta|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
nt|star6ija: we have Bulgarian pair, playing precision here|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h e 2 sanzatuyu davet oynuyorlar..fit 4 lü|pg||
nt|ady: east has balanced|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|poohbear: hi all|pg||
nt|star6ija: sems like a good board for Bulgarians to start with|pg||
nt|star6ija: seems|pg||
pc|s2|nt|desinka: Hello, Barry:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yusufb: ilk 9 girmeyi garantiledik bundan sonra final grubuna cýkacak takýmlardan alýnacak puanlar onemli isvec maçý bu acýdan onemli|pg||
pc|s4|nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: request for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|tez: @h atak edebilir zorlu|pg||
nt|tez: yerde tek ya da þigan @h var..konuþmalardan biliniyor|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a 2/1 style with lots of gadgets and 12-14NT |pg||
nt|funtay: ataðýda batýrmasý da zor bir 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly not easy but I think 2 can be made.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|geot: Hi Jon, and kibs. Welcome.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hello all, Hei Geir and Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
pc|cA|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: iddialý atak ediyorlar..eðer en küçüðüyse|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: may be able to beat 2@H now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|star6ija: yes...this way avoiding trump queen guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Yes, needed to avoid leading a @d from hand.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|yusufb: bcok iyi dondü nafiz abi|pg||
nt|funtay: asý girerse batar|pg||
nt|tez: en iyi defansý yaptý|pg||
nt|yusufb: batabilir|pg||
nt|tez: oynayanda @h uzun..@s i ele çekti valesi var..@c saðlamaya çalýþýyor..@c i de uzun|pg||
nt|funtay: öbür oda da yapmýþ bizimkiler|pg||
nt|tez: bil bakalým elinde ne kýsa:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|poohbear: Didnt see that North dbled the final contract. This is somethign that modern bidding has frowned upon|pg||

nt|tez: 3 ya da 4lü imiþ|pg||
nt|ady: well played    |pg||
nt|barnets: down 1 only in open|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|poohbear: 6 imps for Bulgaria for the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the play would have been interesting|pg||
nt|geot: to take 2 down I mean|pg||
nt|santyclz: So 1st blood to Italy for going down 1 fewer trick.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||
nt|ady: so in fact 6 imps to Bulgaria   Hanlon played 10@S  in the end game  ttrying to give impresion of Q10 left I would think|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d alsaydý oynayan entresan sekilde oluyordu @c lere nafiz abi kart tutamýyordu@h @s atamazdý @d atsada @d tahsil edilemiyordu|pg||
nt|tez: operator yanlýþ klikledi|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: and another Bulgarian pair in the OR, whose agressive style misleaded Swedes|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is very aggressive|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mihov has taken good decision in the OR|pg||
nt|desinka: this one looks like flat to me...|pg||
nt|james_h: tough position for NS here|pg||
nt|funtay: 12 ile açmadý Nafiz abi|pg||
nt|tez: 10 imp bize|pg||
nt|funtay: 4-4 major ile açardým, siz?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: diðer masada 3@d oynanýyordu bu el|pg||
nt|tez: @h ataðýna batacak burda|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4-3 e 4@s iyi kontrat ama bulmak zor|pg||
nt|tez: nafiz abi diyor ki @h asýyla al küçük @d yý oyna..batýr bakalým:)|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be a flat board probably in all matches|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|james_h: I like Fantunes defence to Multi ... X shows @h|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have 3NT   with their 28 hcp   not in the bidding yest|pg||
nt|james_h: it counters this situation here|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Shwartz did here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Can never tell with these big distribution hands|pg||
nt|tez: oynayanlar skoru görmüyor..masada oynuyorlar..yanlarýnda bilgisayar operatörü var..genelde isimleri kenan oluyor..onlar masada ne olduysa bize iletiyor|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yusufb: 2@d tek renkli major eli|pg||
nt|ady: south should certainly have taken some action first round|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon did well to recover|pg||
nt|ady: North has taken a gamble balancing at that level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 top tricks playing their 5-5 fit in 3nt, but  it's not likely...|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: hi ..eamon galligan here ..I reconstructed play on board 1 here .. fairly close ..bidding I made up also |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|star6ija: these 4 @h are little tricky|pg||
nt|jbgood: and at the other table a heart was lead - since E opened 1 @h|pg||
nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in trouble now if south re-doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: S asked about 3NT  and shrugged|pg||
nt|yusufb: bende kesin acardým 3 pozisyona gerek yok 1dende herkes acar nafiz abi ilk elin keyfini sürüyo olacak:)|pg||

nt|star6ija: as our friend from Pakistan Oosman Bashir pointed out...both Souths did also well not trying slam over 4th level overcall|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: in the unlikely event e/w reach the 5 level South needs to unblock his @HK under the Ace later in hand to avoid endplay|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tez: el dikkatli oynamayý gerektiriyor|pg||
nt|tez: þimdi hep @c oynayacak..@c çakacak..sonra koz ele..yere doðru @s oynayacak|pg||

pc|h5|nt|andyv:  1@h = 0-11hcp w 4@h or 4@s|pg||
nt|geot: Second seat opening. Nice hand though.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: Who would open with norths hand at board 1?|pg||
nt|tez: kontr ile baþlamasý avantaj kazandýrdý|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, mistyped..1@h denied 4@h and has 4@s|pg||
nt|james_h: + 1 I expect|pg||
nt|ady: should make an overtrick end playing east|pg||
pc|d4|nt|geot: i wonder if Boye would have doubled if West had rebid 2@D on this hand? Probably.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|nevaio   _: Hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: hi |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tez: ben 1@s ile araya girerdim|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|xenya: looks like 1 off?|pg||
nt|andyv:  as per spec (all help appreciated): 1S is 4cards , 2hearts GF relay, 2spades balanced other natural|pg||

pc|c7|nt|xenya: hello Andy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: 4@H made in OR   though it appears 1 spade and 3 clubs to lose|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  hi, yes|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N offers more chances as the cards lie -- still likely down|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tez: çok zordu 7 direk eli almak defansta|pg||
nt|eamongall: had the wrong names so typed in the contract on board 1 and result |pg||
pc|h9|nt|arigun:  running skor ve siralama icin http://tinyurl.com/c5csabw|pg||

mb|1H|nt|star6ija: easy to be made when we see all the cards|pg||

nt|jbgood: 4+ @d, 6-9|pg||
nt|tez: @d as atak edilmedi tabiki|pg||
nt|tez: her eli böyle claim etmez inþallah:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  at this vul, EW will stretch as much as possible to get to 4@h|pg||
nt|james_h: I think the double will weaken Easts case(assuming he has one) on the last hand|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@c is a Tx to @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I appreciate Mihov's overcall in the OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT depends on who bids it. Safe from West not from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 1@d is natural and unbalanced|pg||

nt|barnets: east must allow wet to win the second heart|pg||
pc|sA|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||
nt|geot: Declarer can finesse clubs to get rid of the diamond loser, so only four top losers in 3@H, but....|pg||
nt|tez: 11 e 11..iyi durdular 1 nt de|pg||
nt|ady: this makes on the nose|pg||
nt|ady: cant work out only 1@D made in OR|pg||

pc|s8|nt|andyv:  good brakes by EW as 4@h has virtually no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 2, 3N went off 1 so only 3 imps exchanged|pg||
nt|geot: he will finesse|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they overcalled 1H with North so a @H was led|pg||

nt|barnets: the position I remarked on|pg||
nt|barnets: If east plays high dec will set up a pitch|pg||
nt|barnets: on the@H9|pg||
nt|barnets: how can east beat this if south had the @H 10 ?|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: never|pg||
nt|barnets: the answer is not likely at all|pg||
nt|barnets: so east must duck|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps if dec had one less @D and 1 more club|pg||
nt|barnets: but then he would have led a diamond|pg||
pc|hK|nt|geot: free|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|tez: %50 den az|pg||
pc|dT|nt|geot: sort of free finesse.....can always ditch a diamond on the club king if the club finesse loses.|pg||
nt|jbgood:   2 was a push|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|james_h: and even with that it hard to explain :)|pg||

nt|barnets: as long as dec has 5 clubs|pg||

nt|barnets: a good vul game|pg||
nt|santyclz: I am told the 3@c was just a @d raise, rather than being a fit jump.|pg||

nt|star6ija: Stefanov will probably make 12 tricks...|pg||
nt|poohbear: same auction?|pg||
nt|desinka: no|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg:  Correct to duck, but unlikely to help, and definitely not on this layout|pg||

nt|jbennet: but if south had placed west with 1552 from start (not unreasoanble since west might have led singelton club if he had one.|pg||
nt|barnets: you see with the extraction west would have to play a red card that would eliminate souths red loser|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: not clear what South should do. 4-4-4-1 with partner's suit your singleton is not a good recipe for NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fisher agrees|pg||
nt|james_h: We appreciate your at the table comments Dermot, keep up please|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  the NT can be 5-3-3-2, 5-4-2-2 (but not in the majors) and 4-4-4-1 besides three run  of the mill 4-3-3-3 and 4-3-4-2|pg||

nt|star6ija: this one looks like a chance for Bulgarians to shorten the gap|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think 3@C means?|pg||
nt|jbennet: he has passed initallly, showed both monors, and then all of u sudden a double comes.|pg||
mb|d|nt|panosk: natural?|pg||

mb|p|nt|oleberg:  The lower the partscore, the faster you lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: already 8 tricks |pg||
nt|tez: sanzatuyu kötü taraf dedi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW playing French Standard -- their convention card doesn't hint at why 2@C alerted|pg||
nt|tez: eli küçük @d çýkar|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|sengulerz: Lauria @dyu bilemezse 1 imp kazanýrýz|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 6@C could be reached but EW double (I assume for majors) should warn NS |pg||
nt|jbennet: not 100% safe of course but indeed a good chance. of score big. |pg||
nt|yusufb: @h 10 suit preferans olabilir @d için|pg||
pc|dA|nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: @s  ataðýna hemen karar vermek zorunda kalacak|pg||
nt|tez: yerde rua vale varsa küçük çýkmak lazým deðil mi hocam?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: If 3@C still could be 5-5 S have a very good hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive he need some sort of endplay if defence is correct|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: if S keeps at least 4@D can be 1 down and a push|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs stunned the Gold passed|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand E's pass either|pg||
nt|xenya: too refined for my taste|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||

nt|arvidsson: unlucky break (can you say so, after W did say he got some @H by double)|pg||
nt|barnets: good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: seftesi burdan|pg||
pc|d7|nt|geot: If he goes down, which not at all is unlikely now, he will really regret not trying the spade 8 in the first trick.|pg||
nt|geot: Oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: chatting 0 the old rule of eleven|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: W thaought he was trying to bluff a trick for the @h king - with nothing in his hand'|pg||
nt|tez: @h vale vermesi iyi olmadý..ama defans zor deðil|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oleberg:  But if he keeps 3 diamonds, two hearts and two spades, it will be down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@dX was played in OR for -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N opened 1@h and E was able to bid @s and then double @ds for further takeout.  W was only too happy to leave it in.|pg||
nt|geot: On a club switch from West instead of that 1H10, declarer can still win|pg||
nt|baardolav: everything solved... with a @c can win with ace, spade to ace and jack of @h|pg||
nt|yusufb: gelme denince @d doner|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|geot: yes, and he can also duck the club, then fly ace on a spade back, and set up the clubs with two entries to dummy in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: in the closed room perhaps n/s were lucky to avoid a X|pg||
pc|hK|nt|geot: will in that case depend on East holding the Q of hearts|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: beeing Bulgarian supporter I like what happens here|pg||
nt|tez: @c asý çek..bak ortak ne veriyor|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oleberg:  Which seems like the obvious cards to keep|pg||
nt|star6ija: as far as this is about to go down...and there are 2 options for Mihov - Karakolev in the OR (to stay at 1N or to bid 3) some IMPs might have been expected for Bg team|pg||

nt|barnets: north overcalled 4@C in open and perhaps surprisingly south did not raid to 5|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room w treated his 7-5 as a 1 suiter and this time it didn't work out.|pg||
nt|barnets: 6! D a good spot|pg||

nt|yusufb: seyircilerimiz sagolsun Tez hocam:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force -- a couple of different hand types |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen can ask [1@S] or start to describe his hand via 1N|pg||
nt|baardolav: first grandslam today|pg||
nt|james_h: The Bulgarians were quite agressive at both tables on the last hand and paid the price|pg||
nt|jbennet: bridge an easy game sometimes, Bid longest suit first and nest time the 2nd longest suit. |pg||
nt|barnets: really ?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andyv:  2@h = p/c|pg||
nt|arvidsson: rdbl is just for strengt and the pass by west is probbebly forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@C more likely by south than west in my opinion :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2nt+2 lik eli bizimkiler 2@s oynuyor|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2C is checkback |pg||
nt|poohbear: looking for partner's majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|sengulerz: 2@c gazilli mi?|pg||
nt|barnets: now east is wondering what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|barnets: why didnt he bid diamonds before himself|pg||
nt|barnets: at the 4 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there any possibility this is a cue in support of @Ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: is this a natural bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west made a clever move; 4 clubs then removing 4 sp should tell his p "I have a massive red-suiter and think that the 5 level is safe"|pg||
nt|barnets: why do I have this problem ?|pg||
nt|barnets: he thinks it should be obvious to his partner but I assure you it is not|pg||
nt|jbennet: cue for spades?? 5 clubs would be cue for spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: or he would have bid already|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east has hands on head thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: east is wondering what is going on and probably should bid 6@D to cover all possiblities|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many are telling me (all for different reasons) that this "Can't" show @s support.  I agree, if you're looking at the w hand it's obvious it can't.|pg||
nt|barnets: you , I and west know that bit does east ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east have to work this out, but if he thinks that west is showing a red 2-suiter good enough to go to the 5 level. East just might raise to 6 d.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 12-14 HCP  and exact shape|pg||

nt|panosk: the simplifies decl task|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how is N going to set this?|pg||
nt|panosk: *the lead|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this will not be any trouble for EW they reached a good contract, and will take 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: now 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: this time north did well to ldraw conclusions from the bidding , ew were favourites at have at most 9 spades between them , ergo p har at most 1 heart.  and duly led one.|pg||

nt|james_h: y|pg||
nt|jbennet: in other room west hade a more difficult view to take because he had to act over 4 clubs.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: 5@C = maximum [in context]  3 keycards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in response to 4@D  'slave' can also describe  bad or medium hand for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held same hand with @DQ instead of @CQ   i wonder if he bids the same way or treats the hand as 15+ HCP|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Or else, there will simply not be enough tricks|pg||

pc|cA|nt|andyv:  so now we can take back what we thought of E's pass on board 7 as it appears he did double for a push board.|pg||
nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tez: 2 fazla oldu|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s cn in fact make 5@C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|baardolav: the 13th trich on... 3 of heart|pg||
nt|baardolav: trick*|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|geot: Here an eventual NT contract will be played by East|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|geot: And South knows what to lead:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Stefanov gonna try for crossruff?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|arigun:  ilk 10 board sonunda 49 ondeyiz kalan 10 board mac berabere bitti|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... a heart seem safe even for me... but 7@s it is|pg||

nt|baardolav: A very good grand slam... need to ruff e diamond before pichting the @h on @c K, |pg||

nt|barnets: lucky for e/w no X|pg||

nt|barnets: but swing earned by east for Italy in open by opening 4@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 5h can even be set -3. |pg||
