mb|p|pc|cT|nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  NS play a 2/1 style with lots of gadgets and 12-14NT |pg||
pc|cK|nt|geot: Hi Jon, and kibs. Welcome.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hello all, Hei Geir and Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
pc|s7|nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||

nt|poohbear: 3NT depends on who bids it. Safe from West not from East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||

nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
