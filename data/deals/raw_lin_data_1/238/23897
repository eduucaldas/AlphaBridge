mb|3H|nt|james_h: Welcome All|pg||
nt|mcphee: decent slam on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Looking at this board, NS will probably bid to 3NT, but the duplication in spades will make that an uphill struggle.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi - looks like a quiet 450/420 for the start|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, top9 teams advance to the second RR, and these teams are currently 7th and 8th, so a big loss may cause either to drop out|pg||

nt|mdgraham: will be hard to stop out of game here  |pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: As the lay-out is N/S can not hurt declarer much in the spade suit|pg||
nt|baardolav: true... and the natural heart lead, give declarer an easy way for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: double dummy 6@D makes if you guess right in @Cs, but its not a slam you want to be in|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: dobrze ¿e przed parti¹ (z mojej strony a Twojej Lechu jak?|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: bi bakarsýnýz @h ya da @c rua ataðý gelir hemen olur|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West will feel a little endplayed, when in with the @SA|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Double-dummy this can make, by playing two rounds of clubs, and then a spade to the ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: after the overcall oliveri might have tried 2@S rather than 2NT, assuming that asks for help in spades|pg||

nt|tez: @h oynrsa þimdi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Oliveri may have missed the 1s overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame seems to be with golin, whatever 3@D meant it looks wrong|pg||
nt|baardolav: there is no way for Aronov bid 2nt on ten? |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gulyas: then declarer can duck and test the suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bye Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Fantoni thinking this time, not Muller |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: screen down briefly, F asks M a question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Muller's PASS was a RELAY  but Nunes 3@C ended the artificial bidding|pg||
nt|clinch: Can actually make 6 by ducking a @h to S, but unlikely with the whole @d suit exposed|pg||
nt|baardolav: instead of 2d|pg||
nt|geot: his partner is limited to 15|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes i knoww|pg||
nt|geot: I guess 2NT was an option to try reaching a vul game, but...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes, you end up in 2NT on 11+10 hp too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: 3@h would have shown 4 or 5 @h, 3@s would have shown 5@s, & 3N both majors|pg||

nt|geot: Lauria - Versace (in the OR) has not missed much so far in this set, but I think Bulgaria has got a chance on the next board|pg||

nt|ahollan1: does Nunes open 1N [12-14] or PASS?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: helps*|pg||
nt|mathat: 6 @c @d|pg||
nt|geot: Well, this hand was at first scored as 200 in the other room, then changed to 500|pg||
nt|star6ija: about 10-15 years ago, returning from one European Championships, Ivan Nanev, one of the topBulgarian international players shared with me the following|pg||
nt|fluffy: hi all|pg||
nt|star6ija: Italian style is not to play scores with 24-25 points|pg||
nt|star6ija: they never compare +150 with -600 and +480 with -980|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And a club-switch instead ogf the diamond would have tangled declarers communication|pg||
nt|monde9: W helped with the @H second time|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite a bad defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 4@s x /1 is correct|pg||
nt|mcphee: might have been better to run more @C there|pg||
nt|gulyas: so back to 9 tricks, playing it safe|pg||
nt|james_h: some cards may be wrong there|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: iyi swing þansýydý|pg||

mb|1H|nt|james_h: This feel like the calm before the really calm :(|pg||
nt|geot: East in OR, Brogeland, went from playing 1@H on board 6 to playing 1@S on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4441 is systemically opened 1N when 12-14|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea has a good fame as dec in Romania|pg||
nt|monde9: I think the 6th board can bring another points to Romania|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that he did anything wrong at all, but there was only the straightforward way to play it|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It was EW who "made" the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|eyamut: yok tehlikeli..|pg||
nt|tez: rakip 2 tur @d dan sonra @c oynamalý..yoksa @h lere @c ler gider|pg||
nt|psyck: Duboin opened 2@c last deal, so they should get there too|pg||
nt|clinch: Last match was full of slams; this one seems to be characterised by awkward misfits so far|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: 6nt by south my preferred contract|pg||
nt|blum1956: They will soon discover the lack of Aces|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@d is a catch all 2+|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what happened on 6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: wejcie EInarssona przed 23 nie powinno byæ pokazywane:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: deminki 6-6 siyah olan el kadýnlarda 6@c soylenip yapýlmýþ|pg||
nt|geot: that was why a thought this was a possible good board for BUL, but note that 4@S by West can be set|pg||
nt|geot: if South gets two heart ruffs|pg||
nt|mcphee: may have been worried about @S 5/3|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Norths return of @S4 could mean that spades are 4-4 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: S's second heart presumably suit pref - dangerous switch otherwise |pg||
mb|1N|nt|geot: and it will be the same contract|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1nt showing both minors, 5-5|pg||
nt|gulyas: so E may also try for game|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: birben 3s ye as sorabilirdi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, 7 bid and made|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the displayed bidding in open room is clearly not correct, that table is having problems with operator boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: his major honors are really too soft, so this is enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N is the catchall that doesn't fit  1-suit [usually 14+ HCP] or 2-suit [10-13, 5+ suit, unbal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: whereas 6d is dependent on spade favourable since played by north|pg||
nt|blum1956: Khokhlov knows partner is 18+ but going on the 5th level is unsafe|pg||
nt|james_h: 20 imps up for grabs on that last board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyirciler sebep soruyor sn yorumcular|pg||
nt|solex333: prob east made the mistake, playing udca he should play 2 of @h, pd will see who has the ace|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d = 5@H?|pg||
nt|gulyas: S showing a strong NT, N forces to game with 2@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: two way checkback|pg||
nt|james_h: ok|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H shows 3 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|eyamut: evet|pg||
nt|james_h: I'll use this time to make myself a nice cup of gin|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|james_h: +11 or -9 for Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry computer froze will enter result when claim comes|pg||
nt|nilsland:  North 2@S shows a raise, S pass oven 3@C shows minimum and denies @C shortness|pg||
nt|fabsayc: may need to finesse in spades to make hand|pg||

nt|fluffy: Momchil, you mean "scores" as partscores?|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||

nt|yusufb: 4@s oluyor|pg||
nt|star6ija: what we see :)|pg||

nt|oleberg:  He can expect barrage, and to may of his bids will be Non-forcing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Here he will have to bid something like 4@C|pg||
nt|monde9: if 5 @C now in South the slam in @D is far|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Maybe west will then chance 6@C. Maybe|pg||
nt|monde9: if 3NT 6 @D is possible|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But south has much defence. Surely he doesn't expect EW to have a slam on|pg||
nt|solex333: 5 @c is a good bid|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If he is alive to Wests huddle, he might preempt some|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But pass is surely an option|pg||
nt|solex333: pass is prob not an option. maybe a soft 4@c|pg||

nt|gulyas: I mean S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: thin opener by E - strikes gold|pg||
pc|h5|nt|geot: yes, maybe a diamond lead can make some trouble for declarer in 4@H|pg||
nt|geot: On a spade lead as he got he will take the ace and play clubs|pg||
nt|geot: And can't lose more than a club and max two trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: smooth duck by golin might have helped defense|pg||

nt|blum1956: 4@s being not interesting at all|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s Q gelmese olmayabilir acýk ele gore konuþuyoruz|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I dont know why West did not make 4@S - miscounted spades would be what anyone of us could do|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, exciting 2 matches|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS do not play 2 suiter wk2s as far as I know|pg||
nt|gulyas: you can find running scores here: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they play the same as I do (which is possible), 3@C means a good suit and a good hand (in context to being NV)|pg||
nt|gulyas: or bad-bad|pg||
nt|gulyas: but they did end up in 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Muller shows 1-suiter, then short @S, then exactly 2326|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@c is 11-13 bal in this case|pg||
nt|star6ija: having Ace and King Aronov assumes he has 8 plus points, not 0-7|pg||
nt|james_h: South I expect will be looking for 7@s ...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|james_h: Fun over on this hand -  from an Irish perspective|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@D is an artificial GF|pg||
nt|james_h: lets hope he finds it :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|begse: they can send in 3 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C asks total controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: ok, this will probably end in 13 tricks|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@H shows 4+@s, 1@s shows 3 card support|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 11 tricks to me|pg||
nt|psyck: @d looks likely lead|pg||
nt|baardolav: And a good distribution 4252|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ryskiel_: niewiele siê dzieje na boisku|pg||

nt|james_h: 2@d a relay I think|pg||
nt|geot: Only one imp at stake here, the overtrick|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is easier for Madala to find @h lead|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|psyck: did well to lead it even after W probably showed @d stopper|pg||
nt|solex333: garozzo: "never lead ur singleton" :)|pg||
nt|james_h: in this hand, I think both souths must drive to at least 5, but its easy for me to say that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: if memory serves  4@S now asks  Denial Cue Bidding|pg||
pc|s8|nt|james_h: I'm told 1@s is 2/3 card support|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D GF artificial, Sylvan wrote for Mesbur|pg||
nt|james_h: Tx Martin|pg||
nt|geot: 4@S played by West at the other table|pg||
nt|star6ija: as we are 12 behind I am jealoused for every IMP Italians won|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: so Muller will show control in @C but not @D  [don't quote me]|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Wijs writing lots of explanations for Nunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs may have enough information now to try 7@S|pg||

nt|star6ija: our international youngster Deyan Spasov ensures me that it is a kind of Flanery bid...showing both majors|pg||
nt|baardolav: Both 4@s and 4@h makes... +1 I believe |pg||
nt|geot: Game can be played in either major, np. |pg||

nt|monde9: Coldea thinking or BBO is slow ? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: They can read "The Dubliners" during that :) |pg||

nt|james_h: I doubt that will be the case come board 20|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT N/S on a possible @D lead may make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even making four required major help from defense|pg||

nt|blum1956: the vulnerability may prevent EW from the 5th level save|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like declarer must have taken the double finesse in hearts at the other table|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: NS in 5@Cx on 9, the double will make it easier to win (make overtrick)|pg||
nt|monde9: now that's the time for Konow to hesitate ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they can tell by the mouse clicks. This is standard procedure for vu graph operators. |pg||
nt|gulyas: EW has 3@Cs making, maybe even 4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so NS stealing the contract in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: ama bu kadar önde olduklarýný tahmin etmiyorlardýr bence|pg||
nt|geot: If declarer does nothing funny there will be 2 spade losers and a diamond loser|pg||
nt|blum1956: Do Bakshi-Townsend have an agreement against the popular "redouble=bid your auit" convention?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçmesinin sebebi..2@d kontrlu oynamak istemesindendi assaelin|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorulara cevap vereyim|pg||

mb|4N|nt|vugraphzeq: line up yazýlýrken  tahmin etmeleri lkazým:)|pg||
nt|geot: He will probably cross to hand with the @HA and take a spade finesse followed by the ace, then play on clubs for +620|pg||
nt|clinch: Pass looks normal here|pg||
nt|clinch: Yep|pg||
nt|baardolav: Aronov will earn one imp on this hand... if NS play diamond and diamond all the time|pg||
nt|baardolav: you need the double finesse for the entry|pg||
nt|geot: not really|pg||
nt|star6ija: the coach Vladislav Ispoeski helped me with explanation of the openning: 54+ in majors (NonVul maybe 4441), VUL usually 55+ 6-10|pg||
nt|oleberg:  5@H is even wrongsided|pg||
nt|solex333: lead directing bid ?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW did not came close to 6@D/@H but suits does not break|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: will they investigate @D slam?|pg||
nt|blum1956: "your suit"|pg||
nt|blum1956: Karpov is accurate|pg||
nt|clinch: Cards don't lie that well even for declarer to make 3|pg||
nt|clinch: Seemed to my (lesser than these guys) eyes to be between a 2 and 3 @h rebid|pg||
nt|monde9: same story as in Open|pg||
nt|oleberg:  In West it takes the lead of a diamond-singleton to defeat|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Virtually impossible to find :)|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @D was alerted :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: both majors are makable, lets see how 2@S fares here|pg||
nt|baldjean: since this contract will not make it does not matter much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, not certain about NS system - not sure whether 2@c is GF or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if 4NT is quantitative|pg||
mb|6N|nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçeyim..ortak kontr der belki..ben de pas geçerim..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bir oyuncu 60+ yaþýnda ise hem senyör hem açýk takýma katýlma hakkýna sahiptir|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Probably a re-transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, it's taken up quite a lot of room|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: but other lines will work as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what inferences are available from Fantoni's sequence  [2@H then 3N  vs  immediate 3N ...]|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably the agreement is that 4th hand passes first with good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ters taraftan oynuyorlar ama @c atak edilmez heralde|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise Townsend's first pass looks strange|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt 2@C was some form of gazilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@H needs 3 rnds of @Ds to beat it|pg||
nt|kamyk: uparty ten W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess -- Fantoni was showing hand that hoped for reopening DBL|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lead so long as they collect the 2@c b4 S gets rid of one|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|blum1956: His hand deserves a 3@h bid if it is nonforcing. Still it could force according to their agreement|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: 2c not alerted at the time but later explained as Gazilli|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, this late to decide to bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s needs a correct club guess after the heart lead, being laydown after the diamond one|pg||
nt|monde9: ah ok :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@C = South African Texas     standard Texas transfers with 4@D/@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is right of course, but unusual|pg||
nt|geot: If Shouth held diamond ace instead of the spade K this bid would have been fine|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: not sure. play continues, but he has left the table. may only be looking for some1 to turn the cards|pg||
nt|blum1956: If the declarer uses the diamond suit correctly he will sooner or later win|pg||
nt|blum1956: But he does not know the advere distribution. The only thing he may be sure after the lead - 3rs spade trick|pg||

nt|mdgraham: some players have a rule to always bid game after 1M-3M if they have a singleton or void|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzgn: he is back now explaining his absence - but in italian!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ace and ruff and second ruff when in with spade ace|pg||
nt|james_h: The difference on board 9 was Fitzgibbon deciding to upgrade his 13 count to a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7 tricks on top.  Possible overtrick in H, or long spade - but i doubt declarer will risk anything|pg||

nt|dkkello:  the thing is:  That all the danish players are very strong players and declarers and that why we are a little , a lot disapointed|pg||

nt|gulyas: so a small gain turned into another small loss|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzeq: bu günün son eli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west hand automatic opener for most big clubbers -- not sure if deWijs will open 1N [good 12-15]|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@d is 4+ diamonds unbalanced|pg||
nt|begse: tek karo|pg||
nt|monde9: a lightner here for -1 X in N in TOR|pg||
nt|gulyas: -6 instead of +6|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: X=majors|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: it was the lucky 1nt opening - if it went 1@C-1@H overcall, they would never have gotten to this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Fantoni's DBL = same HCP as opener|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a fairly routine 3NT E/W ..|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score on board 7 is still wrong|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@H is down on a diamond lead - as 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club towards the jack|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South would like to X here - but it may show a hand with 4+@S|pg||
nt|monde9: 6 @S is the normal & good contract|pg||
nt|monde9: for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: Batman Briç Kulübü tüm takýmlara baþarýlar diliyor|pg||
nt|ken__: Batman Briç Kulübü tüm takýmlara baþarýlar diliyor|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and welcome!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: but Muller treating the DBL as artificial rather than Penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||
nt|oleberg:  This might end with 6@S in south|pg||
nt|ritong: if you did so, id a free shot for me:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS will end up in 3nt, and will get a @C lead|pg||

nt|ritong: really saying " you won t toy with me lorenzo"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see any reason to bid with fredin's hand|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@s probably preemptive, as X mainly disruptive|pg||
nt|baardolav: here... coffee I think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eyamut: sabah mý?|pg||
nt|blum1956: the rest is simple|pg||
nt|james_h: throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|nilsland:  surprisingly - but RD showed a good hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And Lauria is hoping for a club lead|pg||
nt|monde9: :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Where an underlead of clubs is needed|pg||
nt|baldjean: Hungary now need 6 IMPs per board to still win this|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he expects the contract to be cold|pg||
nt|clinch: Well it's obviously preemptive... I mean by agreement|pg||
nt|monde9: same 200 but different contracts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the formula is 3sn+1|pg||
nt|ritong: 2sn+1*|pg||
nt|ritong: ty ty|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemos double is a little aggressive but makes life easy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C invitational stayman|pg||
nt|gulyas: or just showing 4@H now with a minimum GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn knows that Lauria is prepared for a club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate " my @hs are fine"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble=max hand probably|pg||
nt|ritong: has he?|pg||
nt|geot: this will not be any swing, standard 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible to go down|pg||

nt|nilsland:  At the other table South is playing 2NT with a heart lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not in my book|pg||
nt|fluffy: another flat board I'd say|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea has "some" temperamant" :)|pg||
nt|monde9: teperament |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Tea-apartment? :)|pg||
nt|solex333: unlucky 6 @d, but prob 5 @d will lead to 5/6 @s|pg||
nt|monde9: Bogdan Marina in N seems more cool to me :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|james_h: 2@c is probably a version of Drury showing 3 card fir|pg||
nt|geot: I think on board 10, the 3@S, it was something to be said for playing the Ace of trumps first. That is if East had KJ doubleton. So playing the ace and later play as he did was ...|pg||
nt|geot: acdtually ok|pg||
nt|james_h: fit|pg||
nt|james_h: 2s = min|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3@d = 4+ @c I am told|pg||
nt|psyck: so E shows his suits by not bidding them|pg||
nt|clinch: Might have been clobbered if N only had 4 @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer just needs to guess the @SJ to make, which should be a normal play to finesse|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean, normal to play it to W after E shows up with the long @Cs|pg||
nt|baldjean: N/S can develop a @H trick here for 9 tricks, but it needs careful play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good 2NT rebid - 2NT usually stronger in a balanced hand, but here W has a good source of tricks in diamonds  |pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: interesting use of 4C as a kind of leaping michaels, kibitzers will no doubt say standard in France but new to me|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1S shows @D i assume - 2@s anyone know what that means ?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@d pretty comfortable losing 3 red tricks in all likelihood|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i blame it on the defenseless 3@S bid :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: when did that bid promise any defenses?:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: I first played against Tiit Laanemae in... probably 1979. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs a spade switch sharpish-like|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: defenseless bids cause opponents to overbid|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, this may make|pg||
nt|geot: Some will maybe consider 3NT as South. Bad contract, but would make |pg||
nt|monde9: Rotaru X the 6 @S for @D leading in TOR|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzeq: akþam pardon|pg||
nt|gulyas: that would not work with E having 2 aces|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after an A/K lead vs NT, the defenders carding is usually either count/attitude, not suit pref - so if N finds a spade switch we can be seriously impressed |pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: no bonus points for being in 5|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|gulyas: N needs to cash his @HQ to beat it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: its true that his black suit holdings are not very promising|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: after 2@h 3@H by w|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: if pd has a @C honor, and only one @H honor, @HQ could be fatal|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: i speak about led|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he has closed the screen and asked if 3@c was forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||
nt|gulyas: but its attitude as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he cannot have Axxx|pg||
nt|gulyas: for convention cards: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=Italy&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5C2012Dubli...|pg||
nt|gulyas: n%2Fsystems%2FOpenTeams|pg||
nt|nilsland:  this will be good for sweden - on  11 as expected we lost 6 imps|pg||
pc|c7|nt|geot: the 4@S I mean, reached and won by both teams|pg||
nt|baardolav: and here same number of tricks all over|pg||
nt|oleberg:  6@D is an ok spot|pg||
nt|ritong: he has the entries for the standard trump handling|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helness looks like a man that makes it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|james_h: well denies a major anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D explained as 18-19 bal - hard to overhear, but I think 2@s was explained as denying major|pg||
nt|tez: güney dengeli 16 puanla 1 saniye düþünmedi pas geçmek için|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: this trump position starts with @hAQ to pin singleton @h10/J on East|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: he got it|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice|pg||

pc|h6|nt|james_h: I expect Ur right given the 2@d responce|pg||

nt|fluffy: after board 9, Bulgaria had regained the lead on group A, just 1 VP ahead of Italy|pg||
nt|mcphee: helgemo, no fear pard we have em now|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think daddy bessis loves it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  They certainly has to improve their declarer play - or go to the bank|pg||
mb|3C|nt|geot: Tough 3@S bid from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at other table nystrom doubled 2@H, a move i think should show a better overall hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was time we started the comeback :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|geot: and North bids 3NT on the stiff king over his partner's t/o double|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that versace does not wander in doubling 2@h|pg||
nt|monde9: better lead : @H |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We go for crossruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: this isn't over yet:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: we are not sure which side will go for the cross ruff yet|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Geir know that Tor will lead a trump if he has one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: All fine about the spades, but 3NT does not work very well anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C artificial game force, not sure about the rest|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No slam possible here.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and whats the TD verdict pls operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: still no ruling on board 3|pg||
nt|monde9: like that S can take the hand on the Jack of @C to give the ruff in @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|james_h: it maybe helped by the EW action|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: declarer will want to draw trumps may just cash the K+A and then play on D which works on all 3/2 splits.  If the trumps 4/1 though ...|pg||
nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now he worries about the long pause|pg||
nt|gulyas: with everything friendly, 5 or even 6@C is a decent contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: no lebensohl? strange|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5@c? co to mia³o byæ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: It was probably Khokhlov who bid 3NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Were he thinking about 5@D??|pg||
nt|mcphee: hehehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|nevaio   _: maybe inverted on @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, they play inverted lebensohl style|pg||

nt|monde9: can always go this defense, let see|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly better than 3nt|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: as usual i would rather be in 3nt|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Ok, played by N 6@s works|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, must be around 25% or 100% on actual layout|pg||
nt|ritong: confirmed, operator?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|gulyas: 2nt shows a good hand, any other bid is just a wk hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak siê pytam dwa razy to znaczy by³em podwójnie zdziwiony|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@c from Townsend first suggested by the viewgraph could have created a problem for EW |pg||
nt|clinch: Cards lie pretty well so may make 9, though would need a different NT range to bid game|pg||
nt|baldjean: this may make 12 tricks even|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|james_h: exactly Karel|pg||
nt|tez: hala karar yokmuþ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oleberg:  Not obvious to make this, though double-dummy it is easy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kdr_fm: may also finesse into the east hand on the basis a @d switch will be hard to find.  S8 looks ominous|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: i always thought lebensohl was backwards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you drinking sparkling grapfruit?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  seems operator have enough to do :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|nilsland:  You may regret not double if S bids 3NT - but I agree :)|pg||
nt|clinch: Opposite 14-16 NT E might just have a go|pg||
pc|d3|nt|monde9: not more now|pg||

nt|nilsland:  But we may see TD at the table if Helgemo feels that its needed|pg||
nt|ritong: i doubt that|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am not sure - East has a good hand and west may have 5-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Have lost play. Will claim with result when they are finished.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kamyk: dobrze, ¿e W to skontrowa³;|pg||

nt|baldjean: 4@s looks makeable E/W, so another chance for Hungary to close the gap|pg||
pc|d3|nt|blum1956: which is by no means beautiful|pg||

nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rns 3N denies support|pg||

nt|mdgraham: to be fair, a lot of players open flat 11's these days|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i guess that is route for Nunes to invite|pg||
nt|pauleger: this will lead to 8 tricks |pg||
nt|sastro: with 1C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: an other possibility is " i don t like @ss" when 3@s would promise fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to discard dummy's clubs to avoid a ruff|pg||

mc|12|nt|geot: We have seen a match so far, with not too much action, really. Norway went down in a game they could have won, and Ireland bid a very tough but good game they won. That is about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for NS  that works up through 9x|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: at this moment due to vacant spaces 6@D with E and 1 with west.  West is likely to hold any card declarer wants by the odds of 12-7 fairly significant|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nunes didn't open with 4-Qs  so deWijs can't with only 4-Js|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- let's play this again|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room as well in 3nt E, also medium club lead and 8 from north|pg||
nt|tomi2: let's see how Piekarek plays this|pg||
nt|psyck: should be interesting, a chance for Germany to catch up|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, versace is a superactive bidder|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
nt|baardolav: but then aronov could have played clubs|pg||
nt|monde9: more than 20 IMP's than France :)|pg||
nt|solex333: vp's|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea did it :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Half time just announced in playing area|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are the best team in my opinon|pg||
nt|james_h: I seriously doubt that Monaci will win, while wishing them well at the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Gromov is an extremely fast player, Dubinin being no faster then average |pg||
nt|monde9: & I said he's a very good dec :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Monaco|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|geot: Italy favourites of course, then the World Champs the Netherlands|pg||
nt|james_h: y, throw Poland into the mix also|pg||
nt|geot: But I think Monaco has a chance|pg||
nt|geot: Polan is always in such a mix|pg||
nt|james_h: only 17 imps on that hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh big swing - played from the other hand and teh S lead gave declarer more options, went -2|pg||
nt|clinch: That's a pretty dire opening bid|pg||
nt|tez: 4@h oluyor 5@d oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: bizde 4@s e yakýnýz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: internet kopmasýndan önce bu masada bulunan yaklaþýk 700 seyircinin hayatlarýndan endiþe ediyoruz|pg||
nt|tez: oyuna ve savunmaya baðlý|pg||
nt|baldjean: 51 IMPs are too much to gain in only 5 boards|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: well if sweden wins the europeans, maybe you get bragging rights for a year|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Will be interesting to see how Israel goes|pg||
nt|james_h: They have shown no form dispite bursting with talent|pg||
nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
nt|mcphee: so the bar is open?|pg||
nt|gulyas: luckily, this is not a knock out match|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nilsland:  I am not sure they can bid either :P|pg||
nt|ritong: making friends is your strong points, true?|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
nt|clinch: Taking vulnerability into account|pg||
nt|baardolav: A new 4nt from OR|pg||
nt|baardolav: where 6@s can be made...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
nt|gulyas: gain half of it back, and I would be happy:)|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@c looks like a Bergen raise|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tomi2: in his room south did not overcall since he bid 1@H himself, so he does not know the @H layout|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not really hehe|pg||
nt|baardolav: both black small slams and 6nt is makeable|pg||
nt|geot: Friendly clubs makes both 6@S and 6NT makeable. Have to solve the spades though|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6 @s needs very unusual treatment of trumps|pg||
nt|geot: You have to bring in the spades in NT as well|pg||
nt|monde9: the finesse in @H was protecting the @C in the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||
nt|james_h: 3@h is a balanced slam try (I think)|pg||
nt|ritong: oohh|pg||
nt|baardolav: it is no help making the @c tricks in 6nt... before you play spade|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcphee: now looks like on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Forrester must know that Gold is weak, and one assumes that must mean he has 5 @d at least. I'm just guessing this, but it's logical to me|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d @h ataðýndan sonra batýyor(muþ)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: double club have single spade...|pg||
nt|mcphee: make a lot of @S here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  That why they are playing so quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9 imps to France on board 11 - 4@sx= next door |pg||
nt|mdgraham: N has an awkward hand-type|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: 2@C game force, 3@C relay, not sure about 3@D|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah apparently 1@d showed 5@d; thanks|pg||
nt|gulyas: S reopening yet again, N is happy to pass that|pg||
nt|gulyas: but it needed some @S plays to beat this 2 tricks I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: dont know if it will make any difference tho|pg||
nt|geot: Unusual to let E/W play 3@C I think|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel are a tough outfit, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 4@c perhaps|pg||
mb|5D|nt|blum1956: Not enough from Karpov's point of view, needs some extra values (few)|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
nt|gulyas: the defense has to be careful not to try any trump promotion|pg||
nt|baldjean: still ok with @H switch, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
nt|baardolav: true|pg||
nt|baardolav: sorry private|pg||
nt|monde9: it was not a big risk of ruff in @S with the lead of @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
nt|baardolav: Even if you miss the spade play in 4@s here... I think Bulgaria make +1 imp|pg||
nt|fluffy: this lead ensures the 2 spade tricks fron south :)|pg||
nt|geot: At this moment Israel leads the group. But it is 237 237 236 236|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1NT would have been better this time|pg||
nt|mcphee: difficult to pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe some S hands will act over 1N|pg||
nt|mcphee: no fun defending NT with S hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now cue bids (this partnership's favorite action)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In many systems East will be able to show short diamonds which would cool off West|pg||
nt|ritong: @s lead looks very possible after this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so they better stop lower than 6|pg||
nt|tez: þu direktör onlarýn aleyhine olcaksa.kararý bildirseydi..iyi olacaktý|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nilsland:  At the other table it started 1N-3@D showing 4441 with a singleton minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that a whole lot better|pg||
nt|clinch: This looks to be on the @h guess; won't be much of a guess after Forrester turns up with AQ of trumps and a @d honour|pg||
pc|h2|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at least we know that they probably know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think they play turbo on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: now down 1 only|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: perhaps E was a bit conservative|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or not|pg||
nt|ritong: i t would match  now, i m told they do play turbo, but restricted to minor fits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a straightforward hand to play - may try a cross-ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: as expected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  easy lead from the sequence :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|clinch: Will have to play a @h early now|pg||
nt|baldjean: still a little swing for Hungary, since it was not doubled at the other table. but not enough|pg||
pc|s5|nt|geot: Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey|pg||
pc|s6|nt|geot: Myself I do not like 3@S the first time unless it is agreed to show some cards|pg||
nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa will return @h after winning @d, maybe Piekarek will have an idea then|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe it will be too late then, he is still thinking how to play the @D|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, too difficult a hand, even when looking at all cards :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yapmak içen @cQ yerini bilmesi gerekiyordu|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama daha ilk turdan empas atmasý için bir sebep yoktu. normal oyun|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ferlema: http://csbnews.org/my-way-iv-by-norberto-bocchi/?lang=en|pg||
pc|c3|nt|james_h: I have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|clinch: As otherwise Forrester will get a @c ruff|pg||
nt|monde9: -1|pg||
nt|monde9: for 6 IMP's|pg||
nt|solex333: ok if k of h offside, a of @c onside and spades 4-1 or spades to dummy return spade and east ruff with 2 @s. but|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|geot: but I dont think it can be right to let opps play 3@C on Souths hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: they move to the next board I guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: Muller will think again -- but it is too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes as dummy takes out a magazine to read|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Italy, Monaco or Ireland??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running score linkleri þu adreste|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I do not say that 1N is always making - but passing may still be good in the long run|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: that was  said, lemme see....21 lines ago|pg||
nt|ritong: but great minds drink alike:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Good defence, and would have been supernatural to find the counter-play|pg||
nt|clinch: Before knowing the @s position|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mcphee: it sure can|pg||
pc|c5|nt|clinch: Nothing about the bidding suggests Gold has such a weak hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|nt|james_h: My bridge suffers from real life and vice versa|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, its a push|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|blum1956: Certainly he could try some 5th level invitation (the 5@d cue probably being the best) but the 5th level was not safe from Maxim Karpov's point of view|pg||
pc|h5|nt|MolvaM: açýk takýmýmýz A grubunda|pg||
nt|tez: koz gelirse|pg||

nt|MolvaM: sizi totemciler sizi|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tez: kozu alamýyor þimdi de|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: actually east denied a spade control and west bid slam reluctantly so any lead but a spade would mean fredin was not listening|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: this is ok|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dK|nt|kdr_fm: people suggest a squeeze - but the squeeze card is the 4th @C and the @h9 ... not the J so west saves the day|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|james_h: @hj to transfer the manace (hoping that West has long clubs)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|baldfriede: yes, but as I said, S was afraid of @H, so he did not bid on|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like a possibility for Bulgarians to shorten the gap|pg||
nt|monde9: yes, than i have an excuse :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: no way lauria sits here|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s..|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1NT?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double for takeout... East have for 3  maybe 4spade|pg||
mb|d|nt|geot: Ireland got a grip on this now, and fully deserved. they have not done anything wrong, and Norway has got a few hands where I do not really recognise my good friends to be honest|pg||
nt|geot: It is the first match only, do not worry Norwegian fans:)|pg||
nt|pauleger: in relation to the other rounds these hands are kind of flat until now|pg||
nt|ritong: well, unexpected|pg||
nt|ritong: no, i naively thought fredin would keep quiet|pg||
nt|tez: assael köksoyun eliyle girmezdi araya|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If N is strong and doubles you can go from 1NT X to 2@H but if 2@H is doubled you cant go back to 1NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 1 lvl higher here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was definitely operating on this hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes only a couple of hands had some potential, maybe we will end with a bang with some fancy hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D would show 5 cards for me|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think FF use support doubles|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though EW have game on here, but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|star6ija: now 4 @ss|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s might make ona non diamond lead, not very likelly o this table|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s makes with diamond too?|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry, on diamond pushes you can discard all hearts from dummy, so 4@s still makes|pg||
nt|star6ija: Aronov knows Stefanov has singleton @d|pg||
nt|geot: right|pg||
mb|3N|nt|geot: This might be a pick up for Norway|pg||
nt|gulyas: no dbl, no trouble:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: but there are still matches with more imps exchanged. some suprise is that pland is down 40 imps against Croatia|pg||
nt|clinch: Again, lots of bidding from NS|pg||
nt|monde9: -2 here another bad board for Romania|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 2NT is more challenging than 2@d in the OR and will probably fail|pg||
nt|clinch: Dbl presumably support; not sure what rdbl was|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Poland has been doing surprisingly poor all rounds|pg||

nt|star6ija: correct|pg||
nt|baardolav: double can be invite from east|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: very true|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: 4@S a good save|pg||
nt|tomi2: except of their win against France|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Fredin may even make this with a club finess|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: yes Bessis probably wrote that up in BBO news|pg||
nt|tomi2: if they get kicked out a new discussion will start about the way the team gets selected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or without|pg||
nt|ritong: bar is open:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|geot: At the other table Boye Brogeland made this hand simple when he overcalled 4@H over Hanlon's 1@C|pg||
nt|clinch: Good work from NS to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like this move from helness|pg||

pc|cT|nt|nilsland:  CocaCola someone?|pg||

nt|mcphee: yes, rum and a tiwst of lemon|pg||
nt|mcphee: E knows this one is a make|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2: Germany has made trials first time for 10 years, this team won earlier this year|pg||
nt|clinch: England has played very well against a strong French team (so far)|pg||
nt|fluffy: another line pointed by an spec is to pitch the heart on second/third diamond|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea's temperament ? 14 PH 1 NT opening ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cross to dummy, H finesse - not so easy for North |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room on their final board  [ 20]|pg||

pc|cK|nt|oleberg:  But a club it must be|pg||
nt|mcphee: ducking?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is also a possible ethical problem for North, although it depends on how long S took to pass the double - we can't always tell the correct speed of the bids |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as the hesitation could only imply (given the srong dummy and the jump to 3NT) that South was thinking of bidding 2@s, and therefore has three spades   |pg||

nt|tomi2: in Germany we had no trials but that was like in Italy, it was because there was no real doubt that the team playing is the strongest one|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|clinch: Despite the @h misguess, Gold can't put Forrester in to lead a trump without establishing a @d winner for declarer|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Yes, it could be missed on a (very) bad day|pg||
nt|gulyas: the bad news is, we may end up behind both, and be eliminated|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Sweden in 7 here - without success|pg||
nt|baardolav: 33 33... 3@h non vul preemtive style|pg||
nt|geot: I wonder how the weak 3@H bid is defined, if he may have something like KQ or AQ to six|pg||
nt|geot: or if that is too strong|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double ask if Bocchi have max|pg||
nt|oleberg:  My guess is, it would be bid 95% of the time (more or less)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, computer died for a while!|pg||
nt|clinch: Gold finally has a hand we'd all open|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iþte hizmet :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: With maximal hand they open 2@c instead of 1@d|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would have guessed @D wrong:(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: I hope we will not be playing that nice fit...|pg||
nt|gulyas: if Madala tries 3@D now, it would be the Italians for a change who declare the same contract in both rooms:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, we'd have opened his 21-count of course|pg||
nt|geot: Madala can not see many losers, but he will pass 4@H i think|pg||
nt|monde9: & the finishing match sometimes are tough :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: well 4@h can make too i suppose, esp as bidding marks cards|pg||
nt|psyck: making some endplay on North possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant nothing works after the heart pitch, we could all see how to make it|pg||
nt|baardolav: Madala scans the records... and try to estimate if Bocchi can have 2 hounours in @h now...|pg||
nt|geot: He goes on in the hope that the heart suit is stronger|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S is some form of a wk2, but S thinks this has play, and he is right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching anything but a heart on the third club gives up on various other chances|pg||
nt|clinch: on last hand|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  But maybe playing a heart before playing the third club preserves some chances|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe 5@H could have been an alternative?|pg||
nt|monde9: now plus 1 costs some points |pg||
pc|h7|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||

nt|psyck: best would be to set up a @d ruff here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South opened 1@C and thus was favourite to hold the @DK - so a little bit unlucky for sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room south opened so the grand odds were different than at this table, ie a bit unlucky the diamond king offside|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not an unreasonable double. The opponents hands fit miracolously|pg||

nt|mdgraham: still, may survive - depends on the way E plays the diamonds|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the match   round 5 begins in about 1 hour|pg||

nt|baardolav: Last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Last board.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The double gained a trick :)|pg||
nt|monde9: Players are tired after all that boards |pg||
nt|mcphee: e/w hold the record for 3 down in one set:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, and a push|pg||
nt|gulyas: final board of the match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board here - thanks to our operator - excellent job |pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: last hand now, thanks everybody, restart in about 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|baardolav: 140 ew par score... |pg||
nt|gulyas: Ireland making a partscore, this may be duplicated here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: england gains lead in B I think if they push this one|pg||
nt|oleberg:  They virtually had a day off yesterday|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
nt|tomi2: cards could not be friendlier, I think 6@H could make if they bid it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden EW stopped in 3@S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: yorumlarýyla bizi aydýnlatan nafiz zorlu, tezcan þen, yusuf sohtorik e çok teþekkürler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bizi izleyen siz sevgili seyircilerimize de çok teþekkürler|pg||
nt|oleberg:  1nt = 12-15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will be interesting to see what the other table does with 17, 18, and 19|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yusufb: selamm levent bolþanss|pg||
nt|star6ija: non-forcing|pg||
nt|monde9: 3 NT on South ? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SK doubleton onside, clubs 4-4, hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|psyck: see, i told you cards will slowly get exciting towards the end :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S = any shortnes, weak or strong|pg||
nt|ozgull: önemli maçlarýmýzdan biri üstgruba skorumuz taþýnacaðý için kazanmak önemli umarýmson bord birþey olmaz 18 çok iyi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iyi oynayan millilerimize de|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks to our excellent operator MArtin|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@s=any spl 5-8 or 12-14|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: their notes say 4m = minor void|pg||
nt|tomi2: so I would think this bid would show @C void and no @D void in north|pg||
nt|pauleger: S won´t believe the @c void :)|pg||
nt|clinch: It's been good bridge, I think - not obviously swingy hands, but England have handled them very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
nt|clinch: To hold France to less than 2 IMPs per board is very well done|pg||
nt|tez: 2d yý 18 19 dengeli oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet cýkacak olan takýmlardan alýnan puanlar onemli 18 iyi skor|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fitting reply from partner|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3-3-2-5 not so fitting|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not doubled any of those occasions|pg||
pc|cT|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: but they have sequences where "first step = high shortnes, 2nd step = lowest shortnes" could apply. Hope they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|nemeo: sorry sorry private :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The only way not to be in a 8-card fit|pg||
nt|monde9: a X from Coldea ? |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 dwn is likely here |pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@c X is -200|pg||
nt|nemeo: a me questa foto piace molto di più, l'altra molto meno (diciamo che qui mi riconosco mentre nell'altra ho la solita faccia di quando devo sorridere per forza), mi chiedevo solo ...|pg||
nt|nemeo: quale può andare meglio per lo scopo che interessa...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Par score is 140 EW|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s|pg||
nt|baardolav: The result from OR|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, getting out of 1nt is going to be fine|pg||
nt|monde9: His temperament was calm than :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  X would probably have been take-out|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thank you|pg||
nt|ozgull: herkese iyi günler iyidilekleriniz  bizle olsun|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bugün baþka maç yok|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt oluyor|pg||
nt|gulyas: E 'nevergiveup' Fitzgibbon bids one more|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: yes, this is what the notes say: If OPENER bids 2M over 2M-1, RESP can continue with 2NT asking, showing a side suit or  a splinter.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs would copy that bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4 card @S invite|pg||
pc|sA|nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S is plain and simple an overbid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýnki 3 maçtan hangisinin yayýnlanacaðý akþam belli oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: @c dam 3lü|pg||
nt|geot: Noone will double 4@C here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: E has taken a bit of a view here, not supporting spades|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
nt|baardolav: Now probably Italy will win with 1 imp...|pg||
nt|star6ija: or with 7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|clinch: Good lead; makes 4 on a @s lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bana iletiliyor ve ben de TBF web sayfasýnda yayýnlanmasý için bildiriyorum|pg||
nt|gulyas: this can be beaten by playing trumps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tomi2: 3NT is defined as @S void, so 4@C could be @D void and 4@D club void|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they knew what they were doing anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: everybody knows the situation holding 2 aces against a bid slam :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: most of the time it is bad to lead one of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: N and E are sitting on the same screen side, so if N thinks his bidding shows @D void he will tell this to Lauria|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gulyas: just like that, yes|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|clinch: Less than 1 IMP per board of course|pg||
nt|tez: diðer masada 1 nt oynanýyor|pg||
nt|baardolav: Can be 2 down... |pg||
nt|geot: He is more likely to go 2 down than winning this|pg||
nt|mcphee: or weakish?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I like that Irish spirit. too bad it did not help in the European soccer championships|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: versace has the worst possible diamond holding after the double|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and 3@S prob making in other room will be 8 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|star6ija: right|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Declarer doesn't really want to play any suits|pg||
nt|monde9: it's depending on agreements|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a problem if the opening lead was on the other side and south would explain "i dont know what this shows"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks for watching|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani www.tbricfed.org.tr adresini takip ediniz|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|geot: so this will decide the match. 9 tricks = Italy wins, 8 tricks= BUL wins|pg||
nt|star6ija: but this is still 15-15|pg||
nt|geot: I put my money on Bulgaria here|pg||
nt|baardolav: If Bocchi start with AK heart... and heart for ruff... it is easy for stefanov to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|geot: it will likely be 15-15 anyway, but the imps:)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @D jack shows @d ratherthan @h|pg||
nt|szeryf: Muller spasowa³ z rêk¹ S na otwarciu! graj¹ 1 kiera|pg||
nt|star6ija: @S Jack|pg||
nt|baardolav: I think bocchi start with @d 8|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, if we could bet, I'd bet you a beer their agreement is take-out|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|mcphee: thats what I like to use,|pg||
nt|mcphee: it works well|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of us like our partners to support with 5-card support :) |pg||
mc|11|nt|yusufb: cok sanslý 3nt @h AKQ sýrtta J kurtuluyor @c dede QXX empasta|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all. A quiet start, but it got swingy towards the end. |pg||
