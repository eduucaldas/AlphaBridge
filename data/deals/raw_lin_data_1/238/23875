mb|1S|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||

nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in trouble now if south re-doubles|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: in the unlikely event e/w reach the 5 level South needs to unblock his @HK under the Ace later in hand to avoid endplay|pg||

nt|barnets: a good vul game|pg||

pc|c3|nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||

nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||

nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||

nt|barnets: at the 4 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there any possibility this is a cue in support of @Ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: is this a natural bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west made a clever move; 4 clubs then removing 4 sp should tell his p "I have a massive red-suiter and think that the 5 level is safe"|pg||
nt|barnets: why do I have this problem ?|pg||
nt|barnets: he thinks it should be obvious to his partner but I assure you it is not|pg||
nt|jbennet: cue for spades?? 5 clubs would be cue for spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: or he would have bid already|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east has hands on head thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: east is wondering what is going on and probably should bid 6@D to cover all possiblities|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many are telling me (all for different reasons) that this "Can't" show @s support.  I agree, if you're looking at the w hand it's obvious it can't.|pg||
nt|barnets: you , I and west know that bit does east ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east have to work this out, but if he thinks that west is showing a red 2-suiter good enough to go to the 5 level. East just might raise to 6 d.|pg||

nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||

mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices from West|pg||
nt|geot: Normal overcall. Normal decision by North.|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like|pg||
nt|arvidsson: as we can see all cards we see that EW will not make 4@H, but guess the whole field will play game on this hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: bugün kaç maç yapýldý bilen varmý sanýyorum 5 maç|pg||

mb|4H|nt|star6ija: 6@h will go down with @s lead|pg||

nt|geot: But not all will re-open with a double as South on that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: ok play gone ahead at this stage|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: Lots of thinking at this table|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sengulerz: 2 imp olsun bizim olsun|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Ahhhh another way to beat 4 . kill the entry to the @d|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky for e/w no X|pg||
nt|jbennet: it was reasonable to remove 4 sp x, but 4NT as a "pick a suit" would involve p in the process. |pg||
nt|barnets: but swing earned by east for Italy in open by opening 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: a better bid in my opinion|pg||

mb|5C|nt|vugraphzgp: one round of hearts have been played so far|pg||
nt|jbgood: so maybe Norway will get off the schneid now|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 6@D on this hand, but only double dummy. Has to drop the @DK|pg||
nt|geot: Madala did not re-open with a double at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: second trick won by EW so logic tells me a diamond queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: from there on it is quessswork sorry|pg||
nt|jbgood: just wait for the final result and give us that, Tos|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 5h can even be set -3. |pg||
nt|barnets: Italy now in fron by 4|pg||
nt|barnets: south could have risked a x|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: actually it would have been more interesting to see wheter Aronov would have found the lead against 3 N played by South|pg||

mb|p|nt|panosk: if you go a 20 hcp game and 5 are useless its not gd news, but i also think many will venture 4@H|pg||

nt|2celik1: Suleyman Hoca @d as rua yi almayarak 10 love aldi|pg||
nt|santyclz: As with many relatively new conventions, there are many variations so it's important to discuss exact sequences.  Saying "Gazilli" isn't enough.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: eamongall here for a few boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good contract, game on few HCPs and nice fit, but you can not expect to win such a board in an international championship, and especially playing against Italy|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lookes strange, might be some operating glitch?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tez: asým var ya daha yusufum:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: OR: same contract on bd 11|pg||
nt|yusufb: tez hocam @c ye @h atýnca bende cakmýyomuyum:)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: it was 10 tricks, not 11, right?|pg||
nt|barnets: south bid 6@D in other room|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 5N would work better|pg||
nt|barnets: then over 6@C|pg||
nt|barnets: south could bid 6@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|2celik1: iceride Tokay hizli sekilde 3nt dedi 1@s e|pg||
nt|panosk: 10, 2 trumps and a @H|pg||
nt|barnets: giving north some choice|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: 3@c oynanýr bu|pg||
nt|ady: last hand a continuation of a 2nd trump  might have been down 2    but Hanlon can bring in the spades so defence cant risk that|pg||
nt|tez: ortak keser sorduðunda sizde QX varken ne diyorsunuz?|pg||
nt|remo: grande 5nt!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: sure seems NS had 9 tricks on defense that last hand|pg||

nt|arigun:  hersey bilinirse 4@h oluyor ama batma olasiligi var|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: 7-3 fit in hearts again (N/S)|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: bence 4@h batacak|pg||
nt|arigun:  @h 2 kaptirirsa @d yu bilmesi lazim|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h Q koyarsa batar|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: so  -4 rather than -2|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d da sorun yok|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2D showed 5 @ds and 8+ points|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok then I guess W raised with a @S H or S finessed with T of @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: since partner is passed hand East just bids 3NT|pg||

nt|tez: onlar kontrol gösterirken keykart sayýsýný da veriyorlar ama burada emin deðilim|pg||
mb|p|nt|vahaboglu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Brink-Drijver will play this hand in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we see that perfect defense defeats 3N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if defense does NOT take first 5 -- then declarer takes first 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did rebid 3N with east hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner was unpassed and unlimited East would bid 2NT and give partner room to describe|pg||
nt|panosk: this might get expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|kbitzer: 600  cepte görmek  dbl ý tutmak..|pg||
nt|yusufb: rakip 1nt dedikten sonra 3nt ye ulaþmak ve yapmak cok nadir olan bi durum|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a very good double by E and this might be whats needed for norway to get back in the lead |pg||
nt|arvidsson: declarer need to cash out for -800 otherwise this could go for 1100|pg||
nt|yusufb: @c cýk|pg||

nt|tez: çýkar bence|pg||
nt|yusufb: cýkabilir @c|pg||

pc|c5|nt|barnets: now a low club lead|pg||
nt|yusufb: bravo salvo|pg||
nt|arigun:  @h de dogru oyun 8'e dogru oynamak ama yanlis yapar dam koyarsa ve pisman olursa @d da yuksek ihtimal cift pass (masada kaybettiriyor)|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: @c atak batýrma þansýný artýrýr|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: þimdi kaldý oyunu batýrmaya|pg||
nt|arigun:  gelir gelmez bi 5 bi 12 aliyoru,|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: so the off-the-wall preempt by E has worked...|pg||
nt|tisserand: molto bravi|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: what do YOU lead from south hand against 3N  [without peeking at north hand]?|pg||
nt|star6ija: this one looks like overbid|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|baardolav: well done Nybo... +1|pg||

pc|dA|nt|2celik1: kotu oldu bu board|pg||
nt|sengulerz: çok güzel konuþtular (maalesef)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but I would see the player that do not take the @C finesse|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is traditional double: I have something in your suit pd. |pg||
nt|tez: büyük abi 1 fazla olur diyor ama o @d valeyi oturtuyor|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|rodvenn: some play some of these situations as Lightner. But probably not this combination|pg||

nt|james_h: Score is: Bul 39 - Ire 19 after 11 boards (19-11 in VPs)|pg||
nt|ady: south cant be blamed for entering |pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, showing 2 suits and allowing your partner to show his hand wins over the solo bidding.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|star6ija: but I think declarer has his 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Spade now since @h position clear|pg||
nt|arvidsson: no is my prediction 5 off|pg||
nt|arvidsson: now|pg||

pc|hA|nt|arvidsson: I guess he did and we therefor will just see a claim soon :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|poohbear: In the other room Israel found the wrong lead on board 10 and allowed 4H to make|pg||
nt|ady: useful swing for Bulgaria  several down    suppose if doubled n/s can escape to 3@D   which if not doubled is  less painfull|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: low spade best|pg||
nt|james_h: Record sheet for this match  ...|pg||
