nt|santyclz: Good morning folks.  Looks as if we're getting underway.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Aha!  This looks like the same board being played in the other room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: will enter contract after play finishes ...we had wrong names b4|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all for this interesting match |pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|desinka: In this hand, 4@S will be not the final contract, i think|pg||
nt|desinka: but lets see the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 1st hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: n/s likelyto play 2@H|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D transfer response showing hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Good morning|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzgp: this not the correct bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in Open room|pg||
nt|barnets: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: but contract is written 3@H on bocchis record|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if e-w are limited to 2@hs if the defense gets all its tricks.|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure you can even make 1@H its close|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: now 2@S|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi all|pg||
mb|2N|nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: merhaba:)|pg||
nt|desinka: Hi Momchil|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desi :)|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  just 1 down in 3@D  if they can balance|pg||
nt|yusufb: herkese selammm|pg||
nt|yusufb: oncelikle milli takýmýmýza baþarýlarrrr|pg||
nt|funtay: slm Yusuf|pg||
nt|yusufb: slmmm Tayfun|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yusufb: merhabaa:) takýmýza bolþans|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 1@h could be 11-13 bal or big both with 4+ support|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt ye gelince @d atak en iyisi..ama zor çýkmak|pg||
nt|yusufb: 13 maç oynuyoruz milli takýmýmýz italya ile 2ligi paylaþmakta|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
nt|star6ija: we have Bulgarian pair, playing precision here|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h e 2 sanzatuyu davet oynuyorlar..fit 4 lü|pg||
nt|ady: east has balanced|pg||
pc|c7|nt|poohbear: hi all|pg||
nt|star6ija: sems like a good board for Bulgarians to start with|pg||
nt|star6ija: seems|pg||
pc|c5|nt|desinka: Hello, Barry:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yusufb: ilk 9 girmeyi garantiledik bundan sonra final grubuna cýkacak takýmlardan alýnacak puanlar onemli isvec maçý bu acýdan onemli|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: request for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|tez: @h atak edebilir zorlu|pg||
nt|tez: yerde tek ya da þigan @h var..konuþmalardan biliniyor|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  NS play a 2/1 style with lots of gadgets and 12-14NT |pg||
nt|funtay: ataðýda batýrmasý da zor bir 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly not easy but I think 2 can be made.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|geot: Hi Jon, and kibs. Welcome.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hello all, Hei Geir and Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tez: iddialý atak ediyorlar..eðer en küçüðüyse|pg||
pc|dK|nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: may be able to beat 2@H now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|star6ija: yes...this way avoiding trump queen guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Yes, needed to avoid leading a @d from hand.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like defence should play trumps at every opportunity  even west give up a trump trick to stop any cross ruff|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yusufb: bcok iyi dondü nafiz abi|pg||
nt|funtay: asý girerse batar|pg||
nt|tez: en iyi defansý yaptý|pg||
nt|yusufb: batabilir|pg||
nt|tez: oynayanda @h uzun..@s i ele çekti valesi var..@c saðlamaya çalýþýyor..@c i de uzun|pg||
nt|funtay: öbür oda da yapmýþ bizimkiler|pg||
nt|tez: bil bakalým elinde ne kýsa:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: i was thinking they are doing fine with this neutral defense|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: Didnt see that North dbled the final contract. This is somethign that modern bidding has frowned upon|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back to -1 again...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: If they make overtricks..........|pg||
nt|desinka: h tables starts from 1st board..|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|ady: now trump trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not really matter, west gets two trump tricks for down 1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tez: @h müracaatý var..alýp @d yý oynayacak|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats how they do things here|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is forbidden to change the order in official competitions|pg||
nt|star6ija: a kind of rule|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|tez: @d larý atabiliyor zorlu|pg||

nt|ady: well played    |pg||
nt|barnets: down 1 only in open|pg||
nt|ady: yes   down 1    3 imps for Norway|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 6 imps for Bulgaria for the dbl|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  the play would have been interesting|pg||
nt|geot: to take 2 down I mean|pg||
nt|santyclz: So 1st blood to Italy for going down 1 fewer trick.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||
nt|ady: so in fact 6 imps to Bulgaria   Hanlon played 10@S  in the end game  ttrying to give impresion of Q10 left I would think|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d alsaydý oynayan entresan sekilde oluyordu @c lere nafiz abi kart tutamýyordu@h @s atamazdý @d atsada @d tahsil edilemiyordu|pg||
nt|tez: operator yanlýþ klikledi|pg||
mb|2S|nt|star6ija: and another Bulgarian pair in the OR, whose agressive style misleaded Swedes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is very aggressive|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mihov has taken good decision in the OR|pg||
nt|desinka: this one looks like flat to me...|pg||
nt|james_h: tough position for NS here|pg||
nt|funtay: 12 ile açmadý Nafiz abi|pg||
nt|tez: 10 imp bize|pg||
nt|funtay: 4-4 major ile açardým, siz?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tez: diðer masada 3@d oynanýyordu bu el|pg||
nt|tez: @h ataðýna batacak burda|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4-3 e 4@s iyi kontrat ama bulmak zor|pg||
nt|tez: nafiz abi diyor ki @h asýyla al küçük @d yý oyna..batýr bakalým:)|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be a flat board probably in all matches|pg||
mb|5C|nt|james_h: I like Fantunes defence to Multi ... X shows @h|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have 3NT   with their 28 hcp   not in the bidding yest|pg||
nt|james_h: it counters this situation here|pg||
nt|ady: there is a lucky lay to make 6@D    but will surely play an easy 3NT|pg||
mb|5H|nt|star6ija: as Shwartz did here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Can never tell with these big distribution hands|pg||
nt|tez: oynayanlar skoru görmüyor..masada oynuyorlar..yanlarýnda bilgisayar operatörü var..genelde isimleri kenan oluyor..onlar masada ne olduysa bize iletiyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: 2@d tek renkli major eli|pg||
nt|ady: south should certainly have taken some action first round|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon did well to recover|pg||
nt|ady: North has taken a gamble balancing at that level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 top tricks playing their 5-5 fit in 3nt, but  it's not likely...|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eamongall: hi ..eamon galligan here ..I reconstructed play on board 1 here .. fairly close ..bidding I made up also |pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|star6ija: these 4 @h are little tricky|pg||
nt|jbgood: and at the other table a heart was lead - since E opened 1 @h|pg||
nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in trouble now if south re-doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: S asked about 3NT  and shrugged|pg||
nt|yusufb: bende kesin acardým 3 pozisyona gerek yok 1dende herkes acar nafiz abi ilk elin keyfini sürüyo olacak:)|pg||

nt|james_h: Cheeky stuff by North and East|pg||
nt|james_h: East will have the bloody nose though|pg||
nt|tez: as saklanmýþtýr|pg||
nt|ady: looka lik 3@C  puppet tayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: good start for the Italians|pg||

nt|arigun:  herkese iyi aksamlar|pg||

pc|d5|nt|andyv:  1@c is 14+ or a good 12/13 with 5 card suit|pg||

nt|poohbear: 4H is not a good bid in my opinion. Wont stop opps from bidding 4S . And you have weak trumps and defense|pg||

nt|star6ija: as our friend from Pakistan Oosman Bashir pointed out...both Souths did also well not trying slam over 4th level overcall|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S  shows 4 hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: and they play in the predictable 3NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
nt|ady: west is aware of 4 spades with south    the 3@D response to puppet said no 5 card major  but promised at least 1 4 card major|pg||
pc|s9|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: in the unlikely event e/w reach the 5 level South needs to unblock his @HK under the Ace later in hand to avoid endplay|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|tez: el dikkatli oynamayý gerektiriyor|pg||
nt|tez: þimdi hep @c oynayacak..@c çakacak..sonra koz ele..yere doðru @s oynayacak|pg||
nt|tez: kuzey oyun açtý sonuncudan|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  1@h = 0-11hcp w 4@h or 4@s|pg||
nt|geot: Second seat opening. Nice hand though.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: Who would open with norths hand at board 1?|pg||
nt|tez: kontr ile baþlamasý avantaj kazandýrdý|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  sorry, mistyped..1@h denied 4@h and has 4@s|pg||
nt|james_h: + 1 I expect|pg||
nt|ady: should make an overtrick end playing east|pg||
pc|c3|nt|geot: i wonder if Boye would have doubled if West had rebid 2@D on this hand? Probably.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nevaio   _: Hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: hi |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now low heart|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tez: ben 1@s ile araya girerdim|pg||
nt|ady: south was considering winning diamond with acce or king to unblock|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: as it tutns out 5 diamond tricks available|pg||
mc|11|nt|xenya: looks like 1 off?|pg||
nt|andyv:  as per spec (all help appreciated): 1S is 4cards , 2hearts GF relay, 2spades balanced other natural|pg||

nt|ady: 1 imp for Norway|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yusufb: hýzlý oynarlarda bu kadar degil:)|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|star6ija: easy to be made when we see all the cards|pg||
nt|geot: +140 is a fine result for N/S on board 2. E/W has 8-9 tricks in diamonds. Depending on the lead.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4+ @d, 6-9|pg||
nt|tez: @d as atak edilmedi tabiki|pg||
nt|tez: her eli böyle claim etmez inþallah:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: (3 @c)|pg||

nt|arigun:  nerden bilecekki o zaman bir tek @sA atagina yaptiriyor olabilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  at this vul, EW will stretch as much as possible to get to 4@h|pg||
nt|james_h: I think the double will weaken Easts case(assuming he has one) on the last hand|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@c is a Tx to @d|pg||
nt|ady: this can be defeated with a diamond ruff|pg||
mb|4S|nt|star6ija: I appreciate Mihov's overcall in the OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT depends on who bids it. Safe from West not from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 1@d is natural and unbalanced|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|barnets: east must allow wet to win the second heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||
nt|geot: Declarer can finesse clubs to get rid of the diamond loser, so only four top losers in 3@H, but....|pg||
nt|tez: 11 e 11..iyi durdular 1 nt de|pg||
nt|ady: this makes on the nose|pg||

pc|h4|nt|geot: Would be surprised if Versace win this contract. Lots of work to do.|pg||

nt|andyv:  good brakes by EW as 4@h has virtually no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 2, 3N went off 1 so only 3 imps exchanged|pg||
nt|geot: he will finesse|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they overcalled 1H with North so a @H was led|pg||

nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||

nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||

nt|arvidsson: If 3@C still could be 5-5 S have a very good hand|pg||

pc|d5|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||

nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Is there any possibility this is a cue in support of @Ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: is this a natural bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west made a clever move; 4 clubs then removing 4 sp should tell his p "I have a massive red-suiter and think that the 5 level is safe"|pg||
nt|barnets: why do I have this problem ?|pg||
nt|barnets: he thinks it should be obvious to his partner but I assure you it is not|pg||
nt|jbennet: cue for spades?? 5 clubs would be cue for spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: or he would have bid already|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east has hands on head thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: east is wondering what is going on and probably should bid 6@D to cover all possiblities|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many are telling me (all for different reasons) that this "Can't" show @s support.  I agree, if you're looking at the w hand it's obvious it can't.|pg||
nt|barnets: you , I and west know that bit does east ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east have to work this out, but if he thinks that west is showing a red 2-suiter good enough to go to the 5 level. East just might raise to 6 d.|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: 5@C = maximum [in context]  3 keycards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in response to 4@D  'slave' can also describe  bad or medium hand for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held same hand with @DQ instead of @CQ   i wonder if he bids the same way or treats the hand as 15+ HCP|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg:  Or else, there will simply not be enough tricks|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  so now we can take back what we thought of E's pass on board 7 as it appears he did double for a push board.|pg||
nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tez: 2 fazla oldu|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s cn in fact make 5@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with bust hand north bids 2@H as first bid and can stop in 3@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|baardolav: the 13th trich on... 3 of heart|pg||
nt|baardolav: trick*|pg||
pc|cK|nt|geot: Here an eventual NT contract will be played by East|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|arigun:  ilk 10 board sonunda 49 ondeyiz kalan 10 board mac berabere bitti|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||

nt|xenya: to get back to hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: A very good grand slam... need to ruff e diamond before pichting the @h on @c K, |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: so much better to be in 6@S even if declarer can guess 13 tricks|pg||

pc|s3|nt|arvidsson: that is right since you just loose 1 @S if it is J/Qx|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Drijver did rebid 3N with east hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4-3-3-3 16 only worth slam invitaaton. Usually need partner to have 5 card suit to make slam|pg||
nt|tez: senyörler|pg||
nt|jbennet: i wonder whether 2 d was a bid to show 4sp+longer minor?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told it's 5 @d and a 4 card major, on the nose.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h e kontr der guney|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in 3rd/4th seat -- can have longer @C but not longer @H or @S in 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C can be 5-4 either way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@D 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 55 |pg||
nt|2celik1: muthis bir 4@S kontrati var |pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt dede sorun yok|pg||
nt|2celik1: @D makul,bu da oluyor |pg||

nt|funtay: kadýn milli takýmýmýz 22-8 önde 2. sýrada 1. ile farký kapýyor 3.ile açýyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: @s as ruayý çekip @d empas yapar..sorunsuz|pg||
nt|james_h: I can understand McGanns decision to bid 4@h instead of 3n|pg||
nt|james_h: on board 15|pg||
nt|tez: as yok diye 1 nt açmadý|pg||
pc|dT|nt|geot: How will Nybo play after the @CK? I guess he plays a heart|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|yusufb: bencede|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4-3-3-3 still not slam force|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3@S is by the look of it a minimum hand|pg||
nt|funtay: 6@s için @si dogru yerden çekmeli|pg||
nt|tez: þleme gelmek kolay yapmak zor|pg||
nt|barnets: nothing e/w can do now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Others are saying it's even more specific, 4@s and 5@d.|pg||
nt|barnets: to have a chance  2@S they had to lead a @D and dec woud need to win the A and fin hearts to make it|pg||
nt|jbennet: board 12 both players had to decide what to do after 5 cl and x from p.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Naber opened north hand  1N = 10.5-13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's playing 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone want to bet on either declarer?|pg||
nt|panosk: and no singleton|pg||
nt|arvidsson: E showes his stiff @H and was turned down by W|pg||
nt|rodvenn: a good stop here unless u get a hart lead:)|pg||
nt|james_h: so 4@h looked like the more promising spot|pg||
nt|yusufb: ama 3@c x oynanan elde 5@c denmiþ biraz vericez sermayeden|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|poohbear: and Fisher doesnt even try the 5 level. Good judgement|pg||
nt|panosk: or a club for that matter :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: well is it not always cold?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: as long as you get the @C correct|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta also stopped in 3@s at board 15. But doobled! :)|pg||

nt|yusufb: þimdi |pg||
nt|tez: alacak çünkü @c ten korkuyor|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: if the double on hand 15 showed hearts  could north have passed 3 spades  could 1 club have been a weaker hand?|pg||
nt|tez: önce @c empas atarsa|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: slam needs either 3-3 @cs or dbl finesse in @h|pg||
nt|jbennet: in one room the decision was to close proceedings with 6 d. in the other p was involved in the process. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Now I'm told it's specifically @ss but either minor.  What's next?|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: 1 batarsa ki öyle 1 imp daha alýyoruz|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tez: bu sefer @s i doðru oynayabilir|pg||

pc|h3|nt|geot: He may win 1NT now by ducking the diamond shift that will come after the clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodvenn: as long as the black suits behave, 12 tricks is likely|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|baardolav: yes... ha can actually make to contract now... but no time for testing spade 3-3 before finessing heart|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: heyecanlý el|pg||
nt|tez: yerde 8 olmasa rua çekip 10 luya doðru oynarsýn|pg||
pc|d2|nt|baardolav: Vesace have to play the K of @d |pg||
nt|geot: He can set up hearts after duking the diamond switch. But will he play like that? Depend on diamonds 6-2...rather than try for spades to be 3-3?|pg||

nt|funtay: olmadý:(|pg||
pc|c2|nt|geot: so now he must chose, spade 3-3 or heart finesse|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
