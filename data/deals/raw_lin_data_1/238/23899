nt|mamos: declarer has to make the best oof his Diamonds though defence has a lot of work to do to make 5 tricks as well|pg||
nt|runnerup:  for some reason ns never bid in board 1 -in other room -and so nice 4 counter as south had -4 @s +1 a push :) |pg||
nt|jaapfr: but if @DQ in tr 3 he is down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: 2@C is 98% forcing for most players|pg||

pc|h6|nt|runnerup:  north had sorry|pg||
nt|patricck: technically it loses on this layout, but only if North can duck smoothly wen a low heart is led from dummy|pg||

nt|jaapfr: how can he find @H lead|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If North had ducked, 9 tricks wer possible|pg||

nt|mamos:  although declarer surely likely to play South for @dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N thinking|pg||
nt|mamos:  i dont understand why  South didnt discard Spade to give count|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Would 4 diamonds to the Queen really be your first discard-choice?|pg||
nt|mamos:  no I agree but surely more @d length in South might even imagine 5 wirth @c 4-0|pg||
nt|mamos: this wont make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: In fact, it is hard to bid 3NT, but it makes as EW cannot take both a club and an extra diamond trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but who will lead a @H small in dummy against 6@C?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm |pg||

nt|runnerup:  6 @c looked making -and this -no chance so strange 6nt |pg||
nt|andyv:  that play takes a lot of nerve|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer has to play well to make 5 dia after heart lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzgq: I lost play ù|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its been suggested the 1@S shows 0-3@S and no @H stop, can someone confirm|pg||
nt|skaftij: In OR, 1NT showed 14-16, so impossible for Jonsson-Baldursson to stop short of game|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: a spade switch is more likely|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls check other tables if 6@C was made or down (imo 50% will make it)|pg||

nt|murat e: west following all the way|pg||
nt|murat e: birmans double must have shown him the way|pg||
nt|tweety1: thinking to play @s or @c|pg||

nt|patricck: I would probably make it hard for partner by leading small, but there is a lot to be said for the Q@S|pg||
nt|patricck: on a small spade lead West will want to play AK when East has Jxxx and declarer Qx|pg||
nt|andyv:  on opening lead, small @s (some would play the 10@s to start the unblock) is fine.  Here where you are pretty sure you need to collect 4@s tricks, the Q@s is best|pg||

nt|400 volt: 8-17 hcp in general|pg||
nt|400 volt: obviously east upgraded because he had 6@C and @C 1098 and @S 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: the norsemen in the other room did well for team Monaco|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c finesse was forced.  Declarer needed K@c to be in N hand...otherwise S would get in and push a @h thru before the @d pitch|pg||

nt|400 volt: it's even 2 down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|400 volt: west will soon be surprised that his partner has the @S-suit, 2@D probably asks for the major |pg||

nt|barnets: dec now had entries to cash a top spade then get to dummyw ith club ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  low scoring in most matches over these first few boards - these two teams lead in Group A  but scores are very closely bunched as we  would expect|pg||
nt|patricck: The Hungarian East switched to a small @S on board 5 just the same as this room. I fear that I would have failed the test as well, but I agree leading the Q@S is better|pg||

nt|ady: west can overtake club with the ace   defence may be tested|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, with this dummy, if North has the @C Ace, he can do nothing but play it. |pg||
nt|mamos:  ah   wont East have Spade trick or Spade exit|pg||
nt|ady: as said still only 8 tricks with an end play|pg||
nt|skaftij: 2@s, sry pard for bidding a 4 card suit :-)|pg||
nt|patricck: While declarer can still make on a @C switch it doesn't seem likely he would play for exactly this layout and spurn the 50% chance of a club finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it's more difficult...he needed to lead a @h at trick 2 so that his timing would be better (he could ruff a 3rd @h after only one round of @cs were played to see if suit broke)|pg||
nt|patricck: Still just 1-0 after 6 comparisons, but I think there could be a swing on board 7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos:  oor|pg||
nt|mamos:  Germany picking up imps regularly|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer isn't aware that, with E holding only 2 @cs and the A of @d, his contract is safe if he simply attacks the @h suit.|pg||

nt|skaftij: Presumably, Einarsson thought a 5-2 fit would play better than a potential 4-3 @d fit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|tomi2: a bit lucky that this -4 is a) not doubled and b) 4@S is not making, but it will still be expensive|pg||

nt|petergill: on Bd 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: when I was on board 8 I accidently clicked redeal and this blocks the scoring system|pg||

nt|patricck: oh yes, so he did.... I saw the 3NT bid but it was from EW|pg||
nt|oliverc: This looks like a fairly inevitable 4@S for NS|pg||

nt|snetram: to nie problem systemu, ale licytacji naturalnej|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: szykuje siê strata|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ofcourse he can get 4 @D tricks for his contract if he starts with the @Da|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So they should have doubled 2 @c in Open|pg||
nt|djneill:  Fantunes needs to pick a more intimidating name, it sounds like a music download site|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|farrukh: all he needed was 1 ruff to make, |pg||
nt|arderi:  What would you bid by north?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
nt|barnets: he took a lot of chances there @D fin or south having 3 diamonds or @CA right|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: Russian NS will be very happy to gain 3 imps on Board 14|pg||
nt|djneill:  East may have a major bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  2/1 gf|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dbl if it penalty for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 16+ any|pg||
nt|murat e: for those who forget the links pls go to bbo forthcoming vugraphs click tournement site and find results section there bot previous and running scores are there|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|farrukh: he could play @c from his hand as well instead of @s |pg||
nt|farrukh: But this is the beauty of coffee hands, you take them so casual and go down in baby contracts |pg||
nt|mamos:  ew will get to@d fit now|pg||
nt|mamos:  can ns bid and make slam?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and now i will try for a @S game|pg||
nt|arderi:  or 3NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: how is 4@S save over 3NT?|pg||
nt|djneill:  East plays CRASH so chose not to show the @h|pg||
nt|jbgood: 13 was not a lucky number for Norway - EW ending up in 5@h doubled for a phone number|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the CR|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A bit unlucky that 6 @S is down on this one|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos:  easy 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: ca³kowita zgoda, nie ma o czym mówiæ:) 2@S by³o oczywiste...|pg||
nt|garden2005: tak!|pg||
nt|arderi:  looks like 4@s needs more than 3NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hear the Dutch ladies did give S the 3nt by @S leading (not a Dutch board)|pg||
nt|barnets: playing south for the @DQ loses one of these chances|pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jaapfr: the one S has @CQ9x|pg||
nt|andyv:  S really doesn't have enough to make a slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Next board, pls|pg||
nt|arderi:  3@s now.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true. now punt 3nt|pg||
nt|djneill:  X = Colors, 1@d = Rank, 1N = shape(d) suits|pg||
nt|petergill: 800 on best defence (trump lead) in 4@SX I think|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Finally a small gain for Iceland|pg||
nt|mamos: oooh undo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N passes|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, it is close though isn't it, and he probably wants to generate a swing after just going for 1100 and this being such an important match for them|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT forcing - but Broge may go low since prd surely have something wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: will surely invite slam|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I  think Nybo is showing 3-6 in majors. Now there is probably one invitation for @H and one for @S|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lechcold: 2BA mocne (naci¹gniête troszkê)...3@S = powiedz 3N|pg||
nt|ady: likely 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos:  5@c much better than  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - only 26 HCP...|pg||
mb|p|nt|arderi:  ok|pg||
nt|arderi:  Can NS pass this one :)|pg||
nt|mamos: @cK looks normal|pg||
nt|andyv:  he may be feeling some pressure due to the result on board 13 although that should not have an influence|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: This is for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|arderi:  Nyberg is thinking he has promised much more than he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: I'm sure it doesn't have an influence.... in the Vulcan championships...... but here on Earth sometimes our emotions get the better of us|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...one of Bob Hamman's great strength is he can completely forget the previous board and focus on the board in front of him.  We all try to do that...sometimes we fall short.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway is now 11th - 12 VPs behind Greece in 9th - Greece demolishing Turkey - a big surprice|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Even if Norway qualify to the next step they will not be able to achieve a decent result at the end after three heavy losses against Israel, Germany and Hungary|pg||
nt|jbgood: hope Brogeland will pass - even th as you say Peter, a very good slam|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think he will because he relies on his partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: my granny always said you must play the Ace when there is a singleton K offside|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lechcold: 3@S mog³o zawieraæ te¿ silne rêce (zwykle na m³odszych) z którymi Grzegorz by kontynuowa³ po 3N |pg||

nt|arderi:  and quick claim|pg||

nt|antoniz: tylko -13IMP|pg||
nt|skaftij:  IIn OR, West was tempted to seek slam after South had doubled 2@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: the recent matches against Sweden and Bulgaria will help though, but first goal is to be among the 9 qualifying for the final rounds|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think Nybo should have bid something more forward-going|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos:  THIS has been an excellent German  performance |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na szczesie tylko 13|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 more imps to Israel as they made 1NT in OR on board 14 |pg||
nt|barnets: you see how aggresive e/w are with wests x with only 7 hcp|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos:  very onesided match|pg||
nt|400 volt: north will not take his 8 tricks. He will try to make a @S finesse - the only chance to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nicely predicted|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Maybe because the state of the match he is bidding 5 @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: now they will surely bid it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos:  Israel have a bit of a lead now  19-11vps  they lead group A  by six vps frpom Italy Latvia and Sweden|pg||

nt|skaftij:  West having shown 14-16. @sQ in stead of jack, and the slam is a good one after the double|pg||
nt|mamos: i think West shoul;d be grabbing any trick in sight|pg||
nt|jaapfr: playing 2@C and playe @CT and ducked by S???|pg||

nt|patricck: Slanm can be made if you play spades the right way, but should you really do that even if you know you have no club loser|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tomi2: I think 2@H is @S + any minor, so Rehder expects @D but it might be some great fit, if partner really has clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: E otworzy³ na 10|pg||
nt|jkotor: ciekawe czy E za drugim razem pod³o¿y 10@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for the defense, N needed to hold 3 spades to an honor|pg||
nt|andyv:  then continuous @d taps would set up a 2nd @s trick|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but two tap here leaves no entry to the club suit, so not completely plain sailing either|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hungary did get 12 imps back on board 16 as they played 4@s making 4|pg||
nt|patricck: So as it stands they are losing 19-11 in Victory Points, but they need to do better|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: software is awkward .. changes both names|pg||
nt|andyv:  not that easy although declarer should be able to prevail...remember, the stiff A@c in dummy makes transportation difficult.|pg||

nt|djneill:  North can pitch a discouraging @s|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|arderi:  5@h is down of course with diamond lead, but it is fairly unlikely|pg||
nt|bobholl: and keep their scores |pg||
nt|ahollan1: effectively the end result is 18 team RR -- with top 6 countries qualifying for 2013 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play of K@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: thanks ..glasses is East and declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: Winning the Ace and playing clubs will work out OK here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: fortunate lay for declarer   diamonds 3-3  club ace well played   and only having to lose 1 heart|pg||
nt|bobholl: against the also qualifing teams|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|mamos:  bye everyone|pg||
nt|petergill: West knows N has 4+ cards in @c or @D, makes @DJ look good to me as next play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no Knockout phase in this event|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|djneill:  if needs 2 diamonds, low one might work, but I think needs 3 diamonds, yes?|pg||
nt|petergill: well, yes, unless clubs are very friendly|pg||
nt|djneill:  big club but not friendly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  declarer should prevail here...in OR, N played the 9@s at trick 4 making the task a little easier for E|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  By playing the @D King in the first trick, South gave West "an open book"...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  A really gentleman would claim|pg||

nt|andyv:  same here and thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sleep well|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: if @DKQ is onside, then might have 2 @d entries to dummy - to set up @H's|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s5|mc|11|nt|vugraphzgq: fucik thinks lots on these 2 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: risky opening at 3 level with 6 card suit    have defence with an ace and king   will sometimes go for a number  on a part score hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  right with @d9 offside|pg||
nt|petergill: which is what he seems to have played for|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y you right -3|pg||
nt|patricck: the defences plan here is for North to score the 9@S and Suth to overruff dummy on the diamond exit, but declarer can simply ruff high|pg||

nt|arderi:  I think pre- empting 3@d with East cards could work sometimes, but in the long run it only kills partners faith to your bidding.|pg||

nt|djneill:  1N GF with desire to declare NT, 2@c bal or @c, 2@d relay, 3@c no 4M 5@c|pg||
nt|petergill: this might be exciting in the play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as expected|pg||
nt|jbgood: and as you might have guessed - 2 NT is a good heart support (as most play these days)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: not unreasonable effort by east    partner can go down better than a low singleton diamond|pg||
nt|lechcold: u pañ tymczasem wygl¹da na 10:20 z Austri¹|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and now easy to take the ace and duck @h to west|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|pbmarstr: 4 @S is more or less lay-down, but 5 @C just one down.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|400 volt: let's see if piekarek will make the @S right|pg||

nt|arderi:  Or lets say a diamond|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hmmmm|pg||
nt|arderi:  They have a good chance to keep declarer in 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @S is tough but a @D cpossible i thk|pg||
nt|arderi:  Bridge is easy. Dont give opponents 9th trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it looks pretty standard to be in 3nt here|pg||
nt|mamos: The WElssh NS in the OR have been a little timid in these last few boards seems normal to bid to 3Nt here|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - spade support|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S is a poor contract|pg||
nt|barnets: but on this lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  Another ! - the fastest play|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|400 volt: leading the J of @H indicates a length in @S|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: teraz ju¿ bez 1, Ada nie dostrzeg³ potencjalnej promocji|pg||
nt|arderi:  hmm|pg||
nt|barnets: can be made|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|djneill:  yes 1NT is to declare, without declaring intention would bid 1@h (@s)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes indeed. But as little as 5 @h to the queen and 10 and game is feasible|pg||
nt|pelu:  but N are very but he sh know that S is very weak - 2@C is a opening hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lechcold: zawilimy? czy tylko ja?|pg||
nt|400 volt: that's why he finessed even if he had 9 @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Problems with 4-1 now - or?|pg||
nt|pelu:  N very strong|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland making a lot of borderline pushes that proved wrong|pg||
nt|skaftij:  And staying out of a winning 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu:  and bidding wrong game (B17)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mlodygda83: gdyby wyszed³ w pika w drugiej lewie, to druga wpadkowa, bo 7 karo wziê³aby lewê|pg||
nt|arderi:  Thats why I dont like small spade|pg||
nt|djneill:  helpful lead|pg||
nt|djneill:  does not know @c not breaking, nor @h is onside|pg||
nt|petergill: @D and @S lead was fatal and |pg||
pc|h6|nt|lechcold: tak jest|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: jednak ¿eby to siê uda³o Cezary musia³ miec asa karo i króla pik|pg||
nt|jbgood: good news for N is that declarer didnt play for the magic lay out and went 1 down in the CR|pg||
pc|h8|nt|murat e: declarer can win and duck another heart west reaches east with a spade who plays a club but wests entries are gobe|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ryskiel_: ja nie wiszê, choæ w tym meczu mia³em parê razy ochotê to zrobiæ|pg||

nt|lechcold: Buras ju¿ nie dojdzie do wyrobionego pika|pg||
nt|kamyk: znana triada: wci¹gn¹c, skontrowaæ...:(|pg||
nt|patricck: Declarer needs to guess @H here as a losing heart guess, 3@D and 1 more @S would be down 1|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 imps for Norway|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pg||

nt|roswolf: no|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Squuezed from the @H 10 now|pg||
nt|ady: now down 2     of course natural to take A@H   and diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: @H lead creates squeeze on either N or S, even when @H hook not taken |pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu:  very nice shift to @D from Fantoni|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos:  play has been quite quick here but they are slow in OR|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|patricck: making 2, but still 2 imps to Israel|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|petergill: so the right-siding 1Nt response was a big winner for Fantunes|pg||

mb|1H|nt|lechcold: na razie to ten mecz nam po prostu nie wyszed³ i ju¿|pg||
nt|mamos:  @H game|pg||
nt|ady: they have been up to speed here   18 hands in 2 hours|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy slam - without @d-lead here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And that was EastÂ´s only reson to bid - red against green|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i think he should|pg||
nt|djneill:  but if @d break it meant North led 4th best spade with 5 hearts, odd|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I resist the wish to comment on such a 3 @C - at both tables |pg||
nt|pelu:  a lucky 3Nt need @hs 3-3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most will agree with 4@H bid|pg||
nt|mamos: in OR E competed in  H so harder for NS to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: North would have bid 2@H without the interference, South would have found an easy raise to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: tak, jeden z³y mecz, to jeszcze nie koniec wiata; trzeba o nim szybko zapomniec, odbudowac sie psychicznie, i...|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: 2@s od N by³oby forsuj¹ce|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ic|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lithuania and hungary bid to 7c on this board and went down of course|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|djneill:  oh never mind, had 5 spades|pg||
nt|djneill:  so could be 5431|pg||
nt|petergill: because N lead from Jxxx in @s is dangerous, West thought N probably had @H honour(s), hence play for 3-3 @D not for @H onside?|pg||
nt|ritong: and underled a jack|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ryskiel_: a nie mo¿na odbudowywaæ siê psychicznie po jednym nieudanym rozdaniu? to chyba ³agtwiesze?|pg||
nt|400 volt: a sacrifice for 1100 (down 5) is possible here in 6@S|pg||

mb|4N|nt|vugraphzgq: hmmmm results just disappeared|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm, sad, so the match will be scored 0-0?|pg||
nt|400 volt: but when they didn't enter in the bidding (i really don't know how), they won't find|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  not sure what 3@h is|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hawe45:  we got our 480|pg||
nt|mamos:  not much point bidding them if p's lead @c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Some additional chance if defense does not start in @s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and black aces favourably placed|pg||
nt|pelu:  after @s-start there are 1@S tricks + 8 red tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: bardzo cenne punkty|pg||
nt|djneill:  I know of only one system in the world that actually relays a 6-6 hand, ultimate club or whatever granovetter/rubin play these days|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sure, on this layout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What I meant to say that a 4-2 @h split does not always doom 3 NT !|pg||
nt|bobholl: so it is a manche with 40% chance or so |pg||
nt|bobholl: but NV not enough|pg||
mb|6D|nt|400 volt: but first of all east has to find the @C slam - but he's on the best way|pg||
nt|lechcold: i mo¿e oznaka jakiego prze³omu?|pg||
nt|garden2005: podarunek od Basi :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  yeah at some point, East is going to select one of the red suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing UDCA, NS on Bd 18 both gave true count in @d, but West did not believe them, at this expert level. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kania12: Witam wszystkich|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: but as a pard of mine says 0+POINTS + 6+card suit at these colors|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: kibs suggest that the boards will be played again, but obviously that is not possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - he should have bid @C...|pg||
nt|petergill: If you want to know anything abour Relay Systems, go to Dan Neill's website one day...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: likely 5 ips for Welsh (for being timid:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|400 volt: the other table failed to bid the slam|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@S was RKCB, 5@D showed 2 without the @C Q|pg||
nt|djneill:  oh no!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: they both contributed their smallest @d, not sure it has to do with count|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is the last bd of this match|pg||

nt|jaapfr: tx Liz (order the 4 boys to be once operator this week:) |pg||
mb|3N|nt|djneill:  East has no "both majors weak" option, so just gets out in @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 15 minutes left|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: raczej nie|pg||
nt|roswolf: well slam is on here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it is a very poor slam indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but the norsemen sailed into it with no bother in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: auction + play = 15 seonds other room|pg||
nt|ritong: seconds*|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@d may well be a hear5 raise of some kind|pg||

mb|5C|nt|jkotor: kontra fit = 3@h|pg||
nt|josj: Bergen style?|pg||
nt|pelu:  but the result dont count for Russia if they Qualify - only results agsinst the other 8 teams - and CypÃ¥rus are still last, but very well done|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Mike and kibs for all yr fine comments questions and advises|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 3@C is asking for 5card majors|pg||
nt|400 volt: 3@D denies a 5card major|pg||
nt|murat e: and spade king lead...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that is meant as exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|josj: let's hope so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it is easy to play - West must have King doubleton in @S and @H 3-1 would also give problems|pg||
nt|oliverc: a fairly inevitable 3NT, it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  another suprising contract in other room|pg||
