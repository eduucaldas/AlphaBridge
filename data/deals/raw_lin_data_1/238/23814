mb|p|mb|4C|nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||

nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||

nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||

pc|s3|nt|geot: Here an eventual NT contract will be played by East|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|geot: And South knows what to lead:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Stefanov gonna try for crossruff?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... a heart seem safe even for me... but 7@s it is|pg||
pc|h8|nt|geot: Good contract|pg||
nt|larsarthur: good lead|pg||
nt|geot: and the same contract as at the other table|pg||
nt|arvidsson: one have to decide if partner have good @C +@S there is a choice to play partner for good @D to|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s7|nt|geot: on the heart lead the double squeeze chances are gone, so declarer will go for a diamond ruff.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  can he get back to his hand to play the @cs?|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: @S ruff?|pg||
nt|xenya: to get back to hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: A very good grand slam... need to ruff e diamond before pichting the @h on @c K, |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so much better to be in 6@S even if declarer can guess 13 tricks|pg||
nt|geot: Which probably is the best line in the spade contract anyway|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c7|pc|s9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|arvidsson: the easy layout is that partner have AJ @D + singelton @H|pg||

pc|s5|nt|vugraphzgp: one round of hearts have been played so far|pg||
nt|jbgood: so maybe Norway will get off the schneid now|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 6@D on this hand, but only double dummy. Has to drop the @DK|pg||
nt|geot: Madala did not re-open with a double at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: second trick won by EW so logic tells me a diamond queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: from there on it is quessswork sorry|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually it would have been more interesting to see wheter Aronov would have found the lead against 3 N played by South|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|geot: there they stopped in 5@D, will make 600 or 620|pg||

nt|jbgood: well done to take the 800|pg||
nt|geot: Norway's first IMPs in this match will come here, 5 of them|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|panosk: if you go a 20 hcp game and 5 are useless its not gd news, but i also think many will venture 4@H|pg||
