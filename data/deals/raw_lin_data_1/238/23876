pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller play Tarzan Precision  but they open fewer hands at 1-level than most big clubbers|pg||
nt|pauleger: defending 3@c X you have to switch to a trump early|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@S = relay|pg||

nt|geot: Italy might bid game. North has only 15HCPs but the fifth diamond is good so he may accept an invite.|pg||
nt|star6ija: leading from some of his long suits East will be immediately thrown in with @d Jack...now he has to find @s switch|pg||

nt|gulyas: on very little values|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I like that meaning of the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the range applies to all opening 2-bids  that is why 1N is their 12-14 catchall that includes some odd shapes  [4441, 5422 not @H & @S, etc]|pg||

nt|nilsland:  EW makes 4 @H but would East have bid again over 2@H??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with no competition east's 3@D would be forcing, here the alert was probably that bid is not forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on last board west in open room doubled 2@C and then rebid 2nt only|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe 2NT was for minors even?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this hand in open room north passed and ew are playing 2@H|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@c may have been artificial (it usually is these days), though seems not alerted|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|james_h: When U have the machinery, U got to let the neighbours see it |pg||

nt|geot: I am sure Mc Gann does, I am suprised Berg does not|pg||
nt|james_h: East must have seen West lead directing Dbls on previous oceasions|pg||
nt|geot: What I think is that South was aiming for a 5-4 fit in spades, or else 3NT, but then the double of 3@C came|pg||
nt|geot: and he changed his mind and tried for a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if they find the lead to beat it (as they should, pd must have short @Ds for running)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think much of a stretch to double here|pg||

nt|fluffy: a belgian pair played this as both majors weak, but I Think @h+other is more common|pg||
nt|star6ija: our international youngster Deyan Spasov ensures me that it is a kind of Flanery bid...showing both majors|pg||
nt|baardolav: Both 4@s and 4@h makes... +1 I believe |pg||
nt|geot: Game can be played in either major, np. |pg||
nt|oleberg:  3NT = Preempt in a major|pg||
nt|monde9: when N playing 1 NT made 3 on king of @H lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Cannot remember the diference betweem this and a direct 4@H|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West tempted to pass? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea thinking or BBO is slow ? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: They can read "The Dubliners" during that :) |pg||

nt|james_h: I doubt that will be the case come board 20|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT N/S on a possible @D lead may make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even making four required major help from defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin deems his hand not worth a constructive direct raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@S can make from south hand, with some luck and a spade guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: briçte senyör = 60+ yaþ demektir|pg||
nt|star6ija: sacrifice is good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: but Madala gave up|pg||

nt|blum1956: the vulnerability may prevent EW from the 5th level save|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like declarer must have taken the double finesse in hearts at the other table|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tomi2: NS in 5@Cx on 9, the double will make it easier to win (make overtrick)|pg||
nt|monde9: now that's the time for Konow to hesitate ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they can tell by the mouse clicks. This is standard procedure for vu graph operators. |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ken__: ama bu kadar önde olduklarýný tahmin etmiyorlardýr bence|pg||
nt|geot: If declarer does nothing funny there will be 2 spade losers and a diamond loser|pg||
nt|blum1956: Do Bakshi-Townsend have an agreement against the popular "redouble=bid your auit" convention?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçmesinin sebebi..2@d kontrlu oynamak istemesindendi assaelin|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorulara cevap vereyim|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: line up yazýlýrken  tahmin etmeleri lkazým:)|pg||
nt|geot: He will probably cross to hand with the @HA and take a spade finesse followed by the ace, then play on clubs for +620|pg||
nt|clinch: Pass looks normal here|pg||
nt|clinch: Yep|pg||
nt|baardolav: Aronov will earn one imp on this hand... if NS play diamond and diamond all the time|pg||
nt|baardolav: you need the double finesse for the entry|pg||
nt|geot: not really|pg||
nt|star6ija: the coach Vladislav Ispoeski helped me with explanation of the openning: 54+ in majors (NonVul maybe 4441), VUL usually 55+ 6-10|pg||
nt|oleberg:  5@H is even wrongsided|pg||
nt|solex333: lead directing bid ?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW did not came close to 6@D/@H but suits does not break|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: will they investigate @D slam?|pg||
nt|blum1956: "your suit"|pg||
nt|blum1956: Karpov is accurate|pg||
nt|clinch: Cards don't lie that well even for declarer to make 3|pg||
nt|clinch: Seemed to my (lesser than these guys) eyes to be between a 2 and 3 @h rebid|pg||
nt|monde9: same story as in Open|pg||
nt|oleberg:  In West it takes the lead of a diamond-singleton to defeat|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Virtually impossible to find :)|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @D was alerted :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçeyim..ortak kontr der belki..ben de pas geçerim..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bir oyuncu 60+ yaþýnda ise hem senyör hem açýk takýma katýlma hakkýna sahiptir|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Probably a re-transfer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|geot: but other lines will work as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what inferences are available from Fantoni's sequence  [2@H then 3N  vs  immediate 3N ...]|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably the agreement is that 4th hand passes first with good hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tez: ters taraftan oynuyorlar ama @c atak edilmez heralde|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise Townsend's first pass looks strange|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt 2@C was some form of gazilli|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: 5@H needs 3 rnds of @Ds to beat it|pg||
nt|kamyk: uparty ten W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess -- Fantoni was showing hand that hoped for reopening DBL|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lead so long as they collect the 2@c b4 S gets rid of one|pg||
pc|d7|nt|blum1956: His hand deserves a 3@h bid if it is nonforcing. Still it could force according to their agreement|pg||

nt|geot: that is why the first suggested line is better, I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: bu günün son eli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west hand automatic opener for most big clubbers -- not sure if deWijs will open 1N [good 12-15]|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@d is 4+ diamonds unbalanced|pg||
nt|begse: tek karo|pg||
nt|monde9: a lightner here for -1 X in N in TOR|pg||
mb|1D|nt|clinch: X=majors|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gulyas: it was the lucky 1nt opening - if it went 1@C-1@H overcall, they would never have gotten to this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Fantoni's DBL = same HCP as opener|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a fairly routine 3NT E/W ..|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score on board 7 is still wrong|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@H is down on a diamond lead - as 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club towards the jack|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South would like to X here - but it may show a hand with 4+@S|pg||
nt|monde9: 6 @S is the normal & good contract|pg||
nt|monde9: for N-S|pg||
mb|d|nt|ken__: Batman Briç Kulübü tüm takýmlara baþarýlar diliyor|pg||
nt|ken__: Batman Briç Kulübü tüm takýmlara baþarýlar diliyor|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and welcome!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: but Muller treating the DBL as artificial rather than Penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||
nt|oleberg:  This might end with 6@S in south|pg||
nt|ritong: if you did so, id a free shot for me:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzeq: 6@s gelinmesi zor fakat yapýlabiliyor|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ok board 7 finally correct|pg||
nt|ritong: really saying " you won t toy with me lorenzo"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see any reason to bid with fredin's hand|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@s probably preemptive, as X mainly disruptive|pg||
nt|baardolav: here... coffee I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|eyamut: sabah mý?|pg||
nt|blum1956: the rest is simple|pg||
nt|james_h: throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|nilsland:  surprisingly - but RD showed a good hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And Lauria is hoping for a club lead|pg||
nt|monde9: :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Where an underlead of clubs is needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he expects the contract to be cold|pg||
nt|clinch: Well it's obviously preemptive... I mean by agreement|pg||
nt|monde9: same 200 but different contracts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the formula is 3sn+1|pg||
nt|ritong: 2sn+1*|pg||
nt|ritong: ty ty|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemos double is a little aggressive but makes life easy|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn knows that Lauria is prepared for a club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate " my @hs are fine"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble=max hand probably|pg||
nt|ritong: has he?|pg||
nt|geot: this will not be any swing, standard 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible to go down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|caruse57: Bu turnuvanýn hazýrlanmasýnda ve vugrap'da yayýnlamasý için ugraþýlarýný esirgemiyen Sayýn Erdoðan ÖZBEY arkadaþýmýza.Modern Briç Kulubu oyuncularý adýna teþekkür ederim|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South is playing 2NT with a heart lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not in my book|pg||
nt|fluffy: another flat board I'd say|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea has "some" temperamant" :)|pg||
nt|monde9: teperament |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Tea-apartment? :)|pg||
nt|solex333: unlucky 6 @d, but prob 5 @d will lead to 5/6 @s|pg||
nt|monde9: Bogdan Marina in N seems more cool to me :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|james_h: 2@c is probably a version of Drury showing 3 card fir|pg||
nt|geot: I think on board 10, the 3@S, it was something to be said for playing the Ace of trumps first. That is if East had KJ doubleton. So playing the ace and later play as he did was ...|pg||
nt|geot: acdtually ok|pg||
nt|james_h: fit|pg||
nt|james_h: 2s = min|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3@d = 4+ @c I am told|pg||
nt|psyck: so E shows his suits by not bidding them|pg||
nt|clinch: Might have been clobbered if N only had 4 @s|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting use of 4C as a kind of leaping michaels, kibitzers will no doubt say standard in France but new to me|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1S shows @D i assume - 2@s anyone know what that means ?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@d pretty comfortable losing 3 red tricks in all likelihood|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: i blame it on the defenseless 3@S bid :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: when did that bid promise any defenses?:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: I first played against Tiit Laanemae in... probably 1979. |pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: defenseless bids cause opponents to overbid|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, this may make|pg||
nt|geot: Some will maybe consider 3NT as South. Bad contract, but would make |pg||
nt|monde9: Rotaru X the 6 @S for @D leading in TOR|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzeq: akþam pardon|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no bonus points for being in 5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: N needs to cash his @HQ to beat it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: its true that his black suit holdings are not very promising|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: after 2@h 3@H by w|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: if pd has a @C honor, and only one @H honor, @HQ could be fatal|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: i speak about led|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he has closed the screen and asked if 3@c was forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||
nt|gulyas: but its attitude as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he cannot have Axxx|pg||
nt|gulyas: for convention cards: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=Italy&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5C2012Dubli...|pg||

nt|nilsland:  this will be good for sweden - on  11 as expected we lost 6 imps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|geot: the 4@S I mean, reached and won by both teams|pg||
nt|baardolav: and here same number of tricks all over|pg||
nt|oleberg:  6@D is an ok spot|pg||
nt|ritong: he has the entries for the standard trump handling|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helness looks like a man that makes it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|james_h: well denies a major anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D explained as 18-19 bal - hard to overhear, but I think 2@s was explained as denying major|pg||
nt|tez: güney dengeli 16 puanla 1 saniye düþünmedi pas geçmek için|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: this trump position starts with @hAQ to pin singleton @h10/J on East|pg||

nt|mcphee: good start|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: he got it|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|james_h: I expect Ur right given the 2@d responce|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyircilerimiz 7@d bordunu soruyorlar. o elin skoru muhtemelen maçtan sonra netleþir ve skor tabelasýnda görürüz|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||

nt|MolvaM: þimdi hakem kararýný bildirecek sanýrým|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will he play a low diamond now?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|monde9: yes, it is a enough good spot, obviously|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So even though 6@S is better, its a good effort to land in a sensible contract, when the opponents has preempted|pg||

mb|d|nt|james_h: good judgement on the 3@h by NS in the open room|pg||
nt|fluffy: after board 9, Bulgaria had regained the lead on group A, just 1 VP ahead of Italy|pg||
nt|mcphee: helgemo, no fear pard we have em now|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think daddy bessis loves it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  They certainly has to improve their declarer play - or go to the bank|pg||
mb|4D|nt|geot: Tough 3@S bid from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at other table nystrom doubled 2@H, a move i think should show a better overall hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: and North bids 3NT on the stiff king over his partner's t/o double|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that versace does not wander in doubling 2@h|pg||
nt|monde9: better lead : @H |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We go for crossruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: this isn't over yet:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: we are not sure which side will go for the cross ruff yet|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Geir know that Tor will lead a trump if he has one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: All fine about the spades, but 3NT does not work very well anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C artificial game force, not sure about the rest|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No slam possible here.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and whats the TD verdict pls operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: still no ruling on board 3|pg||
nt|monde9: like that S can take the hand on the Jack of @C to give the ruff in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: it maybe helped by the EW action|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: declarer will want to draw trumps may just cash the K+A and then play on D which works on all 3/2 splits.  If the trumps 4/1 though ...|pg||

nt|blum1956: 3@c from Townsend first suggested by the viewgraph could have created a problem for EW |pg||

pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: i always thought lebensohl was backwards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you drinking sparkling grapfruit?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  seems operator have enough to do :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- let's play this again|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room as well in 3nt E, also medium club lead and 8 from north|pg||
nt|tomi2: let's see how Piekarek plays this|pg||
nt|psyck: should be interesting, a chance for Germany to catch up|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, versace is a superactive bidder|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
nt|baardolav: but then aronov could have played clubs|pg||
nt|monde9: more than 20 IMP's than France :)|pg||
nt|solex333: vp's|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea did it :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Half time just announced in playing area|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are the best team in my opinon|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: Gromov is an extremely fast player, Dubinin being no faster then average |pg||
nt|monde9: & I said he's a very good dec :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|james_h: Monaco|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|geot: Italy favourites of course, then the World Champs the Netherlands|pg||
nt|james_h: y, throw Poland into the mix also|pg||
nt|geot: But I think Monaco has a chance|pg||
nt|geot: Polan is always in such a mix|pg||
nt|james_h: only 17 imps on that hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh big swing - played from the other hand and teh S lead gave declarer more options, went -2|pg||
nt|clinch: That's a pretty dire opening bid|pg||

nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
nt|mcphee: so the bar is open?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  I am not sure they can bid either :P|pg||
nt|ritong: making friends is your strong points, true?|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
nt|clinch: Taking vulnerability into account|pg||
nt|baardolav: A new 4nt from OR|pg||
nt|baardolav: where 6@s can be made...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
mb|d|nt|tomi2: in his room south did not overcall since he bid 1@H himself, so he does not know the @H layout|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not really hehe|pg||
nt|baardolav: both black small slams and 6nt is makeable|pg||
nt|geot: Friendly clubs makes both 6@S and 6NT makeable. Have to solve the spades though|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6 @s needs very unusual treatment of trumps|pg||
nt|geot: You have to bring in the spades in NT as well|pg||
nt|monde9: the finesse in @H was protecting the @C in the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||
nt|james_h: 3@h is a balanced slam try (I think)|pg||
nt|ritong: oohh|pg||
nt|baardolav: it is no help making the @c tricks in 6nt... before you play spade|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: now looks like on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Forrester must know that Gold is weak, and one assumes that must mean he has 5 @d at least. I'm just guessing this, but it's logical to me|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d @h ataðýndan sonra batýyor(muþ)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: double club have single spade...|pg||
nt|mcphee: make a lot of @S here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  That why they are playing so quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@C game force, 3@C relay, not sure about 3@D|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah apparently 1@d showed 5@d; thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: dont know if it will make any difference tho|pg||
nt|geot: Unusual to let E/W play 3@C I think|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel are a tough outfit, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
pc|hK|nt|blum1956: Not enough from Karpov's point of view, needs some extra values (few)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
nt|baardolav: true|pg||
nt|baardolav: sorry private|pg||
nt|monde9: it was not a big risk of ruff in @S with the lead of @D|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
nt|baardolav: Even if you miss the spade play in 4@s here... I think Bulgaria make +1 imp|pg||
nt|fluffy: this lead ensures the 2 spade tricks fron south :)|pg||
nt|geot: At this moment Israel leads the group. But it is 237 237 236 236|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1NT would have been better this time|pg||
nt|mcphee: difficult to pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe some S hands will act over 1N|pg||
nt|mcphee: no fun defending NT with S hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now cue bids (this partnership's favorite action)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In many systems East will be able to show short diamonds which would cool off West|pg||
nt|ritong: @s lead looks very possible after this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so they better stop lower than 6|pg||
nt|tez: þu direktör onlarýn aleyhine olcaksa.kararý bildirseydi..iyi olacaktý|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nilsland:  At the other table it started 1N-3@D showing 4441 with a singleton minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that a whole lot better|pg||
nt|clinch: This looks to be on the @h guess; won't be much of a guess after Forrester turns up with AQ of trumps and a @d honour|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at least we know that they probably know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think they play turbo on this auction|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: perhaps E was a bit conservative|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or not|pg||
nt|ritong: i t would match  now, i m told they do play turbo, but restricted to minor fits|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: as expected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  easy lead from the sequence :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|clinch: Will have to play a @h early now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|geot: Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey|pg||
pc|s9|nt|geot: Myself I do not like 3@S the first time unless it is agreed to show some cards|pg||
nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa will return @h after winning @d, maybe Piekarek will have an idea then|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe it will be too late then, he is still thinking how to play the @D|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, too difficult a hand, even when looking at all cards :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yapmak içen @cQ yerini bilmesi gerekiyordu|pg||

pc|h3|nt|james_h: I have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|clinch: As otherwise Forrester will get a @c ruff|pg||
nt|monde9: -1|pg||
nt|monde9: for 6 IMP's|pg||
nt|solex333: ok if k of h offside, a of @c onside and spades 4-1 or spades to dummy return spade and east ruff with 2 @s. but|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|geot: but I dont think it can be right to let opps play 3@C on Souths hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: they move to the next board I guess|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: Muller will think again -- but it is too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes as dummy takes out a magazine to read|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Italy, Monaco or Ireland??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running score linkleri þu adreste|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I do not say that 1N is always making - but passing may still be good in the long run|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: that was  said, lemme see....21 lines ago|pg||
nt|ritong: but great minds drink alike:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS convention card only talks about DBL over 1N=10-12  and  1N=strong|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: Ireland got a grip on this now, and fully deserved. they have not done anything wrong, and Norway has got a few hands where I do not really recognise my good friends to be honest|pg||

mb|2S|nt|gulyas: 1 lvl higher here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was definitely operating on this hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes only a couple of hands had some potential, maybe we will end with a bang with some fancy hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D would show 5 cards for me|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think FF use support doubles|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though EW have game on here, but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|star6ija: now 4 @ss|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s might make ona non diamond lead, not very likelly o this table|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s makes with diamond too?|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry, on diamond pushes you can discard all hearts from dummy, so 4@s still makes|pg||
nt|star6ija: Aronov knows Stefanov has singleton @d|pg||
nt|geot: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: This might be a pick up for Norway|pg||
nt|gulyas: no dbl, no trouble:)|pg||

nt|monde9: always -1 |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|geot: that is how it is, and it will be 10 IMPs whether he gets 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|clinch: On that leadd, though....|pg||

pc|h3|nt|pauleger: lauria will take his 10 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|ritong: sigh|pg||
nt|ritong: traitor!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now lauria will bid 6 based on those clubs, i think|pg||
nt|mcphee: west might well have dbled|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kdr_fm: losing 2@h, one @C ruff and the @SA, no guess unless N underleads the @S now|pg||
nt|monde9: maybe -2 some days :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nilsland:  It has come down to Lauria vs Upmark. Make you bets!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he only has 10 top tricks, so play is very complicated|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs to strip E of his @d s  then throw him in|pg||
nt|clinch: Also needed to play two trumps as now W can trump third @c|pg||
nt|clinch: Perhaps too double-dummy|pg||
nt|clinch: Of course E may think his partner has J @c|pg||
nt|clinch: So defence is not clear|pg||
nt|clinch: If W has QJ10 of @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: will not be right to play a third one|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|blum1956: The declarer needs not to discard a diamond but he cannot be sure |pg||
nt|nilsland:  same lead|pg||
nt|ritong: my crystalball is broken  i ll abstain:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4c,3d,3s note clubs not running|pg||
nt|mcphee: not going to see it being redbled|pg||
pc|c2|nt|baldfriede: percentage play in @s wrong this time, but that's why it is percentage only|pg||
nt|geot: Bulgaria in 3NT at the other table and win 600, and this table N/S do not take a bid at all. Very unusal against Italy|pg||
nt|geot: The opening was creating it, because who of N or S should bid?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 10 I belive  if Aronov maake -3 11 if -2|pg||
nt|tax456: ok. ma su 60 mani il carry over conta il 10%|pg||

nt|ritong: i guess lauria is already thinking something gross in italian:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or a double squeeze, but of course nothing works on actual hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so laurias line may not have been wrong, just unsuccesful|pg||
nt|clinch: Terribly tough to defend... sometimes double-dummy declrer play not necessary|pg||
nt|monde9: 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: some kind of come back for Norway in this match, and there are still 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|1S|nt|geot: min NT again|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they reversed this board in their haste - Mesbur is actually N for this hand|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2 chances left for some more action|pg||
nt|henryb:  except playing a heart to the ten after two rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bbo ile anlaþmamýza göre türkiyenin vugraf maçlarýnda kapalý oda yorumu türkçe yapýlacak þekilde|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @S seems so cool but I saw that "major accident" happens sometimes|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, it could be missed on a (very) bad day|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||
nt|psyck: this is not easy|pg||
nt|pauleger: lauria will pass I think|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baardolav: Very tight and nice match... |pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||
nt|psyck: pass may work as 4@h may go down|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden in 7 here - without success|pg||
nt|baardolav: 33 33... 3@h non vul preemtive style|pg||
nt|geot: I wonder how the weak 3@H bid is defined, if he may have something like KQ or AQ to six|pg||
nt|geot: or if that is too strong|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double ask if Bocchi have max|pg||
nt|oleberg:  My guess is, it would be bid 95% of the time (more or less)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, computer died for a while!|pg||
nt|clinch: Gold finally has a hand we'd all open|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iþte hizmet :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: With maximal hand they open 2@c instead of 1@d|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would have guessed @D wrong:(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gulyas: I hope we will not be playing that nice fit...|pg||
nt|gulyas: if Madala tries 3@D now, it would be the Italians for a change who declare the same contract in both rooms:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, we'd have opened his 21-count of course|pg||
nt|geot: Madala can not see many losers, but he will pass 4@H i think|pg||
nt|monde9: & the finishing match sometimes are tough :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: well 4@h can make too i suppose, esp as bidding marks cards|pg||
nt|psyck: making some endplay on North possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant nothing works after the heart pitch, we could all see how to make it|pg||
nt|baardolav: Madala scans the records... and try to estimate if Bocchi can have 2 hounours in @h now...|pg||
nt|geot: He goes on in the hope that the heart suit is stronger|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching anything but a heart on the third club gives up on various other chances|pg||
nt|clinch: on last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  But maybe playing a heart before playing the third club preserves some chances|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe 5@H could have been an alternative?|pg||
nt|monde9: now plus 1 costs some points |pg||
pc|hT|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mcphee: @D lead best|pg||
nt|psyck: best would be to set up a @d ruff here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South opened 1@C and thus was favourite to hold the @DK - so a little bit unlucky for sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room south opened so the grand odds were different than at this table, ie a bit unlucky the diamond king offside|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not an unreasonable double. The opponents hands fit miracolously|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: y, but not exactly a claimer:)|pg||

nt|geot: On a diamond lead declarer must fly ace and cash three rounds of clubs to win|pg||

pc|cK|nt|geot: South opened in this room with 8HCP, mini NT. In the other room North opened the bidding in third seat with 9HCPs :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|gulyas: he may still go down if S, upon winning the @HK, plays the @DQ for N to discard his @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs to play 2 rnds of @Hs eventually to ruff the 3rd|pg||
nt|gulyas: so either @HA-Q, or just Q, S wins and plays the @DQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is no duck N has a certain @s entry ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d switch will make it very tough|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Henry -- how about  in competition for average net worth?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|psyck: France is precariously placed after this round, but their opponents get easier final two rounds & so they have a good chance to qualify|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the match   round 5 begins in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|mcphee: a pretty entertaining set of cards|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal.  Nice job by our operator A Considine.  Thanks to my co-commentators Paul Orth, Thomas Gotard, & Dirk Schroeder and to the kibitzers for joining us here & for their ...|pg||
nt|psyck: inputs.|pg||
nt|tomi2: last board here|pg||
nt|pauleger: and to you, Krishna :)|pg||
nt|clinch: So last board of thday coming up|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu maçtaki son ele geldik|pg||
nt|baardolav: Last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Last board.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The double gained a trick :)|pg||
nt|monde9: Players are tired after all that boards |pg||
nt|mcphee: e/w hold the record for 3 down in one set:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: last hand now, thanks everybody, restart in about 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|baardolav: 140 ew par score... |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcphee: england gains lead in B I think if they push this one|pg||
nt|oleberg:  They virtually had a day off yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
nt|tomi2: cards could not be friendlier, I think 6@H could make if they bid it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden EW stopped in 3@S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: yorumlarýyla bizi aydýnlatan nafiz zorlu, tezcan þen, yusuf sohtorik e çok teþekkürler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bizi izleyen siz sevgili seyircilerimize de çok teþekkürler|pg||
nt|oleberg:  1nt = 12-15|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yusufb: selamm levent bolþanss|pg||
nt|star6ija: non-forcing|pg||
nt|monde9: 3 NT on South ? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SK doubleton onside, clubs 4-4, hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|psyck: see, i told you cards will slowly get exciting towards the end :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S = any shortnes, weak or strong|pg||
nt|ozgull: önemli maçlarýmýzdan biri üstgruba skorumuz taþýnacaðý için kazanmak önemli umarýmson bord birþey olmaz 18 çok iyi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iyi oynayan millilerimize de|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks to our excellent operator MArtin|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: 2@s=any spl 5-8 or 12-14|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: their notes say 4m = minor void|pg||
nt|tomi2: so I would think this bid would show @C void and no @D void in north|pg||
nt|pauleger: S won´t believe the @c void :)|pg||
nt|clinch: It's been good bridge, I think - not obviously swingy hands, but England have handled them very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
nt|clinch: To hold France to less than 2 IMPs per board is very well done|pg||
nt|tez: 2d yý 18 19 dengeli oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet cýkacak olan takýmlardan alýnan puanlar onemli 18 iyi skor|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fitting reply from partner|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3-3-2-5 not so fitting|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not doubled any of those occasions|pg||
mb|2S!|an|not forcing|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: but they have sequences where "first step = high shortnes, 2nd step = lowest shortnes" could apply. Hope they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|nemeo: sorry sorry private :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The only way not to be in a 8-card fit|pg||
nt|monde9: a X from Coldea ? |pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 dwn is likely here |pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@c X is -200|pg||
nt|nemeo: a me questa foto piace molto di più, l'altra molto meno (diciamo che qui mi riconosco mentre nell'altra ho la solita faccia di quando devo sorridere per forza), mi chiedevo solo ...|pg||
nt|nemeo: quale può andare meglio per lo scopo che interessa...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Par score is 140 EW|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s|pg||
nt|baardolav: The result from OR|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, getting out of 1nt is going to be fine|pg||
nt|monde9: His temperament was calm than :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  X would probably have been take-out|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thank you|pg||
nt|ozgull: herkese iyi günler iyidilekleriniz  bizle olsun|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bugün baþka maç yok|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt oluyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, this is what the notes say: If OPENER bids 2M over 2M-1, RESP can continue with 2NT asking, showing a side suit or  a splinter.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs would copy that bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4 card @S invite|pg||
pc|s9|nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S is plain and simple an overbid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýnki 3 maçtan hangisinin yayýnlanacaðý akþam belli oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: @c dam 3lü|pg||
nt|geot: Noone will double 4@C here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
nt|baardolav: Now probably Italy will win with 1 imp...|pg||
nt|star6ija: or with 7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|clinch: Good lead; makes 4 on a @s lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bana iletiliyor ve ben de TBF web sayfasýnda yayýnlanmasý için bildiriyorum|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3NT is defined as @S void, so 4@C could be @D void and 4@D club void|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they knew what they were doing anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: everybody knows the situation holding 2 aces against a bid slam :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: most of the time it is bad to lead one of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: N and E are sitting on the same screen side, so if N thinks his bidding shows @D void he will tell this to Lauria|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|clinch: Less than 1 IMP per board of course|pg||
nt|tez: diðer masada 1 nt oynanýyor|pg||
nt|baardolav: Can be 2 down... |pg||
nt|geot: He is more likely to go 2 down than winning this|pg||
nt|mcphee: or weakish?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: versace has the worst possible diamond holding after the double|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and 3@S prob making in other room will be 8 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|star6ija: right|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Declarer doesn't really want to play any suits|pg||
nt|monde9: it's depending on agreements|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a problem if the opening lead was on the other side and south would explain "i dont know what this shows"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks for watching|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
pc|dK|nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani www.tbricfed.org.tr adresini takip ediniz|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: so this will decide the match. 9 tricks = Italy wins, 8 tricks= BUL wins|pg||
nt|star6ija: but this is still 15-15|pg||
nt|geot: I put my money on Bulgaria here|pg||
nt|baardolav: If Bocchi start with AK heart... and heart for ruff... it is easy for stefanov to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|geot: it will likely be 15-15 anyway, but the imps:)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @D jack shows @d ratherthan @h|pg||
nt|szeryf: Muller spasowa³ z rêk¹ S na otwarciu! graj¹ 1 kiera|pg||
nt|star6ija: @S Jack|pg||
nt|baardolav: I think bocchi start with @d 8|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, if we could bet, I'd bet you a beer their agreement is take-out|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcphee: thats what I like to use,|pg||
nt|mcphee: it works well|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|yusufb: cok sanslý 3nt @h AKQ sýrtta J kurtuluyor @c dede QXX empasta|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mcphee: i had a few specs suggest @D was best|pg||
nt|mcphee: by golly he is going to make 3 I think|pg||
nt|nilsland:  @H to J and @D now?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|geot: I do not think the defence should take the diamond ruff, then nine tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who were asking -- this is why Fantoni didn't need to continue @C immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- if Nunes original trump was @D9xx  then    oops|pg||
nt|jkotor: ruff high, play low @d, and makes|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is making now I think - the defence dont have the 2nd @d trick|pg||
nt|tez: son bord kazasýz|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D showed @Hs, was not alerted by the operator|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hepinize çok çok teþekkür|pg||
nt|begse: çok iyi bu sonuçta elinize saglýk arkadaslar|pg||
nt|tez: bakarsýn @c empas atar imp kazanýrýz|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
nt|clinch: So this looks to be a flat board... thanks everyone for bearing with me - see you tomorrow!|pg||
nt|geot: easy way is to take the diamond ruff for one down|pg||
nt|geot: He must NOT take the ace and switch to a heart|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck: anything that could work, works, @s Kx, @h22, @c44, etc.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|blum1956: That was the last board of the set. Thanks all, the spectators and the vugraph operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thank you Michael|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well either way thats a swing to sweden|pg||
nt|psyck: bye folks|pg||
nt|pauleger: bye all|pg||
nt|sastro: wünsche noch guten Abend|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|blum1956: unfortunately this misguess ended up his chances|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Looks like declarer will get two more tricks, for a 3 imp gain|pg||
nt|monde9: not now|pg||
nt|monde9: no gain here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: oh right -- no extra @C for trump promotion|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|mcphee: a good set from Estonia|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks for watching|pg||
nt|blum1956: Well, this was the last board of the set. Thank you, Bob. Thanks to the spectators as well.|pg||
nt|blum1956: The 3rd match of the day for Russia will be the Netherlands, we may observe it here in BBO|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bye all|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jkotor: sorry, wanted priv to Al... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm going to blame  local time of 04:37|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set in about 50 minutes  --   try not to wake me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores get posted under  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|s7|nt|geot: Declarer will have no real problems here, whatever he does. Push. See you all :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: özellikle bize ýþýk tutan yorumcularýmýza|pg||
nt|baardolav: made it the safe way|pg||
nt|geot: may still go wrong for two down|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: claim is for just making.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: match over thanks all|pg||
