nt|santyclz: Good morning folks.  Looks as if we're getting underway.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Aha!  This looks like the same board being played in the other room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: will enter contract after play finishes ...we had wrong names b4|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all for this interesting match |pg||
mb|2C|mb|3H|nt|desinka: In this hand, 4@S will be not the final contract, i think|pg||
nt|desinka: but lets see the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 1st hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s likelyto play 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D transfer response showing hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: this not the correct bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in Open room|pg||
nt|barnets: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: but contract is written 3@H on bocchis record|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if e-w are limited to 2@hs if the defense gets all its tricks.|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure you can even make 1@H its close|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|desinka: now 2@S|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi all|pg||

pc|h2|nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: request for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|tez: @h atak edebilir zorlu|pg||
nt|tez: yerde tek ya da þigan @h var..konuþmalardan biliniyor|pg||

nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
pc|d2|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: iddialý atak ediyorlar..eðer en küçüðüyse|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barnets: may be able to beat 2@H now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|star6ija: yes...this way avoiding trump queen guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||

nt|barnets: down 1 only in open|pg||
mb|1S|nt|poohbear: 6 imps for Bulgaria for the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the play would have been interesting|pg||
nt|geot: to take 2 down I mean|pg||
nt|santyclz: So 1st blood to Italy for going down 1 fewer trick.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||
nt|ady: so in fact 6 imps to Bulgaria   Hanlon played 10@S  in the end game  ttrying to give impresion of Q10 left I would think|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: and another Bulgarian pair in the OR, whose agressive style misleaded Swedes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is very aggressive|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mihov has taken good decision in the OR|pg||
nt|desinka: this one looks like flat to me...|pg||
nt|james_h: tough position for NS here|pg||
nt|funtay: 12 ile açmadý Nafiz abi|pg||

nt|funtay: 4-4 major ile açardým, siz?|pg||

nt|yusufb: 4-3 e 4@s iyi kontrat ama bulmak zor|pg||
nt|tez: nafiz abi diyor ki @h asýyla al küçük @d yý oyna..batýr bakalým:)|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be a flat board probably in all matches|pg||
mb|4S|nt|james_h: I like Fantunes defence to Multi ... X shows @h|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have 3NT   with their 28 hcp   not in the bidding yest|pg||
nt|james_h: it counters this situation here|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Shwartz did here|pg||

mb|p|nt|yusufb: 2@d tek renkli major eli|pg||
nt|ady: south should certainly have taken some action first round|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon did well to recover|pg||
nt|ady: North has taken a gamble balancing at that level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 top tricks playing their 5-5 fit in 3nt, but  it's not likely...|pg||

nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in trouble now if south re-doubles|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
pc|s9|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: in the unlikely event e/w reach the 5 level South needs to unblock his @HK under the Ace later in hand to avoid endplay|pg||

nt|james_h: + 1 I expect|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: @s  ataðýna hemen karar vermek zorunda kalacak|pg||

pc|h8|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive he need some sort of endplay if defence is correct|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|barnets: good pass by south|pg||
pc|s3|nt|geot: If he goes down, which not at all is unlikely now, he will really regret not trying the spade 8 in the first trick.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: chatting 0 the old rule of eleven|pg||

nt|oleberg:  But if he keeps 3 diamonds, two hearts and two spades, it will be down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@dX was played in OR for -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N opened 1@h and E was able to bid @s and then double @ds for further takeout.  W was only too happy to leave it in.|pg||
nt|geot: On a club switch from West instead of that 1H10, declarer can still win|pg||

nt|barnets: in the closed room perhaps n/s were lucky to avoid a X|pg||
pc|d8|nt|geot: will in that case depend on East holding the Q of hearts|pg||
