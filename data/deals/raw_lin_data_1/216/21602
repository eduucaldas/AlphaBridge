mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe not totally trivial, since W is aceless and E has close to minimum possible trump holding|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: didnt mean to say "trump holding", meant club holding|pg||

nt|marlowepi: E should like his hand for clubs despite only doubleton. his "in & out valuation" (a concept from the great Jeff Rubens classic "Secrets of Winning Bridge") is as good as it gets|pg||

nt|roswolf: but i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||

nt|vugraphzvw: they have managed to play this back to front... so TF is DG for this board and vice versa|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: fair comment marshall but irish eyes are still smiling|pg||
