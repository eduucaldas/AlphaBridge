mb|2D!|nt|athene: i don't think four hearts are a bar to opening a weak-2@D|pg||

nt|athene: my guess is it was the latter, especially knowing who south is|pg||

nt|athene: but 6@D tick looks pretty good to me|pg||

nt|athene: no, it's just a major one-suiter|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: 2@H is showing hearts after the double - no need for it to be pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north has redouble for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: was there any reason for S to double 2 @S? |pg||
nt|athene: maybe east's 2@S was precipitous|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: the way the bidding had gone it was quite likely south actually had spades and the hand was a big misfit|pg||
nt|athene: so NS could be in trouble|pg||
nt|athene: but at these colours i guess there is less incentive to fiddle around trying to catch people speeding|pg||

nt|athene: the double of 2@D actually helped NS|pg||

nt|athene: if west had passed then it might have gone 2@H (P/C) - 2@S from south|pg||

pc|s5|nt|penseur9:  I think the most expensive at 3000 pounds|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: if you have an unbalanced hand (i.e. a singleton) and opps are in 1NT, you better be prepared for partner to lead your singleton|pg||

nt|viren169: How many would open 1@S or Pass or 2@S?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S 1NT 2@H would have made more sense|pg||

nt|athene: 12 count with 4 spades|pg||
