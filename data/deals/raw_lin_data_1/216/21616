pc|d2|nt|psridhar: will net down 3 on @c lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: now-after the @d lead it is going to be difficult to achieve down 1 even-South has to convince his pd to give him a @c ruff |pg||

nt|psridhar: if he had sacrifice in mind all he needed to do was to bid 4@C over 3@d and leave it to opener|pg||
nt|psridhar: he masterminded a pass and now in blind guessing situation|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Let's stress that no-one can make 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4:20 am, late|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: this is common among many players - instead of providing info to pd and let the strong hand/opener decide, mastermind a save all by your own|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|oosmanb: RV might compete now, with 2NT if its to play|pg||

nt|petka: I disagree with souths second pass here. A 1S spade bid looks prudent. Takeout double is probably not so clever with passed partner, since the board belongs to opps very often|pg||

nt|psridhar: with 2 red suit tricks, Def need to find 4 trump tricks to beat-@d ruffs offer scope|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 3@C was accepting the trf and confirming @DK|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is also a sound idea -shorten decl...but may not work here|pg||
nt|petka: West also had an intersting situation. Many top pairs play that X here shows spades, and 1S is takeout without spades. Others reverse the meaning of these bids.|pg||
nt|petka: If you play that 1S over 1H promises 5+cards, then you have a real problem with bal/sbal hands with 8+HCP but no 4card spade suit and no heart stopper|pg||
nt|psridhar: true-thats waht makes this game interesting -no perfect solution to most problems|pg||
nt|psridhar: several possibilities,make your pick based on odds / experience|pg||
