nt|vugraphzwd: North-South are experienced and have won the Lady Milne playing together|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on a @d lead declarer can play 3 rounds of  to discard the @d|pg||
nt|copeyj: Good morning bridge players|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|copeyj: Good morning Peter|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h9|pc|d8|nt|pitiful:  4@h a little cautious for me|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|mc|12|nt|pitiful:  North might have had one less @d and one more @c|pg||
pg||

nt|pitiful:  grand slam now|pg||
nt|copeyj: As you can see I am in one of those moods :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not a slow start|pg||
nt|pitiful:  aren't you always like this Simon?|pg||
nt|copeyj: See if E makes it harder for them by opening with a weak 2 in @S or similar|pg||
nt|pitiful:  east may well pre-empt here|pg||
nt|copeyj: Uncontested it really should be not too tricky|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  north might splinter here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  then south will just be fishing around for the grand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  maybe 4N followed by 6@d is a possible way to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Plunging, not fishing|pg||
nt|copeyj: North is on the cusp for being too strong for a splinter for many pairs - many people play it as about 8-11|pg||
nt|copeyj: 6@D after keycard response asking for 3rd round @D control a nice idea, Peter|pg||
mb|5H|nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: gm|pg||
nt|pitiful:  good morning Kath|pg||
mb|6H|nt|copeyj: ouch|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I was recently introduced to 2 tier splinters, love them!|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't understand 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we ladies dont like grands|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2 tier splinters in terms of split range, Kath?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: in my view much better to have two tier differentiating between singleton and void|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe south doesn't have the 6@d agreement or maybe expects north to be a little weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: strong splinters go via 2N|pg||
nt|pitiful:  anyway time for a coffee, back in a sec|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont know EW at all , are they youngsters?|pg||
nt|copeyj: No, Kath|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think two pairs of youngsters in the event - Constantin and O'Connor and Kaye and Youngs (apols if I am missing someone out :P)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|copeyj: Ah there is also Rowena Clow and Millie Jones|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the winning pairs compete in the Lady Milne on a "self funding basis"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 's a bit of a cheek, imo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did the camrose players compete on a self funding basis?|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think more often than not they get some funding though.. Last year and the year before they definitely got some funding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: That should be stated then|pg||
nt|copeyj: Camrose players are also warned they are self funded, although again in principle they often get some assistance at least|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|copeyj: It can not be stated in the CoC as it is not guaranteed|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: depends on budgets etc as I understand it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: who provides the assistance, seems very odd|pg||
mc|13|nt|yo_yo: all those simultaneous pairs  !|pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SKT842HAQ964DA7C3,SAQHJDKJ542CA9542,SJ975H7532DQ6CK76,S63HKT8DT983CQJT8|sv|e|nt|yo_yo: all those entry fees!|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a competitive deal here|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@S-2NT the likely start|pg||
nt|copeyj: double fit for both sides|pg||
nt|pitiful:  North will probably stretch to 3@s and east maybe 4@c|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  partner is vulnerable after all|pg||
nt|copeyj: note E shld bid 4@C not 4@D as that is the suit she wants led if partner on lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pitiful:  mike bell has suggested the following lonk for Carrie Eden event:http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8131429216939991171|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|pitiful:  now west should really double|pg||
nt|pitiful:  imo|pg||
nt|copeyj: Agree 100%|pg||
nt|pitiful:  in my opinion|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: to show a good hand for defending given the 2N call|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well 5@s is not a pernership bid either|pg||
nt|pitiful:  partnership|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: Davies bidding a lot on that rubbish!|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south might have bid 4@h over 4@c |pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't really understand - if your hand was only worth 3@S first time round how can you suddenly be able to judge to bid 5 over 5 - especially with KXX@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: looks an interesting video, i didnt know Eden was an actress : http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8131429216939991171|pg||
nt|copeyj: All of her hand is defensive - KXX@C and QX@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: So, not a bad start for your first three boards on BBO!|pg||
nt|copeyj: Morning, Simon|pg||
pc|cA|nt|copeyj: down 2 against the non making game looks likely|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|pitiful:  in this position east might consider playing SP|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Poor Carole,  how did she get into this mess|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pitiful:  K@s was a nice try|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hoping to pin the singleton Queen|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pitiful:  so 300 to E-W|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not a good start for n-s|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|s9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|pitiful:  missed a difficult slam, then a grand slam, now a phantom|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  reminds me of playing with you Simon|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SAT5HKJT743DK4CJ8,SJ3HA9852DJ982CK9,S8742HDQ763CQT642,SKQ96HQ6DAT5CA753|sv|b|nt|copeyj: Ahhh|pg||
nt|copeyj: fond memories indeed Peter|pg||
nt|copeyj: If only I had such pleasant memories :(|pg||
nt|pitiful:  all my fault as you carefully explain afterwards|pg||
nt|copeyj: Always :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the beauty of bridge, one minute scaling the heights, the next plunging to the depths :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not that you boys know about the depths|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you will need to explain the heights feeling to Simon Kath|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|yo_yo: i think he's had his moments, he has a star after all|pg||
nt|copeyj: Pretty sure I have a few inches on you, Peter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: Anyway - back in the real world...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@HX quite likely here I would have thought|pg||
nt|copeyj: in my view west should pass and east should reopen with a double|pg||
nt|pitiful:  would be nice to be playing a penalty double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well, anyone would overcall 2@H here|pg||
nt|copeyj: perhaps N might xx but N/S have nowhere to run|pg||
nt|pitiful:  likely to go around 3 down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont think East can reopen after that pause|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|pitiful:  west decided not to risk partner passing 2@H out|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this should make |pg||
nt|yo_yo: if there was a pause, then Carole didnt  pick up on it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well I am sure I would lead a @H regardless of the pause - do you have any realistic chance of beating 3N otherwise?|pg||
nt|copeyj: W could have been thinking about whether or not to introduce a 6 card minor, for example|pg||
nt|yo_yo: probaby not, you are going to be endplayed all the time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  8 top tricks now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|copeyj: and other considerations|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|copeyj: not sure about playing on @D here - I would have won the lead and played a @H back - those 98@H in dummy look nice|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i agree Simon |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|copeyj: A rare occurence - perhaps I should rethink|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|pitiful:  if the second @d had lost and a @h was returned declarer would have been in a mess|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||

nt|yo_yo: current scores ( i think) http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2012Jan_July/LadyMilneTrials/rank.txt|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|pitiful:  looks like 10 tricks from here|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pitiful:  9 i mean|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pitiful:  but not sure what happened |pg||
mc|7|nt|pitiful:  why did declarer play a @c|pg||
pg||

nt|pitiful:  should have cashed @s and played a @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Quiet apology from East|pg||
nt|yo_yo: someone went for  - 2900  gosh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unfortunately i can beat that, I went for 3600 once|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well it is easier seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|pitiful:  we musn't forget that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: 2300  correction|pg||
nt|copeyj: True, Peter. Much easier game double dummy.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|copeyj: E/W can make 4@h here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree with 1@D here?|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well i would have opened the east hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  even vul|pg||
nt|copeyj: Snap|pg||
nt|copeyj: AQJXX@C very nice|pg||
nt|copeyj: T@S nice|pg||
nt|copeyj: only the JX@H dubious really|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  e-w really belong in 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: Wonder if Kelly considered 3NT at all after 3@H - there is a facebook group dedicated to QX being a stopper|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south gave east another chance|pg||
nt|copeyj: After 3@H from W, in my view E should have bid 4@C showing @C and @H|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still the problem was that west could have a wide variety of hands opposite a passed partner|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h could be awful opposite an undisciplined pre-empt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: just 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some will open 3NT with that south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pushing West into 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Hi all, Paul Huggins here taking over from Simon Cocheme|pg||

nt|copeyj: Fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: is that possible?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S has a good chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: seems to be cold|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not on a club lead though|pg||
mb|1C|an|could be 2|nt|copeyj: played by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes can just win first @c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  east cannot get back on play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: I would have opened 1NT with the S hand if I played 15-17|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes true|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|copeyj: on @CJ lead I suppose you are likely to win A too - worried about ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: this is a horrible decision to have to rebid 2@C - but no problem here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south not really describing her hand type in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: I don't like off shape 1NT openings but that was a rather conservative rebid|pg||
nt|pitiful:  likely @d queen lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: she's not quite strong enough to reverse|pg||
nt|copeyj: agreed Kath|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|copeyj: only choice really for me is either to open 15-17 1N or to rebid 15-17 1N if I play 12-14 1N opener|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am not a fan of off shape 1NT either but even less so of offshape 2@c rebids|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||

nt|pitiful:  and too strong|pg||
nt|dagold: Good morning all|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|pitiful:  i would open or rebid 1N|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pitiful:  depending on range|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but swap Majors and I wou;ld not open 1N|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hi again David|pg||
nt|dagold: hi Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: I missed the hand that opened 1@c|pg||
nt|dagold: what was it?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5/4  15 pointer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: it's the south hand - 2=4=2=5 15 count|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dagold: that covers alot, anything more specific Kath?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|mc|11|nt|dagold: So its a clear 15-17nt|pg||

nt|pitiful:  i suspect you might open 1N with the Majors swapped David?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: dont tell anyone Peter|pg||
nt|copeyj: Especially not Tony|pg||
nt|copeyj: (Forrester)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oh he would as well|pg||
nt|copeyj: I know :)|pg||
nt|dagold: the hand in question is not even close, to bid it any other way is frankly not right imo|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not my style|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i agree david|pg||
mb|1C|an|could be 2|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  the 2@c rebid was too stong and not enough @c|pg||
mb|1D|an| |nt|pitiful:  strong|pg||
nt|dagold: and misses the hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: just wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|copeyj: Unusual for a pair playing strong NT 5cM not to bypass @D to bid the M with a weak hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what's 1@D i wonder|pg||
nt|dagold: 1@d is alerted|pg||
nt|dagold: do we know why?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  working well for them here|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: sorry, they havent explained it yet!|pg||
nt|pitiful:  contract is likely to be 2@d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i belong to the 1@S responses |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: perhaps they play it as a relay as do Tony and I?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  was it alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: it does look that way from the alert and subsequent bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: was what alerted?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  11d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: still no explanation forthcoming I'm afraid - but relay now seems likely|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @c switch best now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d would have been a much better spot for n-s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: declarer in the tank, checking opps conv card|pg||
nt|pitiful:  personally i would open 1@d warts and all as north|pg||
nt|copeyj: Walsh style would have missed it too unless N chose to open 1@D - which seems ok to me |pg||
pc|c2|nt|copeyj: although your @D are bad|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dagold: yes me too but its possible 1@d promises 5 for them|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: me too - makes rebids mor eflexible|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|copeyj: Davies has read things well here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|copeyj: my guess is 9@C denied an honour|pg||
nt|copeyj: which made things easier|pg||

nt|copeyj: ty|pg||
nt|copeyj: any sneak previes on which pairs will feature?|pg||
nt|copeyj: previews|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 4 youngsters at the table, |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Briony Youngs might not like that description, though  ( a bit more mature)|pg||
nt|dagold: average age at this table around 24|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS were winners of the trophy last year|pg||

mb|4N|an|rkcb|nt|dagold: west could have had a flat 10 count and has far more than that. Prefer 4@c splinter on the first round to get it off my chest|pg||
nt|roswolf: some might say east's bid was fast arrival|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|an|1 or 4|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be the weakest bid surely Geoffrey|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: even i might make this now|pg||
nt|dagold: E has over bid a bit, but at least she appreciates the hand is quite good and the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|dagold: the thing is, if you can make 4@h, partner can bid it over 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: north is in the tank|pg||
nt|yo_yo: EW always seem relaxed and unconcerned when i see them play |pg||

nt|copeyj: 4@H from Kaye now I think|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|an|cue|nt|dagold: yes terrible hand for the initial 2/1. 4@h to show it is what most people play|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: then 3@h shows a slightly better hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: all a bit optimistic i feel|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hope they are not getting on the cue bidding roundabout|pg||
nt|dagold: south is well worth it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some might ask why it's a terrible hand, the north hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: two queens|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4333|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well it's 4333 shape which is bad|pg||
nt|dagold: but north should sign off now, hacing not done so the round before|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and yes the unsupported Qs are not good|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dagold: a 2/1 starts at 12. this is a bad 12 so its a total minimum|pg||
nt|copeyj: South has a nice hand really|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: and she's thinking now|pg||
nt|dagold: she couldn't have less|pg||
nt|copeyj: N might even have chosen to show a 3 card limit raise if they were playing a way to show that directly|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm dont like the tank here|pg||
nt|dagold: so should show that with 4@h over 3@d|pg||
nt|copeyj: perhaps not with a vul game at stake but|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will go on!??|pg||
nt|dagold: I can understand south thinking, she expects slightly better for North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: The fact that North didnt cue bid should be the clue to pass|pg||
nt|copeyj: South knows it is a double fit|pg||
nt|dagold: is Kx Kxx AQxxx xxx possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup to both|pg||
nt|copeyj: and she has 4 massive cards and a singleton|pg||
nt|dagold: when 6@d is easy|pg||
nt|dagold: but 3@h does show a decent hand|pg||
nt|dagold: I have to say I am on souths wavelength here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kay maybe bid 3@H because she didnt want to go past  3NT|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|dagold: I would not crime her bidding on|pg||
nt|copeyj: K@D has basically become a keycard|pg||
nt|copeyj: so she has 3 keys and Q trumps|pg||
nt|dagold: although perhaps just 5@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm well this wont be successful|pg||
nt|dagold: to leave partner an out|pg||
nt|dagold: even this contract has a tiny bit of play facing the total garbage north has|pg||
nt|roswolf: neither will 6@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: it does|pg||
nt|dagold: north has an easy pass now. Diamonds might be essential, to use the hearts for disgards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: for me North is mostly to blame here. Perhaps 70-30|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe even 80-20|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: FOR ME THIS IS JUST SUPER OPTIMISM|pg||
nt|dagold: so she needs to try and ruff two clubs in the dummy then hope for the diamonds and hearts to come in|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the caps were intentional|pg||
nt|copeyj: ha ha Geoffrey|pg||
pc|cT|nt|copeyj: Makes a nice change|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||

nt|dagold: ruffing two clubs is hard|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: pressure duly applied|pg||
nt|dagold: diamond to the J|pg||
nt|dagold: club ruff|pg||
nt|dagold: heart to the T(!)|pg||
nt|dagold: club ruff|pg||
nt|dagold: then @d K|pg||
nt|copeyj: 9@C was suit preference from O'Connor|pg||
nt|dagold: wont work here of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think this is the right alice Kaye, there are 2 http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=26518|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: this is the one with middle initials GC|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she wont be smiling at the moment though|pg||
nt|dagold: no reason to suppose the spade is from the king|pg||
nt|copeyj: definitely not|pg||
nt|dagold: so i think something like the line I suggested|pg||
nt|copeyj: given the SP signal from W|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: not when east had lots of safe exits|pg||
nt|copeyj: and the fact that W would be unlikely to switch from @SK now|pg||
nt|dagold: which included a heart to the T at some point for the extra entry to hand|pg||
nt|dagold: needed|pg||
nt|dagold: its a shame nothign works, as if the diamond Q was with west it would be a pretty play hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is likely to be -2 rather than -1|pg||

nt|vugraphzwd: true, if she was a passed hand she'd be ok doing it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: with a good hand with clubs she can do the same - in this case if partner raised clubs she can go back to diamonds having shown the lead|pg||

mb|1D|nt|dagold: not so bad|pg||
nt|dagold: actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: quite reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: patchy imo|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: I still want to know about the -2300 from yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Mixed, Tom, but as you say improving. Thought we saw a generally very impressive set last time out from a young pair O'Connor and Constantin|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mug: I thought so too, seems to improve every year|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: agreed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i thought the same about the men's trials@@)|pg||
nt|mug: if you just look at the mistakes from a bridge event, everybody who ever played the game looks like an idiot|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mug: 6@D is on a finesse here but not really biddable|pg||
nt|dagold: Men didnt have a trials Kath|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: will N double 3NT for a heart lead?  and will it encourage EW to play in diamonds?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: true but  the camrose is mainly men|pg||
nt|roswolf: east continues|pg||
nt|dagold: there is no open trials that I am aware of|pg||
mb|4S|an|undiscussed!|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mug: the Premier League as you are well aware serves as a Camrose trial, same as this weekend serves as the Lady Milne trial|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 5@C cue would have produced a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: the camrose is almost a private event, no proper funding from the ebu. Not many people want to play it anyway now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes tom  but simple arithmatic tells me that most are male|pg||
nt|mug: well we're both playing in it this season :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: I disagree David,  loads of people would want to play camrose|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|dagold: anyway|pg||
nt|dagold: the bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: W to S: 2@C would not be natrual|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: perhaps double would be penalty?|pg||

nt|dagold: I would still double|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|mug: 3@C will make with the @SQ falling, and NS could make 3@D, so this cost them|pg||
