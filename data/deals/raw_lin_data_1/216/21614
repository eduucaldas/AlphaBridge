nt|vugraphzux: OTHER SEMI TARKUNDE/ ENDLESS HIGHWAY|pg||
nt|basu_4139: sound of a dbl usually adds a natural confusion for getting 3N wet|pg||
nt|psridhar: that E hand was only worth an invitnal smollen..|pg||
nt|psridhar: 9 hcp with stiff @d Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|basu_4139: trial n acceptance probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Maybe an overtrick IMP now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|basu_4139: no way out unless a ruff n sluff because a C is obvious move now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|psridhar: passive lead -always a problem whether one shd lead passive or aggressive-one theory is to lead aggressively always since the odds of success and failure are equal|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|psridhar: hi all w/c to the last segment of QF|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|psridhar: if succeeds then defeat of cont|pg||
nt|psridhar: big gain|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|psridhar: when it doesnt succeed most of the time it sells only OT so no skin off ones nose|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|nt|psridhar: RV's X in bal seat is protecting a penalty pass of 2@C by his pd-hence JM's 2@H rather than 2@s|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|psridhar: in short aggreessive leads succeed on a 'make or sell' game mode |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|psridhar: commpared to the situation if JM had Xed 2@c, RV can confidently bid 2@s expecting fit|pg||

nt|psridhar: i wd consider a @d lead as aggressive there|pg||
nt|psridhar: and that wd hv caused a headache to declarer , though he may end up making|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psridhar: cant understd the Moysian attempt in pref to 4-4 @h in CR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: here JM/RV will play in @h -will they reach game is the question|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3N|nt|psridhar: after that 1@H , 4@H it is going to be|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: wonder why hema ruled out 4@h there|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be not sure of the methods to find the @h fit-oppo have bid 2 suits so Lebensohl may not apply ; X may be misconstrued?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: down  if they can find their ruff(s)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jain: good chance for promila saraf to pick the lead|pg||
nt|jain: N needs to unblock|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: it shd be worthwhile Doubling in South seat -if that is lead indicating|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psridhar: will net down 3 on @c lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: now-after the @d lead it is going to be difficult to achieve down 1 even-South has to convince his pd to give him a @c ruff |pg||
nt|psridhar: else def can be held to 1 trump , 2 @s tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: decl can play ace and another trump...|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|basu_4139: luck must be seen to be believed|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is going down -more i think of it|pg||
nt|psridhar: after the @d ruff, how is declarer going to get his black suit tricks?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: imposssible, looks like the rich are going to get richer here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt has some chances.. double dummy|pg||
nt|jain: they can get 11 tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps she played 'safe' , but in bridge there is no such thing , it is only a temporary feeling of comfort|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Nowhere|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h might have made |pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: for eg the South player in CR played 'safe' not overcalling 1N.....how risky was that move? they seem to have missed 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|nt|psridhar: long ago Kaplan wrote an article titled " how risky is not taking the risk" ?  an eye opener |pg||

nt|psridhar: def may have huffed and puffed to down 1 -but declarer had paucity of hcp in hand...|pg||

nt|tullo: opening leads make or break :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The famous 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: also @c queen will mean S held 18 hcp -shown 4 aces|pg||
nt|psridhar: "if you do not wish to play 3-3 fits do NOT bid 3 card suits" -another famous Kaplan prescription :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: 2@S may also be the contract here, but by N-S|pg||

nt|psridhar: RV may be tempted into bidding game here|pg||
nt|psridhar: good major holdings he has|pg||
nt|psridhar: double fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: Vul pd has entered the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if that 3@d is invitnal in @s ( 3@C may be invitn in @h) , then RV has done well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: JM will not cross 3 level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 4@s ? what has he got xtra ? may be state of the match bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: might prompt 5@C|pg||
nt|psridhar: North has got into the typical trap that he set for himself|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he had sacrifice in mind all he needed to do was to bid 4@C over 3@d and leave it to opener|pg||
nt|psridhar: he masterminded a pass and now in blind guessing situation|pg||
nt|jain: another missed oppurtunity for promila,may b N cld have waited nd xled 2s for a later t/o|pg||
nt|psridhar: deadly Roland prediction -is it morning or night yet for you Roland? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's stress that no-one can make 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4:20 am, late|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: this is common among many players - instead of providing info to pd and let the strong hand/opener decide, mastermind a save all by your own|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|oosmanb: RV might compete now, with 2NT if its to play|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hema may scoop her Queen trick1 and 110 with it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|psridhar: at least he guessed to pass here|pg||
nt|psridhar: indeed|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "If you want to fool partner, underlead an ace". Who said that?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psridhar: and that could have been wrong as well if save was warrnated|pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting if 2@S still to play, given south showed majors|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Ooosman|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Btw I like the initial pass of 1NT with a 4333 8 count pretty flat hand|pg||
nt|jain: but may not b that badly off|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sunsamvar: unlike in other room J M has a good picture of opps hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did, 30 secs ago|pg||
nt|psridhar: wrong ace to underlead it was here-@s wd hv not cost|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: Risky dbl by north now, auction based|pg||

nt|tullo: is it some sort of acceptance of @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tullo: shows 3@H nows cos didn't bid them initially over partner's double|pg||
nt|psridhar: with @h breaking all games make-coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|tullo: rana should be able to work out distribution of partner's hand from bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this cont wont make|pg||
nt|jain: but 2@H shd show a better hand nd direct 2s weaker raise,does it qualify for 2h raise a 4333 hand ?|pg||
nt|tullo: game would definitely be doubled|pg||
nt|tullo: so 4@D should be the minimum loss for east west here|pg||

nt|psridhar: S in other room charged in with a passed hand t.o X-here JM avoided it|pg||
nt|petka: I disagree with souths second pass here. A 1S spade bid looks prudent. Takeout double is probably not so clever with passed partner, since the board belongs to opps very often|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 1@H 1@C 2@D to lose in @S for EW|pg||

pc|c6|nt|sunsamvar: 3@C was accepting the trf and confirming @DK|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is also a sound idea -shorten decl...but may not work here|pg||
nt|petka: West also had an intersting situation. Many top pairs play that X here shows spades, and 1S is takeout without spades. Others reverse the meaning of these bids.|pg||
nt|petka: If you play that 1S over 1H promises 5+cards, then you have a real problem with bal/sbal hands with 8+HCP but no 4card spade suit and no heart stopper|pg||
nt|psridhar: true-thats waht makes this game interesting -no perfect solution to most problems|pg||
nt|psridhar: several possibilities,make your pick based on odds / experience|pg||
nt|psridhar: with the modern tendency being to bid at slightest of excuses, passing when you want them to bid will work too|pg||
