mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvs: questions from west. South explaining 4@D+4M|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: Shortly followed by a double and popeye expression.|pg||

nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|eamongall: I can hear Wald doing a solo voice commentary in the background in the other room |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: S hand not worth much except in spades really,  is it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Its Ian Crorie doing voice for this room  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzvs: interesting one...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|baldjean: @s lead again, I suppose|pg||
nt|eamongall: sure but I talking about open room|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes it is Wald in the open room |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think I would be transfering to 2@S but this hand might be a horror story in @Ss if it bought xx in trumps instead of @SAQx|pg||
pc|d8|nt|baldjean: if you exchange the trumps of EW it would be 1 down. this way it can make|pg||

nt|golfsquash: a chance for ireland there to start a recovery|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: NS here playing strong and 5s, EW weak and 5s|pg||
nt|wendle: makes the fa cup manchester derby look like a sunday afternoon kick around|pg||
nt|wendle: may reach 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt or 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SUPPORT WITH SUPPORT|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I would have preferred 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the cry from my club|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: EW multi, flannery 2@h, lucas 2@s|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 4@c splinter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: south needs caution|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  West will like the @hQ but the rest of the hand is not great|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: NS multi and Muiderberg 2M|pg||
nt|golfsquash: south may bid again|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  it looks like East was trying to deny a @d stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  and hoping West would bid 3NT with something in @d|pg||
nt|golfsquash: game on for both sides here|pg||
nt|wendle: or not|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: conservative and safe auction|pg||
nt|wendle: maybe im just overly agressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: yes, i dont think many reaching 4@S|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|golfsquash: so this could be a big gain for Ireland|pg||

nt|wendle: can make 10 now|pg||

nt|sybarra: not everyones weak 2 suit |pg||

nt|vugraphzvw: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup 3@H was cast-iron|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 18 HCP South is too good for 1NT and opens a strong 1@c|pg||
nt|wendle: ew with the points, ns with the @H save here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|wendle: how many from south?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wendle: well judged by whyte, 3n on for ew|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzvw: 5@D -1 though|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: so perhaps a good board for SBU|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvw: unless there's something im missing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu:  what system do NS play? - a canapÃ© system? - major before minor?|pg||
nt|wendle: you? surely not!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: :P|pg||
nt|wendle: should be -1 though|pg||
nt|wendle: 4@H did the job nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: actually he might make?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: ruff two hearts, draw trumps and cash spades. then play A and another club|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: gordon needs to be sharp enough to ditch K@C|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: (which he will ofc)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can make 4@s tricks if he wins in hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see a lot of finesses and must guess which to take|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wendle: we're about to find out|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: its a legitimate line, sometime someone has KQ tight|pg||
pc|c5|nt|golfsquash: West did have 4D available to show a stronger 4@s opening|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|golfsquash: He has a lot outside of spades to open a preempt|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: cold now right?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|pelu:  I am told NS play Blue Club-style|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: ah no, with 3-1 break he cant ruff the last H and draw|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: so E will have a safe exit?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  West should have been able to tell from East's carding who has the last @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @h suit is now frozen with West on lead but safe for East to play|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  after playing one minor, declarer may exit in @h|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer needs to exit in @h before cashing the @dA|pg||

nt|pelu:  @D is max|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, pass is unlikely:)|pg||
nt|pelu:  4@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: but it could be a winner of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S seems remarkable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4 card major with longer minor|pg||
nt|wendle: as linda points out correctly, if tedd had unblocked the spades before playing third trump the heart king goes on spade ace and now cold|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu:  even if I play 2@S as @S+minor I would bid 3@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if just S + m with no length specifications, i agree Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 4-7 is within the system but is too wide for me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South wants to compete but does not want a @h lead if West declares|pg||

nt|wendle: its ok, bas, we dont expect you to get it right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: :)|pg||
nt|wendle: north giving some thought it seems?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the greatest of respect 3nt is off the scale of sanity|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d lead works best but hard for North to visualise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: 4@sX not alerted by S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  @c lead just as good if South does not attempt to cash a 2nd @c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not a fan of trump leads as you may know|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Welcome to Henry Bethe on voice commentary|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  4@c might have been pass or correct, which would perhaps explain why South did not do that|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: if 2S shows specifcally 4 of them then it is within the bounds, especially since 3C doesnt consume much more useful space than 2S. still my eyes keep bulging at those clubs and the ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzvw: 6@C makes on a very, very good day i guess|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will be expecting North to have @c for the @dK to be wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  pleasant surprise for him|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: if 3D is constructive due to lebensohl, W can expect to run the whole suit|pg||

nt|roswolf: the scoreboard shows the bitter truth|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 18 Wales as EW did get to 3NT from the right side but NS saved |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and Wales went on to 5@c|pg||
nt|wendle: this should be fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: i suppose 6@C is another decent alan slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: uh uh - another trappy hand for the english|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzvw: actually, does 7@C qualify as decent for you?|pg||
nt|wendle: better than the last one we saw!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: i asked players what they think which result it is|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: all 4 players said that they have no clue|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: and that match can go either way from this point|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: they have managed to play this back to front... so TF is DG for this board and vice versa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they both had hard bids. E is a bit suit-oriented for 5N perhaps, but that does bring clubs into the picture which is essential on such a primey hand. and i dont think W ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can be faulted because for all he knew it was crucial to protect one of his kings|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphztx: 2@h is 1-D overcall style|pg||
mb|p|nt|wendle: yes, haha|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to like the look of his hearts after West's opening|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably he has passed hoping to get the chance to X 1NT|pg||
nt|wendle: we'll see if club fit is ever discovered|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: actually does a spade lead beat 7@C on all the favourable layouts|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at this vulnerability, the bonus for bidding game is at its least and the reward for picking up a penalty is at its highest|pg||

nt|wendle: brb|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: this looks like one down and 5imps to Panteros team|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: fair comment marshall but irish eyes are still smiling|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 5N is just a more flexible way of bidding 6C, and as i said E was right to have a preference for clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and W did not know there were no aces missing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have jumped to 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: here 6D is not easy to reach and far from laydown anyway|pg||
nt|golfsquash: That lead will help declarer, who is quite a way short of 9tricks at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: @dT denies the J in NS methods|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wendle: some kind of cue im guessing - any kibs know their style here?|pg||
