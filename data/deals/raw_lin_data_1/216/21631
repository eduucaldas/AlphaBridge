mb|p|mb|1S|nt|copeyj: He liked AAK I suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|an|f1r|nt|dburn: oh, sure - ace-ace-king is an opening in any position at any vulnerability, but happened not to work well that time|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|!s!d or bal|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: I think they play transfers over 1M-1N|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 1N was 100% forcing|pg||
nt|copeyj: Maybe 2@C was @D or balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: 2@s described as doubleton spade or poor hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Discussion of flushing kind of obviates any possibility of dry wit...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|copeyj: @S lead will not trouble the scorers I don't think - lose at most 2@H 2@D 1@C|pg||
nt|dburn: Pownall obviously an atheist|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  David, it depends on who you are. Roth in his heyday would not open three bare aces and 4-3-3-3 shape, or even 5-3-3-2 unless the 5 card had A10 at the top|pg||
nt|dburn: no one knows - attributed to several people, none of whom probably said it first|pg||

mb|2S|nt|oosmanb:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Douglas Piper and Alex Wilkinson for Scotland; Peter Crouch and Derek Patterson for England|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb:  2@D was multi. 4@C was : Bid one UNDER your major, and then South can declare it|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Playing 4@C this way, (and 4@D = bid your major) allows responder to protect his holdings|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eamongall: Good evening folks |pg||

pc|s7|nt|vugraphzvu: yes, 4@c would show a stronger hand with @h|pg||

nt|eamongall: and Peter Goodman a regular visitor to Dublin (maybe he lives here) ...but afraid I don't know Pownall in person |pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzvu: could have been 3 apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: according to the system file 3+ @H or 5+H if GF|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|eamongall: McDonagh  has represented Ireland in the recent past at Senior level with Pat McDevitt ... I think Heneghan is making his debut here for Ireland |pg||
pc|hA|nt|clinch: Some guesses in the red suits here - first was wrong|pg||

pc|s2|nt|clinch: A club from Wilkison would have been interesting, but didn't happen|pg||

nt|clinch: Patterson now can't afford to lose two heart tricks; he will probably exit with a diamond and Piper will be somewhat stuck for an exit card|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|eamongall: he will make this contract but he may not see 9 tricks just yet |pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Steve Robinson gave a definition of a constructive raise the other day which I hadn't hear before but which makes a lot of sense:|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|santyclz2:  A constructive raise is a hand that would accept at least 1 game try.|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@S showing 5+|pg||
nt|copeyj: Wonder what north's poison will be|pg||
nt|copeyj: many pairs play 2@S as natural here, even if he were considering it|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|an|natural 16+ or (17-18 bal, exactly 2!s)|nt|dburn: they may not do if 1@s shows five|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Lew Mathe used to say that the only thing worse than leading from Jxxx was leading a trump|pg||

mb|p|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||

mb|1C!|an|strong, artifical|mb|p|nt|eamongall: of course we can all see @S finesses and endplays with @C but this is teams and over a 32 board match an imp here or there is less crucial then going down in a game |pg||
mb|1D!|an|negative|nt|clinch: Part-score hand now; EW make 3@s; NS 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 2D is either 6+ D no 4cM and 10-13 or 5-9 with 4+D and a 5cM|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: Yes Henry|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - there are enough club spots to set up a second trick there to dispose of a diamond, but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: the @C pips are up to the task|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (If you guess @cs on a @c lead -- which shouldn't be too difficult.)|pg||
nt|copeyj: Presumably 3@C a 3 card limit raise|pg||
mb|3H|an|concentration of strength|mb|p|nt|copeyj: I confess I might have opened 2N with south in a natural system|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, with that 4-1 trump break, can you keep control while setting up that club?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: I mean, if you take a heart ruff on the table and draw trumps, then East will force your last trump with a heart when he wins the second club|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  20.80 http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=akj93+ak7+1054+a8|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  play for 6@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you avoid a @h loser, just the @cA to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: bidding is pointing towards a heart lead   so better stop in game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I think 1C was conventional|pg||
nt|ady: ok   so 1@C had not promised clubs|pg||

mb|3S|an|3!s and values|nt|vugraphzvu: with the K@S lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is about to find out that South's second suit is spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  and this sequence has protected the @dAQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is sure to look for a slam once he finds out South's second suit is spades rather than clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|clinch: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should have said 'if' rather than 'once' :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: not clear if 3@s is systemically 3+@s or exactly 3...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North uses RKCB with @h inferentially agreed, the response will reveal 2 key cards missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I *think* 3@s has shown exactly 3@s as N bid 2N, not 2@s|pg||
mb|4S|an|Kickback|nt|ady: must assume 4NT in this sequence not rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 4N was asking something...impossible to read the Robson scrawl|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South may be trying to work out whether 4@s is a cue with @h agreed or an attempt to play there|pg||
mb|4N|an|1 or 4 key cards|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  it seems 4@s was a keycard ask, so 4NT = 1 or 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch did write he *thought* 4@s is RKCB, so we may be in the unknown here|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: not suprising with Robson having 2 small of a suit not bid or cu bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  using the bid at the 4 level one denomination above the trump suit is kickback|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: though he has confirmed N should not have 4@s on the bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so 4@s is the ask with @h agreed, 4@h with @d agreed etc|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play will be quick here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 2 England gained 2 IMPs|pg||

pc|c5|nt|clinch: It looks as though just playing small from either hand would be ok as safety play on prior hand - key is not to bang down the ace!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  when East bid 3@d, he said 2@h was hearts, with @d a second suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: so 1@d here is limited and denies a 4cM, may not necessarily have @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS did not get in the bidding in the other room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|clinch: We have comparisons for the last three boards, and 4@h one down looks likely to be duplicated here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: solid 6@H here    diamond finesse for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 2@d here confirming a @d suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: I like to play that the double of 2-level artificial pre-empts promises 15+p|pg||
nt|clinch: Will need to avoid a @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: looks like 15/16 both strong results for eng though|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: on a club lead do you need spades 1-1 (or an inspired hook) H 3-3 and the Q@H onside... not too much|pg||

nt|copeyj: game down on @C lead though and cant imagine wilkinson leading anything else|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, and 5@s is a very unlucky contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: fingering a heart.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: now the Q@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: asking lots of questions and thinking still|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: crouch says he cant have a shortage, and with that he settles on K@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: oooh, 3@h E here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  north and East are on the same side of the screen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eamongall: Turned out Heneghan had declared 4@S on a 3-1 fit making 10 |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so in theory it could have been North who was thinking|pg||
nt|ady: just keep away from hearts  and 500 in the bag|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer can strip the minors before playing a @h to the 9, that will endplay East|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if he ruffs 2@d in dummy, a ruff and discard will no longer be an option|pg||
nt|ady: may go go for 800  as no quick entry to play a diamond towards the king|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzvu: guess he will play A@H, AK diamond and exit a club?|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: director pacing...time trouble|pg||
