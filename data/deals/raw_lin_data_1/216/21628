nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|eamongall: I can hear Wald doing a solo voice commentary in the background in the other room |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: S hand not worth much except in spades really,  is it?|pg||

mb|2D|an|weak 2M|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup 3@H was cast-iron|pg||

mb|2S|an|p/c|mb|d|nt|wendle: how many from south?|pg||

mb|3D|an|stronger than via 2NT (Lebensohl)|nt|vugraphzvw: 5@D -1 though|pg||

nt|vugraphzvw: :P|pg||
nt|wendle: should be -1 though|pg||
nt|wendle: 4@H did the job nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: actually he might make?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: ruff two hearts, draw trumps and cash spades. then play A and another club|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: gordon needs to be sharp enough to ditch K@C|pg||

nt|rmb1: Convention card for NS http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/BurnsMurchan.pdf|pg||
nt|pelu:  @D is max|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, pass is unlikely:)|pg||
nt|pelu:  4@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|p/c|nt|marlowepi: but it could be a winner of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S seems remarkable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4 card major with longer minor|pg||
nt|wendle: as linda points out correctly, if tedd had unblocked the spades before playing third trump the heart king goes on spade ace and now cold|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu:  even if I play 2@S as @S+minor I would bid 3@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if just S + m with no length specifications, i agree Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 4-7 is within the system but is too wide for me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South wants to compete but does not want a @h lead if West declares|pg||

nt|wendle: its ok, bas, we dont expect you to get it right :)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the greatest of respect 3nt is off the scale of sanity|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d lead works best but hard for North to visualise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: 4@sX not alerted by S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  @c lead just as good if South does not attempt to cash a 2nd @c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not a fan of trump leads as you may know|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Welcome to Henry Bethe on voice commentary|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  4@c might have been pass or correct, which would perhaps explain why South did not do that|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: if 2S shows specifcally 4 of them then it is within the bounds, especially since 3C doesnt consume much more useful space than 2S. still my eyes keep bulging at those clubs and the ...|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will be expecting North to have @c for the @dK to be wrong|pg||

pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: if 3D is constructive due to lebensohl, W can expect to run the whole suit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphzvw: actually, does 7@C qualify as decent for you?|pg||
nt|wendle: better than the last one we saw!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: i asked players what they think which result it is|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: all 4 players said that they have no clue|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: and that match can go either way from this point|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: they have managed to play this back to front... so TF is DG for this board and vice versa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they both had hard bids. E is a bit suit-oriented for 5N perhaps, but that does bring clubs into the picture which is essential on such a primey hand. and i dont think W ...|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  South might have jumped to 3@s|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|d|an|alert|mb|3S|mb|4D|nt|baldjean: rather keen 2@d with a passed partner|pg||

nt|idc:  North might have bid 3@h over 2@s but that's not a great suit for it - if he were raised to 4@h he would worry it was 5-2 opr even 5-1 fit|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like Micky Burns law is coming into play again |pg||
nt|idc:  now he is showing hearts & club tolerance (he hopes!)|pg||

mb|1C|an|1+!c|nt|vugraphzvw: it appears there's a problem with board 28 and the players here may need to play a substitue board to compensate|pg||

nt|marlowepi: E presumably tried to transfer to hearts. at the end maybe deciding whether to pass, or bid 4H. or maybe wondering if 4D would be a re-transfer vs. something else|pg||
