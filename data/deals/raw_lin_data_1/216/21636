nt|dburn: if that is a typical 3@d opening, he probably should, but...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|dburn: West may think this is a doubtleton, of course - surely North would not open 3@d with four hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it matters - this is down about four whether he winds or ducks|pg||

nt|roswolf: this may be fun|pg||
nt|clinch: Strong chance of a double game swing there|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Robson says he got the hand wrong because AA led the 7 of clubs, not the low one he should have done from his holding|pg||

mb|p|nt|clinch: A grand slam here, though not for the opening bidder!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: another very exciting hand|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|clinch: Don't blame E for passing, though he might have bid on|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  in 3rd seat I am not sure of the need to make the distinction - perhaps it helps partner judge whether to save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  East might have wanted to bid 2NT after the double to show two places to play|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but perhaps he thought West would take it as natural|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  defenders will need to play @c eraly to stop the overtrick|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm so far so good|pg||

nt|marlowepi: The course followed by E here is not one I would expect to have a positive long-term track record. Certainly it is sensible to treat the hand as too promising for an initial 3C,, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially at these colors, but having bid 2C and heard partner pass you arent really going anywhere and further action rates to help the foe more than your own side|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|golfsquash: I believe 2@c is GF, even tho' the convention card doesn't say so|pg||

nt|clinch: The first double game swing on 17 came to pass for Scotland - 17 and 18 won't go their way, though|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS judged well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  contract is makeable but declarer will need to reject @d finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  endplay might not work if diamonds were 2-2 but in that case taking the trump finesse does not help anyway|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  1NT was forcing|pg||

nt|marlowepi: or ten of spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 10@S    even better chance|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, will be interesting|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: with the heart finesse right declarer should be ok but is tested at T1|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Must confess I would bid 3H with the North hand so as to show the clubs later... what do I know?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: Diamond more likely now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should come close on any lead, favorite to make on some:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Who knows what Robson's 1Nt was :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: I thk it might be "crash" defence to big @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: again, he waved at it, but no idea what it means|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: HMM IN TROUBLE NOW|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has enough in @h to play in 3NT facing the shortage|pg||

nt|copeyj: seems likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: robson says 1nt showed a major and a minor|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
nt|ady: close to making if ace and king of clubs would stand up|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N has the upside of making it a bit harder for EW to get together in spades, but with a strong club on one's left there is less likelihood foe will be seriously discomfited. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile it might well help the eventual declarer.  after all, if robson were to pass on this S hand at these colors, who would ever play him for this hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson still thinking|pg||
nt|clinch: After opening his 1 count on 19, who can blame him for entering with this monster?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 20 the endglish n/s conceded -1100 in a very dubious auction - 15 big imps back|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson states that they could be in a 3-0 fit and hes not sure on the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see only 5 top tricks and a shortage of entries to hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: the real upside of 1N with the S hand comes when W is strong and balanced while EW have a 44 spade fit, and N can do something dynamic over the pass (or NT bid) by W|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  where is the Earl of Yarborough whe you need him? :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|golfsquash: 6@d is possibly 1 down, even on a nontrump lead, ducking the first spade creates problems.|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ady: defence will need to take care to get their diamond trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he did roll his eyes somewhat when he picked it up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  10 or 11 depending upon whether the @hQ scores|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|dburn: that @cQ was likely to be a defensive value, even if he couldn't cash any diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: the test you should apply is: will this contract go two down more often than it will make?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my club an 18 count with KQx of trumps behind the bidder is an automatic double|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch decides to open a packet of Boubon biscuits....not passing them round though|pg||

nt|dburn: and if South bids 3@s as he might, the partnership should at least avoid 3NT, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...if he does that instead, Crouch may well lead a club and not a spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: which black suit will west lead|pg||
nt|ady: Robson will find an agreeable dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N presumably is a specific @S raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: alerted, but didnt say what|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW play 2NT as limit or better, so 3@s is a 4-card raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dburn: since he knows Patterson doesn't have diamonds, so he is very likely to have clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kerasidis: could end play to make this!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd contract to reach in other room, with 4S making|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: he could have done - it was pretty much 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are they playing 13-15 NT in other room?|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades  fair play for n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: Just the way it is with 1N openings in 2012.  You'll have lots of company if you ignore AQxxx majors.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table England found a good defence to 4@h, taking out dummy's spade entries|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  killing the long @d|pg||
mb|1S!|an|Kaplan inversion, F1 art.|nt|roswolf: 1nt is an imaginative bid on that collection|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and forcing declarer to play @c himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: sorry, wrong person!|pg||

mb|p|nt|golfsquash: opener could be void in diamonds!|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  1@s is like a forcing 1NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I've played it but did not know the name before 'Kaplan inversion'|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E perhaps belongs to the innumerable tribe whose slogan is: "let's push them to a game they might not otherwise bid, and tell them  all about our hand so they can make it when they ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: might otherwise go down". |pg||
nt|othered1: But if you can count on aggressive opponents drawing you a roadmap out of the ditch you've driven into . . . |pg||
nt|ady: maybe north should adjust here and volunteer 2@S second round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: England aren't going to bid game after this start|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup e/w have stayed low another english gain likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, so it would appear, but there may be nuances in NS methods that made 2S unattractive|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I think that is what it is called|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: the magical mystery bus continues the tour|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: because 1NT then shows @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: so, inverting the 1@s and 1NT meanings|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|golfsquash: 2! is probably artificial game force, known as XY NoTrump, a good method.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: if Xx showed power, I'd submit both north's first pass and south's 2@D shold be forcing.  Still I might want to get that suit in, as north|pg||
nt|ady: well at least it is plus for England although out of a good game|pg||

mb|1N|nt|clinch: That one may not make The Times|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand valuation by S, though that does not automatically make 2N the correct call. since N is not a passed hand, 2N could preempt them out of a slam sometimes. playing as NS ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do, though, that is a bigger danger when the main suit is diamonds, because a 1D opening would show length whereas 1C doesnt make much of a move toward an eventuakl club contract ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they bid a rather thin 3NT that makes becuase the hand with the long hearts has neither minor suit ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|stayman|nt|othered1: using NT openings as aggressive weapons hasn't shown well for NS so far this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I feel 4 hearts better here|pg||
