nt|athene: pin declarer in dummy then you might be able to give pd a spade ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: Forrester in deep thought|pg||
nt|athene: small spade would not work as declarer could run it to his @SJxx and draw the last trump|pg||

nt|vugraphzvt: nice play says Walker|pg||
nt|copeyj: predicted*|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: thought followed by "play the ace"...|pg||
nt|athene: of course even without the ruff possibility this sort of messes up declarer's entries a bit|pg||
nt|athene: but he can just come back to hand with @SJ and play west for @DA to reach the last spade if needed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: since diamond ace rates to be with West he should get this right|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|2N|nt|clinch: Douglas Piper and Alex Wilkinson for Scotland; Peter Crouch and Derek Patterson for England|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|oosmanb:  2@D was multi. 4@C was : Bid one UNDER your major, and then South can declare it|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Playing 4@C this way, (and 4@D = bid your major) allows responder to protect his holdings|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Good evening folks |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: Here we have Michael McDonagh and James Heneghan representing Ireland |pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: according to the system file 3+ @H or 5+H if GF|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|eamongall: McDonagh  has represented Ireland in the recent past at Senior level with Pat McDevitt ... I think Heneghan is making his debut here for Ireland |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|clinch: Some guesses in the red suits here - first was wrong|pg||

nt|clinch: A club from Wilkison would have been interesting, but didn't happen|pg||
nt|clinch: n|pg||
nt|clinch: Patterson now can't afford to lose two heart tricks; he will probably exit with a diamond and Piper will be somewhat stuck for an exit card|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c7|nt|eamongall: he will make this contract but he may not see 9 tricks just yet |pg||

nt|athene: 2@S should lead to a slightly more controlled auction|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S in the other room a bit of a bash|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D now from Walker I expect, and maybe Forrester will double back in or rebid @S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: expect 3S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|copeyj: I think so - Forrester top end of 2@S|pg||
nt|copeyj: You are not really interested in playing in @C with such solid !@S|pg||
nt|athene: he might double just to cater for partner having enough in diamonds to pass|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: wow that's some view from gold with 1-5 in the blacks|pg||
nt|copeyj: Can't imagine Short bidding again - but he might I suppose as length in @S looks good|pg||
nt|copeyj: Bill - Gold would not even have considered 4@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't think|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: well i think it's close|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|athene: 3@S is a fairly extreme example of false preference |pg||

mb|4S|nt|clinch: Part-score hand now; EW make 3@s; NS 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 2D is either 6+ D no 4cM and 10-13 or 5-9 with 4+D and a 5cM|pg||

nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: will he bid 3@H to deny a 4-card major?|pg||
mb|3H|an|denying|nt|athene: that's the latest style|pg||
nt|copeyj: Ah|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3h is becoming popular for no majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: There you go|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|athene: allows responder to unravel 5@S-4@H hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: they play 3N as 5 hearts that;s right|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: this board not one to trouble the scorers I don't think|pg||
pc|c6|nt|copeyj: 11 tricks now whatever Gold plays from the dummy, as it will be the 9 or the Q|pg||
nt|athene: if your only concern is to keep two club stops you stick the 9 in now i suppose|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think he may play the 9|pg||
nt|athene: if south has the king you can always play for that later|pg||
nt|athene: so might as well cater for J10 with south|pg||
nt|odysseus69: expect queen |pg||
nt|athene: of course there are other issues (spade suit for example)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|copeyj: That was his consideration I suppose|pg||
pc|d9|nt|copeyj: there is another thought - East showed no major yet south still chose a minor suit lead|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to be a long, strong suit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|copeyj: Maybe A@H and @H finesse now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|copeyj: and when the Q is offside but they break 3-3 will be an imp to England|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: if diamonds are not breaking then playing low on 1st club means reliance on heart finesse|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C|an|GF|mb|p|nt|athene: not a great 6@S here on a club lead; better without as you may get club away on heart and make for the loss of  just one major-suit trick|pg||
mb|3S|an|no shortage; non-minimum|mb|p|nt|athene: assuming 3@S is south's weakest action then i think north will give up|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nearly slam - needs both majors to be right|pg||
nt|athene: oh right 3@S shows extras; ok, might be hard to put on the brakes now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: expect 4d-4s then?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|an|2 with Q|mb|p|nt|athene: i suppose these bids help responder to judge how well the hands fit, but it is often a big tactical disadvantage to tell opps declarer has no shortage|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|athene: after the @SA he will play for @HQxx onside, so two down quite quickly i would think|pg||

nt|timb: I'm off to bed; thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: indeed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|clinch: So here Scotland got optimistic|pg||
nt|clinch: Not unreasonably|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: it had some play. lets see how N/S bid it|pg||
nt|clinch: Will surely start with some kind of forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: on a club lead do you need spades 1-1 (or an inspired hook) H 3-3 and the Q@H onside... not too much|pg||
mb|2C|an|art GF|mb|2N|nt|ady: if diamond finesse right 11 imps the other way   25 imps swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Don't think hearts need to be 3-3 if trumps are picked up, but they do if not!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: ah yes, sorry. so its not the worst slam then|pg||
mb|4N|nt|nurkumkale: e-w in sadece soyisimlerini görebiliyoruz|pg||
nt|nurkumkale: Tahmin etmeye çalýþýyorum çoðunda isimlerini:)|pg||
nt|emre kaya: Ew 450 yazarsa hanesine çok iyi olur|pg||
nt|emre kaya: 420 egale skor olur|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: double?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: Patterson hasn't quite got his hand across yet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: i guess this will keep them out of slam though|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nurkumkale: Emre sen bilirsin ben Ýstanbul Briççilerine uzak kaldým çok|pg||
nt|emre kaya: batý ibrahim aksoy|pg||
nt|emre kaya: doðu jülide yardýmcý|pg||
nt|eamongall: We note the debutant Heneghan hogging the bidding with his 3 card suit |pg||
nt|eamongall: I played a match with Heneghan as Team mate one time and spent the week wondering how he blew a trick in 4@Hs ... they were 6@Hs-1 against me ... |pg||
nt|copeyj: game down on @C lead though and cant imagine wilkinson leading anything else|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, and 5@s is a very unlucky contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: fingering a heart.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: now the Q@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: asking lots of questions and thinking still|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: crouch says he cant have a shortage, and with that he settles on K@C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nurkumkale: teþekkürler|pg||
nt|clinch: Nervy times for Scottish viewers - can open eyes now|pg||
nt|clinch: So will be 3 IMPs to England nonetheless|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|eamongall: including 4 trump tricks despite missing trump ace ... opponents were gone to bar on that hand |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|eamongall: Turned out Heneghan had declared 4@S on a 3-1 fit making 10 |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: guess he will play A@H, AK diamond and exit a club?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: on a good day Q@C with E|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eamongall: this hand will take a while ... wondr how long before McDonagh realises Heneghan Hogged his hand |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|emre kaya: ataða bakmadýk el normal olarak pik dam çýkýyor 450 hep oluyor|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: 7@H is better than 7@S i suppose because you can throw two clubs from south|pg||
nt|athene: not that anyone will be getting that high :)|pg||
mb|2N|an|3 card raise plus|mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt natural GF?|pg||
nt|athene: or does it show specifical three-card support?|pg||
nt|athene: specifically|pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: grands a bit pushy but heart q with Sourth and good point about hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  more likely they will end up in 6@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 4@S is a little unambitious - north has a good hand once partner has a fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: last one    thx Alastair    thx specs|pg||
nt|clinch: and not one you want to have after going 2 down in a slam on the previous|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes, all the spice saved for the end in this set|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|emre kaya: 4 pike baraj gelicek|pg||
nt|emre kaya: baraj yaparken kaðýt olur ama:)|pg||
mb|3D|an|3 card raise|mb|p|nt|eamongall: I suppose Heneghan started out planning to ease the opps out of a @S contract |pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   a save against vul 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: south has bid it early|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: director pacing...time trouble|pg||
nt|ady: could be some problems in 4 spades  with heart leads  and a tap   and spades 4-1|pg||
nt|clinch: I think most clubs would see a lot of 510s on the traveller for this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: think crouch said 3 card raise but nothing written and i didnt hear properly|pg||
mb|4D|nt|copeyj: I thought N/S play this as a FG raise, and 2N wld have been invitational only, but I may be wrong|pg||
nt|clinch: Will see if Patterson-Crouch have the tools|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes simon, you may well be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 4@H from Crouch last train now perhaps|pg||
mb|4H|an|last train|nt|clinch: Thanks Simon|pg||
nt|clinch: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: CopeyJ on fire|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if Patterson will try 5@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has done a lot of bidding - but limited and 6-5|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, he must be tempted to go on|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|copeyj: I am also of the opinion they play 4@D as shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5 spades almost certain to go of|pg||
mb|5S|nt|clinch: yes|pg||
nt|clinch: well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: east taking the plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: in fact 4 spades down 2 in OR   so a good dwing around 11 for England|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: claiming 2 off early to save time|pg||
