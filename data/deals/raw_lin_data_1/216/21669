nt|vugraphzwd: East-West are on BBO for the first time ever, having risen to third place|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: the scores are here: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2012Jan_July/LadyMilneTrials/rank.txt|pg||
nt|mug: Nicole Cook and Chris Duckworth have a commanding lead|pg||
nt|mug: second and third well up for grabs|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Rosen deep in thought|pg||
nt|mug: nothing to think about, she should bid|pg||
mb|d|an| |mb|p|mb|2C|an| |mb|2D|nt|mug: double is perhaps spades and another?|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|dagold: dbl probably something like majors or a minor?|pg||
nt|dagold: the 2@h bid suggests it wasn't the majors originally|pg||
nt|mug: anyway it looks like she's shown her hand now and North can pass, 2@H is a good spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: 7 tricks are there|pg||
nt|mug: sorry it's one off|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like 1 off yes|pg||
nt|mug: defenders have to be careful|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Yes, double was majors or minors|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: if declarer can draw trumps and duck a club before a spade is played it can make|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|dagold: good point|pg||
nt|mug: better than defending 1NT on a low club lead, which is cold for 120|pg||

nt|dagold: messy hand here|pg||
nt|mug: now we've learned that the axe rarely descends, and there are a lot of ways bidding can gain|pg||
nt|dagold: NS can make 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: with EW able to make 4@s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pitiful:  what if anything would you open as south|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hi|pg||
nt|dagold: so 5@d doubled down 1 is par but it might even make on the K of spades lead|pg||
nt|mug: hello Peter|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dagold: 4@s held to 10 tricks on the King of clubs lead|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi peter|pg||
nt|mug: I'd open a weak 2@D if available otherwise pass|pg||
nt|dagold: i would pass south|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5S|nt|dagold: I dont like 3@d as I dont know what to do if partner bids 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i would bid 4@c masterminding|pg||
nt|dagold: I like a weak 2@d too|pg||
nt|mug: this may fail on a club lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if i had opened 3@d|pg||
nt|dagold: sure|pg||
nt|dagold: I think you have to but i wouldn't open 3@d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  vulnerable a bit ugly i agree but i have been there before|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Teshome knows 6@d is failing and 5@s may go off so I think she will pass|pg||
nt|pitiful:  never at red|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mug: may well lead a club for fear declarer has @DAQ|pg||
nt|dagold: declarer in for a severe shock|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mug: so that's down one, effective defensive bidding by NS|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dagold: 5@d might have made. Ace of clubs lead for example, or spade lead|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|vugraphzwd: I am told that earlier in the event East West conceded 2300 - nine off in 5Dx. This is known as a Newcastle in Australia, because 2300 is the postcode of Newcastle, New South ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Wales.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although maybe get to slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|an| |mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@d checkback|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mug: if South tries it may be hard to apply the breaks|pg||
nt|dagold: south might consider she is worth one move|pg||
nt|dagold: and I would agree|pg||
mb|4C|an| |nt|dagold: north is minimum though|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: North may consider she has great controls|pg||
mb|4D|an| |mb|p|mb|4H|an| |nt|dagold: 4@d-4@h-4@s enough though|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: envisaging something like @SKQxx @HKJ10xx @CQxx @Cx opposite|pg||
nt|dagold: easy cards for partner to discover|pg||
nt|mug: a hand I constructed carefully|pg||
nt|dagold: lol|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dagold: qx xx minors equates to be fair|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: now south has an easy pass I think|pg||
nt|dagold: done enough|pg||
nt|dagold: two tries|pg||
nt|mug: oh yes|pg||
nt|mug: it doesn't pay to push too hard for slam in a 4-4 fit, even if partner has a right hand, you still tend to need the 3-2 break|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mug: Teshome showed very fine judgement with 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  for me one of those hands where you think and if slam happens to make you say "well i nearly did bid on partner"|pg||
nt|mug: now the lemmings are headed over the cliff|pg||
nt|dagold: cant say the same about souths bid however|pg||
nt|pitiful:  however Anne more aggressive|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dagold: North made one positive noise and has a better hand than she might have had|pg||
nt|pitiful:  now 5@h|pg||
nt|pitiful:  5@s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: even 5@s likely to fail|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|dagold: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 5@D was three KC and South has the other two, she couldn't stop |pg||
nt|dagold: south has really over bid but it has play|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well i have been in worse, when these make you know it is your day|pg||
nt|dagold: not here sadly|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mug: needs 3-2 spades onside and further handling, around the 30% mark|pg||
nt|mug: here's a question for you both, is it better to play these hands in 6@S or 5@S?|pg||
nt|dagold: 6@s I suspect|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|pitiful:  i hate playing 5M down 1|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pitiful:  uncontested|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: infact am sure that is mathematically better than 5@s on these hands|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mug: we can calculate it|pg||
nt|dagold: many layouts that beat 6@s will beat 5@s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mug: do you agree with my estimate of 30% for 6@S?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mug: and what is your estimate of 5@S?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|s2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dagold: seems reasonable, perhaps on the high side|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not sure on the odds but might have with @s1-4 if East's singleton is the 9, 10 or Q|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|pitiful:  5@s would be what|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d6|nt|pitiful:  maybe 70%|pg||
nt|dagold: make 6@s with singleton 9 or T? I doubt you would double finness|pg||
nt|mug: more than that, you can cope with most 4-1 spades onside|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay says 39% chance of playing the spades for no loser|pg||
nt|dagold: but you are far from solid|pg||
nt|dagold: even with the trumps|pg||
mc|10|nt|dagold: far a bit strong|pg||
pg||
qx|o25|st||md|3SA4H9832DA543CK96,SK8632HAJ654DK87C,S975HQDQJ6CAT8532,SQJTHKT7DT92CQJ74|sv|e|nt|dagold: but you arent solid|pg||
nt|mug: that's how I came to 30%, on the basis that you are 75% if trumps behave|pg||
nt|mug: I make 5@S 75%|pg||
nt|mug: maybe 80%|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes probably 80|pg||
nt|dagold: call it 77.5|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was forgetting 4-1 onside|pg||
nt|pitiful:  earlier|pg||
nt|mug: ok call it 77.5%|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: and let's assume the other table are in 4@S|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mug: making the same number of tricks as you|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  4@s here|pg||
nt|dagold: i dont like 1@s at all|pg||
nt|dagold: why not michaels|pg||
nt|dagold: hand seems perfect|pg||
nt|mug: this would be great if I could find my calculator|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  for me always michaels with 5-5 Majors if i am worth a bid|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: quite a view to pass 3@s as west|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 trumps in partners hand will be a game usually|pg||
nt|dagold: then E would double 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  5@c hoping for singleton @s opposite|pg||
nt|dagold: yes but too much|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@c enough|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dagold: south can always raise with small singleton spade|pg||
nt|dagold: and a good enough hand|pg||
nt|dagold: and might have bid already|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mug: according to my calculations you're better in 5@S which is a 2.25 IMP error, whilst 6@S is a 4.4 IMP error|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|dagold: but Id rather respect myself in the morning and do my 4.4 imp|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dagold: of course thats assuming I cant play in 4S|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c6|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d7|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mug: yes that was the question|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d2|mc|8|pg||
qx|o26|st||md|4S84HKQJDK52CQT972,S2HA9762DQJT876C4,SJ9765HT43D93C865,SAKQT3H85DA4CAKJ3|sv|b|nt|mug: interesting conclusion, all players hate to play 5M but in that case it was better to stop than play a terrible slam|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|an| |nt|dagold: vile 2N opener|pg||
nt|mug: no I think I prefer 2@C|pg||
nt|dagold: hand is worth about 23.5 I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oh good i am glad you think that|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dagold: I would open 2@c and rebid 2@s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  so would i|pg||
nt|mug: of course, it's a suit hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  prefer 1@s to 2N but a long way behind 2@c|pg||
nt|dagold: agree|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  opening 2N on offshape almost as popular as 1N nowdays|pg||
nt|dagold: this has gone horribly, but making |pg||
nt|mug: 4@H on 8-2 doubleton not ideal, I think a natural 4NT was the call|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dagold: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pitiful:  maybe not available as natural for e-w|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dagold: one reason not to bid 4@h is if partner is slammy they may go on, expecting 3@h|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mug: but I think she'll get away with it, and 4NT is down on heart leads, cutting off the dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzwd: Rosen looks surprised that E only had 2 hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dagold: I am not surprised and perhaps E was surprised at her dummy on the last hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|d6|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mug: I think 4@H shows three in standard methods|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|mc|10|pg||
qx|o27|st||md|1SA6HKT2DAQJ9CA962,ST953HJ74D532CQ54,SQJHA98653D4CJ873,SK8742HQDKT876CKT|sv|o|nt|pitiful:  maybe a good hand for completing transfers with 3 card support|pg||
nt|mug: it's an excellent method|pg||
nt|mug: EW were lucky to escape there|pg||
nt|pitiful:  at least then west can prefer 5@d|pg||
nt|dagold: here E would bid 3@s showing 5@s and 2@h|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mug: this looks like a regulation 4@H, there's a bit in the play|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|an|Support Double|nt|mug: on Friday evening Teshome declined to apply restricted choice with this combination, let's see if she is willing to apply it here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dagold: a weakness of support doubles is shown here. North should try 4@h and now south has 6 points more than she might have|pg||
nt|dagold: is she therefore suppused to bid on?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: at least I would bid 4@h as north|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  not sure i would have bid 3N|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: and I would have doubled 3@s as south, unlikely 3N is right spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  double looks more sensible|pg||
nt|mug: have to try it, what's the worst that can happen?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  worse is partner doesn't have @s Jack|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and not 9 quick tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dagold: I am with you Peter. 3@s doubled will be fine if 3N making, I think it is more flexible|pg||
nt|mug: I meant 4@H|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|pitiful:  oh sorry :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dagold: ah I would bid 4H as north directly over 3@s|pg||
nt|dagold: if partner has a suitbale weak NT it may make|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|pitiful:  so would i|pg||
nt|dagold: I am 6-4 and have been supported|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dagold: I do not defend 3@s|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mug: amazing|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|pitiful:  but i also prefer not to play compulsory support doubles and when you see what i open....|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mug: I suppose it's only the overtrick|pg||
nt|dagold: and I prefer not to play support doubles|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|h5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mug: I wasn't counting right when I said there was a bit in the play|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|pitiful:  east getting enplayed|pg||
nt|dagold: I was told they were not invented for playing with precision but it seems to me they work better in that system|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well i like support doubles at 1 level only|pg||
nt|dagold: nice play|pg||

nt|dagold: Robson-Allfrey play them everywhere at all levels. Even say 1@c-(1@s)-X-(1N)-X shows 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes but he invented it for use in a natural system i was told|pg||
nt|mug: interesting|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not a bad 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: once got mowed down by Walter Johnson|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dagold: who informed me of that, and I guess he would know|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dagold: I would invite as north|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mug: yes he is an authority on all things Meckwell|pg||
nt|dagold: some case for ignoring the spade fit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  will need a partial elimination and endplay to have any chance|pg||
nt|mug: the South hand is much too good for a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|dagold: he told me what a great idea it was and I said well it was invented by Rodwell who plays precision|pg||
nt|dagold: and he bit my head off |pg||
nt|mug: she'd have played there with me|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dagold: saying Rodwell actually invented it for standard american|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would have passed 1N as well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but then i would not have opened 1N either|pg||
nt|dagold: I am not allowed to pass with 8 facing 15-17 in my partnership|pg||
nt|mug: the @H109 and @C109 make the difference between a very poor game and an excellent one|pg||
nt|dagold: it is actually an agreement|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but you play 14-16 :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|dagold: and 9 facing 14-16. we are 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oh ok|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|pitiful:  sorry :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mug: I would advance facing a partner who thinks the South cards are a 15-17 NT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|dagold: and i advance facing someone who plays them as well as my partner does|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dagold: I am surprised you dont want to tackle 24/25 point 3Ns vul when you declare so well also Tom|pg||
nt|pitiful:  no wonder my partner's pass 1N|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, mine seem to also Peter!|pg||
nt|mug: it's up to partner to decide how much work he gives me as declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Back with match 16 very soon ...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dagold: our view is the opposite. Partner must give us a chance to tackle a tricky one if we fancy it|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dagold: more partnership game then|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|pc|sA|nt|mug: can't burn the candle at both ends, partners mostly seem to have 14 for their 15-17 NTs these days|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mug: anything to be done here or was it just unlucky to find @CKJ offside?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|mc|9|nt|mug: they don't have anything like Rosen's hand here, that's for sure|pg||
nt|dagold: if your range is not 15-17 that is another matter but if it is...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  unlucky for Anne|pg||
nt|dagold: I think an upgrade is reasonable but not mandatory. depends on where you partnership is on opening 14 and that kind of thing|pg||
nt|mug: let's just say that DB and I don't miss many marginal games|pg||
nt|dagold: lol between you, you are about right|pg||

nt|vugraphzwd: The opening lead was made to 2NT but now the director has been called|pg||
nt|mug: ah I see|pg||
nt|dagold: oh|pg||
nt|mug: Brock was passing a 2NT response to her 1@D|pg||
nt|dagold: so it went 1@d-2N all pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D   2NT  (invite) so North passed|pg||
nt|dagold: a great shame for NS|pg||
nt|mug: well NS control the screen, I don't see why they should have any redress|pg||
nt|dagold: how did that happen?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gross did not see 1@D|pg||
nt|mug: unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: SEEMS DISASTER-HAS STRUCK FOR N/S|pg||
nt|mug: the tray wasn't pushed far enough through|pg||
nt|dagold: in a junior european nearly 10 years ago my partner passed my 1@s opener with 4-card support and a 12 count vs the netherlands|pg||
nt|dagold: didnt see my bid|pg||
nt|mug: hardly East-West's fault|pg||
nt|dagold: we picked up 6 imps for our 140|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am not a fan of mechanical screen errors|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: The board hadn't been pulled all the way through and everyone on this side of the screen thought it was a pass|pg||
nt|dagold: but this is particularly harsh punishment|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 4@S would have been down, David?:)|pg||

nt|mug: yes I believe the score will stand|pg||
nt|dagold: I am careful to pull the tray all the way through or push it from the other side if I dont feel sure|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps Brock and Gross can bid a slam on this hand instead?|pg||
nt|dagold: especially when say a surpise double is added at the end of the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: The hand was claimed as 12 tricks, the TD has gone to consult as to whether there is any adjustment|pg||
nt|mug: but they will have a pre-empt from Constantin to contend with|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|dagold: I might boost it with 4@h as West or even 4@d|pg||
nt|mug: maybe they bid slam out of anger now|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: What do you suggest now, 4NT or 5@D?|pg||
nt|dagold: good reason not to bid 4@d!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|dagold: 4N could be silly facing say 33 or even 2-3 minors|pg||
nt|roswolf: or not i think passions/emtions may now be at work|pg||
nt|dagold: tricky hand actually|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dagold: double is clear|pg||
nt|dagold: so what is the solution|pg||
nt|mug: by the way someone suggested that EW should waive the good fortune as an act of sportsmanship|pg||
nt|mug: I say absolutely not|pg||
nt|dagold: I agree Tom|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|mug: the field have rights, you are not allowed to waive them in a multiple event|pg||

nt|dagold: how do we solve this bidding problem though|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You let the TD rule, full stop.|pg||
mc|10|nt|dagold: 4N then 5@d over 5@c sounds just like a good 5@d bid|pg||
nt|mug: 5@D was not unreasonable |pg||
nt|mug: I don't like being asked what I'd bid in these close cases where I can see all the hands|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h being suggested|pg||
nt|dagold: then over 4@s?|pg||
pg||

nt|dagold: pulling 4@s to 5@c suggested, does that show a diamond canape?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: There is no good solution to a hand like that with 6-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|mug: but in my book it's RKC|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 4N as minors is also playable|pg||
nt|mug: it is|pg||
nt|dagold: 4h then 5@d over 4@s might have seen south correct to 6@c|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Natural GF|mb|p|nt|mug: ideally you'd have a meaning for each of these sequences, probably Meckwell do|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mug: most of us muddle along|pg||
nt|mug: 2@D natural and game-forcing|pg||
nt|dagold: did Sarah really pass 1@s?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mug: nothing to be said but 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: that is a good 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It is because you have @SAQ over opener|pg||
nt|mug: yes I would bid 2@H but there is some kind of a case for pass|pg||
nt|dagold: the hand is basically AKxx AT9xxx xx x|pg||
nt|dagold: thats a huge hand|pg||
nt|dagold: need very little for 4@h and you can defend spades|pg||
nt|mug: passing is very old-fashioned|pg||
nt|dagold: just a nice 7 count opposite and its your game hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dagold: no case for pass in my view|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East has to be alert here and go up with @CA|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway hasn't matterd here I suspect all roads led to the doomed 3N|pg||

nt|dagold: 2@s wow|pg||
nt|dagold: with 21!|pg||
nt|dagold: double as a start seems normal|pg||
nt|mug: she's supposed to double, not like she would be averse to defending 2@H*|pg||
nt|dagold: partner might be leaving it in|pg||
nt|mug: ironically it is North-South's game hand|pg||
nt|mug: this will be interesting|pg||

nt|vugraphzwd: biltcliffe coup in prospect?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: quite a 4@S bid by Lavinia Constantin|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: which although it has pushed the opps to 5@h she will probably lose 650|pg||
nt|mug: and now what, 21 points but how many defensive tricks|pg||
nt|dagold: true, 5@s the winning call|pg||
nt|mug: she knows Brock must have something special for this bidding|pg||
nt|mug: and holding stiff @HK is hardly in her favour|pg||
nt|dagold: and Brock has bid all that without the H!K|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: The other table are being told to play board 37 under TD's supervision|pg||
nt|dagold: so technically you should not double|pg||
nt|mug: on the other hand @CKQx @DAQJ look like defence|pg||
mb|d|nt|mug: hard to see how it can be down more than off if partner couldn't double it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: *one|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mug: now it's a matter of how declarer uses her dummy entry|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dagold: anything vaguely sensible works|pg||

nt|mug: looks like regulation 4@S|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mug: immediate 2@S was a weak jump shift, so this is invitational|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They must be playing weak jump shifts, which makes 2@S invitational|pg||
nt|mug: Constantin should move on|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry Tom|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Commentators are correct, Sarah has just explained at the table|pg||
nt|dagold: still that is some invite|pg||
nt|mug: my typing is faster than my brain these days|pg||
nt|dagold: a 1N rebid makes it so much easier|pg||
nt|dagold: W just bids 4@s|pg||
nt|mug: I think 2@S is the right bid, maximum of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe 3@S by East|pg||
nt|mug: yes and West will add the fourth|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dagold: well done Lavinia|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: whole point of the method is to stop in 2@S when East has a misfitting distributional opener|pg||

nt|mug: club lead will clear up the play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dagold: good lead|pg||
nt|dagold: very good lead infact|pg||
nt|mug: aha, a trump, now she has to work|pg||
nt|mug: 3@S over 2@D by the way is either a very strong invitational, or (my choice) a slam-going single-suiter with a good suit, according to taste|pg||
nt|mug: more than one kibitzer asked about it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mug: this will be a real test|pg||
nt|dagold: low spade better as you dont want the k taken, and keep a high trump in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: declarer can test clubs and fall back on H finesse if the @CJ doesnt come down in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|mug: first Brock has to win @SA and play a second round, otherwise declarer can ruff a club in dummy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: She will probably have to take the heart finesse, as she most likely does not have the entries to ruff out @HK anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mug: simple line is as Jonathan suggests|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: I can't claim credit for that  - Paul Huggins' pearls of wisdom|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dagold: I am not so sold on the 2@s bid. that is a mighty hand and could well miss game. say a 14 count with a stiff spade, or such could produce game|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|mug: well you'd raise an Acol 3@S rebid to four with that hand so it must be close to a move in this method|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You did read the manual, did you not, Tom?|pg||
nt|dagold: they will play in the future I am sure|pg||

nt|mug: she's an Acol Bridge Club regular I'm informed|pg||

nt|mug: right I have to go and read "Mr Silly", apparently the bridge didn't qualify, goodbye from me|pg||
