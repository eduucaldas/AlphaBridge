pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||

nt|sybarra2: hello Phillip |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzty: yes|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  zia needs no interoduction, and david bakshi has had a very successful last few years|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.tgrsbridge.com/2012_Auction_Pairs/2012_Auction_Pairs.html   for all info you need|pg||
nt|vugraphzty: as per North: J shows QJ or J10|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|phil_20686:  Double dummy there is is likely now a tenth trick available, south must come down to 4 tricks|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  four cards|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  if he gets rid of a diamond ace and another sets up extras, if he gets rid of his spades the ace and then JD endplays him|pg||
pc|c2|nt|clinch: Made easier as declarer needs to enter his hand with an ace|pg||

nt|phil_20686:  a large number of people play two suited major overcalls in the UK, in a multi landy/rev capaletti set up|pg||
mb|4S|nt|clinch: Bakhshi is likely to have a decent hand for raise of Zia's protection; Zia considering how bad he might be!|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||

nt|phil_20686:  did they really duck that heart?|pg||
nt|clinch: Good result for Zia - to balance the 3NT+2, which scored only 2 MP|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686:  can the operator confirm that he really ducked?|pg||

nt|clinch: If Zia had played for @d 3-3, then could have escaped with -1|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  presumeably the low club asked for a diamond switch, but south has a certain route in hearts and indication that declarers diamonds are going away, so no hurry|pg||
pc|d2|mc|7|nt|phil_20686:  no indication*|pg||
nt|psyck: another gift for Zia|pg||
nt|clinch: -100 will probably score ok, yes|pg||
nt|clinch: though always possible in theory|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  might have been easier for the defence if south had let the diamond run to his partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we wait for change |pg||
nt|phil_20686:  rather than rising with the k|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for specs,  but this is pairs |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, -1 will be an above average score for Zia|pg||

nt|clinch: Since the early glitch in 3NT, Zia and Bakhshi have stormed to second|pg||

nt|sybarra: the voice commentary is discussing overcall suits |pg||
nt|sybarra: well those are different suits |pg||
nt|sybarra: they are discussing longer suits,  but solid like j10xxxx |pg||
nt|clinch: The more I think about it, the more I think taking the @d with the ace would have worked|pg||
nt|clinch: Continue a heart, and declarer still needs to work on clubs for 9 tricks, but may take the "guaranteed" @d finesse again while N has a @c entry|pg||
