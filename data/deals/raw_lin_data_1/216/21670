nt|psridhar: did we get a look at next session deal by accident?|pg||
nt|rv: we will start getting comparision from this deal onwards|pg||
nt|vugraphzvy: brd is kept in wrong direction|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|rv: Kamat is sponsored by Mr Sudesh Kamant from Goa, his partner Finton Lewis also from Goa, Ivan and Subir are Mumbai based|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|psridhar: inStd auction this S hand ok for splinter raise of 1@s |pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: MISMATCH is Ms Hema's team who gives new and novel names for her teams in every tourney|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psridhar: very innovative thinker Hema|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: I asked her reason for different names and she told me that she does that since her team is never constant and also possibly her artistic bent of mind|pg||
nt|psridhar: with Subbir's hand i prefer either a preemptive 4@d OR a pass ; 3@d seems to serve no purpose and may mislead pd on his values|pg||
nt|psridhar: did Hema miss a XX to show her Ace of @d there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rv: 5@d is a good save vs 4@s, 5@s makes for N-S though|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|rv: yes she missed redouble and now compensanting with 4n|pg||
nt|psridhar: if 5@D was balsted at first avlble opportunity it will propel NS into slam -thats a big plus for such venture|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|psridhar: Gutsy bid by Hema ( if later it turns out her side lost becos of this, i will change the adjective ) :)|pg||
