mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 2! is probably artificial game force, known as XY NoTrump, a good method.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: if Xx showed power, I'd submit both north's first pass and south's 2@D shold be forcing.  Still I might want to get that suit in, as north|pg||

nt|roswolf: to our screens. To my fellow commentators David and Vladimir for their perceptive insights many thanks as well as to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: last one...next match at 15.10|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: That one may not make The Times|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand valuation by S, though that does not automatically make 2N the correct call. since N is not a passed hand, 2N could preempt them out of a slam sometimes. playing as NS ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do, though, that is a bigger danger when the main suit is diamonds, because a 1D opening would show length whereas 1C doesnt make much of a move toward an eventuakl club contract ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: anyway|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|othered1: using NT openings as aggressive weapons hasn't shown well for NS so far this set|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: I feel 4 hearts better here|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: if declarer leads a high heart in the middle game, north wins and continues spades, south throwing a diamond and declarer is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this lacks aces |pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|othered1: Tough in the modern game to get your messages in on south hand, weak KS, good @S fit and 7-card side suit that might be best as trumps.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Unfair to use a big @C system, which may well allow south to describ e  his hand.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one top spade and ace of hearts should do it|pg||
nt|ady: does best to play A@H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|golfsquash: 2@d was checkback for both Majors and for strength. It guaranteed 5 spades.|pg||
