pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|mug: playing diamonds will do her no good|pg||

nt|athene: trump to ace and run @CQ, pin everything on the club finesse i suppose|pg||

nt|vugraphzwd: sorry lost the play |pg||
nt|athene: yes but defence have spades to cash|pg||
mc|7|nt|mug: how do they cash them?|pg||
nt|athene: you keep control but you lose six tricks|pg||

mb|1C|an| |nt|athene: if you finesse clubs west wins, east can ruff a diamond and cash some spades, so it is always down surely|pg||
nt|mug: @CQ to the king, then @DK, throw a spade on that, claim|pg||
nt|eggy:  Perhaps it was kust a  trick short|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mug: defence had two tricks, @CK was the third, @DK the fourth, @HK the fifth|pg||
nt|athene: yes and one spade|pg||
nt|eggy:  if west palays a club back?|pg||
nt|mug: no ep|pg||
nt|mug: club back is better|pg||
nt|eggy:  so we'll assume that she did that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: agreed as one down|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: what is west planning to do if her partner rebids 2@H? tricky|pg||
nt|mug: 2@S I suppose|pg||
nt|eggy:  Do we know if 2C is natural?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|eggy:  or does N know?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: 2c nat|pg||
nt|eggy:  i SHOULD SAY :)|pg||
nt|mug: it's charitable to assume so|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|eggy:  I don't think so!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: Dhondy took it as Michaels|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H gives us some reason for uncharitableness|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i suppose 3@H might just about be a fit-jump for clubs, but that is unlikely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: can't fault the 4@H bid in any way|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: seems like a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|athene: ace and another club and declarer can still misguess them|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|eggy:  At least the screens saved an ethical dilemna|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would she lead @CA from AQx?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i suppose you might argue that @CAQx is not an appealing lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|athene: i think it's sensible for 1@C (2+) 2@C to be natural; you can use 2@d for majors if you want|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: but discussing it is sort of a good idea|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|mug: yes I like to play that way too|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|eggy:  Well it's not too hard for EW to work out where their tricks may come from|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|mc|9|nt|eggy:  Why take away the 2D bid?|pg||
nt|mug: never forgotten it except when opponents opened a Polish Club and there was confusion|pg||
nt|eggy:  as it is possible that the 1C can be clubs but not that it can be diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: well playing very loose 1@C even (as here) with perfectly biddable diamonds is common these days|pg||
nt|mug: jump overcall in diamonds is not a very important bid, that's the theory anyway|pg||
pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: i think that south hand might be a bit good for 1nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: maybe with 4333 it is ok but it just looks like about 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: you definitely don't need agreements when to treat 1@C as natural, best to play the same methods regardless |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|athene: nice @D10 for declarer means she can't be attacked in that suit|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|eggy:  although a heart guess will bring it in |pg||
nt|mug: East couldn't afford to duck the second club in case declarer started with four|pg||
nt|eggy:  Probably better for East to have not signalled her entry ...|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will really not want to run the @H10; much more likely to lead to the queen and then decide whether to finesse hearts or diamonds|pg||
nt|mug: will survive unless Dhondy is inspired enough to run @H10|pg||
nt|mug: no reason to do that|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eggy:  well it looks tight to get hearts wrong as there is always the d finesse to fall back on|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: if north decides to believe that the @C9 was showing @DK, then maybe running the @H10 is the odds play|pg||

nt|eggy:  playing the winning line it seems from that play?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mug: East is bound to have one of the big cards or she would have ducked trick two|pg||
nt|eggy:  or not|pg||
nt|mug: she may not necessarily signal it honestly|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|athene: yes, i think it was definitely a position where a signal was going to help declarer more than partner|pg||

mb|p|nt|mug: 6@C is a good spot, 7@C has play|pg||

nt|mug: perfectly reasonable actions but won't be a success for NS|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|athene: yes we can see passing really did not work out well but a lot of times north will have a less offensively-oriented hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: say with a diamond singleton instead of void|pg||
nt|mug: one off I think|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: and then pass will be fine|pg||
