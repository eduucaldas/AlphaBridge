mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but it could be a winner of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S seems remarkable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4 card major with longer minor|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if just S + m with no length specifications, i agree Geoff|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe not totally trivial, since W is aceless and E has close to minimum possible trump holding|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: but i do predict they will get there|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: didnt mean to say "trump holding", meant club holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: same difference on this hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should like his hand for clubs despite only doubleton. his "in & out valuation" (a concept from the great Jeff Rubens classic "Secrets of Winning Bridge") is as good as it gets|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a bit like groping in the dark|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: groping in the dark is for AFTER the session:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could afford to bid 4@h the first time without mkaing South think he had a good hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugraphztx: i asked players what they think which result it is|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: all 4 players said that they have no clue|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: and that match can go either way from this point|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: they have managed to play this back to front... so TF is DG for this board and vice versa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they both had hard bids. E is a bit suit-oriented for 5N perhaps, but that does bring clubs into the picture which is essential on such a primey hand. and i dont think W ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can be faulted because for all he knew it was crucial to protect one of his kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: 2@h is 1-D overcall style|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to like the look of his hearts after West's opening|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably he has passed hoping to get the chance to X 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  at this vulnerability, the bonus for bidding game is at its least and the reward for picking up a penalty is at its highest|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: fair comment marshall but irish eyes are still smiling|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 5N is just a more flexible way of bidding 6C, and as i said E was right to have a preference for clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and W did not know there were no aces missing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have jumped to 3@s|pg||
