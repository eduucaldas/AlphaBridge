nt|roswolf: this may be feisty|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup 3@H was cast-iron|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 18 HCP South is too good for 1NT and opens a strong 1@c|pg||
nt|wendle: ew with the points, ns with the @H save here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wendle: how many from south?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wendle: well judged by whyte, 3n on for ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvw: 5@D -1 though|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: so perhaps a good board for SBU|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvw: unless there's something im missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  what system do NS play? - a canapÃ© system? - major before minor?|pg||
nt|wendle: you? surely not!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: :P|pg||
nt|wendle: should be -1 though|pg||
nt|wendle: 4@H did the job nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: actually he might make?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: ruff two hearts, draw trumps and cash spades. then play A and another club|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: gordon needs to be sharp enough to ditch K@C|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzvw: (which he will ofc)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can make 4@s tricks if he wins in hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see a lot of finesses and must guess which to take|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wendle: we're about to find out|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzvw: its a legitimate line, sometime someone has KQ tight|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|golfsquash: West did have 4D available to show a stronger 4@s opening|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|golfsquash: He has a lot outside of spades to open a preempt|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|vugraphzvw: ah no, with 3-1 break he cant ruff the last H and draw|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: so E will have a safe exit?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have been able to tell from East's carding who has the last @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @h suit is now frozen with West on lead but safe for East to play|pg||

nt|roswolf: this might lead to a penalty|pg||
nt|roswolf: hu marshall:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: how frisky will north be?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Convention card for NS http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/BurnsMurchan.pdf|pg||
nt|pelu:  @D is max|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, pass is unlikely:)|pg||
nt|pelu:  4@d|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but it could be a winner of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S seems remarkable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4 card major with longer minor|pg||
nt|wendle: as linda points out correctly, if tedd had unblocked the spades before playing third trump the heart king goes on spade ace and now cold|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu:  even if I play 2@S as @S+minor I would bid 3@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if just S + m with no length specifications, i agree Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 4-7 is within the system but is too wide for me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South wants to compete but does not want a @h lead if West declares|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvw: so, as predicted, my analysis was flawed again|pg||
nt|wendle: its ok, bas, we dont expect you to get it right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: :)|pg||
nt|wendle: north giving some thought it seems?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: yes, board on other side and i assume its not E in the tank|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|wendle: shouldnt be too taxing this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: N says "sorry if we've got a slam on"|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  X may ask for a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump lead, looking at good hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: with the greatest of respect 3nt is off the scale of sanity|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d lead works best but hard for North to visualise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: 4@sX not alerted by S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  @c lead just as good if South does not attempt to cash a 2nd @c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not a fan of trump leads as you may know|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Welcome to Henry Bethe on voice commentary|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  4@c might have been pass or correct, which would perhaps explain why South did not do that|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will be expecting North to have @c for the @dK to be wrong|pg||

nt|vugraphzvw: TF says maybe he should bid 3@H but both he and DG end up agreeing that its just one of those things...|pg||
nt|roswolf: now an easy slam to bid - but after the previous disaster who knows!?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2D|an|majors - any range|nt|wendle: comparisons starting to filter thru from open room, just click movie and then 'open room' if you want to see what happened at the other table|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  North just judge how many @h to bid|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: partnership harmony|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe not totally trivial, since W is aceless and E has close to minimum possible trump holding|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: didnt mean to say "trump holding", meant club holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: same difference on this hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should like his hand for clubs despite only doubleton. his "in & out valuation" (a concept from the great Jeff Rubens classic "Secrets of Winning Bridge") is as good as it gets|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a bit like groping in the dark|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North could afford to bid 4@h the first time without mkaing South think he had a good hand|pg||

nt|frankaus: DD its good but 16 V15 ? no fit ?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  on 18 Wales as EW did get to 3NT from the right side but NS saved |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and Wales went on to 5@c|pg||
nt|wendle: this should be fun|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphzvw: actually, does 7@C qualify as decent for you?|pg||
nt|wendle: better than the last one we saw!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: i asked players what they think which result it is|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: all 4 players said that they have no clue|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: and that match can go either way from this point|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: they have managed to play this back to front... so TF is DG for this board and vice versa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they both had hard bids. E is a bit suit-oriented for 5N perhaps, but that does bring clubs into the picture which is essential on such a primey hand. and i dont think W ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can be faulted because for all he knew it was crucial to protect one of his kings|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphztx: 2@h is 1-D overcall style|pg||
mb|p|nt|wendle: yes, haha|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to like the look of his hearts after West's opening|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably he has passed hoping to get the chance to X 1NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzvw: actually does a spade lead beat 7@C on all the favourable layouts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at this vulnerability, the bonus for bidding game is at its least and the reward for picking up a penalty is at its highest|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  South might have jumped to 3@s|pg||

nt|wendle: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvw: it appears there's a problem with board 28 and the players here may need to play a substitue board to compensate|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Are the hand records, play records, etc., available anywhere?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|golfsquash: redouble is Rosencranz, a raise with one of the top honours.|pg||
