mb|p|nt|brolucius: But it would be stretching a bit for South to upgrade to a 15-17 hand.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some pairs play 5-card majors and open 1@C on all other hands that are not suitable for a 1NT opening (perhaps 12-14 and 18+ here).|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|mug: not a great advertisement for the method|pg||

nt|brolucius: You're welcome. I am glad I do not have such an obvious and rather silly rule under my own name. |pg||

nt|mug: do you have a link to that one too Roland?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|18-19|nt|mug: 1NT = 18-19|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's a tough one, Tom|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: It's not among my 3,000 macros I must confess|pg||
nt|mug: she'd have rebid 1@S with 12-14 |pg||
nt|brolucius: What system is that, Tom?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Useful space principle|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|mug: it's what I played with David Gold, I think he coaches this pair|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is quite common to play transfers opposite a 1@C opening nowadays.|pg||

nt|brolucius: How is your new partnership coming along, Tom?|pg||
nt|mug: not too bad|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 17 matches altogether over three days|pg||
nt|mug: quite tough schedule|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Seems right to open 1S in 3rd seat, even if it is within range for 1NT. Because you have a good suit to mention.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|brolucius: 3@S, as usual, shows only around the values for a normal 2@S.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dkkello:  ok, not that Caplan!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: No, but it worked because she has pushed them to 3@S rather than 2@S.|pg||
nt|mug: true|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps you can make a note of the tactic, Tom. Ready for the Camrose.|pg||
nt|mug: need a diamond shift fast now|pg||
nt|mug: noted|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, before declarer sets up a discard.|pg||
nt|mug: and balancing is also dangerous|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unless East switches to diamonds, declarer will be able to draw trumps and lead towards the @HQ to set up a diamond discard.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|mug: but still it helps for partner to know you are sound in this position|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||

mc|9|nt|vugraphzwd: Back in 10 mins for round 2|pg||
nt|mug: stiff heart was possible|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I see.|pg||
nt|mug: West should have played her lowest club|pg||
nt|mug: @CA was also very strange|pg||
nt|mug: better a diamond at trick two|pg||
nt|mug: as you said, David, they needed diamond tricks anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but if the @C9 had been explicitly chosen it could have suggested a singleton heart, as you say.|pg||
nt|brolucius: They should be re-starting soon. These are the England trials for the Lady Milne Trophy (the women's version of the Camrose home internationals).|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are some relatively inexperienced pairs competing, but they are unlikely to be on VuGraph. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing in such a Trial is a valuable experience in itself.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3 of the 4 names have been changed, so we are moving ever closer to some.... BRIDGE.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Make that 4 out of 4.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was on holiday with the present VG operator (Simon Cocheme) when I met my wife in Tunisia - some 35 years ago. So, if he makes any stupid errors, I will pretend I did not notice.|pg||
pg||
qx|o8|st||md|2SK52HAT6DAKJCJ874,SAJ4HJ42DQ65CQ962,SQT7HK98753D873C5,S9863HQDT942CAKT3|sv|o|nt|brolucius: Oh, we have Heather Bakhshi instead. Well, I have never been on holiday with her...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I have often admitted that VG-operating would be beyond me, so I always appreciate the efforts of those who can do it.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Difficult for South to judge whether 3NT or 4@H would be the better game. (or perhaps if a partscore would be even better).|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Usually 3@C shows a minimum with a poor suit. But there are other (better) new systems around.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If 3@C did show a minimum and South bid 4@H anyway, perhaps she might have bid it a round earlier.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: 3@C is a shortage, I am told. Good news for South! |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mug: hello again|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer plays the @HA first and the queen comes, she should finesse against the jack on the second round (Restricted Choice).|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Tom has rejoined us to see if he can pick up any more useful tips for the second half of the Camrose.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You may find the heart suit instructive here.|pg||
nt|mug: ah I don't believe in that Restricted Choice nonsense :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: And I don't believe in your disbelief.|pg||
nt|mug: it's a lot of snake oil|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mug: Teshome will finesse on the way back of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: Snake Oil that works 2 times out of 3.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That play wins against Q or J with East and loses only to QJ. Odds of 2-to-1 in your favour.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Depends on whether she believes in Burn's Law.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: I suppose a trump lead is possible on this bidding. No, she has led a diamond.|pg||
nt|mug: yes a trump is normal|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|brolucius: The point is that West will be 5-5-2-1 or 5-5-1-2 much of the time and declarer may get a ruff in the short trump hand without a trump lead.|pg||

nt|athene: declarer settled for the safe 8; didn't want to lead to the @CK and find north wins the ace and puts another heart through, but really that was not going to happen|pg||

nt|Walddk2: To get out in a 5+ card suit|pg||
nt|mug: a lot of players like a conventional double of a strong notrump, some play it as either or|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: the issue here is whether south should bid hearts immediately or pass first then introduce them|pg||
nt|athene: which is stronger?|pg||
nt|mug: I like to play you pass with nothing until and unless partner forces you to bid something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know|pg||
nt|mug: but with this hand I think I'd pass just in case I can defend 2@C or 2@H doubled|pg||
nt|athene: north can advance with a simple 3@D here surely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|mug: yes 3@D would have been reasonable|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|mug: just out of interest, how much if you make @C10 the @C3?|pg||

pc|c8|nt|mug: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: well, maybe things are different when you are defending only 2@S, but still, a heart shift looked indicated there anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, that South hand is worth 10.1 KR points, so with a combined 25+ count North-South ought to be in game|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||

nt|mug: like AKQ J32 10432 KQ2?|pg||
nt|dburn: sure they are - but as far as I know the evaluator only works on single hands; it doesn't know that Kx facing singleton is not a lot of use most of the time|pg||

nt|mug: West has some juicy cards|pg||
nt|dburn: might even bid four|pg||
nt|athene: north can find her club suit now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S would not be unreasonable by West|pg||
nt|dburn: would be pretty tough for North to bid at the four level, but I guess she might|pg||
nt|athene: she may not know how much support for clubs was promised by south's double, but she can still bid on the general principle that EW have a fit, so NS do too...|pg||
nt|mug: depends whether South's double showed points or just diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwd: south told west her X meant good diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe West could have bid 3@d as a game try if she was unwilling to commit to 4@s|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Layout very friendly for declarer, but 4@S is a good contract|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mug: almost a certainty|pg||
nt|athene: if NS "sacrificed" in 5@C over 4@S, east might have to find a good lead|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @SK then the heart shift|pg||
nt|athene: small spade lead and the @HAQ can't be attacked?|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@s may just have sounded competitive to East, and her doubleton diamond was not a good holding on the bidding|pg||

nt|dburn: technically, in England at any rate, an alerted double is penalty, but I am not sure of the regulations here|pg||
nt|mug: screens|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sometimes you might double en route to 3nt in case you can pick up a penalty, but surely that is very unlikely here|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if south could bid 2@S for example, you would not feel great|pg||
