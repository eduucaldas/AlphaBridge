nt|vugraphzwd: We're off!|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East passes, I will be disappointed.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@D. Yes, exactly right!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|brolucius: West has no reason to suspect the double fit and quite rightly passes.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S looks the spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Or 5D, E-W.|pg||
nt|roswolf: not at red|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: +600 not good enough?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: I still think that 3@D was the right tactic. Very unlucky to find West with that precise hand.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Standings after 3 matches of 17 at  http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2012Jan_July/LadyMilneTrials/Travellers1.txt|pg||
nt|roswolf: this event is scored by cross-imps and therefore this hand will generate a lot of big swings i suspect|pg||
nt|brolucius: West could not have expected 5@D to make but there was a fair case for her to bid 5@D anyway. Might get out for one down and defeating 4S was unlikely. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: +28 maximum for a match of 7 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment david -would you have raised immediately as west?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, but I would bid 5@D over 4@S. |pg||
nt|roswolf: to game i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Brock & Gross have qualified for the last two years, and won the Lady Milne both times - first as EBU and then as England|pg||
nt|brolucius: West can expect some shape with partner when she opens a vul 3@D on a Q-high suit.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: this is a nasty hand - could be played at the 1 level or in slam depending on system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: A jump overcall is never weak in the pass-out weak.|pg||
nt|roswolf: after a strong club start by south 5/6@C IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..seat.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South doubles for take-out to show her fine hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM EAST MIGHT REGRET THAT BID|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S would show the good fit by West.|pg||
nt|roswolf: if north bids her clubs then n/s may well play in 5@C|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: WILL SOUTH TRY AGAIN?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is so much better than 4@H by West, which might be bid partly as a pre-empt.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The other big question is will Geoffrey get his upper-case shift unlocked?|pg||
nt|roswolf: old computer keyboard and clumsy fingers:(|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Caps-unlock is next to the Caps-lock, Geoffrey.|pg||
nt|roswolf: aah that's where I am going wrong|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S best for North. Why not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is tough for north but bidding is the lesser evil|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Passing at MP perhaps, 4@S at IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm -790 beckons|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 990|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: i stand corrected -990|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sally Brock is a former world champion and just about the best woman player in England. So, we must respect her judgement, although I would certainly have bid 4@S on her hand.|pg||
nt|copeyj: She is a current world champion, David|pg||
nt|copeyj: GM all|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morning Simon, welcome|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Apart from anything else, she has no reason to think that 4@H will go down (after West's 3@S bid).  So, 4@S is OK, even if it is 1 or 2 down.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Some players would bid 1NT on the first or second round on the West cards.|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w better stay low - they are missing too many aces for 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: No reason for them to arrive in game Geoffrey|pg||
pc|s8|nt|copeyj: This auction seems fine - 3@C an alternative with the E hand although four low clubs not pleasant|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Pass missing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: by North|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm a psyche by north would have enlivened proceedings|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: There is no side entry to the dummy, so it will be interesting to see how declarer plays the diamonds.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: 10 covered by king|pg||
nt|timb: pass saves 9+ imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: west who is well known for her aggression leaps to the "house" contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: No aggression required with 14 points opposite an opening bid.|pg||
nt|roswolf: gillians opening bids are often off centre|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer must be wary of South holding up a doubleton @DK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North willcover the 10 with the king, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North plays the king on West's @D10, declarer can duck in the dummy.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Brock made an expert play in the Lady Milne trials 2 years ago - rising with a diamond in second seat to block the suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I can't spell|pg||

nt|copeyj: Stop digging :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to think before playing the ace than afterwards.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|brolucius: It could have been costly if North held  @DK-x.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Director calls half time . . .|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that if/when this makes Madam Artivolans may make an appearance - Harrison-Gray's famous femme fatale|pg||
nt|brolucius: Simon Cocheme, our present VG operator, is an expert of bridge puns and has written several articles along those lines for English Bridge.|pg||

mc|11|nt|Walddk2: The question is, would North cover with Kxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: really +2!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, Brock picks up a bundle of IMPs for her @DK. Shouldn't have done, really. Declarer played too quickly.|pg||

nt|roswolf: tyhe fur may fly now|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: You don't need to worry whether North has @DK-x or DK-x-x if you duck on the first round. That's the point.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|copeyj: Geoffrey - I think we would all like to volunteer to buy you a new keyboard for Easter - what do you say? |pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand will stir the passions yet again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I will pay for new fingers too.|pg||

nt|dagold: NS|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|s7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think one must accept that pre-empts sometimes work|pg||
nt|brolucius: Difficult for N/S over such bidding, because they have no reason to know whether West is weak or strong. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S did not do anything silly|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|copeyj: 3@H now from Gross|pg||
nt|brolucius: Brock cannot be sure of 6 spades, since 2@H took up so much room.|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 3@S from Brock I expect|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dagold: 3N is best 4@s should make too although if E gets to switch to a low @c it may not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S and 3NT can both make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 3NT looks good, with values in both minors.|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||

nt|roswolf: last bd of this match coming up|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphzwd: Last board of the set ... next match starts at 11.50|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 2@H best for East, even if playing 4-card majors.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You can tell the audience about your view on this issue while we are on a break after this board, David. I know you are not a big fan|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dagold: not a big fan of what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pro/client selection for internationals|pg||
nt|dagold: ah ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I was talking to David Bird|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes I got that bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: There are good and bad aspects. What disappoints me is when England teams are weakened for the big championships. |pg||
nt|copeyj: No, David, they aren't|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dagold: any example teams?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Our line ups for the last few European and World Ch'ships have all been as strong as we could field|pg||
nt|copeyj: in my humble opinion|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|copeyj: Veldhoven - Brock/Smith, Dhondy/Senior, Stockdale/Brown|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|copeyj: same in Ostend 2010|pg||
nt|brolucius: Robson and Forrester have been missing for many years. They were one of the world's top pairs in their hey-day.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|copeyj: They were but they are no longer a partnership... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think David refers to the Open, Simon|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: I was looking forward to the medal haul.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dagold: but they stopped playing together|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: Yes, the open. Our women have done splendidly well.|pg||
nt|dagold: nothing to do with pro/client|pg||
nt|dagold: without the so called 'clients' the pros wouldnt be able to play enough bridge to get good enough to compete with the rest of the world|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is what Marc Smith tells me when we spend hours discussing it.|pg||
nt|dagold: what open team has had a client on it ina  amjor championship in the last say 12 years David?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: You miss my point, David. The top players with a sponsor in their team do not get through the trials.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Some do|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|dagold: the top playes would have to get normal jobs and wouldnt be able to spend the time training and going away|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|copeyj: Our premier league is the closest we have to an open trials, and the Allfrey team won that comfortably recently|pg||
nt|dagold: so we would barely have a team|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dT|pc|hK|mc|7|nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
nt|dagold: You speak as though we have 6 world class pairs all waiting in the flanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has worked in USA for decades, so why not in England?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is the problem andthe present 'solution' may be the best available. Meanwhile, it is disappointing for England fans.|pg||
nt|dagold: I am not sure which pairs you feel have missed out on the last few championships David|pg||
nt|dagold: or are Lauria-Versace really english?|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can't say that it is unavoidable when we do not have sponsors playing for England in such as football and cricket.|pg||
nt|dagold: We dont in bridge in the major championships, or havent done since 1996 I believe|pg||
nt|dagold: think we should focus on trainging/preparing better rather than blaming the clients that allow the proffesionals to have the chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure why you are disappointed, David. Did the open team not do very well in Beijing?|pg||
nt|dagold: only silver sadly|pg||
nt|copeyj: "only" :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, and in the Olympiad in the Netherlands.|pg||
nt|dagold: Bermuda Bowl in 2005 also|pg||
nt|dagold: also did well in Istanbul 2004, winning the group without losing a match|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway Id like to continue this debate but I have to go to work :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: And I have to go shopping with my wife...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no wife, so what am I supposed to do?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|dagold: with a singleton diamond and 44M you must act|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is reasonable here|pg||
nt|mug: I think he should have something reasonable game all facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|dagold: so you play 3M and go 1 off undoubled maybe 2 with  diamonds cold. you may also make or get to a cold game|pg||
nt|mug: noone seems to agree with me on that last point unfortunately|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mug: if you have game partner bids again|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: too soft to pass|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mug: another good question is should you double 1@D or bid 1@H as South|pg||
nt|barbyh: probably hates to repeat that d suit'|pg||
nt|mug: I think I would raise to 3@C instead|pg||
nt|dagold: so partner has to act again with a 4432 14 count?|pg||
nt|dagold: where both sides can make?|pg||
nt|mug: probably one side is off in that case|pg||

nt|barbyh: what would you do over 2 d/s?|pg||
nt|barbyh: then pd raises to 4 sp|pg||
nt|mug: works out better if South raises to 3@C, the North can bid 3@D forcing and South can pattern out with 3@S|pg||
