pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|hantveit: That was a very strange choice. if you hold 7-3 you and partners open with a weak bid, you do not go for down in 3nt. Too speculative|pg||

nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator, Alistair for his skill and company. Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for bringing this fine event ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: to our screens. To my fellow commentators David and Vladimir for their perceptive insights many thanks as well as to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: last one...next match at 15.10|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a fireworks party|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: That one may not make The Times|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand valuation by S, though that does not automatically make 2N the correct call. since N is not a passed hand, 2N could preempt them out of a slam sometimes. playing as NS ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do, though, that is a bigger danger when the main suit is diamonds, because a 1D opening would show length whereas 1C doesnt make much of a move toward an eventuakl club contract ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|othered1: using NT openings as aggressive weapons hasn't shown well for NS so far this set|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: I feel 4 hearts better here|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: if declarer leads a high heart in the middle game, north wins and continues spades, south throwing a diamond and declarer is in trouble|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: interesting pass from W|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm support with support is not west's cup of tea|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this lacks aces |pg||
nt|roswolf: now a reluctant 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: PASSING WOULD BE QUITE A VIEW|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: n/s might well axe this|pg||
mb|5D|nt|othered1: Tough in the modern game to get your messages in on south hand, weak KS, good @S fit and 7-card side suit that might be best as trumps.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice bid south|pg||
nt|roswolf: north|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: Unfair to use a big @C system, which may well allow south to describ e  his hand.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one top spade and ace of hearts should do it|pg||
nt|ady: does best to play A@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|roswolf: a lot of bridge experience shown in that auction|pg||
pc|c5|nt|golfsquash: 2@d was checkback for both Majors and for strength. It guaranteed 5 spades.|pg||
