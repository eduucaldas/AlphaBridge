nt|mrt2000: well stopped!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2D|an|majors|mb|d!|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: I like to make this distinction of bidding =5+  and neg X not 5,  makes bidding easier later |pg||
nt|idc:  Looks like E-W play intermediate jump overcalls, which explains the 1@d rather than 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvs: West came out on top of this argument.|pg||
nt|idc:  I wonder if Forrester is setting a trap with that 3@d - normal for it to be weak but he has a tasty looking hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: another good auction for NS|pg||

nt|vugraphztx: last 5 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scoreboard shows the bitter truth|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 18 Wales as EW did get to 3NT from the right side but NS saved |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and Wales went on to 5@c|pg||
nt|wendle: this should be fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: i suppose 6@C is another decent alan slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: uh uh - another trappy hand for the english|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzvw: actually, does 7@C qualify as decent for you?|pg||
nt|wendle: better than the last one we saw!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: i asked players what they think which result it is|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: all 4 players said that they have no clue|pg||
nt|vugraphztx: and that match can go either way from this point|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: they have managed to play this back to front... so TF is DG for this board and vice versa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they both had hard bids. E is a bit suit-oriented for 5N perhaps, but that does bring clubs into the picture which is essential on such a primey hand. and i dont think W ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can be faulted because for all he knew it was crucial to protect one of his kings|pg||
mb|1N|an|NF, up to 12 HCP, <3!s|nt|vugraphztx: 2@h is 1-D overcall style|pg||
mb|p|nt|wendle: yes, haha|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to like the look of his hearts after West's opening|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably he has passed hoping to get the chance to X 1NT|pg||
nt|wendle: we'll see if club fit is ever discovered|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: actually does a spade lead beat 7@C on all the favourable layouts|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at this vulnerability, the bonus for bidding game is at its least and the reward for picking up a penalty is at its highest|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: you dont really have very many entries if that happens|pg||
nt|wendle: the @C fit is yet to be discovered and unlikely now|pg||
nt|wendle: brb|pg||
mb|2N|an|extras|mb|p|nt|vugraphztx: this looks like one down and 5imps to Panteros team|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: dont know if 4@C should be nat or a Q for @H, these things sometimes get murky|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: fair comment marshall but irish eyes are still smiling|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 5N is just a more flexible way of bidding 6C, and as i said E was right to have a preference for clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and W did not know there were no aces missing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have jumped to 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: here 6D is not easy to reach and far from laydown anyway|pg||
nt|golfsquash: That lead will help declarer, who is quite a way short of 9tricks at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: @dT denies the J in NS methods|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wendle: some kind of cue im guessing - any kibs know their style here?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer puts up dummy's ace, he might run into a trump promotion - but ducking is normal|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no special reason to think clubs are 1-6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will not be too worried anyway having stopped in 2@s|pg||

nt|eamongall: something like that |pg||

pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sybarra: hi Peter,  yes I think 3 nt was the spot |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|baldjean: this looks like a good swing towards NI|pg||

pc|h2|pg||

nt|sybarra: by not easy to know and hard to stay out of 4 @S imo |pg||
nt|clinch: Hi - very difficult to play in 3NT of course, though it's often the best place when all suits are double-stopped|pg||

nt|sybarra: have we noted the score recently? |pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: E/W discussing whether 3S or 3D should have shown 4 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: new leader|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Fergie just stood up and waved his hands in the air |pg||

mb|1H|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzvs: As things lie, the result will be 18-12 to Scotland.|pg||
nt|idc:  South had AKQxx cluns opposite T9x and decided to finesse 2nd round since West had opened a weak 2 in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: Yes, it was 1NT+1 by W.  I have added it to the 'movie'|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: we did not have a spade lead here |pg||

mb|3N|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|idc:  Quite a view by Robson but it could have been right - he had played @h first and placed West with 6-3 in majors I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: the other room had 10 tricks with 5 @C, 1 sp, 4 hts |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvs: E/W should stop in 5@H but they could be put to a spade guess late on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: we noted that hts were coming home with  3/3 break |pg||
nt|clinch: Walsh not deterred from leading J@s again :)|pg||
nt|clinch: This time very effective lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 21,  Eng. in other room played 3 @H   so more imps to Ireland |pg||

nt|idc:  North might have bid 3@h over 2@s but that's not a great suit for it - if he were raised to 4@h he would worry it was 5-2 opr even 5-1 fit|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like Micky Burns law is coming into play again |pg||
