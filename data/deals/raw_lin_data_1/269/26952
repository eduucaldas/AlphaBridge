nt|athene: that north hand would be a 1@C opener in traditional Polish Club, but i think NS play weak notrump|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: hi Michael |pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is conservative if anything|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mwigor: this match is to determine who will represent australia in the senior's pabf|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would have more chances played by west, with the clubs protected|pg||
nt|mwigor: the klinger team is already guaranteed the spot in the seniors bowl in bali as 5 members of the brown team are playing the bermuda bowl|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|mwigor: gaspar-richman have been the most impressive pair in qualifying, they play a strong club with transfer openings|pg||

nt|mwigor: bilski-brown were the second best pair in qualifying, and play polish club|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: richman wants to find out as much as he can about the honour lie in diamonds, so he has more idea how to play the majors|pg||

nt|athene: 1@H opener isn't canapé; it shows spades|pg||
nt|mwigor: his range is about 9-14 so this is a maximum more or less|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: NS play weak jump overcalls but south didn't fancy 3@D at these colours|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: west in the tank|pg||
nt|athene: EW do play some canapé  but only into minors, so here richman has shown 5+@S - 4+@H, as normal|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: wow...closed room went for 250 :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: the auction in the closed room is worth commenting on|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt in the other room was a little wild|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mwigor: KQ doubleton is not a great stopper - 5 points, only 1 trick and only 1 stopper|pg||
nt|athene: apart from anything, @DKQ is a much worse stopper than @DAx, because you can't hold it up|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: more imps for Klinger|pg||
nt|athene: if the diamonds are 7222 the first one gets ducked, and then if you have to let north in, the diamonds run|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|athene: a diamond lead from west will concede 3nt immediately - win the @D10, play the clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|athene: on another lead it will be much more interesting|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mwigor: on a heart lead it will just be down wont it?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: some sort of puppet sequence after 1nt i guess, with north showing 4-card heart suit and south a 4-card spade suit|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think 2@c asked for 5 card suits|pg||
nt|mwigor: and 3@d asked for 4 card majors|pg||
nt|mwigor: but i could be wrong|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: in the other room, perhaps south's 3@D bid showed the diamond suit - if so, it was very costly|pg||
nt|athene: as west led a club and declarer had only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought perhaps you could still make by playing on spades|pg||
