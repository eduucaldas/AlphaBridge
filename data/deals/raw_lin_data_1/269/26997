mb|2D!|nt|bjacobs: That's what I would do, and then East would certainly progress to slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: at the other table, the Polish 1@C opening got caught by the bid downside of big clubs: the failure to name a suit early|pg||

nt|Henryb:  its a bid downside also|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Yes.  Well 1@D promised 4, just playing standard, so I really don't understand West's pass|pg||
nt|Henryb:  4@c-5@d-6@d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here West is simply bidding his stopper, and they may end up languishing in 3NT|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, your prediction was slightly closer than mine Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  If you are going to bid 6@c, why not 4@h on the way?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps Lilley had a different interpretation of 3@S than me.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I think in answer to your question Henry, once West has passed 2@D, I don't see how Lilley could possibly envisage a grand slam|pg||
