mb|3C|mb|d|nt|dburn: not as many as should know, would be my guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: follow-up   if you decide to play @D bids as natural -- what do you do with hand that wants to cue|pg||
nt|dburn: but the hand is too good for 2@d by far - would 3@d be natural or a splinter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right -- needed to include splinter|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bentzen in 4@H west|pg||
nt|vugraphzed: on b22, he went -5. i misclaimed in the ending. will correct after this board|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: not quite sure what this is all about|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so sorry    1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|dburn: these days double then 4@d is played as a "flexible" hand, not a diamond one-suiter|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  22[2@DX down a bunch]    other room 3N east -100|pg||
nt|dburn: not that he would ever ruff with the king, but he would need to guess the trump position somehow|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: ruffing with the seven or the six or not at all might have been OK, I guess - need GIB to sort this one out|pg||

nt|dburn: quite a lot of defence, moth-eaten suit and all that|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|an|sign-off relay|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 4@D = Puppet 4@H   aka  EndSignal|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: more likely the latter - Glenn is a great theorist|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Closed Room started with  13  so we'll have comparisons at the turn|pg||
nt|dburn: we may do - is Terje Aa at the other table?|pg||
