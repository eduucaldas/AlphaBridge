nt|vugraphzar: 2nt would be a bit of a stretch on an 8 count|pg||
nt|dburn: North wasn't going to do more, but South might|pg||
nt|Henryb:  So you have about a 6% chance of making, and when you then refuse the @d finesse, a 100% chance of down 2. Is that sensible?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now i expect 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: well done - i am glad to be wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: looks like an automatic trump lead to me with such strength in declarer's 2nd suit, but obviously not|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit high though|pg||
nt|dburn: no real reason to lead a trump - you expect partner to overruff dummy in clubs|pg||
nt|Henryb:  N-S play weak NT, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: yes|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|dburn: the time to lead a trump is when you are short in declarer's second suit, not long in it|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer might have ducked the first club|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: on the auction partner might not have many trumps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: could rebid 1NT, certainly - you would probably have opened a strong no trump, but two low hearts is a bit off-putting|pg||

nt|roswolf: low club lead will please declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: well, West bid clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: so one would expect a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: south less likely to lead a club when dummy bid them|pg||

pc|h9|nt|roswolf: this should make ok|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Henryb:  In many parts of the world, 2@c response is frequently 3 card suit, gf, when no 5 card red suit is available|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 2@c could have been 3=4=3=3 shape, so a club was not ruled out|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: indeed - repeated heart leads cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3 mins till next and final match of the weekend|pg||
nt|dburn: it might - declarer would win a second heart in dummy, @s10 would hold, and declarer might try to cross to @dK at some point|pg||
nt|Henryb:  like trick 4?|pg||
nt|Henryb:  best would be for declarer to overtake the @s10, I think|pg||
nt|dburn: conceivably - but since North doesn't have an entry after @hK is gone at the first trick, declarer could still succeed, but it would be a nervous business|pg||
nt|Henryb:  settle for 2 spade tricks, and hope for 3@h, 3@c, 2@s and a @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: we finish with Susanna Gross/Sally Brock vs Chris Duckworth/Nicole Cook|pg||

nt|Henryb:  North started with 14 HCP plus one for the five card suit, and added two more for the stiff when partner showed a fit. |pg||

nt|mug: no reason to finesse in trumps|pg||
nt|mug: heart finesse gives declarer extra chance of East winning @HK and forgetting to cash the club|pg||
