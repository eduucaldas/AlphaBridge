nt|eggy:  I suppose that it would be 50/50 as N will get squeezed|pg||
nt|paulhac: Because BBO cannot deal with a lead out of turn this was the funny play at trick 1|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|s4|pg||

nt|paulhac: E/W are at a slight disadvantage as because they sent in their convention card late they have been forced to plat simple system for the first stanza|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|eggy:  yes = I hope that this event is not going to be ruined, by what is, without doubt, one of the most idiotic cases of officialdom in any walk of life or even fiction, including M*A*S*H and Catch 22 and Brave New World.|pg||

nt|eggy:  In my experience of captaining teams on numerous occasions, this is completely unnecessary for the under 25 event and, given some of the players are in their early teens and first year if the game in smaller countries, hopelessly inappropriate a|pg||
nt|eggy:  hopelessly inappropriate as a rule for the under 21s.  In about half a dozen captaincies, I have never known any serious issues about systems (or much else bridge related) in events of this sort.|pg||

nt|roswolf: not enamoured of the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Sheila A:  It depends on their preempting style|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I like the 4 spade bid, as it may put south under pressure|pg||
nt|Sheila A:  If classical, then W is known to have good @s but no defence, so 4@s seems reasonable|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac: We would prefer 3@D to 3@C to show our shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac: With 6@D a lucky make 3NT is unlikely to play bar miracles|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|paulhac: Good switch|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|eggy:  especially given the stupid bidding sanctions|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|eggy:  A couple of people asked about the sanctions - over half the teams have been forced to play simple systems fo rthis stanza, because they didn;t put systems in 30 days in advance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy:  It seems that Bridge Great Britain introduced a raft of new rules for this year, including the submission of systems a month in advance (before some teams had even been selected).|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|eggy:  It is also clear that these changes were dreadfully communicated as less more than half the teams failed to comply (including the English under 25 team).|pg||

nt|eggy:  It is pretty obvious that whoever devised the rules had never had responsibility for junior bridge, knew anything about this event, or gave any thought to fitness for purpose.  As a dreadful example of self opinionated armchair rule making - it'|pg||

mc|7|nt|paulg:  Steve, I think the rule is correct if a pair is going to play a very unusual system that will not be familiar to the players, but when it's just a normal "club" system then it is draconian|pg||

nt|Sheila A:  While we were arguing, something strange appeared to happen in the play - should only have been one off|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, west tried something in diamonds and lost some tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: 2@c is hardly classical|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: and with 2 aces 2@d seems aqn underbid - unless it is forced by system|pg||
nt|Sheila A:  I checked the card and it is intended to show 8 playing tricks.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well Sheila has done her homework and knows the system here..|pg||
nt|Sheila A:  Although the hand has lots of playing strength it doesn't have defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Sheila A:  And you need to open at the 1 levl to get both your suits across|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: true but both suits are in the picture now|pg||

nt|BaldJean: was a little too much|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Minors|mb|3H|nt|paulhac: Weak NT with 5-4 in the majors is not everyones choice|pg||
nt|eggy:  Well Paul -the rules are idiotic for this sort of tournament - and anyway, other countries like the Netherlands and Belgium are realistically relaxed about enforcement|pg||
nt|eggy:  I've never known any problem over systems or other bridge matters in hjunior tournaments|pg||
nt|eggy:  Rather than take a pragmatic approach, and against the wishes of just about every captain, the powers that be have seen this as some sort of challenge to their power and have insisted that the the sanction is applied across the board|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think if you are playing Brown Sticker Conventions, some of which are permitted in this event, then I think you should be telling people before the event|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy:  well that's as may be - "permitted" perhaps, but played? and for under 20s - words fail me|pg||
