mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ady: 6@H  50-50 by east   near full proof by west|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|gracelin: they may be using a Kokish sequence, the 2H bid is either natural or 25-27 balanced.  West needs to bid 2S with most hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: East's 3D rebid confirms he has a red two suiters|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: no good west playing 6NT to protect K@S  as there are only 11 tricks|pg||

nt|ady: 27 hcp    but not a lot to spare     4thheart trick brings tally up to 8    sure to find 1 more   either from spades   or possible diamond towards the jack|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 2D bid seems to be a GF check-back.  But West shud just bid 3NT when he has no interest in any major suit game|pg||
