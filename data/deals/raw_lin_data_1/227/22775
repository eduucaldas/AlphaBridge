nt|greerm: good morning all|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|jferg: no 3nt now|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|greerm: now declarer knows NS bid to 3@H only with 9 @H, when she is deciding whether @D are 3-1 or 2-2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzbz: someone... how many imps to get 22...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|greerm: should be a fair start for NI when CBAI play in a 3-3 fit|pg||

pc|s4|nt|greerm: defence draw trump, then go about running side suit :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|greerm: not a safe one |pg||
nt|greerm: she knows North will bid 3@H with almost all hands with 4@H |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: best to return a spade now, although declarer should not finesse of course|pg||

nt|snorre: 23-25 is my guess..|pg||

nt|vugraphzbz: dummy is the correct to say....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with the other 2 suits patsy Meehan would double 1@H|pg||
nt|greerm: should be penalty but not sure if strong enough for either penalty or takeout|pg||
mb|1C|nt|greerm: 4@H now for NS after a 2NT opening?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: Notice that Greenwood rebids NT with a singleton,  do you like that?|pg||
nt|dburn: several flaws for a weak two bid, but being in third seat cancels most of them|pg||
nt|greerm: multi 2@D|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|greerm: Di decides whether to "show" @H or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|greerm: I think all right when by agreement, persoa|pg||
nt|jferg: puppet now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jferg: will ciara break?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|greerm: personally, nty|pg||
nt|greerm: S choices? 3NT 4@H or 4@C cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: NI can make 2@d so possible swing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodvenn: probably xyz|pg||
nt|dburn: aggressive sort of lead - unlikely to be any real need to attack like that, but maybe unlucky to find it blowing a trick|pg||
pc|dT|nt|greerm: still a possibility of slam as far as South is concerned, |pg||
nt|jferg: hope this is a retransfer|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@D worries me hope they both know it is retransfer and not a cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: wont help Di already bid @hs|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: xyz yes.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@d forcing to game artificial|pg||
nt|snorre: A passed 2@d GF in closed room?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pbmarstr: Maybe xyz zzzz!?!?!?!? at the other table too?|pg||
nt|greerm: this should make|pg||
pc|c9|nt|greerm: @C finesse or, more likely A, K and another both lead to home|pg||
pc|c2|nt|greerm: strange to retransfer to your own suit|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@H clearer for me, Ciara probably taking insurance with the 4@H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jferg: maybe 4 hearts shows a better hand with no immediate b1st round control|pg||

nt|snorre: One of our best female pairs play NS in closed room, Ingunn Uran - Siv Thoresen. A new combination|pg||
nt|phil352:  and would expect EW to compete further in @C anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: NS have been given dooley about their 2 level overcalls so Anne did not bid 2@D's :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: leading Butlerranking, so 2@d was an unnormal accident. http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0124/olrudlag-1214578687.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 15 facing 10 almost always gets to 3NT nowadays, with 4@h an alternative|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|dburn: 4@h more awkward, though - could lose two spades, a trump and a diamond|pg||
nt|eamongall: http://ladymilne.welshbridgeunion.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Lady-Milne-20122.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil352:  the hand's not strong enough to overcall 2@D in the sandwich position|pg||
mb|1S|nt|greerm: this is one of the flatter hands, we have seen last night and this morning, many swingy ones|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: nice to have some commentry.  was very lonely this morning :)|pg||
nt|jferg: expect 4 hearts which should go off on a dia lead|pg||
nt|greerm: 3 of these ladies have a lot of Camrose experience so we are in for a strong battle|pg||
nt|phil352:  anyway moving on to this hand...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|eamongall: after 2 rounds match is here|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: Cook asking questions|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not the time for an aggressive lead like a diamond, but @cQ is a likely contender|pg||
nt|dburn: but not any more|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: time for a sandwich then|pg||
mb|2S|nt|snorre: Did really Fyrun pass 5@c??!!!|pg||
nt|greerm: 4th suit game forcing, an opening hand opposite an opening hand ..|pg||
nt|greerm: Liz shows a game force with 6@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: Amazing|pg||

nt|vugraphzww: nice simple auction|pg||
nt|phil352:  opposite a 15-17 nt W chooses to invite, obviously accepted|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodvenn: it should have cost more than 50|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: lost the play now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: Fyrun doubled.|pg||
nt|ritong: not a real problem:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: and now thinking in 4 card position.|pg||
nt|snorre: A sossage-squeeze for 11? maybe there is another english word that?  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: he has drawn trumf all the way.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: thinking more in 3card position, A of h went now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: got it right.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an|could be 3|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|dburn: percentages probably favour passing this, but always a temptation to try for game vulnerable|pg||

mb|p|nt|greerm: NI first blood when they "enjoyed" the 500 you referred to in hand 1 John|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: ugly lead problem for North - anything could work well or horribly|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pbmarstr: 2 @H is heart or 5-7 hp, 3 cards @S|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: or|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: maybe a tad agressive this time :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzww: just a tad?|pg||
nt|dburn: question of how to play hearts now|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|vugraphzbz: natural, or a weak sp.support.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: good lead|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Do not think it is natural to win this contract now|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i do not think it si possible|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Oh yes. Heart to Ace, club finesse, club ace, spade ruff, diamond|pg||
nt|phil352:  EW looking to get doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: looks like 4@D tricks plus 3 aces to E/W|pg||
nt|greerm: heading for 4@H here which I think will make, in spite of the @D position|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzww: NI behind for 1st time in this match :(|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|dburn: when the ten falls under the ace, you... but if you don't cash the ace first, of course, that won't happen|pg||

nt|yo_yo: looks like one down to me|pg||

nt|yo_yo: good morning everyone|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jferg: making di think ciara has it|pg||
nt|phil352:  I think E should know NS have marginal game values, or at least the majority. If you really want to bid this much you have to try 3@D or bid 2NT straight away. I prefer bailing after 3@C|pg||
nt|phil352:  generous switch|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|dburn: could be right - would be right on this deal - but not all that attractive into a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah  might make now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|greerm: some play the double of 2@H here showing a good hand with @H, others play it as a lead request|pg||
nt|greerm: i think it makes becasue defence can only get 2@D and 1@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: North just trying to defend passively|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|greerm: looks like Di and Ciara have differing views, or maybe Di thought had enough anyway|pg||
nt|greerm: its certainly a good one to discuss with serious partnerships|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzww: how come both rooms play 3-3 fiton board 17?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: but seems to have abandoned the plan|pg||

pc|h9|pg||

nt|vugraphzbz: and ofcourse BBO allowing to set up this show.|pg||
nt|jferg: part score arguement if w/e get too high in spades ciara may x|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: Liz is asleep|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like ni could make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|greerm: NS play tartan 2s so Di probably decing whether to risk one|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzww: not me, Di|pg||
nt|greerm: now a really difficult decision for South|pg||
nt|greerm: @H suit poor at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|phil352:  as kibs point out 5@C and even 6@C make so might yet be imps in but still think E did too much|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: remind us of their system |pg||
nt|greerm: and I know Ciara not fond of chancy ones :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|greerm: we can see 6@C good|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she hit the jackpot with 3@C|pg||
nt|greerm: but i don't think it will be reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: Congratulations to DiscoNinjas.. Cant see how they can loose this now|pg||
nt|phil352:  off shape takeout double from S|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: just shows 4@s and opening values|pg||
nt|phil352:  opposite a passed partner it's interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbz: They have to be the winners yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|greerm: Di worried about missing game with the good @C fit|pg||
nt|jferg: 2/1 14-16 np 5 card majs|pg||
nt|phil352:  wow, interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: shocked looks all round table (except S)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|greerm: 3N or 4@H seem ok but I'm sure we see 4@H from Ciara now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree 3@H|pg||
nt|greerm: ah, didn't notice she has "borrowed" a point|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: The old one  "When you are dealt  AKx by the bridge gods,....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|greerm: difficult to defend easy to play, anyone for a cup of tea now is the time|pg||
nt|jferg: ok see you shortly|pg||
nt|greerm: maybe @H T now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: his debut was short lived :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|snorre: Javel is down to 4th before the last board..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|greerm: i suspect there will be lots of different contracts acoross the 6 tables on this baord|pg||

nt|mwigor: even 2@sX was only 800 i think - so even then 8 imps to scotland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: I have several requests re the CR bidding,  honestly I have no clue (nor do the other commentators is my guess) |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|georgia19: 1H x xx ppp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|mwigor: the auction was 1@h X XX all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: a creative 1 nt overcall |pg||
nt|mwigor: my guess is south thought that partner couldnt have a four card @s suit for her pass|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do nt see many entries to dummy |pg||
nt|jferg: think over the xx south should bid 1 spade|pg||
nt|mwigor: i agree|pg||
nt|mwigor: i dont much like the double though - i prefer the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|jferg: realms of fantasy passing 1 h xx|pg||
nt|georgia19: and me, but I've had bid with the N hand I think, why not?|pg||
nt|jferg: pass means happy to defend bid is a weak hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats a matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mwigor: some have different agreements|pg||

nt|georgia19: sorry, John TOTALLY disagree, pass means do what you like pard, not I want to defend, that is surely reasonable, can support any suit|pg||

nt|phil352:  S will have a hard time explaining that to her teammates i'd imagine|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: and to her NPC|pg||
mb|1S|nt|snorre: 22-8 is the lowest victory Javel needs to beat Disco N...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|snorre: smallest...|pg||
nt|ady: side suit splits bad for n/s  playing in diamonds|pg||
nt|eamongall: this 2@S might be multi landy |pg||
nt|eamongall: ah single suited hand |pg||
nt|dburn: not many balanced 11s being opened in this event|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: lets hope they can put it behind them|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ady: good morning Sandie|pg||
nt|greerm: more puppetry comin|pg||
nt|greerm: coming|pg||
mb|2N|nt|greerm: we have seen a lot of hands where the @S suit is like here, great entertainment, not always fun for declarers|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: kelly will give it 3@Hs|pg||
nt|phil352:  important to just put the cards back in the board and move on|pg||
nt|phil352:  to borrow from poker, important to not go 'on tilt'|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: largely because of lots of weak no trumpers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like n/s will play in diamonds     will it be 5 or 6?|pg||
nt|eamongall: well maybe cotter will|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@D promising 1 or 2 majors, or some play possible 3@S too|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@S promises 4@H not 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: NS lucky to avoid playing @h's. Let us see if this end up better...|pg||
nt|eamongall: but if its a 15-17 NT she won't |pg||
nt|vugraphzww: wrong again :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: 1+1+3+4= 9?|pg||
nt|snorre: 2@c means?|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@C checkback looking for a 5-3 @S fit|pg||
nt|phil352:  pushy 'good raise' here. by an unpassed hand i'd expect some more values, or some better ruffing potential|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: too much wastage|pg||
nt|ady: even guessing the diamond position   just not enough tricks|pg||
nt|ady: the goo news for n/s  is that 5@D likely to fail   so could be  little lost|pg||
nt|greerm: and now 3NT closes the auction|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|greerm: now declarer worries about losing the @H A and 4@D|pg||
nt|greerm: if South switches, when in with @H A to a high @D then no 4@D |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|greerm: Ciara goes for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: she bid 2N and then changed it|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: Di that is|pg||
nt|greerm: minimum with a 5 card suit ...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzbz: d, or both majors.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: well she can see @D9|pg||
nt|greerm: but i think 5@C will be cashed first|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|greerm: or a trick steal ?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|cT|nt|snorre: 3rd @c to east nine?|pg||
nt|snorre: or maybe south can read him 4-1-5-3?|pg||
nt|eamongall: being wrong is a good thing ... then I can learn from my mistake|pg||
nt|eamongall: being right all the time on the other hand .....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: run for home now|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|greerm: no joy in the @S suit, so lets try the @D|pg||
nt|greerm: running for hhome now, wd|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|snorre: now he can....|pg||

nt|georgia19: tempting, but surely well avoided|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|mwigor: this looks like an error - surely cashing @dA crossing to @cK and setting up 4@d, 2@s, 2@c and 1@h was more or less 100%|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was wondering if after winning sp in dummy, W might have played ace then q of @D? |pg||

nt|phil352:  sorry all, connection problems, did i miss much?|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ady: east over anxious using master trump to ruff the firfrst spade|pg||
nt|greerm: for us spectators !|pg||
nt|dburn: game on 3-3 hearts, which will materialise, but a bit thin on values|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: no. just a bad board for NI|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|rodvenn: undo|pg||
nt|eamongall: now there is a 2@S bid looking for trouble |pg||
nt|eamongall: it probably makes but I doubt South passes it |pg||
nt|dburn: still, North may well just drive to it with ace-king ace facing an opening|pg||
nt|dburn: no - she has a gadget|pg||
nt|greerm: fortune favours the brave here|pg||
nt|phil352:  bd 19 NI went off in 4@S after taking club finesse the wrong way|pg||
nt|phil352:  so scotland pull ahead a little further|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: when its going wrong its going wrong :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|greerm: 1NT is a frocing enquiry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now x by w?|pg||
nt|greerm: 3 or 4 by Di?|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: maybe in the Grand National |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: simple system:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: they use Toronto.|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@S possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: Have to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|dburn: but she also has some gumption|pg||
pc|s2|nt|greerm: well done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like 4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but i would be in with the West hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eamongall: I don't understand this gadget ...effectively its an invite and then when rejected you accept your own invite |pg||
pc|sT|nt|greerm: not sure what the dbl was but Liz McG obviously knew|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|greerm: and you would be right, e/w a great @D contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well did she?  she didnt bid @C|pg||
nt|greerm: i'm told the dbl showed a strong NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: well, maybe if South had a really good hand there could be a slam - North just showing the character of her raise to game|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: would have cost plenty|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eamongall: however as @Hs 3-3 rolls home |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|sverjohn: good lead, some would lead the diamond :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20 here    part score hand|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c - pass 5@c not absurd|pg||
nt|eamongall: but she might stop to bid 3@S and then South gets in easier |pg||
nt|dburn: worst thing East can do is bid 4@c and then wonder what to do when 4@h comes back|pg||
nt|dburn: but of course she can't be sure that 4@h will come back - maybe 4@c will buy it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzww: O'Neill nearly opened 1@h|pg||
nt|eamongall: well she can expect 4 of some red suit to come |pg||
nt|paulg:  they play weak notrump, 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: gtg  bye for now|pg||
nt|greerm: another potential for slam swings|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe 4@c will allow South to bid 4@h and give North a tough problem if East decides to save after all|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|greerm: e/w playing weak NT making the rebid 1BT show a strong one|pg||

nt|greerm: 4@H would not be my choice with all those controls, but East motors on|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|greerm: starneg to use RKC with a void but finding all 4 means it didn't cost|pg||

pc|h4|nt|dburn: diamonds also, for that matter|pg||

nt|greerm: a game swing to NI when scotland missed the making 4@H on board 5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: not good play to draw trumps on this hand  not south should have drawn the 3rd trumps  and if the Q@C was not coming down the contract could fail|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|greerm: now the major minor bid by North, |pg||
nt|eamongall: thats good ... we have lots of screens to be assembled at Euro championships |pg||
nt|greerm: another overtrick to NI, apparently resulting from differing NT opening strengths|pg||
nt|jferg: but 10 imps out|pg||
nt|greerm: this is a big 1@S overcall for south, will be tempting|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: should get out for down 1|pg||
nt|greerm: Ciara not usually shy in these positions|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: not my job.  Not included in Technical|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil352:  normally i would advocate a trump lead here, but holding KQT is a different story|pg||

nt|phil352:  what do i know|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks the limit for n/s if a diamond is cashed|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|dburn: this has chances if declarer gets spades right, which is likely after West's double of 2@d|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are playing a Multi, so East did not have the option of opening a weak 2@d|pg||

nt|greerm: now a low @S is best chance but declarer doesnt knwo about the 4-1 split|pg||

nt|dburn: or of course she may not|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: looks on for losing at both tables now |pg||
nt|dburn: which will result in the loss of a handful of IMPs, as it probably deserved to do|pg||

nt|greerm: more puppet|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  East intended to raise 3@h to 4@h, which is why she is thinking of a slam|pg||

pc|sK|nt|dburn: not sure why you would unblock the @d9 - if you're Scottish you would lead low to the nine if you wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible|pg||
