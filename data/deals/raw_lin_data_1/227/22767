mb|p|nt|paulg:  it looks like Punch and McGowan have swapped seats, a little unusual as most players have a preference especially when playing with screens|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|an| |mb|p|mb|2N|nt|clinch: 4@h seems straightforward here; NS have to go through a Multi which will have it played by the weak hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  many might think that 3@s is invitational and McGowan would have a quick accept|pg||
nt|clinch: 2NT in the NS system shows a particular weak 2-suiter; this sequence shows 21-23 balanced|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  but clearly it is just competing|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  meanwhile, Patsy Meehan found a great lead to get the second undertrick for that contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzxa: Long think by Moore over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  McGowan's two spades, and South's restraint, may remove any slam interest|pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  slam does make, but at 50% it is a case of take it or leave it from a probability perspective|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Liz is made of sterner stuff and asks Punch to bid slam with a spade control|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Weak NT for Scotland and McGowan has no interest in game if partner cannot break the transfer|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  Tough lead for Kelly and this will probably concede a couple of overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator can correct the result for board 3 .. (chat to me if you need help doing that)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  this will work well here, but the five-level may not have been safe if Punch held @sKx for example|pg||
nt|paulg:  however the odds are that she has values in hearts and clubs, which makes it a lot safer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  nice intermediates in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  Cotter does best to try and force dummy, but Punch's @c10 protects her|pg||

nt|paulg:  As a commentator I have to be even more circumspect than normal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  7 imps to Ireland on board 19 where the 2@h overcall was passed, so I make the score 46-27 to Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  not only was Sam Punch on my Vanderbilt team this year and most of my Spingold teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  her boyfriend is in the audience|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I was telly Betty Kelly's son how to access BBO on Twitter earlier today|pg||
nt|paulg:  A very good slam this time, but not an easy hand to bid opposite a weak 1NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  A perfect fit, when there are weak notrumps where you could not make game|pg||
nt|clinch: 1NT=12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|paulg:  2NT will be a transfer to diamond and I guess 3@d denies support|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|paulg:  sorry, it is Jean Kelly here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North-South play four-card majors with a strong 1NT, hence the 1@h opener|pg||
nt|clinch: Moore has to decide whether to step in here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|an| |nt|greerm: god lead by East, cuts down on the @S ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think this is a practical approach|pg||
nt|clinch: I think a reasonable choice, though could be expensive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|greerm: good|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||

pc|h2|nt|clinch: -2 is the best Moore can do here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|paulg:  13 imps to Scotland on board 20 when Ireland did not bid the slam|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|paulg:  Kelly can pick up the trumps now, but has a spade and two diamonds to lose|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|paulg:  so probably down two but this aggressive bidding is typical of all the Irish teams in the Home Internationals|pg||
nt|paulg:  For those who have never operated a BBO vugraph, it is not the easiest job in the world especially in the Camrose|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  Even though they are playing with screens they play very quickly and often fail to show the operator their cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  although, to be fair, very few people accuse Sam Punch of playing too quickly, but Liz McGowan tries to make up for it|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|greerm: 4 tricks in and 2 trumps to come, 2 off|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|greerm: oops|pg||
nt|greerm: 1 off|pg||
nt|clinch: So, depending on whether England can bid and make 4@h in the other room, the swing will be either about 4 one way or 8 the other|pg||

nt|paulg:  and I expect 4@d is keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|paulg:  if her partner had any useful values, then you'd expect her to be balancing with spade shortage|pg||

nt|vugraphzxa: Moore apologies for not doubling1|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@s shows 0 key cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  so McGowan may bid 4NT to ask for the @dQ|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzxa: redoubling!|pg||
nt|clinch: 3NT looks a trick short here if defended properly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  or may just bid 6@d as she expects Punch to hold three diamonds on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  well bid, but I expect it will be bid by the Irish too|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this layout you can make all the tricks, but unlikely to bid it missing one of the key cards|pg||
pc|h9|nt|clinch: Though maybe S gets sqqueezed on 5 rounds of @cs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|clinch: But on this lead NS can take 5 quick tricks|pg||
nt|clinch: That was nonsense about S being squeezed, sorry|pg||

mb|3D|mb|4D|an| |nt|clinch: NS likely to take phantom sacrifice in 5@d here|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|paulg:  you would not normally raise to 3@s with the South hand, but the Michaels bid suggests that partner will have more than four|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|paulg:  perhaps North would be better served bidding 4@c, but she does have a lot of wasted values in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: we have an interesting board here. EW have some spades, but is it enough for agame try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  We are still not linked correctly but we do have another slam hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's 4@s bid, with first round controls in three suits and six trumps does look conservative|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H = @H and a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and, indeed, this might encourage partner to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|greerm: a difficult opening lead, honours in every suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|clinch: Difficult decision for Fawcett, but this won't make, and neither would 5@d|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|petka: obviously not possible for EW to locate their 5-3 fit, and W will be looking at that heart void|pg||
nt|clinch: Of course NS @s didn't have to be 2-2, so pulling the double might have been right|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|paulg:  Punch will be feeling pretty bad at the moment ... conceding -770 and giving away a slam on consecutive boards|pg||
nt|clinch: It just wasn't|pg||

nt|paulg:  I believe the running score is 72-38 to Scotland|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|petka: removing dummies last trump and playing D looks good for us, but what if W has the CQ? That is what south is thinking now|pg||

nt|petka: ruffing your aces is a bit difficult to see|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|paulg:  I'm told that this is the first Lady Milne for Betty Cotter & Jean Kelly .. congratulations to them|pg||
nt|paulg:  and both tables had the same auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  but I also expect that they are very nervous|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petka: for a bridge player it is like paying the bus fare with a diamond ring|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Wiseman and McQuaker have done well to bid the game in the other room, on a combined 22 count|pg||
nt|clinch: Apparently that S hand isn't good enough to open|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petka: it might be the right thing to do in some special situation, but you never really consider the possibility|pg||
nt|clinch: Worked well, as only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  interestingly they reached game after passing the South hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  whereas the table that opened played in a part-score|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh seems to have a simple 1NT bid, much to West's relief, but perhaps they play double as denying four spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh being a short name for South, perhaps not the best one|pg||
nt|greerm: a practical 4@H bid with a bit f play for us |pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||

nt|greerm: Grand National just had a false start|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore thinking|pg||
nt|petka: the spade and diamond aces are right, so this looks promising for S. The trick is not to set up a 5th loser before establishing the 9th winner. (2 aces and 2 clubs are already ...|pg||
nt|petka: losers after the lead if W holds the CT). Therefore hearts are not good to play on.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|paulg:  it looks a better hand on this lead though and hard to criticise O'Neill for it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|greerm: i think ok, promising 4@H and a decent hand, if not double then never bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am more of a classic doubler|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|paulg:  unusual for a vulnerable 2@s overcall to be missing the top three honours, although she does have a seventh one as compensation|pg||
nt|paulg:  Alistair has pointed out that 6@c, or even 6@d, is a better contract than 3NT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  declarer has two spades, three clubs and three diamonds and needs to find a ninth trick|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

nt|henryb:  What do the Welsh pair do with @h and @c?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  you can play in 3@c on standard methods - East rebids 2@d and West bids 3@c|pg||

nt|petka: A well-deserved disaster, bad bidding and wrong defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what's the NT range?|pg||
nt|greerm: very slow as wales gradually gain overtricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|paulg:  they may well bid to slam here as they have excellent controls and good slams|pg||
nt|greerm: strong i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  with hearts agreed I'd have thought 4@c was the normal cue bid for North|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: can't be or south would have bid on|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  when they go through the hands in the post-mortem, Punch might consider that this hand is a better takeout double of 1@s than the takeout double she tried to make on board 22|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: who is winning ?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulg:  as North seems to have denied the ace and king of clubs, unsurprising that South signed off|pg||
nt|petka: The E hand is a problem in standard systems. A bit heavy for a simple 2S rebid, but the suit quality is a bit poor for a jump to 3S|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs careful play; 3@c would have made reasonably easily|pg||
nt|clinch: All these losing @ds are a nuisance in 2@h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  on both occasions she was facing a passed partner and was vulnerable|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  the rule I recommend is that after 1X-1NT-2Y, you can show a 6-card suit at the 2 level or a 7-card suit at the 3 level|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|yorkbeach:  yes you can do that too - I was quoting minium lengths for bidding a suit if you do not like partner's suits|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @cA and the singleton @d may be useful in a heart contract, so agree it is close|pg||
nt|viren169: I dont mind bidding a 6 card suit at the 3-level with no support for pd (ie a mis-fit)...|pg||

pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: i certainly do not|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  1@s would have been more successful than double this time|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I think it is a better call, since the spades are not really strong enough to bid if partner bids clubs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: but I am old fashioned|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  but it was passed back and declarer did eventually make|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  this is the type of hand that I'm sure she'd get right in a book, but under pressure it is very easy to miss these small chances|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petka: If Lane is greedy she might bare the DK :) Declarer is bound to finesse|pg||
nt|greerm: heading for 9 tricks flat board, one to go|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|clinch: Chris Chambers suggests that maybe 3@h implied support in their system|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|nt|paulg:  she must overruff there but the defence can still promote the @h10 to beat the contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  maybe some passing back and forth at this table too?|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think that the contract did fail by a trick|pg||
nt|petka: interesting to see if north opens.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|greerm: a good score for NI other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes  just look at the @S split|pg||
nt|clinch: And indeed, looking at their card, the method is only to complete the transfer with 3 card support, so that worked well|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch-McGowan play Puppet Stayman and 3NT shows a 5-card minor|pg||

mb|2D|an| |nt|petka: a bid in my taste, very easy to take out now|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|paulg:  Also the WBU and BGB for their presentation of the matches and BBO for providing us with the ability to see it all|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petka: a spade now will coup an extra trump trick for -1 |pg||
nt|petka: E needed to attack trumps first, but playing a low from the E hand is unnatural|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petka: I don't mean -1, I mean for 2 trumps winners|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  Also to the Welsh Bridge Union and Bridge Great Britain for arranging and managing the event|pg||
