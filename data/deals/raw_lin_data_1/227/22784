nt|paulg:  North-South are Antoinette McGee & Mamie MacCormac from Ireland, they also play a weak 1NT but with 5-card majors: system card at http://goo.gl/pnp5d (PDF)|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is a quiet 3NT where the only question is the number of overtricks|pg||

nt|clinch: Might be a small swing to England|pg||
nt|clinch: if Wales overstretch or don't play carefully|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Same comment on this hand!|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|paulg:  it looks like Punch and McGowan have swapped seats, a little unusual as most players have a preference especially when playing with screens|pg||
nt|diumraid: Another 4@S for EW and I expect woodruff to open it too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|clinch: Another part score hand here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|clinch: 4@h seems straightforward here; NS have to go through a Multi which will have it played by the weak hand|pg||
nt|diumraid: and little NS an do to harm it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|clinch: EW can make 4@c, NS in theory can make 4@d but in practice won't|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps they haven't :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: 3C alerted by Lane!|pg||
nt|diumraid: except a Club switch now and ducked :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzxa: Alert recinded|pg||
nt|clinch: Fawcett showing extra strength through fourth suit; might get NS bidding, though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  East-West showed some good understanding here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  many might think that 3@s is invitational and McGowan would have a quick accept|pg||
nt|clinch: 2NT in the NS system shows a particular weak 2-suiter; this sequence shows 21-23 balanced|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  but clearly it is just competing|pg||
nt|clinch: Well bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Several opportunities for NS to jam things with @d bids, but contented themselves with a couple of doubles|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|clinch: The very favourable lie should yield 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|clinch: No real advantage / disadvantage in who plays this one, but transfers weren't really designed to play contracts this way up|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|c2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is a trump promotion available on best defence, but Punch has given it too them directly and will now go down one|pg||
nt|diumraid: NS could actually have gotten 1@S 1@C 1@H and a @C ruff to defeat this|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzxa: Almost a misclaim!|pg||
nt|diumraid: so potentially a good board for Wales|pg||

mb|p|nt|clinch: N will probably open a Multi here, and EW will compete in @s|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s certainly looks like a make|pg||
nt|diumraid: 4@H for NS here - looks like we will have an interesting set if things keep up like this|pg||
nt|diumraid: 4@S I meant|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  it might prove difficult for EW to avoid 4@h here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|paulg:  South has a normal takeout double of 2@h, but may not be sure of their agreements here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will want to bid but her hand is not as good as it looks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|diumraid: even taking the 1st 3 @C's cant hurt NS|pg||
pc|h9|nt|clinch: If you're going to overcal 1@d with the N hand, surely might as well double|pg||
pc|hA|nt|clinch: Fawcett's Double showed bal 13-16 or a very good hand, Dixon-style|pg||
nt|diumraid: Correction that is the only thing that would hurt NS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|clinch: Though in this case S has no major|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|clinch: S has implied @s tolerance by bidding 3@h|pg||
nt|clinch: offering to play in 3 of partner's major|pg||
nt|clinch: Well bid|pg||
nt|clinch: 5@h would cost 800 so this is the optimal spot for both sides|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|diumraid: Fairly straight forward 4@S here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|clinch: So called "absolute par", the most EW can gain, and the least NS can lose|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|clinch: Fawcett should be ok for 9 tricks here when J@c falls|pg||
nt|diumraid: should make 11 i think|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|clinch: Losing 2 trumps and a trick in each minor|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|paulg:  Hi everyone, I think we've missed a pass here and NS are playing 4@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator will be able to correct this shortly|pg||
nt|paulg:  unfortunately it seems that the two tables in this match are not "linked" at the moment, so we are not getting comparisons|pg||
nt|clinch: England gained 7 on 17 when Wales made a bit of a mess in 2NT, going 3 down|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|clinch: Moore will be concerned about the Q@c|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|c5|pc|hJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|paulg:  Unfortunately this will require a lot of undos and we'll probably lose the play of the hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  but board 17 is a flat board and Scotland gain 2 imps on board 18|pg||
nt|diumraid: So this is a potential good board for Ireland hre but difficult to find that club lead from AJTx|pg||

nt|clinch: Hi Gad|pg||
nt|viren169: Hello Peter|pg||
nt|diumraid: 4@S on here for EW - Can they get there ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  meanwhile, Patsy Meehan found a great lead to get the second undertrick for that contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|paulg:  Betty Cotter & Jean Kelly are North-South for Ireland - their system card is http://goo.gl/5BP8y (PDF)|pg||
nt|viren169: A bit of work to do for England |pg||
nt|diumraid: anyone for 3@D ?|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzxa: Long think by Moore over 1NT|pg||
nt|diumraid: First blood to Wales they bid and made 4@H on Brd 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  McGowan's two spades, and South's restraint, may remove any slam interest|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  slam does make, but at 50% it is a case of take it or leave it from a probability perspective|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Liz is made of sterner stuff and asks Punch to bid slam with a spade control|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, a mountain to climb - plenty of those in Wales|pg||
nt|viren169: a thin 2@S|pg||
nt|viren169: on a poor suit|pg||
nt|clinch: 7 of them though|pg||
nt|viren169: true... but still|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  Weak NT for Scotland and McGowan has no interest in game if partner cannot break the transfer|pg||
nt|viren169: Will you lead your own suit or Q of @H here?|pg||
nt|viren169: ummmmmmm|pg||
nt|clinch: I wouldn't lead Q@C !|pg||
nt|viren169: Not my choice!|pg||
nt|diumraid: apart from our Viewgraph operator there are many others too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Tough lead for Kelly and this will probably concede a couple of overtricks|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator can correct the result for board 3 .. (chat to me if you need help doing that)|pg||
nt|diumraid: This needs Declarer to get @D's right and also ruff a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: This is a real missed chance for England|pg||
nt|viren169: Q of hearts is a credible alternative with no entry to the spade suit|pg||
nt|diumraid: Thats the best lead for the defence here|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this will work well here, but the five-level may not have been safe if Punch held @sKx for example|pg||
nt|paulg:  however the odds are that she has values in hearts and clubs, which makes it a lot safer|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|diumraid: If West takes another @S finesse it will be costly|pg||
nt|diumraid: NS have managed to keep this low for the moment :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: I agree, though N has implied @h I guess|pg||
nt|viren169: No problems for declarer now|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  nice intermediates in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  Cotter does best to try and force dummy, but Punch's @c10 protects her|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzxa: fawcett giving this lots of thought|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|clinch: Here, should be 10 tricks in @h; any ruff will be with a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|diumraid: interesting hand - looks like 3@D will make but after a 3@D opening would NS finish up in 4@C ?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|diumraid: West must still lose a @S and a@c but needs to do soething with the 2 other @C losers - 1 can go on the @H in due course and the other on the @D9 but she does not know that yet :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: @h Ace led out of turn!|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Director not called!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|paulg:  good try by O'Neill, but unfortunately McGowan had no choice but to finesse in clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|clinch: England on the board with the overtrick on board 2 that proved elusive for Woodruff|pg||
nt|diumraid: that won't cost NS as it just becomes exposed so this will be 3@D +2 eithr way|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|diumraid: 1H to !K and ruff another @C now ?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|diumraid: always good to call the director in any event - makes it easier in the end and you get all your rights|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg:  i'm not sure I'd have played the king of clubs on the first round, if trumps don't break then you'd prefer to keep it|pg||

nt|paulg:  As a commentator I have to be even more circumspect than normal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  7 imps to Ireland on board 19 where the 2@h overcall was passed, so I make the score 46-27 to Scotland|pg||

nt|paulg:  A very good slam this time, but not an easy hand to bid opposite a weak 1NT|pg||
nt|clinch: I guess 6@c could have made on a non-@d lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  A perfect fit, when there are weak notrumps where you could not make game|pg||
nt|clinch: 1NT=12-14|pg||
mb|1D|nt|greerm: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|viren169: I hope South is not thinking of entering the auction here... ummmmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2NT will be a transfer to diamond and I guess 3@d denies support|pg||
nt|diumraid: Easy stuff - just drop the Doubleton @HQ !|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h looks comfortable enough|pg||
nt|viren169: If South dbles North is likely to pull it to 4@S|pg||
nt|clinch: Double would be a criminal act|pg||
nt|diumraid: 5@D makeable here for NS if they can drop than Singleton King !|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  sorry, it is Jean Kelly here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North-South play four-card majors with a strong 1NT, hence the 1@h opener|pg||
nt|clinch: Moore has to decide whether to step in here|pg||
nt|viren169: Similar to 1@S bid!|pg||
nt|diumraid: Interesting hand - if you had the @H10 you had a choice but missing the !Q and !10,9,8 all you can do is play for the drop :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Deep in thought!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|clinch: Seems it was W thinking|pg||
nt|diumraid: Some people play 4@D as keycard in @d's here|pg||

nt|vugraphzxa: No alert either side of the screen|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  i think this is a practical approach|pg||
nt|clinch: I think a reasonable choice, though could be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: and get the @c right|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|clinch: -2 is the best Moore can do here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|diumraid: Some specs saying that 1! position lucky. I agree and even luckier that they are missing @HQ10,9,8 as it eliminates all the choices|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|paulg:  13 imps to Scotland on board 20 when Ireland did not bid the slam|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|viren169: Both East/West pushed the boat out here |pg||
nt|clinch: W's 5@h a bit ambitious|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|clinch: Can understand E's 6@h|pg||
nt|viren169: West expected a bit more from pd|pg||
nt|viren169: And East expected a bit more from West...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  Kelly can pick up the trumps now, but has a spade and two diamonds to lose|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|diumraid: Can N figure out that East must have something more for there 1 @S bid and drop that K|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|paulg:  so probably down two but this aggressive bidding is typical of all the Irish teams in the Home Internationals|pg||
nt|paulg:  For those who have never operated a BBO vugraph, it is not the easiest job in the world especially in the Camrose|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  Even though they are playing with screens they play very quickly and often fail to show the operator their cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  although, to be fair, very few people accuse Sam Punch of playing too quickly, but Liz McGowan tries to make up for it|pg||
nt|clinch: 5@h with just 3 card support seems very optimistic to me|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|greerm: 4 tricks in and 2 trumps to come, 2 off|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|greerm: oops|pg||
nt|greerm: 1 off|pg||
nt|clinch: So, depending on whether England can bid and make 4@h in the other room, the swing will be either about 4 one way or 8 the other|pg||

nt|diumraid: Unfortuneately not :( - I would have  gone wrong too|pg||
nt|diumraid: And there you go - A big board for Wales and they will need many more of these if they are to catch Scotland in the overall|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  Information on the Lady Milne is available at http://ladymilne.welshbridgeunion.info/|pg||
nt|greerm: strong NT by south and west considers|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, 20 and 21 both good for Wales|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  This is the first match of five over the weekend for these teams|pg||

nt|diumraid: Not sure what defence NS aly to 1NT but im sure we wil lfind out now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: No you wont!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|diumraid: some might have choosen something to show both majors there but just as well Antoinette didn't|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  England, Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland are joined by a second team from the hosts, which this year is Wales and is called the WBU team|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  Time for a slam, although never easy to bid hands like McGowan's|pg||
nt|paulg:  An aggressive double by Punch|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|clinch: This should go down with two @s ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  Punch's 3@d is natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I expect 4@d is keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|paulg:  if her partner had any useful values, then you'd expect her to be balancing with spade shortage|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  and it seems that McGowan agrees, she must expect Punch to hold a penalty double|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Moore apologies for not doubling1|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s shows 0 key cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  so McGowan may bid 4NT to ask for the @dQ|pg||
nt|viren169: A-T of spades for a heart switch should see this down|pg||
nt|diumraid: Wales look to gain on board 5 as Ireand paying in 3NT rather than 4@S and that will probably go 2 down|pg||
nt|diumraid: Well i cn count at least 7 for EW|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzxa: redoubling!|pg||
nt|clinch: 3NT looks a trick short here if defended properly|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|paulg:  or may just bid 6@d as she expects Punch to hold three diamonds on this auction|pg||
nt|clinch: Aris for Wales found the Q@h lead to defeat 3NT on 20|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|paulg:  well bid, but I expect it will be bid by the Irish too|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this layout you can make all the tricks, but unlikely to bid it missing one of the key cards|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|clinch: Though maybe S gets sqqueezed on 5 rounds of @cs|pg||
nt|diumraid: but some say i can't cunt :)|pg||
nt|diumraid: count|pg||
pc|s2|nt|clinch: But on this lead NS can take 5 quick tricks|pg||
nt|clinch: That was nonsense about S being squeezed, sorry|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  if you recall board 19, Punch held AK109x in spades over the opening bidder|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs to take hert and play back a low diamond...|pg||
nt|diumraid: 9 should be easy enough here @DQ now|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|diumraid: East trying to set up hearts here asap|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|viren169: more imps flowing in Wales direction|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the general consensus is that double should be penalties here|pg||
nt|greerm: little play in this 8 trick hand|pg||
nt|clinch: Enough tricks now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|viren169:  21 wont be pretty|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|clinch: Not an easy hand to defend, the temptation to switch to a spade when in with the heart would be big|pg||

nt|greerm: 7 tricks rather|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, decent board for England, but the big swings are going West to Wales|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@D here?|pg||
nt|diumraid: Our first glimpse of  Slam hand of this set - but it cant make will be interesting to see what level we get to|pg||
nt|diumraid: and on that note Ireland have stretched their lead with 6 imps gained on 19|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|clinch: 2@h =  4-9 HCP, a least 9 cards in majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|clinch: Pretty tight one, but they need it|pg||
nt|diumraid: Good news for the Irish they gained 6 on board 5 as they made 2NT when Wales did not cash setting tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  EW play a convention called Kokish, so the auction will start 2@c-2@d-2@h-2@s-2NT to show 24-25 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  in the meantime, another 13 imps for Scotland as Symons/Adamson had a fine auction to 6@d on board 21|pg||
nt|clinch: Understandable raise to 3, though they'd have got away with 2|pg||
nt|clinch: Not quite such an understandable take-out double; a bit bold|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@h might be defeated on A@s lead I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore thinking!|pg||
nt|diumraid: board 4 even|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  another bidding challenge hand, a lot of slams already in this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Now Fawcett's turn to go to the Office!|pg||
nt|clinch: This lead isn't best|pg||
nt|clinch: @h lead won't be nice v 6@d|pg||
nt|diumraid: Am i correct in saying EW coul make 4@H here with 16 points between them ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: E comments on the quality of South's diamonds!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  and I expect they will finish in 4@s|pg||
nt|clinch: S needs to have nerve and run it to her Q|pg||
nt|clinch: and she has, well done|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  then West will transfer to spades and bid 3NT, offering a choice of games|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S looks like a general force and 3@D would have been better over 3@C|pg||
nt|diumraid: Nice contract here |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  the main decision for North is whether to play in hearts or spades|pg||
nt|viren169: true... with trumps 4-1 not so easy...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|diumraid: and not much play to it - this will be quick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|paulg:  unfortunately the Kokish sequence fails in a sense, as the weak hand will play the contract|pg||
nt|clinch: England did bid and make 4@h on 5, so an 8 IMP gain against the 300 in 2@S dbld|pg||
nt|diumraid: I think I am and Simon has not corrected me so I am probably right|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  slightly tricky, but you'd like to ruff a spade and then draw trumps|pg||
nt|paulg:  and concede a spade|pg||
nt|clinch: Will get a @s lead though|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: although a spade lead is likely|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3@S + 1@H + 4@D + 3@C should come to 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|clinch: On this one though, Wales should shortly be booking 730 in the plus column|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Correct|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  luckily that works here|pg||
nt|paulg:  11 imps for Ireland on 22 as they managed not to double 2@s|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|greerm: North has an entry now to lead @D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|viren169: Declarer needs to be careful not to pull too many trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|clinch: The result on 21 will be music to English ears... the English NS were allowed to play in 1@s doubled, making...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  I make the running score 72-38 to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  a trump looks the obvious play and it will leave declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Punch may be worried that declarer has another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps another trump|pg||
nt|paulg:  but she did get a correct count signal in clubs, so she knows declarer should be void in diamonds now|pg||
nt|paulg:  but these things are often less clear at the table in the heat of battle|pg||

nt|diumraid: another 2 imps to Ireland on brd 20:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|clinch: NS likely to take phantom sacrifice in 5@d here|pg||
nt|viren169: p/s in hearts here|pg||
nt|diumraid: 4@H has chance on this board|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  you would not normally raise to 3@s with the South hand, but the Michaels bid suggests that partner will have more than four|pg||
nt|viren169: Pushy 1@C by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: but 2@S is 100%|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  perhaps North would be better served bidding 4@c, but she does have a lot of wasted values in the majors|pg||
nt|clinch: Even pushier double|pg||
nt|viren169: Dble=support with 3 card support|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah yes, of course :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petka: we have an interesting board here. EW have some spades, but is it enough for agame try?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  We are still not linked correctly but we do have another slam hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's 4@s bid, with first round controls in three suits and six trumps does look conservative|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H = @H and a minor|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  and, indeed, this might encourage partner to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|greerm: a difficult opening lead, honours in every suit|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|clinch: Difficult decision for Fawcett, but this won't make, and neither would 5@d|pg||
nt|viren169: Not good... but duty bound once you have opened...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|petka: obviously not possible for EW to locate their 5-3 fit, and W will be looking at that heart void|pg||
nt|clinch: Of course NS @s didn't have to be 2-2, so pulling the double might have been right|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|diumraid: can this be made ? - I dont think so but we live in hope|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg:  Punch will be feeling pretty bad at the moment ... conceding -770 and giving away a slam on consecutive boards|pg||
nt|clinch: It just wasn't|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  but she will feel a little better now that the Irish have missed a biddable slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  and more so when she scores up and find out that her team mates bid and made the slam on 23 too|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe the running score is 72-38 to Scotland|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|clinch: No, has helped declarer|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  of course, if she had cashed the ace of hearts then declarer would have pitched two clubs on the spades, so the contract was always safe|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petka: not sure about that heart switch. If NS play udca, then S could see the spade threat and perhaps try to remove the club entry|pg||

mb|p|nt|diumraid: 2@H for EW and 4@C on for NS how hig hand who will win this auction ?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|petka: south certainly has the hand N is hoping for. This should be quick once N gets in|pg||
nt|clinch: Comfortable 4@s here for EW|pg||
nt|clinch: Another shaded opening bid by N|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petka: W would do well to signal negatively now for a diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this looks a fairly routine 3NT, especially with the diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|greerm: i think 4@S here at all 6 tables|pg||
nt|clinch: Moore has a kind of "mixed raise", but probably has no bid for that|pg||
nt|diumraid: @C lead best for defence here|pg||
nt|diumraid: Are NS playing 5 card majors ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|clinch: 2@d probably some game forcing checkback|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|paulg:  our operator has corrected board 3 to four spades making|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will probably lead the @hQ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch is a very aggressive bidder, so McGowan starts slowly ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but the 2@h bid is natural but confirms a sound overcall so she bids game|pg||
nt|diumraid: 2@S + 3@h +3@d AND MAYBE A @C for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  the normal lead but a welcome sight for Punch|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is still the problem of the heart losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  assuming trumps are 3-2, even if you draw trumps and pitch your club loser you still need a heart trick|pg||
nt|clinch: Nice easy 3NT, though by wrong hand in theory... all is well, though as @c finesse is right|pg||
pc|sA|nt|clinch: On 23 Wales gained 13 by playing in 3NT; easily made by establishing the @d suit|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  and you will run out of trumps |pg||
nt|petka: playing standard, the W hand actually must signal negatively, since the T would make it impossble to take 3 clubs if E holds AJx|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg:  the heart lead would worry declarer a little more, but in practice the defence is helpless|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  cue bids should uncover the @d weakness at the 4 level though|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  3NT from South, 4! North 4@h South tells North that South's diamond card is not the ace or king|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4c most obvious|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South would bid 4@d with a diamond control|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South debating between 3NT and 4@h it seems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think they will be in 5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perahps 3NT would be a serious slam try rather than an alterantive contract, in which case South cannot bid 3NT|pg||

nt|petka: this might be interesting if it starts 1C-1D-1S|pg||

nt|diumraid: Little to the play of this hand and little chance of making more than 8 - So Coffee time|pg||
nt|diumraid: I didn't think the players could hear me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Cotter may open 1NT on the South hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|paulg:  but whatever I expect that they'll reach 3NT pretty quickly|pg||
nt|clinch: The 3@h doubled was predictably a good board for Wales, stretching their lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: now E will have a real problem if N jumps in diamonds|pg||
nt|petka: a shot at 3N? some sort of strength double hoping to find 5+spades?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s in some peril here...will surely be reached|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i would upgrade the North hand and bid 2@H, assuming it was forcing for one round, due to the club fit|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  now has South shown a weak 1NT with spades, or a strong 1NT with failings?|pg||
nt|paulg:  North might well pass this|pg||
nt|clinch: Some sort of mixed raise |pg||
nt|diumraid: is that 2@H forcing or non forcing ?|pg||
nt|diumraid: this could get too high - very inviting hands here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petka: Interesting. Does E know the spades are 5+? Mike Lawrence says no, but some pairs use a double of 1D to show one or two 4card majors instead of promising both majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Moore leads out of turn - good job screen is still down!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  a couple of people have asked if North-South are playing 2/1|pg||
nt|paulg:  another making slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  The answer is yes, but that does not really apply in competitive auctions|pg||
nt|diumraid: nice spot to play in the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 1NT not the best spot |pg||
nt|diumraid: and can make 12 tricks on this lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: Ireland back in the lead aftr 7 imps gained on board 22|pg||
nt|diumraid: Well done :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|clinch: Looks as though 3NT makes here, EW's @d guards just being enough|pg||
pc|d2|nt|diumraid: assuming West does not cash@CA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: some would rebid 2@H  looking at a small doubleton @D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  most play that 2@h, over the 1@s overcall, is forcing just for one round|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|clinch: She'll do well to make this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petka: removing dummies last trump and playing D looks good for us, but what if W has the CQ? That is what south is thinking now|pg||
nt|clinch: 5@c also ok with @ss 3-3, but needs careful play|pg||
nt|clinch: 6@c no hope so they'd better stop here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure that is any better|pg||
nt|greerm: would have been a lot better|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  it's always easy to criticise an auction that does not deliver the best result, not always so clear what is the best action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, they can't run 5@D tricks|pg||
nt|clinch: Several ways to make here, it's a matter of combining chances|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|clinch: Well, on that lead very easy to make!|pg||
nt|diumraid: i have been informed tha Wales in 6@D on brd 7 which should be a gain for Ireland|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petka: W would like some sort of squeeze against N, but the entries are lacking if dummy is thrown in|pg||
nt|greerm: 6|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|diumraid: West will be hoeful after this lead but this hand will be quickr than the last a=with 10 tricks so go for coffee now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  Bidding fourth suit and then jumping to game should be a mild slam try|pg||
nt|clinch: Though I suppose can just concede 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  Cotter would not have expected the 1@s overcall, holding just one heart, but you can see that these 4441 hands can be tricky which is why a 1NT opener was an option|pg||
nt|greerm: and then signal a @H for 9 tricks, 3 down i fear|pg||

nt|diumraid: although NS may back in in @S if given the opportunity|pg||
nt|diumraid: a tied match now Wales off in 6@D on board 7 so 18 imps each now|pg||
nt|diumraid: These players appear to be playing at some speed here - remember they have been playing since Friday at 6.00pm and thats a lot of boards|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|petka: for a bridge player it is like paying the bus fare with a diamond ring|pg||

nt|clinch: Apparently that S hand isn't good enough to open|pg||
nt|clinch: This is a hand to defend rather than to play|pg||
nt|diumraid: Nice bid by West - might keep them out of trouble here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petka: it might be the right thing to do in some special situation, but you never really consider the possibility|pg||
nt|clinch: Worked well, as only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|diumraid: thinks are getting exciting here now|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  interestingly they reached game after passing the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  whereas the table that opened played in a part-score|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh seems to have a simple 1NT bid, much to West's relief, but perhaps they play double as denying four spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh being a short name for South, perhaps not the best one|pg||
nt|greerm: a practical 4@H bid with a bit f play for us |pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  surprising how often that seems to happen|pg||
nt|diumraid: but it doesn't as I say they are getting tired now - |pg||

nt|diumraid: this will be doubled :(|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petka: this is a guessing situation for inexperienced players, but for experts 3S is normally forcing here|pg||
nt|greerm: Grand National just had a false start|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore thinking|pg||
nt|petka: the spade and diamond aces are right, so this looks promising for S. The trick is not to set up a 5th loser before establishing the 9th winner. (2 aces and 2 clubs are already ...|pg||
nt|petka: losers after the lead if W holds the CT). Therefore hearts are not good to play on.|pg||
nt|diumraid: Surprised at the Dbl of 2@S and then no DBL of 3@S but won't complain i think this os going 1 of|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg:  in this case, the opening bid meant that the club fit never came to light|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Lane asking questions on the auction - screen is now down|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|diumraid: 2@s should be less than 7 points with 4@S but 3@S enough for East |pg||

nt|yo_yo: who is winning ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  as North seems to have denied the ace and king of clubs, unsurprising that South signed off|pg||
nt|petka: The E hand is a problem in standard systems. A bit heavy for a simple 2S rebid, but the suit quality is a bit poor for a jump to 3S|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs careful play; 3@c would have made reasonably easily|pg||
nt|clinch: All these losing @ds are a nuisance in 2@h|pg||

nt|paulg:  and they did the important job of beating the contract|pg||
nt|clinch: Really -2?|pg||
nt|clinch: Surely a club, 4 hearts and 2 spades?|pg||
nt|clinch: In the open room, Cook and Duckworth for England have had a very good card; a few lapses here from an English perspective|pg||
nt|diumraid: Ireland gained 2 imps on brd 11 when 1@H DBL went off one by North so Ireland have a slender lead after 11 comparisons|pg||
nt|diumraid: 7 more to Wales on 25 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|petka: This line, playing anyone for K singleton hearts, had its chance, but...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: neptune equester, 100-1 |pg||
nt|clinch: 1@c opened on all 11-13 balanced lacking a 5cM|pg||
nt|diumraid: Looks like a minor suit fight here although 3 of each will be difficult to make|pg||
nt|diumraid: Ingham bidding a weak 3@C bid showing 5+ support and less than 8 pts|pg||
nt|diumraid: 3@D seems reasonable from North now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|paulg:  2NT shows a good raise to 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: here is the multi|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|paulg:  another almost slam hand and the five level is safe if they decide to check for aces|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@c clearly used as a general force, but maybe taken by Kurbalija as a @h raise|pg||
nt|diumraid: but 3NT seems doomed - but we live in hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore apologies for not bidding 5@C|pg||
nt|greerm: do you agree that double Kath?|pg||
nt|greerm: with 4@H and not 4@S ?|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, Simon tells me that Fawcett was -2, so that certainly looks like a swing to Wales in the offing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: i certainly do not|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: "2C shows3"|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  1@s would have been more successful than double this time|pg||
nt|clinch: 3 hearts? or 3 clubs? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and I think it is a better call, since the spades are not really strong enough to bid if partner bids clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but I am old fashioned|pg||
nt|greerm: Also i would have treated it as lebensohl, so too weak to bid 3@C for me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and I bid lebensohl with the east hand|pg||
nt|greerm: N not a bit perturbed :)|pg||
nt|diumraid: England are currenty losing to Scotland 47-55|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  Just because we all overcall 1@s with very poor hands does not mean we cannot have a good one occasionally|pg||
nt|paulg:  lead of the @d2, lowest from xxx in partner's suit|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|clinch: 8 tricks most likely here... S had to rise with A@h, but after the opening bid that was easy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulg:  however, they did try 1@s in the other room and a direct raise to 4@h won the auction for Ireland|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  declarer does have some weapons though|pg||
nt|greerm: what think you K ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Wales have put on a few more IMPs on 28 and 29, taking the lead in this session and consolidating their win nicely|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: More good news for the Irish Wales are in 6@D on board 12 which should go 2 off so another 13 imp gain there|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  three rounds of diamonds preserving the king of spades as an entry|pg||
