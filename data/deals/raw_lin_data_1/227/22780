mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|athene: very well done to make 3nt - you have to drop the diamond don't you?|pg||
nt|athene: actually even that should not be enough|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|athene: south wondering whether to make a fit-showing jump i imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2h followed by 3@D gets the strength right, this seems an overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzwx: Slow alert from North|pg||
nt|georgia19: so England, who usually expect to win the Lady Milne, are 33 behind leaders going into this last set. One would think the selectors would have to have a long, hard look at this ...|pg||
nt|georgia19: policy of simply selecting the top three pairs after a very short pairs trial.  When I was interested in playing, only the top pair were guaranteed a game, which at least gave the ...|pg||
nt|georgia19: selectors a chance to correct a fluke, one off success or two|pg||

nt|athene: if you finesse trumps first you might be a bit stuck in hand|pg||
nt|athene: as far as selection trials goes, with BBO available for matches there is really no reason not to have very extensive trials|pg||

nt|fabsayc: spade seems normal|pg||
nt|georgia19: no reason not to on this layout|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C 1@S 1N 3N a bit simpler yes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: north obviously felt that with such a good hand, it was only a matter of making sure 6@D on a 4-4 fit was not missed|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: west might consider shifting to a club now|pg||
nt|athene: only way to beat is if partner has the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: and cashing the @HA would set up declarer's heart for a ninth trick|pg||
nt|georgia19: have a feeling heart Ace might hit deck...|pg||

nt|athene: that might be enough|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: this might work out very badly, steering NS into 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: danger button is on|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe in the closed room west overcalled hearts, and now it is a lot easier to dodge 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 3@D is natural and forcing|pg||
nt|athene: now south has the problem that she can show good hearts (and worry about clubs) but not the other way round|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H pass the buck (pound note)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: yes but 3@H sounds like good hearts and a club weakness|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: i mean unless you have some cutesy agreements|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 4@C|pg||
mb|4C|nt|penseur9:  sorry all, I must leave you... good bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told on board 5, they were 3@S-2 in the other room, so just 5 imps to scotland|pg||
nt|athene: that seems sensible - 3nt making was a bit far-fetched|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey i am on a roll|pg||
nt|fabsayc: someone will eventually have to decide where this auction is going|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: maybe south intended 3@H as a cue for diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but bidding controls for a minor suit below 3nt is always dodgy because it is usually ambiguous whether you are just probing for the right game|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||

nt|athene: declarer will have to do a lot of good guessing in 4@H|pg||
nt|georgia19: np, tx Simon |pg||
nt|athene: but if south bids 4@H i think west will probably bid 4@S|pg||

nt|athene: a spec suggests, reasonably enough, that south probably led the @SA because she was worried about getting endplayed with it |pg||
pc|s7|pc|c6|pc|sT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes that is a consideration when you have a singleton ace of trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: it seems interesting in 4@S ... even with 2 @Cs and @C ruff still might make |pg||

nt|viren169: prefer 4@H by South|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i suppose but with three hearts there is little danger|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anyway chalk one up to sound weak two bids|pg||
nt|athene: declarer stripped the hearts indeed, as suggested, but did not then find the endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzwx: East passes!!!!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: she had to make use of the club spots|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: go to dummy with a trump and lead a small club, and all the spots come into play - you try to duck a club to south|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: north inserts 8|pg||
nt|athene: if north puts in the 8 you cover|pg||
nt|athene: so small 8 Q K|pg||
nt|athene: and now south has to lead away from the 9|pg||

nt|georgia19: yea, 2 losers|pg||
