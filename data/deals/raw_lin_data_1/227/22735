nt|oleberg:  Monsted will have nightmares for weeks to come|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Welcome all|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Hi Ole|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: hi ole and henrik|pg||
mb|1S|nt|barbyh: hi , Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: here is a chance for a small pick-up for Schou|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South can make 3 N here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and even N with a heart guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: should be easy 3nt|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henrik_r:  Hi Torsten|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Good morning all  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w may reach 4 spades    but  may go down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a very quiet 4 @S for 420|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I'm your Danish commentator now.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dkkello:  Hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Good morning Mr. Hansen|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ady: hi Kjeld|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Hi Stig|pg||
nt|oleberg:  east has now shown 17+ with an unbalanced hand and 5+ spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot; you might really want the heart to be led up to, rather than through|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: given the double that's right.  Without it, it's just random|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stigw: The Multi coulndt knock E/W out this time.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  We start of with a board where the objective is NOT to win the battle for the contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  3 @S not veru optimistic bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  very|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead can make|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|oleberg:  7hcp, one probably useless and a flat distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Splendid bidding E/W in my eyes.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: well, you don't know partner has only @HAx - if he has @HAxx or @Hxx, clearly your hand is better-off declaring|pg||
nt|athene: @HAxx or @HKxx sorry|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Surpriding lead - with doubleton in pdÂ´s suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  South was a junior once , won the European title in 1970 http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=9046|pg||
nt|stigw: Might go down after this tantalizing lead.|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should go down  unless south takes first diamond  if east plays a spade to ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The way to make this one, would have been to take it in hand, and lead a diamond. But it is far from certain this would have been the best plan|pg||
nt|stigw: If declarer in the end could get timae to throw h loser on diamonds it makes, but....|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sommer: 3NT would actually be a better contract, but both games make|pg||
nt|sommer: the jump to 3NT seems to be given on the agreement, that 2@S is "sound" raise|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oleberg:  Its to late now, but we are many that will look forward to telleing Hagen, that he made a mistake at the very first trick of the tournament|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stigw: Up and diamonds, no ?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sommer: @SA, @SQ, @CK and run more @H's seems best|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: ..or K, Q:)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|oleberg:  Duck the diamond|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Although EW probably will make 2@H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: if partner does have @Hxx then you want to play it since west might be underleading @HAKxx(x) but east won't, i suppose|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|dkkello:  This is an observationtournament , results so fare http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1214.html|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A return of the @S9 would have been better than the @HK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dkkello:  N-S already on the national women team |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, a return of a passive club will even it out|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow-Hagen, Bjarnarson-Askgaard, Bilde-Graversen and Blakset-Schaltz are in contention for three spots on the Danish Open team for the European Championships|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|athene: given the double|pg||

nt|bensby2: interesting battle in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: W has left the table -- so a short break|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzcp: 2@s=10-12hcp 6@ss|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bensby2: 5sp X is the optimal spot for E/W|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Started as we hoped!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Jesper!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1520 - no swing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fourth best in your longest?|pg||
nt|ady: diamond  play before 2nd trump might have worked    south has to avoid an error|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: N: Nice lead pd|pg||
nt|stigw: Very difficult to reach the lay-down 3 nt here after the multi-start.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Note that the club had a lot of merit, Had West held the @C10 instead, the defence had been helpless|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Also nite the unblocking of the @CK|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oleberg:  If EW gets the hand to themselves, and East opens 1@C, West will have shown 6-6 with his second bid|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dkkello:  6 @D looks right here  |pg||
nt|stigw: In the previous I mean.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   or 6NT     e/w     must avoid 4-4 club fit at slam level|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - my screen was dirty...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Should end up in 6 NT.|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@D is makeable here NS, and 5@S may save 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 4@d would have shown 55 @D and @H (Leaping Michaels)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|sommer: Martin doesn't have a propor raise, but he's trying to figure S' hand ..before passing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..I guess!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Think so, but he is on the other side of the screen|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jesperdall:  thank god he doesnt have 7-6 then|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: They are safe to the 5-level, so west will survive investigation of slam.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In the other room West bid only 4 @S in this situation|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  do they have any tools to help them investigate safely below game?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  an "easy"  minor slam here |pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  EW CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/73y4mxl|pg||
mb|6S|nt|dkkello:  N-S using a natural system with 12-14 NT  and 5 card major |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite inspiring watching both sides competing fiercely for the second non-vulnerable undertrick|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/bubcthc|pg||
nt|sommer: oh yes..again, the commentators curse:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: What is 4@D?  Once there was a general rule not to m ake your first cue-bid in a void, but it may not have considered 6-6 hands|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So now south has shown an unbalanced hand with 4+ diamonds and 4 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The selection committee consist of, amongst others, Peter Schaltz, Rico Hemberg|pg||
mb|d|nt|jesperdall:  It shows 6-6 according to Ole ;)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @D is probably not a cue bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if specifically shortage, t hen it's fine, I guess, even if it's in partner's known long suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Only with @S7; if he had @S6 instead he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Very accurate system :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I have a known 10-card fit, I cuebid my shortness even in partners suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Isn't he short in clubs also?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 hts indicates spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I feel confident they wont end up in clubs. West only has to look at his own hand, to see it can never be right|pg||
nt|ady: good point     communication problem in 6NT  on spade lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think 2 @H is a relay ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No, 2@d promise @h, wek or strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: week|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: weak:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: so this shows a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Making the jump to 3@D a very comfortable option|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Lets see, if they can stop on a dime in 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: ..investment?:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  (Surely I couldn't)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If 4@D is non-forcing, south should pass|pg||
nt|sommer: could be worth 5 imps;-)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: I'm told they use 3N to start cue-bidding of  high card values|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But partner does not know it is a 10-card fit?!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Well, he is infinitely longer in clubs than diamonds...|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Anyway, very tough problem|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  And sure easts hand could be more suitable for slam|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|oleberg:  Doesn't matter. If I know of 10 trumphs, I do it|pg||
nt|stigw: No Ady, 1 superflous trick makes it easy.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But it was to tough|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oleberg:  But just change the @CQ ti the @HJ, and the game is excellent|pg||
nt|sommer: an almost certain -800 here, and in that case 5 imps compared to 5@D=|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: sorry    still 12 tricks   only need 2 heart tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dkkello:  east-vest trying to make it to the national team , who will be decided sunday after this tournament|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Which is also the superflous trick, that makes 6@D easy (on a spade lead)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|stigw: OK, even if 6 nt best, but East are afraid of a H-lesd in 6 nt. |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But, after all, thats playing partner for perfect values, and partner did sign off|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d2|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  If North had been the least bit interested she could have bid 3@S or 4@C instead of 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: it would for sure have been better for W to take the direct sacrifice in 5@S, hoping to put N overboard in 6@D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|stigw: Dont go for overtricks in teams, well done.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: indeed :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bensby2: 2 H is not forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: 2@h = non forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|bensby2: a difficult decision by N - he could have bid 2 diamonds - going for a game - but large risk for misfit|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: Yes|pg||
nt|dkkello:  12 tricks claimed i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  E-W using a strong club system ...|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S NS is a decent contract here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  not what schou is longing for|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Also sure more pairs will be in 5@D. But it is still an oppertunity for NS pairs to excel|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  1NT = 11-14|pg||
nt|oleberg:  4@H on for EW, a diamond will go on the spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@h easy to make, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes , good morning Peter  |pg||
nt|thorvald: 5-6 in the majors, how to bid it ?|pg||
nt|sommer: isn't he wtrong enough to go "direct" via 1@H, 2@S?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..could be a misfit hand, of course|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 3NT is not, whta N wants|pg||
mb|1D!|an|4+!H|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  20 against 20 here ,but looks like action!  |pg||
nt|oleberg:  If east gets the chance to bid heart volountarily, West will support, and they might get there|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|jesperdall:  so east staymans and then 3NT - what's your lead?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can make 3 NT double-dummy...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  renember N-S dont play together on regular basis and a weak 2 can have many faces|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2NT for minor by N?|pg||
nt|thorvald: You will have to bid @Hs first, |pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Only 15 !!! - tournament director !|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dkkello:  N need a good hand to enter the bidding , obviously :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: OK, I will call:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Or not obviously|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  How is to say that the have a minor fit?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  How -> Who|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|stigw: Interesting developement, but surely E/W wont end up in 3 nt.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Wow, you agree with 4@H?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dkkello:  it took them 2 seconds to bid 4 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcq: 2nt was Lebensohl|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes I agree|pg||
mb|4C!|an|cuebid|nt|oleberg:  Diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: As cards lie, looks better for east to play 3N, as @D lead from north seems best for NS|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and Konow is know as a very thoughtfull (slow) player|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Partner has 14+hcp and we have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|thorvald: It would have been worse if partner opens 1 @D, then rebids 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  this lead may hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@S on the other hand, quite a bid|pg||
nt|stigw: Boesgaard gort the highest bid of course !|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@D is transfer, by the way ..NS play a "homemade" system called Nusine-klør (=clubs) ..named after Lars' former cat;-)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dkkello:  Dbl. in first round surely for majors (or something ells) so he couldent|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S not afraid of bidding normally ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a bit lucky p had 5 @C  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  interest suit in itself, diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: tht west a little conservative  might have re-bid 3 clubs    but final contract probably the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcq: S to E: In your younger days, you had a clearcut pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  correct to play the 6 from dummy? not sure...|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Depends whether North has the 7 or 9|pg||
nt|othered1: if south decides to shift to @C, 10 is winning play|pg||
nt|thorvald: if 4@c is a cue, what is 4@h then ?|pg||
nt|sommer: can it stand a trumplead?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|stigw: Can anybodo telle me the differance between a Yarbouroug and "an Earl of Botwell" ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and strange to play the Q  here , ..  even easyer i must admit since I can see all cards!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jesperdall:  south should have considered this earlier and ducked smoothly|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  now it is easy for declarer to continue spades from dummy as done|pg||
nt|sommer: with a @Hentry in W, I think maybe a trumplead could have set it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|oleberg:  Konow has always been slow and thoughtfull (Except once; when he dumped me as a partner)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: ..2 trumpleads:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow carefull to unblock the @SAK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzcq: 1@c was 16+ |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hagen did as well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  always hard for the defense in situations like this - trying to find a way to defeat the contract|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|sommer: as so often before, trumpleads are very often good against preference-contrakts|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|s3|nt|dkkello:  my point is that a goos defenser like Askgaard hates to lead away from a king here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sommer: ..contracts..even|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jesperdall:  flat board then, needed to continue diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|stigw: Well done by both sides - seems to be high class all around at this table.|pg||
nt|thorvald: From säffle @S there was a convention called Lissabon, where 4@C would agree on @h and 4@d agree on @S, this is probably what happened here from marins perspective|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barbyh: should have pitched the ht nine|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: an example of "system misses a game" ... or?|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Either @HK in East or a little help, e.g. @D lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that decent; you need the @HK on the weak hand.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  6 @S is a good contract except for the spade break'|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  well, well, 6 spades looks good on paper|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S would require simply good breaks in both majors.|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  potential swing in schou's favour|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|oleberg:  West would never miss the defence against 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Diffucult to bid however|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  but always hard to bid a slam when the opponents open the bidding|pg||
nt|sommer: 12-14 NT and transfer |pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  any control issues in 4 spades?|pg||
nt|othered1: with @S 3-2, defense of 6@S that began with @C, @C, tapping dummy, would then require @H split (or stiff 10) as well.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS play 15-17 NT in 3rd position vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w likely to get to 4@S    |pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I don't know whether RD is strenght or Hx, but feel certain it virtually denies 3 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Switch the @SQ and the @CJ what would West lead then? I would guess diamonds ;) |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Will North bid 1NT or 2@C ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|oleberg:  By bidding 1@S it can be seen, that West doesn't evaluate his hand to be woth a game-force, facing their opening style|pg||
nt|sommer: with one of the red aces right, this is an easy make|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|athene: you would be ok if someone had 2 trumps and 1 heart|pg||
nt|athene: take the force, draw 2xtrumps, then play @HAQ|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the same applies with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: may encounter some problems  with diamonds and sspades 4-1|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|stigw: Wrong to bid 1 sp in my opinion, but with partner limited to at most 15 it makes sence.|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  so, now two top hearts pitching a diamond, then diamonds?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I wouldn't have done it either, but there is two tens, and a lot of controls|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  so 1 imp to schou - more coming that way on this board, perhaps|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  as they bid and made a heart game in the other room|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|henrik_r:  Probably pass, pass 1@D which can be 11-13 bal|pg||

nt|dkkello:  just spoked to Bjarnasson ,who will play tomorrow instead of Bruun with Askgaard as usualy |pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  it is a great game - its hard to bid and easy to make!|pg||

mb|d|nt|thorvald: At the other table NS never found the @S fit and vent down in 2@H - a terrible result|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I must leave.  Thanks everyone and bye!|pg||

nt|dkkello:  good one for N-S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hagen is not a big fan of bridge in the early monrning |pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  staying out of game is good bridge - well bid EW, despite the loss of imps|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A little sof by West not to bid 2@H, after all it's white vs white (Where going down is punished least, and defeating oponents is rewarded least|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: I think LB forgot that it could be a marmic, as EW are showing 8 @hs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stigw: I dont know if 2 cl as 4 th suit was gameforcing, but Boesgaard has his "stuff" as opposed to his partner.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  But his partner opened in third hand, and the double indicates hearts will not behave|pg||
