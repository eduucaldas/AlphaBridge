mb|p|nt|athene: but you don't really have a good bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: easier to pass 2@D if you play artificial 2@C with some good hands; that limits the range of 2@D/@h/@S rebid|pg||

nt|athene: and then events will suggest to her that that plan won't work|pg||

nt|dburn: this has chances if declarer gets spades right, which is likely after West's double of 2@d|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are playing a Multi, so East did not have the option of opening a weak 2@d|pg||

nt|dburn: or of course she may not|pg||

nt|eamongall: maybe 2 times 140 .. thats about 7 imps |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  East intended to raise 3@h to 4@h, which is why she is thinking of a slam|pg||
