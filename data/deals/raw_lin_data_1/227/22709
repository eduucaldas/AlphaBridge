nt|kingcur: just in case we would end up in a draw; are there extra boards to be played then?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sorta 6@D here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @d is ok -just have to bid it|pg||

nt|kingcur: 14 likely|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Am still looking at the auction to 6@D|pg||
nt|kingcur: East opened a natural 1@D there and jump-rebid 3NT, showing (semi)-solid @D suit and a good hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: and west invited slam with 4@D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|penseur9: 4@S should also make depending on play|pg||
