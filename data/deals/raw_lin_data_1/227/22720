mb|5S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  perhaps North would be better served bidding 4@c, but she does have a lot of wasted values in the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  We are still not linked correctly but we do have another slam hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's 4@s bid, with first round controls in three suits and six trumps does look conservative|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  this looks a fairly routine 3NT, especially with the diamonds 3-3|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  our operator has corrected board 3 to four spades making|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will probably lead the @hQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch is a very aggressive bidder, so McGowan starts slowly ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but the 2@h bid is natural but confirms a sound overcall so she bids game|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  the normal lead but a welcome sight for Punch|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is still the problem of the heart losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  assuming trumps are 3-2, even if you draw trumps and pitch your club loser you still need a heart trick|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||

mb|1H|nt|paulg:  Cotter may open 1NT on the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but whatever I expect that they'll reach 3NT pretty quickly|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|paulg:  i would upgrade the North hand and bid 2@H, assuming it was forcing for one round, due to the club fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|paulg:  now has South shown a weak 1NT with spades, or a strong 1NT with failings?|pg||
nt|paulg:  North might well pass this|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  a couple of people have asked if North-South are playing 2/1|pg||
nt|paulg:  another making slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  The answer is yes, but that does not really apply in competitive auctions|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  most play that 2@h, over the 1@s overcall, is forcing just for one round|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bidding fourth suit and then jumping to game should be a mild slam try|pg||
mc|12|nt|paulg:  Cotter would not have expected the 1@s overcall, holding just one heart, but you can see that these 4441 hands can be tricky which is why a 1NT opener was an option|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  whereas the table that opened played in a part-score|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh seems to have a simple 1NT bid, much to West's relief, but perhaps they play double as denying four spades|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|paulg:  when they go through the hands in the post-mortem, Punch might consider that this hand is a better takeout double of 1@s than the takeout double she tried to make on board 22|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|paulg:  as North seems to have denied the ace and king of clubs, unsurprising that South signed off|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg:  2NT shows a good raise to 3@h|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  another almost slam hand and the five level is safe if they decide to check for aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  1@s would have been more successful than double this time|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  and I think it is a better call, since the spades are not really strong enough to bid if partner bids clubs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  Just because we all overcall 1@s with very poor hands does not mean we cannot have a good one occasionally|pg||
nt|paulg:  lead of the @d2, lowest from xxx in partner's suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  for those who play MUD, it is not a bad leading agreement but just never play it in partner's suit|pg||
