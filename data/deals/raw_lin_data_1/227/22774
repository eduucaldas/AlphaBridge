nt|clinch: Cards don't lie very well for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: but 2NT looks manageable|pg||

nt|paulg:  this is a quiet 3NT where the only question is the number of overtricks|pg||

nt|clinch: Might be a small swing to England|pg||
nt|clinch: if Wales overstretch or don't play carefully|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|paulg:  it looks like Punch and McGowan have swapped seats, a little unusual as most players have a preference especially when playing with screens|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|clinch: Another part score hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: 4@h seems straightforward here; NS have to go through a Multi which will have it played by the weak hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|clinch: EW can make 4@c, NS in theory can make 4@d but in practice won't|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  or perhaps they haven't :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: 3C alerted by Lane!|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|vugraphzxa: Alert recinded|pg||
nt|clinch: Fawcett showing extra strength through fourth suit; might get NS bidding, though|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  East-West showed some good understanding here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  many might think that 3@s is invitational and McGowan would have a quick accept|pg||
nt|clinch: 2NT in the NS system shows a particular weak 2-suiter; this sequence shows 21-23 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but clearly it is just competing|pg||
nt|clinch: Well bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Several opportunities for NS to jam things with @d bids, but contented themselves with a couple of doubles|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|dJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|clinch: The very favourable lie should yield 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|clinch: No real advantage / disadvantage in who plays this one, but transfers weren't really designed to play contracts this way up|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|paulg:  there is a trump promotion available on best defence, but Punch has given it too them directly and will now go down one|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|clinch: Another possible swing to England as they rest in a disciplined part score|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c6|nt|paulg:  but the club return has allowed her to pitch both diamond losers so the contract will make|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|ady: similar aauction in CR  except opening was 2 diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|clinch: N will probably open a Multi here, and EW will compete in @s|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s certainly looks like a make|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|paulg:  it might prove difficult for EW to avoid 4@h here|pg||
mb|d|an| |mb|3H|nt|paulg:  South has a normal takeout double of 2@h, but may not be sure of their agreements here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will want to bid but her hand is not as good as it looks|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|clinch: If you're going to overcal 1@d with the N hand, surely might as well double|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Fawcett's Double showed bal 13-16 or a very good hand, Dixon-style|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Though in this case S has no major|pg||
pc|d7|nt|clinch: S has implied @s tolerance by bidding 3@h|pg||
nt|clinch: offering to play in 3 of partner's major|pg||
nt|clinch: Well bid|pg||
nt|clinch: 5@h would cost 800 so this is the optimal spot for both sides|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|clinch: So called "absolute par", the most EW can gain, and the least NS can lose|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|clinch: Fawcett should be ok for 9 tricks here when J@c falls|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|clinch: Losing 2 trumps and a trick in each minor|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone, I think we've missed a pass here and NS are playing 4@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator will be able to correct this shortly|pg||
nt|paulg:  unfortunately it seems that the two tables in this match are not "linked" at the moment, so we are not getting comparisons|pg||
nt|clinch: England gained 7 on 17 when Wales made a bit of a mess in 2NT, going 3 down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|clinch: Moore will be concerned about the Q@c|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|paulg:  Unfortunately this will require a lot of undos and we'll probably lose the play of the hand|pg||

nt|viren169: Hello Peter|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|paulg:  meanwhile, Patsy Meehan found a great lead to get the second undertrick for that contract|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Betty Cotter & Jean Kelly are North-South for Ireland - their system card is http://goo.gl/5BP8y (PDF)|pg||
nt|viren169: A bit of work to do for England |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: Long think by Moore over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  McGowan's two spades, and South's restraint, may remove any slam interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  slam does make, but at 50% it is a case of take it or leave it from a probability perspective|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Liz is made of sterner stuff and asks Punch to bid slam with a spade control|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, a mountain to climb - plenty of those in Wales|pg||
nt|viren169: a thin 2@S|pg||
nt|viren169: on a poor suit|pg||
nt|clinch: 7 of them though|pg||
nt|viren169: true... but still|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  Weak NT for Scotland and McGowan has no interest in game if partner cannot break the transfer|pg||
nt|viren169: Will you lead your own suit or Q of @H here?|pg||
nt|viren169: ummmmmmm|pg||
nt|clinch: I wouldn't lead Q@C !|pg||
nt|viren169: Not my choice!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  Tough lead for Kelly and this will probably concede a couple of overtricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator can correct the result for board 3 .. (chat to me if you need help doing that)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|clinch: This is a real missed chance for England|pg||
nt|viren169: Q of hearts is a credible alternative with no entry to the spade suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulg:  this will work well here, but the five-level may not have been safe if Punch held @sKx for example|pg||
nt|paulg:  however the odds are that she has values in hearts and clubs, which makes it a lot safer|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|clinch: I agree, though N has implied @h I guess|pg||
nt|viren169: No problems for declarer now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  nice intermediates in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  Cotter does best to try and force dummy, but Punch's @c10 protects her|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzxa: fawcett giving this lots of thought|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|clinch: Here, should be 10 tricks in @h; any ruff will be with a natural trump trick|pg||

nt|paulg:  7 imps to Ireland on board 19 where the 2@h overcall was passed, so I make the score 46-27 to Scotland|pg||

mb|4H|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h looks comfortable enough|pg||

nt|paulg:  North-South play four-card majors with a strong 1NT, hence the 1@h opener|pg||

nt|viren169: Similar to 1@S bid!|pg||

pc|c8|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  so probably down two but this aggressive bidding is typical of all the Irish teams in the Home Internationals|pg||
nt|paulg:  For those who have never operated a BBO vugraph, it is not the easiest job in the world especially in the Camrose|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  Even though they are playing with screens they play very quickly and often fail to show the operator their cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  although, to be fair, very few people accuse Sam Punch of playing too quickly, but Liz McGowan tries to make up for it|pg||
nt|clinch: 5@h with just 3 card support seems very optimistic to me|pg||

nt|paulg:  An aggressive double by Punch|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|clinch: This should go down with two @s ruffs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  Punch's 3@d is natural and game forcing|pg||

nt|paulg:  if her partner had any useful values, then you'd expect her to be balancing with spade shortage|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s6|pg||

nt|clinch: Aris for Wales found the Q@h lead to defeat 3NT on 20|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  well bid, but I expect it will be bid by the Irish too|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this layout you can make all the tricks, but unlikely to bid it missing one of the key cards|pg||

pc|h6|nt|clinch: Though maybe S gets sqqueezed on 5 rounds of @cs|pg||

nt|clinch: That was nonsense about S being squeezed, sorry|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  dont I count five side tricks so all you need to do is take six trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  9 tricks after knocking out the @dK|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  assume this a slow connection rather than thinking by West|pg||
nt|athene: if the play record is to be believed, declarer in 5@D in the other room won the spade lead and took a trump finesse then a club finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzwz: as i said S and W were scribbling and not bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwz: S wanted to know what 3@Ss was |pg||

nt|athene: with so many entries to dummy, declarer can't even go wrong by finessing diamonds and blocking them|pg||
nt|athene: 9 easy tricks (4 diamonds, 2 spades, heart, 2 clubs) which will turn into at least ten when declarer refuses the club finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  have to teach the right way to count losers|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|ady: Wales now getting uncatchable|pg||

nt|viren169: 6@D here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|clinch: 2@h =  4-9 HCP, a least 9 cards in majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|clinch: Pretty tight one, but they need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  EW play a convention called Kokish, so the auction will start 2@c-2@d-2@h-2@s-2NT to show 24-25 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  in the meantime, another 13 imps for Scotland as Symons/Adamson had a fine auction to 6@d on board 21|pg||
nt|clinch: Understandable raise to 3, though they'd have got away with 2|pg||

nt|clinch: S needs to have nerve and run it to her Q|pg||
nt|clinch: and she has, well done|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  then West will transfer to spades and bid 3NT, offering a choice of games|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S looks like a general force and 3@D would have been better over 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|paulg:  the main decision for North is whether to play in hearts or spades|pg||
nt|viren169: true... with trumps 4-1 not so easy...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  unfortunately the Kokish sequence fails in a sense, as the weak hand will play the contract|pg||
nt|clinch: England did bid and make 4@h on 5, so an 8 IMP gain against the 300 in 2@S dbld|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  slightly tricky, but you'd like to ruff a spade and then draw trumps|pg||
nt|paulg:  and concede a spade|pg||
nt|clinch: Will get a @s lead though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: although a spade lead is likely|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3@S + 1@H + 4@D + 3@C should come to 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|clinch: On this one though, Wales should shortly be booking 730 in the plus column|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  I make the running score 72-38 to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  a trump looks the obvious play and it will leave declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Punch may be worried that declarer has another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps another trump|pg||
nt|paulg:  but she did get a correct count signal in clubs, so she knows declarer should be void in diamonds now|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: too much in spades |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  their card is http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/cookduckworth.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: north wondering whether to bid 4@S or 5@D i suppose|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|henryb:  how can she bid 4N with three small clubs opposite shortness|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|athene: well, west isn't leading a heart against 6@D, now she knows declarer has four of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  6@d needs only 1 finesse|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a @c can go on the second spade|pg||
nt|athene: on a club lead, east has to play LOW, does she?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may well lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise west can be squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  you have to handle the fourth heart as well as the finesse|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: in 5@D    best to play hearts early  and intending to ruff 4th heart with 10@D    6 diamonds though too high|pg||
nt|athene: club to king and queen|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: now you knock out the @DA and run all the trumps and @CQ and spades and west is crushed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks right Bill|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|athene: of course no reason to play for that, especially|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb:  doesn't she have a round suit squeeze now?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  no|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|henryb:  not anymore|pg||
nt|athene: there are so many squeeze possibilities though as well as finesse possibilities in hearts|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: ruff spade, then run the trumps looks as though it keeps most options alive|pg||
nt|athene: you may end up getting it right simply because west's second heart is the 10|pg||
nt|athene: so when she has to come down to only two hearts, you see the 10 appear, and you decide she would not throw that from @H10xx originally|pg||
nt|henryb:  Greenland should have played a third club when she won the @dA to eliminate the squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: no, declarer knocked out the @DA first|pg||
nt|athene: east did return a second club when she won the @DA, but that is not enough|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer had cashed the @CAQ then played trumps, yes, a club back would have worked|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|d4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: i think Nicole will get it right now - at the end it will be almost a 50-50 guess between the squeeze and the finesse, and a squeeze is a lot more fun|pg||
nt|athene: (as well as the inference from the @H10, as mentioned)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  Now trumps and you get a pentagonal squeeze|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|sJ|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb:  heart pitch and one the next trick you have a double squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now it is a sure thing anyway|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  yes do not need to guess who has the @hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  the squeeze is a lock|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: so it was a compound squeeze, but was it legit? west would have done better to throw a heart first|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  really?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that does not help her - yes a genuine compound squeeze|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should have thrown the @C|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|paulg:  next door the Irish defended 3NT very well to earn themselves two imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|petka: south certainly has the hand N is hoping for. This should be quick once N gets in|pg||
nt|clinch: Comfortable 4@s here for EW|pg||
nt|clinch: Another shaded opening bid by N|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|petka: W would do well to signal negatively now for a diamond switch|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  this looks a fairly routine 3NT, especially with the diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|greerm: i think 4@S here at all 6 tables|pg||
nt|clinch: Moore has a kind of "mixed raise", but probably has no bid for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: 2@d probably some game forcing checkback|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  our operator has corrected board 3 to four spades making|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will probably lead the @hQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch is a very aggressive bidder, so McGowan starts slowly ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but the 2@h bid is natural but confirms a sound overcall so she bids game|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the normal lead but a welcome sight for Punch|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is still the problem of the heart losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  assuming trumps are 3-2, even if you draw trumps and pitch your club loser you still need a heart trick|pg||
nt|clinch: Nice easy 3NT, though by wrong hand in theory... all is well, though as @c finesse is right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|clinch: On 23 Wales gained 13 by playing in 3NT; easily made by establishing the @d suit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|paulg:  and you will run out of trumps |pg||
nt|petka: playing standard, the W hand actually must signal negatively, since the T would make it impossble to take 3 clubs if E holds AJx|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  the heart lead would worry declarer a little more, but in practice the defence is helpless|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|clinch: The Q@h gives the overtrick|pg||
nt|clinch: Looking like a very healthy win on the horizon|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s9|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|paulg:  the players have 2 hours and 5 minutes to play 16 boards, so if we started on time then they are doing okay|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|paulg:  so I think she is playing for the @hJ onside and a favourable lie of the cards|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  this looks like 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulg:  as it happens, North would have been in difficulty on two more rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|greerm: for results so far go to http://ladymilne.welshbridgeunion.info/results/|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c6|pc|h5|nt|paulg:  but carefull discarding would still have made the defence favourites|pg||

nt|athene: 1@SX on a trump endplay and then 6@D on a squeeze|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  West was squeezed in three suits, and had to abandon spades|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: really it was impossible for east to duck at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: her partner might have led from the @CQ instead of the @CJ|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ady: just the 3 trump tricks to lose in 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  only on even date Saturdays|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: north has good hope to beat this one|pg||
nt|athene: slightly cautious to make a game try with that west hand i think; just 4@S looks reasonable, vulnerable|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  I had a pentagonal clash squeeze once|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6 loser hand but good controls and the sixth spade|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  time to abandon trumps|pg||
nt|athene: 11 tricks still possible, if declarer does stuff in the right order, and ruffs diamonds in hand, rather than clubs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: might end play north for an overtrick here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  East had to shift to a heart|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: throw a diamond on the @CK and crossruff the red suits and north ends up with only trumps left|pg||

nt|petka: this might be interesting if it starts 1C-1D-1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Cotter may open 1NT on the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but whatever I expect that they'll reach 3NT pretty quickly|pg||
nt|clinch: The 3@h doubled was predictably a good board for Wales, stretching their lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petka: now E will have a real problem if N jumps in diamonds|pg||
nt|petka: a shot at 3N? some sort of strength double hoping to find 5+spades?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s in some peril here...will surely be reached|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|paulg:  i would upgrade the North hand and bid 2@H, assuming it was forcing for one round, due to the club fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|paulg:  now has South shown a weak 1NT with spades, or a strong 1NT with failings?|pg||
nt|paulg:  North might well pass this|pg||
nt|clinch: Some sort of mixed raise |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petka: Interesting. Does E know the spades are 5+? Mike Lawrence says no, but some pairs use a double of 1D to show one or two 4card majors instead of promising both majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Moore leads out of turn - good job screen is still down!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a couple of people have asked if North-South are playing 2/1|pg||
nt|paulg:  another making slam|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  The answer is yes, but that does not really apply in competitive auctions|pg||
pc|hT|nt|greerm: 1NT not the best spot |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though 3NT makes here, EW's @d guards just being enough|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: some would rebid 2@H  looking at a small doubleton @D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  most play that 2@h, over the 1@s overcall, is forcing just for one round|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|clinch: She'll do well to make this|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petka: removing dummies last trump and playing D looks good for us, but what if W has the CQ? That is what south is thinking now|pg||
nt|clinch: 5@c also ok with @ss 3-3, but needs careful play|pg||
nt|clinch: 6@c no hope so they'd better stop here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: not sure that is any better|pg||
nt|greerm: would have been a lot better|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's always easy to criticise an auction that does not deliver the best result, not always so clear what is the best action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, they can't run 5@D tricks|pg||
nt|clinch: Several ways to make here, it's a matter of combining chances|pg||
pc|cK|nt|clinch: Well, on that lead very easy to make!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petka: W would like some sort of squeeze against N, but the entries are lacking if dummy is thrown in|pg||
nt|greerm: 6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bidding fourth suit and then jumping to game should be a mild slam try|pg||
nt|clinch: Though I suppose can just concede 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  Cotter would not have expected the 1@s overcall, holding just one heart, but you can see that these 4441 hands can be tricky which is why a 1NT opener was an option|pg||
nt|greerm: and then signal a @H for 9 tricks, 3 down i fear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6 card suit?   i didnt see|pg||
pc|h4|nt|greerm: 4@H now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|clinch: Fawcett will be pleased to see trumps don't break|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petka: for a bridge player it is like paying the bus fare with a diamond ring|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  Wiseman and McQuaker have done well to bid the game in the other room, on a combined 22 count|pg||
nt|clinch: Apparently that S hand isn't good enough to open|pg||
nt|clinch: This is a hand to defend rather than to play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petka: it might be the right thing to do in some special situation, but you never really consider the possibility|pg||
nt|clinch: Worked well, as only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  interestingly they reached game after passing the South hand|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|paulg:  whereas the table that opened played in a part-score|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh seems to have a simple 1NT bid, much to West's relief, but perhaps they play double as denying four spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh being a short name for South, perhaps not the best one|pg||
nt|greerm: a practical 4@H bid with a bit f play for us |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|paulg:  surprising how often that seems to happen|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|clinch: 1NT would have been an uphill struggle, and so shall 2@s be|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|petka: this is a guessing situation for inexperienced players, but for experts 3S is normally forcing here|pg||
nt|greerm: Grand National just had a false start|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore thinking|pg||
nt|petka: the spade and diamond aces are right, so this looks promising for S. The trick is not to set up a 5th loser before establishing the 9th winner. (2 aces and 2 clubs are already ...|pg||
nt|petka: losers after the lead if W holds the CT). Therefore hearts are not good to play on.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  in this case, the opening bid meant that the club fit never came to light|pg||

nt|paulg:  Alistair has pointed out that 6@c, or even 6@d, is a better contract than 3NT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|clinch: Looks as though it could have been defeated by extremely sharp defence|pg||

nt|clinch: This one will also fail...just not enough tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: who is winning ?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  as North seems to have denied the ace and king of clubs, unsurprising that South signed off|pg||
nt|petka: The E hand is a problem in standard systems. A bit heavy for a simple 2S rebid, but the suit quality is a bit poor for a jump to 3S|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs careful play; 3@c would have made reasonably easily|pg||

nt|paulg:  and they did the important job of beating the contract|pg||
nt|clinch: Really -2?|pg||
nt|clinch: Surely a club, 4 hearts and 2 spades?|pg||
nt|clinch: In the open room, Cook and Duckworth for England have had a very good card; a few lapses here from an English perspective|pg||
mb|1C|an| |mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petka: This line, playing anyone for K singleton hearts, had its chance, but...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: neptune equester, 100-1 |pg||
nt|clinch: 1@c opened on all 11-13 balanced lacking a 5cM|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|nt|paulg:  2NT shows a good raise to 3@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|greerm: here is the multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  another almost slam hand and the five level is safe if they decide to check for aces|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@c clearly used as a general force, but maybe taken by Kurbalija as a @h raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore apologies for not bidding 5@C|pg||
nt|greerm: do you agree that double Kath?|pg||
nt|greerm: with 4@H and not 4@S ?|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, Simon tells me that Fawcett was -2, so that certainly looks like a swing to Wales in the offing|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i certainly do not|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: "2C shows3"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  1@s would have been more successful than double this time|pg||
nt|clinch: 3 hearts? or 3 clubs? :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  and I think it is a better call, since the spades are not really strong enough to bid if partner bids clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: but I am old fashioned|pg||
nt|greerm: Also i would have treated it as lebensohl, so too weak to bid 3@C for me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and I bid lebensohl with the east hand|pg||
nt|greerm: N not a bit perturbed :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  Just because we all overcall 1@s with very poor hands does not mean we cannot have a good one occasionally|pg||
nt|paulg:  lead of the @d2, lowest from xxx in partner's suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  for those who play MUD, it is not a bad leading agreement but just never play it in partner's suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happy in fact|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: it's about time these doubles were punished|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  declarer should probably start clubs by playing the @cQ, in case West has @cJ9xx|pg||
nt|paulg:  not that it matters this time|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|clinch: 8 tricks most likely here... S had to rise with A@h, but after the opening bid that was easy|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  however, they did try 1@s in the other room and a direct raise to 4@h won the auction for Ireland|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|clinch: If she hadn't risen, W's Q@s could eventually have been promoted into a 6th defensive trick|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||

nt|greerm: what think you K ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Wales have put on a few more IMPs on 28 and 29, taking the lead in this session and consolidating their win nicely|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|paulg:  three rounds of diamonds preserving the king of spades as an entry|pg||

pc|c3|nt|clinch: Good raise by Fawcett here...as it turns out 12 tricks can be made with the @s finesse and no wasted @d values|pg||
