nt|oleberg:  and let just assume North had covered with the @CQ if they had played 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Many pairs use it to promise additional strength|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|skaftij:  Blakset - Schaltz is a new constellation, so I don't think the auction was under full control|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: is this a Blakset 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: showing 0-5hcp and "any" distribution|pg||
nt|jron: 2@s is a weak pre in any suit, i think|pg||
nt|jron: can be 5-card suit if @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|oleberg:  about the double: Normally I would agree, but after 1m-1NT, I would prefer the double to show ekstra strenght. It is a much needed option, and major contracts are somehow not so importent|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: "I played something like it -- When I was VERY young" says S --- and laughs :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|jron: West is always unbal so you dont need D to show that hand |pg||
nt|skaftij:  I agree with Ole, it is important to be able to show extras|pg||
nt|oleberg:  No, but you need to distinguish the strenght. With a purely competitive hand, you can bid a minor, and be vitually certain to land on your feet.|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Monsted will have nightmares for weeks to come|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Welcome all|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Hi Ole|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: hi ole and henrik|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: hi , Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: here is a chance for a small pick-up for Schou|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South can make 3 N here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and even N with a heart guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: should be easy 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Hi Torsten|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Good morning all  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: e/w may reach 4 spades    but  may go down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a very quiet 4 @S for 420|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I'm your Danish commentator now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Hi David|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henrik_r:  Good morning Mr. Hansen|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ady: hi Kjeld|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Hi Stig|pg||
nt|oleberg:  east has now shown 17+ with an unbalanced hand and 5+ spades|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot; you might really want the heart to be led up to, rather than through|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: given the double that's right.  Without it, it's just random|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: The Multi coulndt knock E/W out this time.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  We start of with a board where the objective is NOT to win the battle for the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 2@c = nat. limited or 15-18 - 2@H = max 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 @S not veru optimistic bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  very|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead can make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oleberg:  7hcp, one probably useless and a flat distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Splendid bidding E/W in my eyes.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: well, you don't know partner has only @HAx - if he has @HAxx or @Hxx, clearly your hand is better-off declaring|pg||
nt|athene: @HAxx or @HKxx sorry|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Surpriding lead - with doubleton in pdÂ´s suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  South was a junior once , won the European title in 1970 http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=9046|pg||
nt|stigw: Might go down after this tantalizing lead.|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should go down  unless south takes first diamond  if east plays a spade to ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The way to make this one, would have been to take it in hand, and lead a diamond. But it is far from certain this would have been the best plan|pg||
nt|stigw: If declarer in the end could get timae to throw h loser on diamonds it makes, but....|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sommer: 3NT would actually be a better contract, but both games make|pg||
nt|sommer: the jump to 3NT seems to be given on the agreement, that 2@S is "sound" raise|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oleberg:  Its to late now, but we are many that will look forward to telleing Hagen, that he made a mistake at the very first trick of the tournament|pg||
pc|hK|nt|stigw: Up and diamonds, no ?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sommer: @SA, @SQ, @CK and run more @H's seems best|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: ..or K, Q:)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|d5|nt|oleberg:  Duck the diamond|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Although EW probably will make 2@H|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: if partner does have @Hxx then you want to play it since west might be underleading @HAKxx(x) but east won't, i suppose|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|dkkello:  This is an observationtournament , results so fare http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1214.html|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A return of the @S9 would have been better than the @HK|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S already on the national women team |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, a return of a passive club will even it out|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow-Hagen, Bjarnarson-Askgaard, Bilde-Graversen and Blakset-Schaltz are in contention for three spots on the Danish Open team for the European Championships|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzcq: houlberg thinking...|pg||
nt|thorvald: No entries so should she not just grab this ?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|athene: given the double|pg||
nt|dkkello:  V-E trying to make it on the open team ..|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|oleberg:  Well, the heart return was just as fine. Just dont rusj the diamonds|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  This tournament is one of the factors the selectors will take into consideration|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|stigw: He couldnt do better, very unlucky E/W|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  Not just an every-day-lead from @C J x x x x|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|oleberg:  On a club, East must rise with the 10, or else partner is endplayed|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pc|s4|nt|thorvald: 1 down, that looks pretty normal|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|skaftij:  A dubious bidding strategy though, must admit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: 1@c :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Ah, better not get too high|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|oleberg:  anybody knows how the bidding went?|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Attitude I suppose|pg||
nt|skaftij:  costly King|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: yes --according to the cc I can see here at the table EW play attitude against nt|pg||
nt|oleberg:  This board does not make EW look good|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If they play attitude, the seems to me, to be a dubious play|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The @HK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With all spots in view, King is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: results after round 4 of 9: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3812.html|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Started as we hoped!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Jesper!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1520 - no swing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fourth best in your longest?|pg||
nt|ady: diamond  play before 2nd trump might have worked    south has to avoid an error|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: N: Nice lead pd|pg||
nt|stigw: Very difficult to reach the lay-down 3 nt here after the multi-start.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Note that the club had a lot of merit, Had West held the @C10 instead, the defence had been helpless|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Also nite the unblocking of the @CK|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  If EW gets the hand to themselves, and East opens 1@C, West will have shown 6-6 with his second bid|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think 2@s would have made|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dkkello:  6 @D looks right here  |pg||
nt|stigw: In the previous I mean.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   or 6NT     e/w     must avoid 4-4 club fit at slam level|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - my screen was dirty...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Should end up in 6 NT.|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@D is makeable here NS, and 5@S may save 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 4@d would have shown 55 @D and @H (Leaping Michaels)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|sommer: Martin doesn't have a propor raise, but he's trying to figure S' hand ..before passing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..I guess!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Think so, but he is on the other side of the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  thank god he doesnt have 7-6 then|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: They are safe to the 5-level, so west will survive investigation of slam.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In the other room West bid only 4 @S in this situation|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  do they have any tools to help them investigate safely below game?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  an "easy"  minor slam here |pg||
nt|thorvald: I would have bid 1NT on the East hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henrik_r:  EW CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/73y4mxl|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: me too|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dkkello:  N-S using a natural system with 12-14 NT  and 5 card major |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite inspiring watching both sides competing fiercely for the second non-vulnerable undertrick|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/bubcthc|pg||
nt|sommer: oh yes..again, the commentators curse:)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: What is 4@D?  Once there was a general rule not to m ake your first cue-bid in a void, but it may not have considered 6-6 hands|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So now south has shown an unbalanced hand with 4+ diamonds and 4 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The selection committee consist of, amongst others, Peter Schaltz, Rico Hemberg|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jesperdall:  It shows 6-6 according to Ole ;)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @D is probably not a cue bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if specifically shortage, t hen it's fine, I guess, even if it's in partner's known long suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Only with @S7; if he had @S6 instead he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Very accurate system :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I have a known 10-card fit, I cuebid my shortness even in partners suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Isn't he short in clubs also?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 hts indicates spades?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oleberg:  I feel confident they wont end up in clubs. West only has to look at his own hand, to see it can never be right|pg||
nt|ady: good point     communication problem in 6NT  on spade lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think 2 @H is a relay ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No, 2@d promise @h, wek or strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: week|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: weak:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: so this shows a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Making the jump to 3@D a very comfortable option|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Lets see, if they can stop on a dime in 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: ..investment?:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (Surely I couldn't)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If 4@D is non-forcing, south should pass|pg||
nt|sommer: could be worth 5 imps;-)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: I'm told they use 3N to start cue-bidding of  high card values|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But partner does not know it is a 10-card fit?!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Well, he is infinitely longer in clubs than diamonds...|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Anyway, very tough problem|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  And sure easts hand could be more suitable for slam|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|oleberg:  Doesn't matter. If I know of 10 trumphs, I do it|pg||
nt|stigw: No Ady, 1 superflous trick makes it easy.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But it was to tough|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oleberg:  But just change the @CQ ti the @HJ, and the game is excellent|pg||
nt|sommer: an almost certain -800 here, and in that case 5 imps compared to 5@D=|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: sorry    still 12 tricks   only need 2 heart tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dkkello:  east-vest trying to make it to the national team , who will be decided sunday after this tournament|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Which is also the superflous trick, that makes 6@D easy (on a spade lead)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|stigw: OK, even if 6 nt best, but East are afraid of a H-lesd in 6 nt. |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But, after all, thats playing partner for perfect values, and partner did sign off|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  If North had been the least bit interested she could have bid 3@S or 4@C instead of 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: it would for sure have been better for W to take the direct sacrifice in 5@S, hoping to put N overboard in 6@D|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cT|nt|stigw: Dont go for overtricks in teams, well done.|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: Yes|pg||
nt|dkkello:  12 tricks claimed i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  E-W using a strong club system ...|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S NS is a decent contract here|pg||
nt|thorvald: A game in @ss for EW, |pg||
mb|1N|mb|3C|nt|jesperdall:  not what schou is longing for|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Also sure more pairs will be in 5@D. But it is still an oppertunity for NS pairs to excel|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  1NT = 11-14|pg||
nt|oleberg:  4@H on for EW, a diamond will go on the spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@h easy to make, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes , good morning Peter  |pg||
nt|thorvald: 5-6 in the majors, how to bid it ?|pg||
nt|sommer: isn't he wtrong enough to go "direct" via 1@H, 2@S?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..could be a misfit hand, of course|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 3NT is not, whta N wants|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  20 against 20 here ,but looks like action!  |pg||
nt|oleberg:  If east gets the chance to bid heart volountarily, West will support, and they might get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  so east staymans and then 3NT - what's your lead?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can make 3 NT double-dummy...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  renember N-S dont play together on regular basis and a weak 2 can have many faces|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2NT for minor by N?|pg||
nt|thorvald: You will have to bid @Hs first, |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stigw: Only 15 !!! - tournament director !|pg||
nt|thorvald: The weak NT strikes again|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|dkkello:  it took them 2 seconds to bid 4 @H |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzcq: 2nt was Lebensohl|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes I agree|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: As cards lie, looks better for east to play 3N, as @D lead from north seems best for NS|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and Konow is know as a very thoughtfull (slow) player|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Partner has 14+hcp and we have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|thorvald: It would have been worse if partner opens 1 @D, then rebids 2@C|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jesperdall:  this lead may hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@S on the other hand, quite a bid|pg||
nt|stigw: Boesgaard gort the highest bid of course !|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@D is transfer, by the way ..NS play a "homemade" system called Nusine-klør (=clubs) ..named after Lars' former cat;-)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dkkello:  Dbl. in first round surely for majors (or something ells) so he couldent|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S not afraid of bidding normally ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a bit lucky p had 5 @C  |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jesperdall:  interest suit in itself, diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: tht west a little conservative  might have re-bid 3 clubs    but final contract probably the same|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzcq: S to E: In your younger days, you had a clearcut pass|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jesperdall:  correct to play the 6 from dummy? not sure...|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Depends whether North has the 7 or 9|pg||
nt|othered1: if south decides to shift to @C, 10 is winning play|pg||
nt|thorvald: if 4@c is a cue, what is 4@h then ?|pg||
nt|sommer: can it stand a trumplead?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|stigw: Can anybodo telle me the differance between a Yarbouroug and "an Earl of Botwell" ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and strange to play the Q  here , ..  even easyer i must admit since I can see all cards!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  south should have considered this earlier and ducked smoothly|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  now it is easy for declarer to continue spades from dummy as done|pg||
nt|sommer: with a @Hentry in W, I think maybe a trumplead could have set it|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|oleberg:  Konow has always been slow and thoughtfull (Except once; when he dumped me as a partner)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2 trumpleads:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|vugraphzcq: 1@c was 16+ |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hagen did as well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jesperdall:  always hard for the defense in situations like this - trying to find a way to defeat the contract|pg||

nt|dkkello:  me to|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  it is sometimes said, that women players lacks bidding-courage|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Now probably a reopening T/O double by East|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C is "weak" with both MA|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: decided on the safe game    which looks right    |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  E are preemping e-v out of and @S contract|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It is not the case for any of the participants in this tournament|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|thorvald: Wonder what that bid shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: my guess is cuebid|pg||
nt|thorvald: A @D lead to get 2 tricks vs a @s contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: the problem for south is, that she only holds 3@s, so no she wishes that she bid something else than 2@s|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|ady: would need a maximum weak 2   and suitability   like singleton spade|pg||
nt|stigw: Konows supermax (?) wasnt even tired to be detected, and with that lead it was perhaps wrong (but I really dont think so).|pg||
nt|barbyh: which could be beaten but still a good save|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (Not for any of the males either)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  btw. They are playing with screens, helps them when they need to think |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  N-S started very strong this session|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@D from W would have been "small+" slaminterest with 5-5 MA|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: *now|pg||
nt|thorvald: With a single @d in East all it takes is the right view in spades and clubs to make 6@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: Now its a maximum 2@s only lacking a spade|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Either @HK in East or a little help, e.g. @D lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that decent; you need the @HK on the weak hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|nilsland:  6 @S is a good contract except for the spade break'|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  well, well, 6 spades looks good on paper|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S would require simply good breaks in both majors.|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  potential swing in schou's favour|pg||
mb|d|nt|oleberg:  West would never miss the defence against 4@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nilsland:  Diffucult to bid however|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  but always hard to bid a slam when the opponents open the bidding|pg||
nt|sommer: 12-14 NT and transfer |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  any control issues in 4 spades?|pg||
nt|othered1: with @S 3-2, defense of 6@S that began with @C, @C, tapping dummy, would then require @H split (or stiff 10) as well.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS play 15-17 NT in 3rd position vulnerable|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: e/w likely to get to 4@S    |pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I don't know whether RD is strenght or Hx, but feel certain it virtually denies 3 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Switch the @SQ and the @CJ what would West lead then? I would guess diamonds ;) |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Will North bid 1NT or 2@C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  By bidding 1@S it can be seen, that West doesn't evaluate his hand to be woth a game-force, facing their opening style|pg||
nt|sommer: with one of the red aces right, this is an easy make|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|athene: you would be ok if someone had 2 trumps and 1 heart|pg||
nt|athene: take the force, draw 2xtrumps, then play @HAQ|pg||
nt|thorvald: It looks to me like 5@d was an interesting contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nilsland:  the same applies with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: may encounter some problems  with diamonds and sspades 4-1|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|stigw: Wrong to bid 1 sp in my opinion, but with partner limited to at most 15 it makes sence.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  !--lead would have been better - as very often|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  results  http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3809.html|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oleberg:  Right, still I would prefer to stay out, competent defenders usualy leads right in these situations. But of course it will make a reasonable amount of times|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It seems as West needs to guess @D to make |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|thorvald: She needs to time this correct|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stigw: I think it will go down on the bad breaks, but we'll see.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  On the lead of @S 5, North might go down|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|barbyh: best lead for defense|pg||
nt|barbyh: cant go down|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  Small @S to the Ace and @s back, North must duck to make 3 NT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Defending, taking your ruffs would have been easier|pg||
pc|cT|nt|stigw: Trumph now ?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|oleberg:  (Underleading @DA on the blind lead, for -3)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  A fourth round of @C would surely have doomed the contract|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|barbyh: can only take 3 sp and 1 cl|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stigw: Not good to establish Cl K.|pg||
nt|ady: home now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|thorvald: She now knows that there are no way home, and should just get on to the next board|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  No - if North covers, defense has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - leading the 5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|stigw: Right, should make now.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzcq: short break|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It was easy for South to see, that a fourth club was needed, but impossible to communicate this to partner.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Agree, very very hard (impossible?) for North to figure this out|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I feel a little silly for eating 6 Mars-Icecream bars yesterday afternoon|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I assume that is because you *only* ate six?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now I have no Mars-Icecream bars :(|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, I'll have tom learn to buy more boxes|pg||
nt|thorvald: On a trumph lead, South would play @H, then ducking from East wouldnt that leave South with a problem|pg||

nt|nilsland:  If East wins this trick 3 N will go down|pg||
nt|thorvald: Pressure on declare from the start - if he get it wrong EW will switch to spades|pg||
nt|othered1: is there a case to p lay the ace?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think declarer has too few tricks for that|pg||
nt|thorvald: Ace might be an idea, but only because T of @H drops out|pg||
nt|sommer: as we see, 5@C is without chances..3NT would be far better|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oleberg:  Here West had to guess. he guessed right, but with enough guesses, you'll go wrong from time to time|pg||

nt|ralfwil:  has anyone of you heard about Miami Coup?|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  and a very healthy lead|pg||

nt|stigw: Ok all - nobody has given in at this table untill now (except ovetrricks)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  As there are 12 tricks this demnostrates why we do not have a "kibitzer-claim" button ;)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2:  But declarer had a blind spot. After the !10 appeared he had a safe route to 9 tricks by continuing with a low heart from hand|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  4NT making in the other room - not exactly a walk in the park...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcq: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  North, for some reason not quite clear to me, chose to show the 21 hcp as 22-24 hcp|pg||
nt|thorvald: Did he claim before getting the lead at 3rd trcik ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: yes|pg||
nt|thorvald: Strange claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: i think it was an attempt to speed things up - first 6 boards has taken 65 min and only 55 min left for last 8 boards|pg||

nt|oleberg:  I wouldn't have done it either, but there is two tens, and a lot of controls|pg||
nt|sommer: the destiny of the contract depends on the @Cguess|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stigw: Diamond lead might make this shaky.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LetÂ´s see @H to the 9 - and KING...!|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks more likely to make    4 hearts likely down on the same diamond lead unless getting spades right|pg||
nt|dkkello:  great pas from E here  ..|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I must leave.  Thanks everyone and bye!|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jesperdall:  staying out of game is good bridge - well bid EW, despite the loss of imps|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A little sof by West not to bid 2@H, after all it's white vs white (Where going down is punished least, and defeating oponents is rewarded least|pg||
pc|s8|nt|thorvald: I think LB forgot that it could be a marmic, as EW are showing 8 @hs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  But his partner opened in third hand, and the double indicates hearts will not behave|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Roland, I do not see how to make 4@s. Perhaps I am blind|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: I suppose the E pass over 4@s is a forcing pass|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In CR, West bid 4@c. After that, slam had to be reached|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobholl: if west bids 5@C now east will bid 6 i guess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now East will bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Do you prefer 4@c with the W hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: no 3nt is the practical bid|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hard to say|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Bob Hamann: "If 3nt is an option - then bid it" .. isnt he right always :)?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|skaftij:  If East has something like 3451 , you probably regret 3NT|pg||

nt|stigw: I think 4 sp will be down on a di-lead overtaken by South followed by a cl-switch, so wd E/W.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|oleberg:  Come on, 4@C|pg||
nt|thorvald: Needing to strip clubs, play a @s to the king and endplaying west, not the best plan|pg||
nt|thorvald: Men du har nok ret i at efter indmelding på 1-trinnet er det oftere 5 farve, hvorimod indmelding på 2 trinnet fulgt af dobling oftere er 6-3-3-1|pg||

mb|p|mb|6C|nt|oleberg:  Whar about you guys, facing a passed hand, wouldn't you at least give it 3@C?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I would do something as North|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 1/2 @C  |pg||
nt|bensby2: at least 3cl|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now EW has all the room they need, to unearth the bad spade suit. And they will. (I'll bet you a box of Mars-Icecream bars.)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  needed run rate is 11, so 12 needed to start the move|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Mathias  are looking foreward to a Leffe after this session |pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  a good reason to play 2/1|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  We are not taking that bet. We know you have no ice cream bars|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  good brain we share|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: We will start with board 26-27-28|pg||

nt|skaftij:  To Kibz: please imagine a result, operator has left:-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: here N played 2nt going down 1 I guess :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: dont know what happend with the BBO - score?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|oleberg:  And young Martin Schaltz, easily the most imaginative of the danish elite|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: 2@H = both majors -- I guess :) -- i havent seen the EW cc anywhere on the internet|pg||
mb|d|nt|jron: both majors yes|pg||
nt|oleberg:  They play a system Lars invented, but Martin has made numerous changes, the first player Lars has accepted to do this.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: NS convention card can be found here: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Iceland/BSJorgensen-Einarsson.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  the convention is not uncommon in Denmark, and the standard is, that you shouldn't bid it with 6-4.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ady: east will open |pg||
nt|oleberg:  It will be with 2@C then|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I disagree with the good-judgement. 3@C might easily have gotten EW to 5@S|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C|nt|henryb:  15.2 imps per board needed|pg||
nt|stigw: Interesting board this one - what is East's opening ?|pg||
nt|ady: as you said  |pg||
nt|oleberg:  And 3!X (which would never happen) is only -300|pg||
nt|sommer: a minor partial is max here..3@D NS, best?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ady: has to be 2 clubs  playing strong club|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West is opening a bottle of valium :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|henrik_r:  Agree. I still think passing and giving the opponents a free run is loosing in the long run|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It is always said, that you should preempt less against bad opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  But we both know careless declarers who would start with a @S to the king and go down in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But somehow people are less inclined to accept the corrollary: You should preempt more against good opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: different aproach in the 2 rooms - and very different contracts :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stigw: And from now anything can happen.|pg||
nt|duschek: South doubles to get all three suits into the picture - better than 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: could be a swing here   3NT looks difficult|pg||
nt|dkkello:  4 @H not down yet   |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  When playing at toplevel they all think they are better than the opponents ;)|pg||
nt|thorvald: You should not open 2@h with 5-card @s - EW getting as deserved in the other room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: now might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: @d9 is missing:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sommer: 2@H is very close, but with 4c in W it may go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Schaltz has left the table...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  Apparently N-S in this room play something resembling ACOL, so after 1@s-2@d-2@h north had no forcing bid in spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wow|pg||
nt|bensby2: interesting lead|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3nt seems unbeatable|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well a preempt might have made declarer more prone to play a spade to the king (But that is circumstansial, in my opinion)|pg||
nt|bensby2: but nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: S: What is 3@D? -- W: A bid...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will take some time but making in the end |pg||
nt|oleberg:  I can't see lead?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow is declarer so this will take quite some time|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No lead yet...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Ok thx, just Bensby rambling...|pg||
nt|sommer: I think Martin has to finesse @H8 to make, or?|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@C = Nat or 15-19 NT, 1@S = 0-5 or 6+ with @Ds, 1NT=15-15, 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2 @H-loosers and one in each other suit, seems ok to me|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  12 unless he goes 4 down|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I bet my money on the defense|pg||
nt|smoller:  the 9th trick|pg||
nt|stigw: Lokks difficult to make with right defence, but ...?|pg||
nt|duschek: 9 tricks now - 2 spades, 1 heart, 2 clubs, 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I bet against Kello|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead   better|pg||
nt|duschek: Very difficult lead though - dummy will likely hold the major suits, and declarer has announced club stoppers|pg||
nt|stigw: Now it looks better.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  always always lead a @H  they thought us last summer |pg||
nt|stigw: I thought it was in the South hand.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  k @C after all , this is rama|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  South does not have an easy hand to lead from|pg||
nt|dkkello:  very nice , but ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Who has a nice butt?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The lead is not that far-fetched or rama-influenced|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Just helps speed things up :)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|henrik_r:  Expensive @C10|pg||
