mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|oleberg:  2@H = a "weak" raise to 2@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|oleberg:  2@D would have been a slightly invitational raise (Or better)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|Walddk4: Difference of style, 2@C overcall in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  3@C is part of Lebensohl, showing a better hand than one that just bids because partner doubled|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A 2@C overcall on the South is not clear cut. Among experts, I am certain it would attract a lot of discussion|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Monsted will have nightmares for weeks to come|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Welcome all|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Hi Ole|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: hi ole and henrik|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: hi , Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
mb|1H|nt|thorvald: here is a chance for a small pick-up for Schou|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South can make 3 N here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and even N with a heart guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: should be easy 3nt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henrik_r:  Hi Torsten|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Good morning all  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: e/w may reach 4 spades    but  may go down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a very quiet 4 @S for 420|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I'm your Danish commentator now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Welcome all|pg||
nt|dkkello:  danish trial -out  , |pg||
mb|d|nt|dkkello:  Hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Good morning Mr. Hansen|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dkkello:  results http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1216.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Kjeld|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Hi Stig|pg||
nt|oleberg:  east has now shown 17+ with an unbalanced hand and 5+ spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot; you might really want the heart to be led up to, rather than through|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: given the double that's right.  Without it, it's just random|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi folks, I'm your commentator in this round.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stigw: The Multi coulndt knock E/W out this time.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  We start of with a board where the objective is NOT to win the battle for the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 2@c = nat. limited or 15-18 - 2@H = max 8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  3 @S not veru optimistic bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  very|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead can make|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|oleberg:  7hcp, one probably useless and a flat distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Splendid bidding E/W in my eyes.|pg||
nt|stigw: We see 2 of the most favoured Danish pair-combinations clash here at this table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: hi Stig|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: well, you don't know partner has only @HAx - if he has @HAxx or @Hxx, clearly your hand is better-off declaring|pg||
nt|athene: @HAxx or @HKxx sorry|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Surpriding lead - with doubleton in pdÂ´s suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  South was a junior once , won the European title in 1970 http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=9046|pg||
nt|stigw: Might go down after this tantalizing lead.|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should go down  unless south takes first diamond  if east plays a spade to ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The way to make this one, would have been to take it in hand, and lead a diamond. But it is far from certain this would have been the best plan|pg||
nt|stigw: If declarer in the end could get timae to throw h loser on diamonds it makes, but....|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sommer: 3NT would actually be a better contract, but both games make|pg||
nt|sommer: the jump to 3NT seems to be given on the agreement, that 2@S is "sound" raise|pg||
nt|stigw: I was switched I see to the other table.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg:  Its to late now, but we are many that will look forward to telleing Hagen, that he made a mistake at the very first trick of the tournament|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stigw: Up and diamonds, no ?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sommer: @SA, @SQ, @CK and run more @H's seems best|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sommer: ..or K, Q:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S is pretty sure to represent Denmark in open tournament  .., but had a slow start this weekend|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dkkello:  they play a strong club system|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dkkello:  E-V represent Denmark in Dublin  (females)  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|oleberg:  Duck the diamond|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Although EW probably will make 2@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: if partner does have @Hxx then you want to play it since west might be underleading @HAKxx(x) but east won't, i suppose|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|dkkello:  This is an observationtournament , results so fare http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1214.html|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A return of the @S9 would have been better than the @HK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dkkello:  N-S already on the national women team |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, a return of a passive club will even it out|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow-Hagen, Bjarnarson-Askgaard, Bilde-Graversen and Blakset-Schaltz are in contention for three spots on the Danish Open team for the European Championships|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: houlberg thinking...|pg||
nt|thorvald: No entries so should she not just grab this ?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|athene: given the double|pg||
nt|dkkello:  V-E trying to make it on the open team ..|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|oleberg:  Well, the heart return was just as fine. Just dont rusj the diamonds|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  This tournament is one of the factors the selectors will take into consideration|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stigw: He couldnt do better, very unlucky E/W|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not just an every-day-lead from @C J x x x x|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all. I have been asked to commentate in this room, but missed the start|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|oleberg:  On a club, East must rise with the 10, or else partner is endplayed|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Started as we hoped!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Jesper!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1520 - no swing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fourth best in your longest?|pg||
nt|ady: diamond  play before 2nd trump might have worked    south has to avoid an error|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: N: Nice lead pd|pg||
nt|stigw: Very difficult to reach the lay-down 3 nt here after the multi-start.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Note that the club had a lot of merit, Had West held the @C10 instead, the defence had been helpless|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Also nite the unblocking of the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Hi Stig|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oleberg:  If EW gets the hand to themselves, and East opens 1@C, West will have shown 6-6 with his second bid|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think 2@s would have made|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  6 @D looks right here  |pg||
nt|stigw: In the previous I mean.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   or 6NT     e/w     must avoid 4-4 club fit at slam level|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - my screen was dirty...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Should end up in 6 NT.|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@D is makeable here NS, and 5@S may save 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 4@d would have shown 55 @D and @H (Leaping Michaels)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|sommer: Martin doesn't have a propor raise, but he's trying to figure S' hand ..before passing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..I guess!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Think so, but he is on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|dkkello:  you are always slow Stig!  welcome|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp|pg||
nt|dkkello:  grand old man og danish bridge|pg||
nt|stigw: Interesting device that 2 H-opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  thank god he doesnt have 7-6 then|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: They are safe to the 5-level, so west will survive investigation of slam.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In the other room West bid only 4 @S in this situation|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  do they have any tools to help them investigate safely below game?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  an "easy"  minor slam here |pg||
nt|thorvald: I would have bid 1NT on the East hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henrik_r:  EW CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/73y4mxl|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: me too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dkkello:  N-S using a natural system with 12-14 NT  and 5 card major |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite inspiring watching both sides competing fiercely for the second non-vulnerable undertrick|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/bubcthc|pg||
nt|sommer: oh yes..again, the commentators curse:)|pg||
nt|stigw: Difficult to reach 3 nt now, but 4 sp will probably also make|pg||
nt|dkkello:  welcome Al Hollander  , american expert|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: What is 4@D?  Once there was a general rule not to m ake your first cue-bid in a void, but it may not have considered 6-6 hands|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So now south has shown an unbalanced hand with 4+ diamonds and 4 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The selection committee consist of, amongst others, Peter Schaltz, Rico Hemberg|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jesperdall:  It shows 6-6 according to Ole ;)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @D is probably not a cue bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if specifically shortage, t hen it's fine, I guess, even if it's in partner's known long suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Only with @S7; if he had @S6 instead he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Very accurate system :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I have a known 10-card fit, I cuebid my shortness even in partners suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Isn't he short in clubs also?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 hts indicates spades?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oleberg:  I feel confident they wont end up in clubs. West only has to look at his own hand, to see it can never be right|pg||
nt|ady: good point     communication problem in 6NT  on spade lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think 2 @H is a relay ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No, 2@d promise @h, wek or strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: week|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: weak:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: so this shows a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Making the jump to 3@D a very comfortable option|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Lets see, if they can stop on a dime in 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: ..investment?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Hi Al|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can anyone explain reason for using this type of 2@H opener?|pg||
nt|stigw: No problem it seems - wd.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|oleberg:  (Surely I couldn't)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If 4@D is non-forcing, south should pass|pg||
nt|sommer: could be worth 5 imps;-)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: I'm told they use 3N to start cue-bidding of  high card values|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But partner does not know it is a 10-card fit?!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Well, he is infinitely longer in clubs than diamonds...|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Anyway, very tough problem|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  And sure easts hand could be more suitable for slam|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dkkello:  nice , with Stig an Al here I can concentrat on saying stupid thngs and they can tell about bridge|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Doesn't matter. If I know of 10 trumphs, I do it|pg||
nt|stigw: No Ady, 1 superflous trick makes it easy.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oleberg:  But it was to tough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oleberg:  But just change the @CQ ti the @HJ, and the game is excellent|pg||
nt|sommer: an almost certain -800 here, and in that case 5 imps compared to 5@D=|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: sorry    still 12 tricks   only need 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|thorvald: Just making|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: Great grand slam, well bid by Bilde-Graversen|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: odds for an "flat" board?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: any Nusine@c expert among the audience?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Game-forcing relay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is|pg||
nt|dkkello:  this aint Nusine |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: ok - then GFR expert :) .. welcome Kello :)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzcp: 2@s = 5+@H 5+@c|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Lars Blaksets convention|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not easy stuf|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The 2@C gameforce-relay is Lars' own creation|pg||
nt|dkkello:  renember there are screens |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Lars has promised to write explanations to me -- I hope he remember to do it - might take som bidding to get to 7|pg||
nt|dkkello:  M. Schaltz the one who thinks now|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Slightly surprised West didn't ovrcall 1@S. Probably being alone red held him back a little|pg||
nt|dkkello:  oops it was Hagen :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: or a slow operator :)|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|oleberg:  It might take some bidding to get to 7@H. But it will definitely take some playing to get 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't have been distracted by a spectator I guess. Is there one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: 3@s = I have no void|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: only about 700 :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Pretty easy to play if they do not lead a @H|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @H lead and its simple one smaal @C ruuf|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: virtual -- no one in this room :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|Walddk4: It's simple on any lead when clubs are 4-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: and now 5nt from N ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now he would also make it with clubs 5-2 after the double of 2@S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, it will make, but declarer will not claim 13 sure, when dummy hits the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure why he doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and as a kibitzer says: N can count 13 tricks with @S finesse|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He may have double in case North got to be declarer|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  At the other Vugraph table Graversen opened 2@H as a strong Acol2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and @s finesse should be on after DBL from W|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And why would a spade lead be better than a club from his point of view?|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I dont know why he thinks so, but I think that is why he doubled|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  And from there Bilde stormed to 7@H probably expecting more in terms of high cards|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, the double shortened the bidding: now North didn't have to worry about the a third @D/@S loser|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: Yes|pg||
nt|dkkello:  12 tricks claimed i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  E-W using a strong club system ...|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S NS is a decent contract here|pg||
nt|thorvald: A game in @ss for EW, |pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: V had 4@d in the end|pg||
nt|stigw: Nothing dramatic in the first 2 deals it seems.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stigw: With an overtrick possible but...|pg||
nt|sejr:  1C = 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  not what schou is longing for|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Also sure more pairs will be in 5@D. But it is still an oppertunity for NS pairs to excel|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  1NT = 11-14|pg||
nt|oleberg:  4@H on for EW, a diamond will go on the spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@h easy to make, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes , good morning Peter  |pg||
nt|thorvald: 5-6 in the majors, how to bid it ?|pg||
nt|sommer: isn't he wtrong enough to go "direct" via 1@H, 2@S?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..could be a misfit hand, of course|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 3NT is not, whta N wants|pg||
mb|3H!|an|3+ controls|nt|dkkello:  "easy "   4 @H  |pg||
nt|sejr:  1H 8+ hearts or 12+ NT|pg||
nt|stigw: Lousy minimum from Gregers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  20 against 20 here ,but looks like action!  |pg||
nt|oleberg:  If east gets the chance to bid heart volountarily, West will support, and they might get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=FG  a) 5+@H  b) BAL, 13+ HCP |pg||
nt|thorvald: That 2 @H bid looks strange to me, any special conventions ?|pg||
mb|3S!|an|splinter|nt|jesperdall:  so east staymans and then 3NT - what's your lead?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can make 3 NT double-dummy...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  renember N-S dont play together on regular basis and a weak 2 can have many faces|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2NT for minor by N?|pg||
nt|thorvald: You will have to bid @Hs first, |pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Only 15 !!! - tournament director !|pg||
nt|thorvald: The weak NT strikes again|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: a kib suggest double in East|pg||
nt|stigw: Here we see a super-strong 2 MA-opening (or is it super-weak playing strong ?).|pg||
mb|4C!|an|cuebid|nt|dkkello:  N need a good hand to enter the bidding , obviously :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: OK, I will call:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Or not obviously|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  How is to say that the have a minor fit?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  How -> Who|pg||
nt|sejr:  2S = 6 H|pg||
mb|4D!|an|cuebid|nt|thorvald: 7@h is makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Interesting developement, but surely E/W wont end up in 3 nt.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Wow, you agree with 4@H?|pg||
nt|sejr:  and minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: funny   i have one referenced where 1@H is 13+ bal, 1 where 14+ bal  and now sejr=12+|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dkkello:  it took them 2 seconds to bid 4 @H |pg||
nt|sejr:  3D = 6331 the singlton uknown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=any 6(331)|pg||

nt|stigw: With at leat 8 + and a Ma-suit its of course GF opposite a 16 + any.|pg||
nt|stigw: If its only defined as "constructive", I consider it a bit to "Constructive".|pg||
mb|5D|nt|oleberg:  Diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: As cards lie, looks better for east to play 3N, as @D lead from north seems best for NS|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and Konow is know as a very thoughtfull (slow) player|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Partner has 14+hcp and we have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|thorvald: It would have been worse if partner opens 1 @D, then rebids 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  this lead may hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@S on the other hand, quite a bid|pg||
nt|stigw: Boesgaard gort the highest bid of course !|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@D is transfer, by the way ..NS play a "homemade" system called Nusine-klør (=clubs) ..named after Lars' former cat;-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their relay structure looks very similar to Viking Club|pg||
nt|stigw: One might misplay the sp-suit here, if left to one's own device.|pg||

nt|skaftij:  This opening has its merits but sacrificing preempt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  konow did well in the other room, selling out to 4 diamonds |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Let's see if South will reopen|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I bet she will|pg||
nt|dkkello:  me to|pg||
nt|pelu: remember that 1@H = max 15 HCP - so East can pass|pg||
nt|pelu: a jump to 2@S is 12-15 and 6 card suit but S is too dtrong - in my book|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  it is sometimes said, that women players lacks bidding-courage|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Now probably a reopening T/O double by East|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C is "weak" with both MA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  weak nt throughout|pg||
nt|stigw: "Gamma-result" is E/W 5 cl doublet 9 tricks, I guess.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Needs to find @d queen if defense shifts to @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: decided on the safe game    which looks right    |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  E are preemping e-v out of and @S contract|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It is not the case for any of the participants in this tournament|pg||
pc|hA|nt|stigw: Not for a while, but they will come later.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Otherwise, if 3 rounds of @h, exit in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: if 2 x @H and @C then no problem - just 2x@s and @cJ - and EW endplayed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thorvald: Wonder what that bid shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: my guess is cuebid|pg||
nt|thorvald: A @D lead to get 2 tricks vs a @s contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: the problem for south is, that she only holds 3@s, so no she wishes that she bid something else than 2@s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: would need a maximum weak 2   and suitability   like singleton spade|pg||
nt|stigw: Konows supermax (?) wasnt even tired to be detected, and with that lead it was perhaps wrong (but I really dont think so).|pg||
nt|barbyh: which could be beaten but still a good save|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (Not for any of the males either)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  btw. They are playing with screens, helps them when they need to think |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: but then we'll have to look at movie|pg||
nt|stigw: Not easy to reach 4 sp (not to mention the sacrifice in 5 cl in that case).|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dkkello:  N-S started very strong this session|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@D from W would have been "small+" slaminterest with 5-5 MA|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: *now|pg||
nt|thorvald: With a single @d in East all it takes is the right view in spades and clubs to make 6@s|pg||
nt|stigw: Nothing to reproach really here, but 4 H has chances.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now its a maximum 2@s only lacking a spade|pg||
nt|pelu: as I said S too strong for 2@S :)|pg||

pc|sK|nt|oleberg:  Just a bit|pg||
nt|thorvald: trying to secure som @S-tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too dangerous for east to bid again opposite  AT MOST 14 HCP that could not super-accept|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the hands just fit perfectly with @C & @D as they are|pg||
nt|stigw: A perfect fit E/W in the side suits, but with the Di K wrong 10 tricks is no sure thing.|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Either @HK in East or a little help, e.g. @D lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that decent; you need the @HK on the weak hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would easily win all the matchpoints|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe conservative by E just to pass 2 H, but 3 di would probably be GF.|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2@S is defined as a 6-card and a good opening hand, I when available I think I would use that too|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The strength of 2@s ia maybe not clearly defined|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|7-9HCP - 6!H's|nt|nilsland:  6 @S is a good contract except for the spade break'|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  well, well, 6 spades looks good on paper|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S would require simply good breaks in both majors.|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  potential swing in schou's favour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, a) 6+@C b) 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  West would never miss the defence against 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Diffucult to bid however|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  but always hard to bid a slam when the opponents open the bidding|pg||
nt|sommer: 12-14 NT and transfer |pg||
nt|stigw: The bidding was the critical thing here, and maybe pelu is right, even if the jump in 4-th hand should show exactly a hand like South's.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  any control issues in 4 spades?|pg||
nt|othered1: with @S 3-2, defense of 6@S that began with @C, @C, tapping dummy, would then require @H split (or stiff 10) as well.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS play 15-17 NT in 3rd position vulnerable|pg||
nt|stigw: Bad sits make any game very difficult for N/S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if DBL = 4@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 @S  =  minimun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just a maximum opener|pg||
nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I think that 2nt denied 4@hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w likely to get to 4@S    |pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I don't know whether RD is strenght or Hx, but feel certain it virtually denies 3 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Switch the @SQ and the @CJ what would West lead then? I would guess diamonds ;) |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Will North bid 1NT or 2@C ?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Im asked when i 2S its not better to go for the overtrick by finessing in @D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg:  By bidding 1@S it can be seen, that West doesn't evaluate his hand to be woth a game-force, facing their opening style|pg||
nt|sommer: with one of the red aces right, this is an easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: this should be down a couple|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stigw: I would try 3 nt also here, even if I'm not a junior anymore !|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: you would be ok if someone had 2 trumps and 1 heart|pg||
nt|athene: take the force, draw 2xtrumps, then play @HAQ|pg||
nt|thorvald: It looks to me like 5@d was an interesting contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true, Bjarnarson DBL would have been negative  but with double @S stop and 4@H 2N might still make sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Agree|pg||
nt|stigw: Chances are there at lest now, but still very difficult (or impossible double dummy ?).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs lead  2nd/4th  [this includes LOW from xx]|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the same applies with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: may encounter some problems  with diamonds and sspades 4-1|pg||
nt|thorvald: In 4@S its safety first by why not go for that extrac trick ?|pg||
nt|stigw: At least is not vulnerable.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|stigw: Best to start running clubs here I think, and see if anything good happens.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stig - is low from small doubleton the normal lead in Denmark?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Gregers is looking at @h10|pg||
nt|stigw: Looks like 3 undertricks but we'll see.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|skaftij:  This hand poses a classical dilemna, settle for penalty or go for vul game bonus|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|stigw: Wrong to bid 1 sp in my opinion, but with partner limited to at most 15 it makes sence.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  !--lead would have been better - as very often|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  results  http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3809.html|pg||
nt|pelu: and 3NT not easy for NS|pg||
nt|stigw: I think wise to pass with the South hand even at this vulnerability, and as pelu mentioned 3 nt is by no means any "sure thing" here.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oleberg:  Right, still I would prefer to stay out, competent defenders usualy leads right in these situations. But of course it will make a reasonable amount of times|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It seems as West needs to guess @D to make |pg||
pc|dK|nt|thorvald: She needs to time this correct|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stigw: I think it will go down on the bad breaks, but we'll see.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running score is just comparison of the 2 vugraph tables -- in the event scoring is actually cross-imps of all 5 tables|pg||
nt|stigw: Kello answered your question ahollan, but I'm not sure if correctly.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On the lead of @S 5, North might go down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stigw: South could even have hoped for 800 un a good day.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D (Multi) would work better here - normal bid by S over 2@D = 2NT|pg||
nt|pelu: they have only played 2 boards in Open room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barbyh: best lead for defense|pg||
nt|barbyh: cant go down|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Small @S to the Ace and @s back, North must duck to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news for declarer -- 5@C doesn't make either|pg||
nt|stigw: Not clear for South what is the best defence here, but it should be 3 down anyway|pg||

pc|s6|nt|stigw: Trumph now ?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oleberg:  (Underleading @DA on the blind lead, for -3)|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: short break|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It was easy for South to see, that a fourth club was needed, but impossible to communicate this to partner.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Agree, very very hard (impossible?) for North to figure this out|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I feel a little silly for eating 6 Mars-Icecream bars yesterday afternoon|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I assume that is because you *only* ate six?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now I have no Mars-Icecream bars :(|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, I'll have tom learn to buy more boxes|pg||
nt|thorvald: On a trumph lead, South would play @H, then ducking from East wouldnt that leave South with a problem|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c3|mc|5|nt|stigw: Wd E/W - might earn them a swing here.|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: i think the only time we see those leads in north america are in the big knockout tournaments  when eastern european players on vugraph |pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Look like a potential strong club with relays auction|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, 2@D is only weak MA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, unbal [1st/2nd], 4+@D, maybe longer @C|pg||
nt|stigw: Gregers didnt hear my piece of advice, but I think that could have made a difference after the di start.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  very common in Poland (and Denmark :)  )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one benefit of 1@D as unbal with 4+    North can raise here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after  nebulous Precision 1@D -- north hand difficult unless able to show BOTH minors|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|oleberg:   NT looks like a good reult in the other room|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2NT = 4-card @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2@H opener on  2 gains a bunch of imps   in other room 3N North|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oleberg:  3|pg||
nt|stigw: He was able this time I see, but the sp-honours scream of nt, or at least not game in a minor.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C does not show both minors, just a "mixed raise" in @D    [see alert explanation from operator]|pg||
nt|stigw: no Al, the 2 h opener lost to 3 nt which wasnt bid at the other table (and neither 4 sp).|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: wn?|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@d = 4+ - unballed hand|pg||
nt|stigw: No good game here, even if 4 H perhaps is makeable.|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: 3@C looks agressive, but still I would have bid 3NT in east|pg||
nt|sommer: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spades lay well|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS likely to take 11 or 12 tricks depeding on the lead|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@h promises a good hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: win andplay a spade    my come to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Shows the importance of interference|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: But 4@s is a winner?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: S: Sorry - I should have passed 1@h|pg||
pc|c6|nt|thorvald: 44 imps stilll needed for Schou|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Left to their own devices, EW would have a walk in the park on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Stig -- i got that exactly wrong|pg||
nt|stigw: The 2-H-opening in deal 2 were at this table, closed room.|pg||
nt|stigw: But the scoreboard dosent show that, I must admit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA looks good for declarer, but no entry to dummy means still lose 2@C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jesperdall:  interesting lead!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If East wins this trick 3 N will go down|pg||
nt|thorvald: Pressure on declare from the start - if he get it wrong EW will switch to spades|pg||
nt|othered1: is there a case to p lay the ace?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think declarer has too few tricks for that|pg||
nt|thorvald: Ace might be an idea, but only because T of @H drops out|pg||
nt|sommer: as we see, 5@C is without chances..3NT would be far better|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Here West had to guess. he guessed right, but with enough guesses, you'll go wrong from time to time|pg||
nt|pelu: :) - he sh have bid 4 :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: ruff and @DQ intersting ploy?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jesperdall:  I think he plays the queen - if it holds, he retains most chances|pg||
nt|thorvald: In closed room West ducked the @H-finess, so declare switched to clubs|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  same lead?|pg||
nt|stigw: Makes easily with the favourable lay-out, next deal please.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|thorvald: Spade and spade|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: J@H seems best|pg||
nt|stigw: OK to stop here, I will say - it needs a good portion of luck to make 10 tricks, and not vul the bonus is too small.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Needs both @dK and @hQ. OK game if vulnerable|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure u are right Stig, - look at the :)'s|pg||

pc|h5|nt|vugraphzcq: TD has been called...|pg||

nt|ralfwil:  has anyone of you heard about Miami Coup?|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  and a very healthy lead|pg||
nt|thorvald: Yes, it was a nice defence, and declarer went down as he did think the @Hk was onside, and didn't want to rely on @ss being 4-4|pg||
nt|stigw: Ok all - nobody has given in at this table untill now (except ovetrricks)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  As there are 12 tricks this demnostrates why we do not have a "kibitzer-claim" button ;)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was there a psychological play that gave declarer a chance for 1 more trick?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I must be the youngest commentator here|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, the defence forgot to take their cl-tricks.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2:  But declarer had a blind spot. After the !10 appeared he had a safe route to 9 tricks by continuing with a low heart from hand|pg||
nt|sommer: would you have bidden 3@C, Thorvald?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  I agree, easy for us to see spades 4-4|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  @H10|pg||
nt|thorvald: Depends|pg||
nt|sommer: ya..on the day:)|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, I would have ...|pg||
nt|stigw: Bad for N/S here. I dont like that 3 cl-bid with so much in Sp - mabe 1 nt better, even if abnormal.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|thorvald: Looking at all 4 hands it looked stupid, but i think that the real error was not to advance jack of @c|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Double shows 12-16 balanced or 17+|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  4NT making in the other room - not exactly a walk in the park...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcq: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal  15+ bal|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=game force, 5+suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Was it bad for N/S? 4@s was a winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  North, for some reason not quite clear to me, chose to show the 21 hcp as 22-24 hcp|pg||
nt|thorvald: Did he claim before getting the lead at 3rd trcik ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: yes|pg||
nt|thorvald: Strange claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: i think it was an attempt to speed things up - first 6 boards has taken 65 min and only 55 min left for last 8 boards|pg||
nt|stigw: Actually 4-times clubs from start est throwing a diamond might give game a head-eck.|pg||
nt|pelu: we will help u, Skafti - dont be afraid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Not to Flannery|pg||
nt|thorvald: Interesting how to play this|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  He gave up bridge instead (Bergen, that is) preferring teaching to playing|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|henryb:  and write of course|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Not easy to find, but wouldn't a spade lead and continuation sink this?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Nope|pg||
nt|oleberg:  No, no communication|pg||
nt|thorvald: But 4NT was in jeopardy because the 4-0 break in @c|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  so, now two top hearts pitching a diamond, then diamonds?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I wouldn't have done it either, but there is two tens, and a lot of controls|pg||
nt|sommer: the destiny of the contract depends on the @Cguess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Such heights the bidding has reached, I get dizzy|pg||
nt|pelu: standard rule: opp on 1-level: lead trump!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stigw: Diamond lead might make this shaky.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LetÂ´s see @H to the 9 - and KING...!|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks more likely to make    4 hearts likely down on the same diamond lead unless getting spades right|pg||
nt|dkkello:  great pas from E here  ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But the flat shape detracts, and the @D10 might not pull it's full weight |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Well Kjeld the online hand evaluator agrees with Rasmussen|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|thorvald: Drop a @S and play @D - North will think you have no @Ds|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and a brave 2 @H of course|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: Askgaard bids are all Relays - saying nothing, asking for full distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Board 6 might not be bad for N/S after all, because maybe E/W can make 4 sp.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|henryb:  Certainly not KJ. K maybe|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still hard to find a way down|pg||
nt|barbyh: very|pg||
nt|thorvald: As suggested by a kib its better to grab @HA, drop a @H and a @C on the @DAK, but declarer will still need to guess the position, when West playes @HK|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|stigw: OK to stop low here with no sp-stopper.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I'd want to be in 5@d. Defense never plays trumps against me|pg||

nt|dkkello:  run the queen best play|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|stigw: Fritzbøger is right regarding board 6, but how was the vulnerability (and maght others not be tempted to bid 5 sp) ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is best way to combine chances in @H & @C here?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|stigw: Normally you would be expected to bid 4 H on Norts's hand, but the 4-3-3-3 and minimum persuaded him.|pg||

nt|ady: of course west cannot see what we see|pg||

nt|thorvald: He need @SA in south and playing accordingly|pg||
nt|henryb:  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I just wrote on my facebook status that I was up early. (but it was to easy)|pg||

pc|s9|nt|oleberg:  IC|pg||

mb|p|nt|thorvald: Much easier with a 15-17 range 1NT|pg||

nt|dkkello:  Hagen is not a big fan of bridge in the early monrning |pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  staying out of game is good bridge - well bid EW, despite the loss of imps|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A little sof by West not to bid 2@H, after all it's white vs white (Where going down is punished least, and defeating oponents is rewarded least|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: I think LB forgot that it could be a marmic, as EW are showing 8 @hs|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stigw: I dont know if 2 cl as 4 th suit was gameforcing, but Boesgaard has his "stuff" as opposed to his partner.|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Well I think both East and West should have competed in 3@S|pg||

nt|dkkello:  the standing after 2 rounds  http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1214.html|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Silence prevails at this table, time to break it with unwitty commentary. South will declare 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure - but many pairs here open 1NT 11-14 - by system|pg||
nt|thorvald: If @hs 4-1 he must depend on spades 3-3 and here 4-2 is no problem, so just play accordingly|pg||
mb|1D|nt|thorvald: Here we have a gamble from closed room - isn't 4@S wash and go ?|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|oleberg:  1NT 0 gane force relay|pg||
nt|oleberg:  1NT = Game force relay|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Fairly simple 7@S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@D by East would have been a good start|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And 3@C by west a good continuation|pg||
nt|thorvald: More free style in 3rd hand - 2@S is a good preempt|pg||
nt|stigw: Can E/W get to 4 sp ?|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  I would have bid a simple two spades - wouldn't you?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not that easy I think|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2@D was just that if East had a weak @D then that was where to play. 2@H would show a good han and semiforcinig. The Double was to show 18-19|pg||
nt|pelu: a free 1@S or jump to 2@S?, soft values and @D QJ ? I would only bid 1@S - partner has only promised 3+ !§ss |pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  I would bid only 2@s, not 3|pg||

nt|dkkello:  agree with Ole ..but would pas myself :) I am a chicken|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Surely, when South confirms all five aces, North will have an easy 7@S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 @S now|pg||
nt|stigw: Michael will come again, but with what ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Not bidding 3@C is chicken. Not bidding 3@D is normal and sane.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Bjarnasson will be back tomorrow ,they too whant to play for Denmark.. |pg||
nt|stigw: Big swing in boar 4 where 6 H was allowed to make at the other table.|pg||

nt|dkkello:  what  ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bensby2: they could have an agreemnent that 3 spades shows an ace - but need to bid 3 spades|pg||
nt|dkkello:  it wasent easy after all|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  No comment|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: NS super-accepts are interesting   they show location of values where more common [i think] is to show weak/short suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|thorvald: And pushing EW overboard - this looks like one down to me|pg||
nt|stigw: Terrible sits so 1 down at least.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I'd have some more coffee if it did not spoil my sleep|pg||
nt|stigw: He didnt I see, and neither Gregers, that was a fault I think.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Schaltz - Blakset ended in 7@h on board  3 where Graversen made 7@h|pg||
nt|thorvald: West should perhaps have bid 2@c planning to bid @spades or double next time|pg||
nt|stigw: All pushes until now, but sure som swings are going to come.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jesperdall:  in the other room, north passed, east bid 1S, and soth overcalled 3C|pg||
nt|henryb:  Run rate up to 8.57 after this|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  and west bid the final contract of 3 NT|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  and the defense ran the first 6 tricks - deadly defense|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think 2@s did justice to West hand|pg||
nt|stigw: Or East should have given a belated sp-support at last with songleton diamond.|pg||
nt|pelu: why not? a free jump|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@s is the value bid, but tends to be 5 @s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jesperdall:  heart to the king, heart, club king hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a truly vengeful Great Shuffler would have also dealt 2 losing trump tricks|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Tea it will be then for you sir|pg||

nt|sommer: ..and it's so easy for us, seing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure EW know that N has the 6+@d hand|pg||
nt|stigw: Should be a pick-up for N/S.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|henryb:  may make it|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  ok, gotta go - a lot of good bridge today from the players, thx!|pg||
nt|thorvald: In fact North might have discouraged in @S to get the @H shift, could that be wrong ?|pg||
nt|pelu: again @d = 4+ and unball|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  If that double of 2@C threw them overboard, I'll vomit|pg||
nt|bensby2: but interesting if they are able to play the next games on a normal level|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: part score hand      will east west get too high|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I think Hagen is right not to bid 1nt opposite a partner who passed as opener|pg||
nt|sommer: good preempt!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another weak nt|pg||
nt|stigw: Normal result, and I guess no or only small swing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Goulash allright|pg||
nt|thorvald: 5@d looks Ok to me|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D making, but almost impossible to bid|pg||
nt|stigw: 5 diamonds is a lucky make here, but can they reach that high ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|oleberg:  2@H = sound raise in spades|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Normally only 3-cards|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 10 tricks in the minors|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the ostot convention|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But maybe there was some disagreement about about the 2@D-bid|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now why will @dace not be led ....?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|invit|nt|oleberg:  But his partner opened in third hand, and the double indicates hearts will not behave|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural RDBL by passed hand opposite weak nt -- go figure|pg||
nt|stigw: I doubt, unless W goes crazy, and 3 di not enough probably.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|henryb:  Roland, I do not see how to make 4@s. Perhaps I am blind|pg||
nt|oleberg:  damn, I agree :(|pg||
nt|thorvald: She should double to show 3-6-1-3 and 15-17 hcp|pg||
nt|thorvald: But probably afraid that it would show 4-card spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  What ?!? Get into the fight Ole ;)|pg||
nt|sommer: I agree, N might have seen, a @Hshift could be needed|pg||
nt|thorvald: Perhaps Lars Should have played @S9 to show interest in @Hs at the previous board as suggested by Knut (his older brother)|pg||
nt|stigw: I dont like that rdbl as nat, but probably it wont mean anything here.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|henryb:  three top losers, but no way to get to 10 winners|pg||
nt|stigw: Come-back for 2 + 5 in deal 5, when 4 sp was defeated in the other room (well deserved)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Yes defeated on a @s lead|pg||
nt|stigw: Better rdbl this time.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Askgaard DBL was just showing strength|pg||
nt|stigw: The terrible thing now is, that East should be forced to bid after her previous rdbl.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Michael thinking about bidding???|pg||
nt|stigw: Well, now maybe|pg||
nt|thorvald: At Board 4 Lars Blakset Doubled and ended up in 4@s making|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT = max opening and @c-stop - now Askgaard dont like his @h-holding|pg||
nt|stigw: How do you like it partner, and the void in H talks against.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|sommer: 3@D is Rubensohl, transfer to @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe it was Lund-Madsen who was thinking|pg||
nt|stigw: I dont think that Al, but Christina LM.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I am on the wrong side of the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Which by no means guarantie I wouldn't have done it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs to run J@C early|pg||
nt|dkkello:  with strong club you might find a @S contract |pg||
nt|pelu: as I exp the S hand was too strong for 2@S jump|pg||
nt|stigw: He did it, wd - now it only remains to bring it home.|pg||
nt|thorvald: A @c lead and al looks bright, a @H and there are work to do|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: nice scramble by NS |pg||
nt|stigw: She overcome her doubt wisely enough, but doesnt get the role of a hero.|pg||
nt|pelu: but Stig - the 4@D = bad @H-stop - so that improved E's hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This may take  some time|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: time isn't an issue - 60 min left with 5 more boards to go (including this)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No obvious line|pg||
nt|thorvald: A ruffing finess in @cs looks like a plan to me|pg||
nt|stigw: The first swing came in deal 4, where N/S missed 4 sp here, bid bu Lars & Martin in the other room.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oleberg:  (trying, trying)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder how auction goes if East PASS instead of RDBL|pg||
pc|hA|nt|stigw: Just a preferance to Di, but Hagen might have considered to bid 4 sp.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Some complication with 10 tricks here, I think |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Perhaps Bjarnarson will play on @s before ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sommer: that would be a good idea!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|stigw: The swing in board 5 came up, so now we wait for deal 6 to decide which team will go ahead.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|stigw: And the same pair followed by making 3 nt in board 5, very difficult, but only 3 imps compared to the 500 at this table in 2 H doubled.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I told you old man, some would go for vul game bonus|pg||
nt|pelu: remember 2@H -500, 3NT in OR: and a serius mistake in trick 1; lead @cQ and @c10 by East = double stop for decl. In trick 2 Lars: @Sx to 9! and K|pg||
nt|thorvald: @D|pg||
nt|stigw: Momentum until now at E/W's side at this table, but it can quickly change.|pg||
nt|pelu: sorru @d to 9|pg||
nt|skaftij:  It is just the sort of thing the defense does now and then|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|henryb:  it might make DD, but unlikely single|pg||

pc|s5|pg||

nt|pelu: B6 - Schaltz-Blakset in game - again - and +6 IMP|pg||
nt|stigw: Schaltz-Blakset are having a good and lucky stream at the moment, but will it last (nothing that Konow-Hagen could have done it seems until now).|pg||

nt|duschek: Good evening!|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jacob|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Hi Jacob|pg||
nt|oleberg:  What about ruffin' @S8 in hand, the one round of clubs, then two rounds of diamonds ending in dummy, last club, diamond to the ace, and claim|pg||
nt|stigw: I think 4 sp will be down on a di-lead overtaken by South followed by a cl-switch, so wd E/W.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember -- official results are actually cross-imps for all 5 tables, but BBO just knows about the 2 vugraph rooms|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|oleberg:  Come on, 4@C|pg||
nt|thorvald: Needing to strip clubs, play a @s to the king and endplaying west, not the best plan|pg||
nt|thorvald: Men du har nok ret i at efter indmelding på 1-trinnet er det oftere 5 farve, hvorimod indmelding på 2 trinnet fulgt af dobling oftere er 6-3-3-1|pg||
nt|thorvald: Sry, private chat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we know that 1@H is NOT  12-14 5@H bal|pg||
nt|pelu: we have a direct match here - the 2 NS pairs are candidate for the 3. place on national team|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sommer: no, again it's double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: i like 6@D better than 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Well, a diffence of opinions :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: assume west PASS = forcing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  maybe he'll get to 6 and redouble for a gain of 12? :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  this table 5 boards ahead  ..  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Whar about you guys, facing a passed hand, wouldn't you at least give it 3@C?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I would do something as North|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 1/2 @C  |pg||
nt|bensby2: at least 3cl|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now EW has all the room they need, to unearth the bad spade suit. And they will. (I'll bet you a box of Mars-Icecream bars.)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @H  must be a new gadget   ..    (se board 2 )|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  needed run rate is 11, so 12 needed to start the move|pg||
nt|stigw: Al is right about the scoring, so we dont have any complete picture of who has done weel or bad, even if 1 of the teams here at these 2 tables wins comfortabely.|pg||
nt|stigw: How can you know (and say) that pelu ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dkkello:  Mathias  are looking foreward to a Leffe after this session |pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  a good reason to play 2/1|pg||
nt|duschek: A quiet board here - I like having a slow start :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  We are not taking that bet. We know you have no ice cream bars|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  good brain we share|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 3@s to show real support|pg||
nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and that you are a hustler|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, I could never lose, so whats the problem?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hustler? What?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It takes one to know one...|pg||
nt|pelu: only that I have heard - do u have other informations?|pg||
nt|stigw: No, I only wondered and therefore asked, thats all.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bensby2: 3nt is a better contract - this one can be down 1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  splinter in support of hearts|pg||
nt|stigw: This sint as bad as it might look. Only 1 down I guess.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This should drift off by a trick or two|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stigw: Laydown in 5, so lets just go on.|pg||
nt|pelu: ok - Auken-Christiansen not in the run - so only 4 pairs left|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW did well to catch NS|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|skaftij:  Need find @hQ in 2@h to make|pg||
nt|skaftij:  DD, best for East to win 4th @c and lead low @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: N: (commentating on S's writing) you should have been a boy. - S: No, because then we couldn't play Ladies Pairs :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oleberg:  And a slow continuation|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West really has no clue what to lead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|oleberg:  :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Schaltz-Blakset a nwe pair - but working hard with system - Bilde-Graversen dont play next year - to in my opinion a close race|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bensby2: not any more|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: down 2 in the picture|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|stigw: Yes, but if only 1 down doubled in a contract thet might have potential to make, its no big deal Al.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to south, frozen @D suit|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @h was best|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stigw: Might have made 6 without that switch.|pg||
nt|stigw: Might be 2 down yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Can South win 4@s, 2 @h and 1@c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|skaftij:  anything but @d|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|thorvald: Dont know :-)|pg||
nt|pelu: correction: I have just been told that Graversen- Bilde also play next year - sorry :(:(|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|henryb:  when do you want N to bid 4@c. Over 3@s I think 4@c is 6-5 or more in the minors|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|nt|dkkello:  when 2 great players plays together system not that important  I guess ?|pg||
nt|bensby2: important not to play spades to the king first time - but to the 9|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Again Rasmussen showed better judgement than the commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: short break|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  She passed and only careful play by declarer prevented a game swing|pg||

nt|ahollan1: while holding @S10  best was continue 3rd round of 1C|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzcq: Agree. South just told East that:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: We will now have a direct comparison between these two pairs -- both in the run for the Danish Open Team in Dublin in June|pg||
nt|oleberg:  While Konow-Hagen is relatively new to the absolute top, they probably have the most "modern" approach to the game|pg||
mb|1H|nt|skaftij:  Konow-Hagen are reigning champions in Denmark Open teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  EW play a strong club system known as Viking-Club, or Rele-prÃ¦sisjon|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  1NT = Game-force relay|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Taking the @SA would have gained an immidiate trick, but would have cost two later|pg||
nt|oleberg:  As declarer is a little in need of tricks, ducking was indeed correct|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The Danish teams are picked by a committee of selectors and this tournament is one of the factors they take into consideration|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|oleberg:  Also very imaginative, the way Hagen played the diamonds|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|d5|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oleberg:  If South had th @DK, the finesse would be of no use, and if North had it, he could easily have been endplayed|pg||

nt|ahollan1: frozen suit = whichever side leads the suit, takes 1 less trick than if opponent breaks the suit|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry I have to go - see u later|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: east will open |pg||
nt|oleberg:  It will be with 2@C then|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I disagree with the good-judgement. 3@C might easily have gotten EW to 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|henryb:  15.2 imps per board needed|pg||
nt|stigw: Interesting board this one - what is East's opening ?|pg||
nt|ady: as you said  |pg||
nt|oleberg:  And 3!X (which would never happen) is only -300|pg||
nt|sommer: a minor partial is max here..3@D NS, best?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: has to be 2 clubs  playing strong club|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West is opening a bottle of valium :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S  not 12-14, 5@S, bal  [open 2@S]|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thanks Peter, |pg||
mb|2D!|an|10-12HCP, 5!H + 4-card minor|nt|henrik_r:  Agree. I still think passing and giving the opponents a free run is loosing in the long run|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It is always said, that you should preempt less against bad opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|skaftij:  Easy 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  But we both know careless declarers who would start with a @S to the king and go down in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But somehow people are less inclined to accept the corrollary: You should preempt more against good opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: different aproach in the 2 rooms - and very different contracts :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Laydown in 6 even with both mi-K's wrong, but we'll see.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC mentions  "Bekkasin"   is that the 2N response structure??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Yes, 3nt is 1@h and values|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: And from now anything can happen.|pg||
nt|duschek: South doubles to get all three suits into the picture - better than 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: could be a swing here   3NT looks difficult|pg||
nt|dkkello:  4 @H not down yet   |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  When playing at toplevel they all think they are better than the opponents ;)|pg||
nt|thorvald: You should not open 2@h with 5-card @s - EW getting as deserved in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|skaftij:  Same bidding as in other room, same meaning of 1NT and 2@d|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1NT = GF|pg||
nt|stigw: 9 and 10 are hopeful for N/S here, the rest doesnt leave much room for them.|pg||
nt|stigw: Wth wrong gesses all around W might go down after this lead.|pg||
nt|stigw: But he really shouldnt go down, starting by playing sp, and later on finessing the H K.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: now might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: @d9 is missing:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sommer: 2@H is very close, but with 4c in W it may go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Schaltz has left the table...|pg||
nt|thorvald: A much more friendly lead at the other table|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Apparently N-S in this room play something resembling ACOL, so after 1@s-2@d-2@h north had no forcing bid in spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wow|pg||
nt|bensby2: interesting lead|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3nt seems unbeatable|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well a preempt might have made declarer more prone to play a spade to the king (But that is circumstansial, in my opinion)|pg||
nt|bensby2: but nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: S: What is 3@D? -- W: A bid...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will take some time but making in the end |pg||
nt|oleberg:  I can't see lead?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow is declarer so this will take quite some time|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No lead yet...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Ok thx, just Bensby rambling...|pg||
nt|sommer: I think Martin has to finesse @H8 to make, or?|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@C = Nat or 15-19 NT, 1@S = 0-5 or 6+ with @Ds, 1NT=15-15, 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2 @H-loosers and one in each other suit, seems ok to me|pg||
nt|skaftij:  It does place declarer at disadvantage. He'd like to play on @s before minors attacked|pg||
pc|h9|nt|henryb:  12 unless he goes 4 down|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I bet my money on the defense|pg||
nt|smoller:  the 9th trick|pg||
nt|stigw: Lokks difficult to make with right defence, but ...?|pg||
nt|duschek: 9 tricks now - 2 spades, 1 heart, 2 clubs, 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I bet against Kello|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead   better|pg||
nt|duschek: Very difficult lead though - dummy will likely hold the major suits, and declarer has announced club stoppers|pg||
nt|stigw: Now it looks better.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  always always lead a @H  they thought us last summer |pg||
nt|stigw: I thought it was in the South hand.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  k @C after all , this is rama|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  South does not have an easy hand to lead from|pg||
nt|dkkello:  very nice , but ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Who has a nice butt?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The lead is not that far-fetched or rama-influenced|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Just helps speed things up :)|pg||

nt|oleberg:  @@Bensby: How was I to know you knew?|pg||
nt|stigw: Sp and sp again might give problems, but ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a play after @S @S?|pg||

nt|vugraphzbg: i don't know why, and now they just left the playing area.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  add Stig Werdelin and Peter Schaltz|pg||

nt|ady: likely 10@D lead|pg||
nt|duschek: Incidentally, N/S play 1NT=15-18|pg||
nt|smoller:  This will complicate getting North as declarer|pg||
nt|ady: now maybe heart lead|pg||
nt|stigw: No swings in the boards lately, so it might end right here, or...........?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  If I double first and the opps preempt in @S then I am screwed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=a) 5+@H, 10-15 HCP  b) 4441@D, 12-15 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  16 imps x4  or so  ..  gee|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Me too. I expect opponents to bid a number of spades, and I feel comfortable doubling even 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = at least 55  and good hand in context of 10-15 hcp|pg||
nt|stigw: With this high standard it would amze me if they dont reach 6 cl, but sometimes your system might get in the way.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South thought NE took long time when East bid 3NT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would have liked to defend 3NT I suppose|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 nt N/S could be a chancy suggestion, and maybe work as a sacrifice here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: There was a break in tempo before the sleigh came back with the 3NT bid, and the question was if W was allowed to bid 4@d|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2NT must be for minors now, with longer @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|stigw: Come on Graver !!!|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Man or mouse|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ady: 4 hearts  re transfer|pg||

nt|stigw: If 4 cl is forcing with slam interest here, it would be perfect, but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Konow-Hagen got to 6@C after  1@H-1N//3@H   now that is impressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 3@h in that seq is 6@h and 5@c|pg||
mb|3D|nt|stigw: Or rat ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Allthough a little timed I think Hagens 2@S is OK with flat distribution and two queens|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Maybe it is actually 6@D that is the right spot|pg||
nt|stigw: Still, after perhaps 3 H follwed by 4 Cl from South the way should be clear.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well if 3@H = specifically 6@H 5@C   that's just cheating [heavy sarcasm] :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Bu 4 H ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perfect if  6511|pg||
nt|stigw: Can South be sure of a di-control I wonder ?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Will Michael bid 3@s?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|duschek: Most players agree that 2@S by North would confirm 3-card support. I like to play that it shows a minimum too, redoubling with 3-card support and a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy -- if only we knew the inferences available to Bjarnarson|pg||
nt|skaftij:  or fox|pg||
nt|stigw: Only 9 & 10, and perhaps this one, can save N/S at this table I guess.|pg||
nt|thorvald: And on board 9 EW bid the marginal game|pg||
nt|stigw: So 9 probably + for N/S.|pg||
nt|thorvald: and made it :-)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|skaftij:  He will put up the Q|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, very well done by Konow-Hagen in the open room on 9, lets see about 10 then.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: still led 10@D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Denamrk has a close call between 3 or 4 pairs , who should represent Denmark  ,if also Mathias Bruun and Knut Blakset would play it wolud be even closer  ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Most troublesome vs 5@D is the natural spade-lead, but I play a low heart from dummy|pg||
nt|oleberg:  vs 6@D i meant|pg||
nt|bensby2: the are all winning 6cl, 6dia and 6H|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  A little timed by South only to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|oleberg:  As a kibz have pointed out, 6@H is in trouble|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Only one communication in North, and you need to get there twice|pg||
nt|stigw: He felt sure I can see, wd boys.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|skaftij:  Nope|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|thorvald: NS will loose an imp here 9 or 10 tricks are equal|pg||
nt|stigw: This could go down now after the wrong H guess. No, good duck actually once you did it wrong in the first place.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|stigw: One of dummys cl will go away on the sp.|pg||
nt|thorvald: he needs a spade-trick to ditch a @c so if east have @HK he probably dont have AK of @Ss|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Right|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|stigw: Right Thorval, but he couldnt be sure of the H K. Had he taken the first H with the ace he would probably have been down.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|stigw: No swing  here either I guess - yes, an imp.|pg||
nt|duschek: Makes no difference on the lie of the cards, though - always 11 tricks unless declarer finesses spades|pg||
nt|ady: knowing of likely shortage of hearts in south hand   tried for different defense|pg||
nt|bensby2: you can just duck a diamond and throw to clubs on the diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stigw: One way or another it would have been an imp.|pg||
nt|duschek: Ah, now it does make a difference. West hoped for a singleton diamond when partner did not respect the lead-directing double|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sommer: as the cards lie, there's no big difference between 1NT and 2@S..guess, NS had a chance to score 1 imp|pg||

mb|r!|nt|oleberg:  The South shape (and distribution) is a classic "off-shape" 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|oleberg:  (A 5-4-2-2 hand with four heart, five of a minor, and a lot of hcp in the doubletons)|pg||
mb|d|nt|oleberg:  Rdbl is obviously part of an escape-complex|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West's second double is take-out|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: RDBL forces a 2@c bid in S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But the rest of EW doubles will be penalty|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (It is a popular treatment, to play: 1. Double = points, 2. Double = Take-out, subsequent foubles = Penalty)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: I cant see who is thinking on the other side of the screen - but I "guess" is that it is E|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  In my experience when playing weak NT any escape  system should include the ability to play in 1nt dbl as this is often the cheapest place when responder has 4-7 hcp|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I agree with Henrik on that one, but who's to say they dont play it|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And that North simply choosed not to|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I was speaking more in general terms than referring to the current board|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  I would never sit 1nt with the north hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You only said it because Mats Nilsland isn't here yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With his defence you can't play 1NT doubled|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oleberg:  This deal illustrates why it is fine not to establish a force, simply because you double a weak NT|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  As far as I remember he does not like his own creation anymore|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Quite lucky here, not to get to the 4-4 fit in hearts|pg||
nt|oleberg:  although 4@S is very likely to go down, it has an offbeat chance, while 4@H is certainly doomed|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But a club lead will kill anything|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oleberg:  (I think)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no 10th trick in 4@S. Five spades, two hearts, one in each minor|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If declarer Guesses to duck the second diamond, that will gain a trick, but there is communication problems|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Well you could create two tricks in @D, but when doing that you setup a @H ruff for the defense|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Anyway, not being able to see all 52 cards, declarer naturally goes for aolving spades and hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But covering that jack was a mistake!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what difference did that make? Hagen was going to run it anyway|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Holding AJ of diamonds, and declarer a large favouite to hold th @DQ, it should be easyto duck|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It doesnt make any difference double-dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oleberg:  but if you duck, declarer will surely continue spades, deprieving himself of an entry|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so now 2 down instead of 1, no big deal|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: tyhe second heart trick vanished|pg||

nt|stigw: This one doesnt look good for N/S here, but maybe a push after all (game is not a "wild stab", but will go down).|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 3@c = "mixed raise" - 4@c = competitive|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dkkello:  hopefully more acton then  :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  action|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I prefer not bidding pass (ever) on a 6-diamonds-4-spades hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|stigw: With a double from Askgaard now, its difficult for Gregers Bjarnason to stay low (or pass).|pg||

nt|dkkello:  I was told  .|pg||
mb|4S|nt|duschek: E/W play 1NT=14-16 in 3rd/4th seat, so 1@D could be 11-13 balanced|pg||

nt|thorvald: At Board 7 NS stole the contract, but mercifully undoubled and only loosing 7imps|pg||
nt|stigw: Board 10 was a gain for N/S here, as Hagen-Konow took 200 against 4 H (instead of bidding and maybe/maybe not winning 5 di).|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: North gave preference  knowing hearts could be 3 card suit   south having bid clubs earlier|pg||
