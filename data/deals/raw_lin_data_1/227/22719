nt|pjs_ch:  other table reached 3N on this hand (NS) and made 9 tricks|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  10 looks more normal|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  there are three top losers and the @C finesse is onside|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  so an overtrick looks reasonable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but 1 IMP unlikely to be significant in a 32 board match|pg||

mb|1S|nt|pjs_ch:  although in the 6-10 range, the West hand is clearly too strong for a weak two bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  awkward for South here, expectign partner to bid hearts over a double. She will be surprised and happy|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  1NT looks clear for North - slight pause was probably East thinking whether to bid 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  with a second stopper in spades (the ten) declarer should be safe here and have time|pg||

pc|s8|nt|pjs_ch:  indeed it is, North's spade values being useful in either NT or suit context|pg||
