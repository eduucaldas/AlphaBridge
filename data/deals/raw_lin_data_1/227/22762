nt|super nova: I think they are playing forcing pass ?|pg||

nt|beauch:  1h shows 9/12 points and 2s clearly non forcing|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|super nova: Well If the 1H denied a 4 card major,.. then 2s as an intended place to play doesnt make sense,.. so it seems there has been an error in the bidding.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|beauch:  specs ask why not natural auction to 4S- my view is that one should be allowed to play any system one likes without restrictions in long team match|pg||
