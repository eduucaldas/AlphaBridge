nt|vugraphzbz: dummy is the correct to say....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with the other 2 suits patsy Meehan would double 1@H|pg||
nt|greerm: should be penalty but not sure if strong enough for either penalty or takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 4@H now for NS after a 2NT opening?|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Notice that Greenwood rebids NT with a singleton,  do you like that?|pg||
nt|dburn: several flaws for a weak two bid, but being in third seat cancels most of them|pg||
nt|greerm: multi 2@D|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|greerm: Di decides whether to "show" @H or not|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|jferg: will ciara break?|pg||

nt|greerm: S choices? 3NT 4@H or 4@C cue|pg||
mb|4D!|an|retransfer|nt|rodvenn: probably xyz|pg||
nt|dburn: aggressive sort of lead - unlikely to be any real need to attack like that, but maybe unlucky to find it blowing a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: still a possibility of slam as far as South is concerned, |pg||
nt|jferg: hope this is a retransfer|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@D worries me hope they both know it is retransfer and not a cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: wont help Di already bid @hs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzbz: xyz yes.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@d forcing to game artificial|pg||
nt|snorre: A passed 2@d GF in closed room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: Maybe xyz zzzz!?!?!?!? at the other table too?|pg||
nt|greerm: this should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: @C finesse or, more likely A, K and another both lead to home|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: strange to retransfer to your own suit|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@H clearer for me, Ciara probably taking insurance with the 4@H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jferg: maybe 4 hearts shows a better hand with no immediate b1st round control|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: Greenwood will be afraid the @C finesse will fail and they run lots of @H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: is there a case for cashing A & K?|pg||
nt|greerm: the @H run less dangerous with 2 discards, so I think finesse next|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jferg: claim time|pg||
nt|greerm: with the friendly @S position, 11 tricks quickly|pg||

nt|snorre: One of our best female pairs play NS in closed room, Ingunn Uran - Siv Thoresen. A new combination|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: leading Butlerranking, so 2@d was an unnormal accident. http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0124/olrudlag-1214578687.htm|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: 15 facing 10 almost always gets to 3NT nowadays, with 4@h an alternative|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dburn: 4@h more awkward, though - could lose two spades, a trump and a diamond|pg||

mb|3H|nt|snorre: Did really Fyrun pass 5@c??!!!|pg||

mb|3H|nt|greerm: maybe a tad agressive this time :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzww: just a tad?|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbz: natural, or a weak sp.support.|pg||

nt|dburn: could be right - would be right on this deal - but not all that attractive into a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah  might make now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|greerm: some play the double of 2@H here showing a good hand with @H, others play it as a lead request|pg||
nt|greerm: i think it makes becasue defence can only get 2@D and 1@H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: North just trying to defend passively|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|yo_yo: if that is current, Scotland in the lead|pg||
nt|greerm: those are after 3 rounds and yes a strogn Scotland team leading|pg||
nt|jferg: looks as if they will play in 3nt where declarer has 5 club tricks 2 dias and 2 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|greerm: will take some handling as they say :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if north south draw the spades  a club finesse may be needed to make 4 spades|pg||
nt|greerm: declares|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jferg: sorry 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this might be a phantom|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: declarers problem is which suit to play|pg||
nt|greerm: no entry to dummy if set up the @S |pg||
nt|greerm: unlless they run|pg||
nt|greerm: Di counting her tricks, where is the 8th? 9th?|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what trumps are on this auction - hope the players know|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but Cook might have done better to bid 3@d rather than 3@s|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|greerm: the winning finesse doesn't really help much|pg||
nt|dburn: since now Duckworth thought 4@d was a cuebid for clubs, while Cook thought 4@d set diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphzww: i cant fix it from here|pg||
nt|greerm: now we reach the last 2 hands already played in Open room|pg||
nt|greerm: slam on on the @S finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|greerm: but no hope of bidding it? |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|yorkbeach:  2NT = red suits|pg||
nt|ady: cant see more than 4 obvious losers in 3@C   but it went down 1 in other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|20-23|nt|greerm: put your mouse over the contract in other room to see if the bidding was the same ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C alerted , what is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: North may balance now, and buy the contract lower than at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: or of course she may not|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|eamongall: looks on for losing at both tables now |pg||
nt|dburn: which will result in the loss of a handful of IMPs, as it probably deserved to do|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 2 times 140 .. thats about 7 imps |pg||
nt|greerm: more puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  East intended to raise 3@h to 4@h, which is why she is thinking of a slam|pg||
nt|greerm: 2NT anyone? a weak raise to 3S?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|greerm: no, trqansfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  going to expensive|pg||
nt|ady: very chance overcall  even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: Meehan tried to led out of turn!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  5@c = 0 or 3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what is going on?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the doubling will start in a minute|pg||
nt|greerm: i'm told it is a 3 card limit raise|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ady: trump lead would have been better    might get home now|pg||
nt|eamongall: bet she was attempting to get a @C on the table |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: as pointed out   by kib  this switch also good enough as long as south ducks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure why you would unblock the @d9 - if you're Scottish you would lead low to the nine if you wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Game forcing or 22+ bal   Punch has upgraded|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yorkbeach:  East seems to have forgetton that she is facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  these things happen when the players are tired|pg||
pc|d5|nt|greerm: now must draw trumps else 2@D ruffs coming up|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jferg: any luck in the national greer|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|greerm: when i was your age Kathleen, 3 aces and 2 kings represented a game force :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: stop going on about my age!|pg||
nt|greerm: i heard 2 horses put down|pg||
nt|jferg: saw 1 in trouble but my wagers are still running|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: thats never good :(|pg||
nt|greerm: anyone lese remember the old honour trick mehtod of hand evaluation |pg||
nt|jferg: must be nearly home in ireland by now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|ady: well defended  part score going down in both rooms  so 4 imps for northern Ireland|pg||
pc|h5|nt|greerm: looking good for declarer but the @S 9 is growing|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|d3|pg||
mc|12|nt|dburn: still, declarer can now run the eight - not in the Dictionary of Suit Combinations, but a play with a certain charm nonetheless|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Some would not overcall with that hand especially after partner has passed|pg||
nt|iain sime: 2Nt is an enquiry.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  on to the next board|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  about 7 minutes left for the round|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: not a word was said :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the mark of players with a professional attitude|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set     thx all   thx kibs|pg||
nt|ady: thx Sandie|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: last board|pg||
nt|greerm: 90 to 73, a proper Irish score :)|pg||
nt|greerm: 5@C a good score for NI|pg||
nt|dburn: North would probably not have defended like that with @dKQ2, but one never knows|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|dburn: 1@c any 0-7 or strong, 1@h takeout of hearts, or perhaps...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzww: :)|pg||
nt|greerm: last hand here, low or zero? error level, wd both pairs|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  very heavy overcall in reopening seat|pg||
nt|ady: some sort of mixed raise in hearts|pg||
nt|jferg: i see we got 2 imps for 4s +2 unfortunate club lead helped declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: all look quite happy|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  as Al Roth might have said 'if I can just get past this round'|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@s OK as a contract until the spade break comes to light|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn: but it might be doubled here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: best to win with K@S and play a heart|pg||
pc|c3|nt|greerm: in the other room Norma Irwin showed max weak hand with 5@S and 4@C, enough for her partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: we'll take them all against this strong Scotland team :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  oops|pg||
nt|ady: now will need to cross with a diamond|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: now should go down|pg||
nt|ady: first heart needed to be played from west hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can ruff 2@d in dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: contract on again   |pg||
nt|dburn: though I suppose it might make despite everything - declarer can pitch clubs on diamonds (and East cannot attack clubs)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly OK now - ruff a heart and concede a spade, with everything under control|pg||
pc|dT|nt|greerm: ok specs, a vey difficult defence missed on the 3NT but really good play overall, remembering we can see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|pc|s4|nt|ady: North needed to cashj A@C and another   then   but in fact south might have been end played  if then declarer cashed the 2nd club   cashes a spade and esits to south with the 3rd ...|pg||
nt|ady: heart|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|greerm: I think short of tricks now, even with the @S finesse|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|dburn: maybe East needed to shift to clubs after the @hA - tough defence to find|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok so with board 30 to come from open room its 57 all |pg||
