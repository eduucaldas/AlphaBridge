mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: Long think by Moore over 1NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  McGowan's two spades, and South's restraint, may remove any slam interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  slam does make, but at 50% it is a case of take it or leave it from a probability perspective|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Liz is made of sterner stuff and asks Punch to bid slam with a spade control|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|paulg:  Weak NT for Scotland and McGowan has no interest in game if partner cannot break the transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Tough lead for Kelly and this will probably concede a couple of overtricks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator can correct the result for board 3 .. (chat to me if you need help doing that)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  this will work well here, but the five-level may not have been safe if Punch held @sKx for example|pg||
nt|paulg:  however the odds are that she has values in hearts and clubs, which makes it a lot safer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|paulg:  nice intermediates in spades|pg||

nt|paulg:  As a commentator I have to be even more circumspect than normal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  7 imps to Ireland on board 19 where the 2@h overcall was passed, so I make the score 46-27 to Scotland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  not only was Sam Punch on my Vanderbilt team this year and most of my Spingold teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  her boyfriend is in the audience|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I was telly Betty Kelly's son how to access BBO on Twitter earlier today|pg||
nt|paulg:  A very good slam this time, but not an easy hand to bid opposite a weak 1NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  A perfect fit, when there are weak notrumps where you could not make game|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  2NT will be a transfer to diamond and I guess 3@d denies support|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  sorry, it is Jean Kelly here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North-South play four-card majors with a strong 1NT, hence the 1@h opener|pg||

pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d7|nt|paulg:  so probably down two but this aggressive bidding is typical of all the Irish teams in the Home Internationals|pg||
nt|paulg:  For those who have never operated a BBO vugraph, it is not the easiest job in the world especially in the Camrose|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  Even though they are playing with screens they play very quickly and often fail to show the operator their cards|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  Time for a slam, although never easy to bid hands like McGowan's|pg||
nt|paulg:  An aggressive double by Punch|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|paulg:  Punch's 3@d is natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I expect 4@d is keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|paulg:  if her partner had any useful values, then you'd expect her to be balancing with spade shortage|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it seems that McGowan agrees, she must expect Punch to hold a penalty double|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Moore apologies for not doubling1|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|paulg:  4@s shows 0 key cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  so McGowan may bid 4NT to ask for the @dQ|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  or may just bid 6@d as she expects Punch to hold three diamonds on this auction|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg:  well bid, but I expect it will be bid by the Irish too|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this layout you can make all the tricks, but unlikely to bid it missing one of the key cards|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||

nt|paulg:  or perhaps another trump|pg||

nt|greerm: a 20 20 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  you would not normally raise to 3@s with the South hand, but the Michaels bid suggests that partner will have more than four|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|paulg:  perhaps North would be better served bidding 4@c, but she does have a lot of wasted values in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: we have an interesting board here. EW have some spades, but is it enough for agame try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  We are still not linked correctly but we do have another slam hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's 4@s bid, with first round controls in three suits and six trumps does look conservative|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H = @H and a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and, indeed, this might encourage partner to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|greerm: a difficult opening lead, honours in every suit|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|petka: obviously not possible for EW to locate their 5-3 fit, and W will be looking at that heart void|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|paulg:  Punch will be feeling pretty bad at the moment ... conceding -770 and giving away a slam on consecutive boards|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  but she will feel a little better now that the Irish have missed a biddable slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  and more so when she scores up and find out that her team mates bid and made the slam on 23 too|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe the running score is 72-38 to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ah, the tables are linked but our operator has to re-enter all the scores|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|petka: south certainly has the hand N is hoping for. This should be quick once N gets in|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|petka: W would do well to signal negatively now for a diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this looks a fairly routine 3NT, especially with the diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|greerm: i think 4@S here at all 6 tables|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|paulg:  our operator has corrected board 3 to four spades making|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will probably lead the @hQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  Punch is a very aggressive bidder, so McGowan starts slowly ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but the 2@h bid is natural but confirms a sound overcall so she bids game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  the normal lead but a welcome sight for Punch|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is still the problem of the heart losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  assuming trumps are 3-2, even if you draw trumps and pitch your club loser you still need a heart trick|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|paulg:  and you will run out of trumps |pg||
nt|petka: playing standard, the W hand actually must signal negatively, since the T would make it impossble to take 3 clubs if E holds AJx|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  the heart lead would worry declarer a little more, but in practice the defence is helpless|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||

pc|s7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  this looks like 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  as it happens, North would have been in difficulty on two more rounds of diamonds|pg||

nt|petka: this might be interesting if it starts 1C-1D-1S|pg||
mb|1C|nt|paulg:  Cotter may open 1NT on the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but whatever I expect that they'll reach 3NT pretty quickly|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petka: now E will have a real problem if N jumps in diamonds|pg||
nt|petka: a shot at 3N? some sort of strength double hoping to find 5+spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  i would upgrade the North hand and bid 2@H, assuming it was forcing for one round, due to the club fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  now has South shown a weak 1NT with spades, or a strong 1NT with failings?|pg||
nt|paulg:  North might well pass this|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|petka: Interesting. Does E know the spades are 5+? Mike Lawrence says no, but some pairs use a double of 1D to show one or two 4card majors instead of promising both majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Moore leads out of turn - good job screen is still down!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  a couple of people have asked if North-South are playing 2/1|pg||
nt|paulg:  another making slam|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  The answer is yes, but that does not really apply in competitive auctions|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|greerm: 1NT not the best spot |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some would rebid 2@H  looking at a small doubleton @D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg:  most play that 2@h, over the 1@s overcall, is forcing just for one round|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|petka: removing dummies last trump and playing D looks good for us, but what if W has the CQ? That is what south is thinking now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: not sure that is any better|pg||
nt|greerm: would have been a lot better|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg:  it's always easy to criticise an auction that does not deliver the best result, not always so clear what is the best action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, they can't run 5@D tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petka: W would like some sort of squeeze against N, but the entries are lacking if dummy is thrown in|pg||
nt|greerm: 6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  Bidding fourth suit and then jumping to game should be a mild slam try|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  Cotter would not have expected the 1@s overcall, holding just one heart, but you can see that these 4441 hands can be tricky which is why a 1NT opener was an option|pg||
nt|greerm: and then signal a @H for 9 tricks, 3 down i fear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6 card suit?   i didnt see|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@H now|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  but I also expect that they are very nervous|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|petka: for a bridge player it is like paying the bus fare with a diamond ring|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  Wiseman and McQuaker have done well to bid the game in the other room, on a combined 22 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: it might be the right thing to do in some special situation, but you never really consider the possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  interestingly they reached game after passing the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  whereas the table that opened played in a part-score|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh seems to have a simple 1NT bid, much to West's relief, but perhaps they play double as denying four spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh being a short name for South, perhaps not the best one|pg||
nt|greerm: a practical 4@H bid with a bit f play for us |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  surprising how often that seems to happen|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|petka: this is a guessing situation for inexperienced players, but for experts 3S is normally forcing here|pg||
nt|greerm: Grand National just had a false start|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore thinking|pg||
nt|petka: the spade and diamond aces are right, so this looks promising for S. The trick is not to set up a 5th loser before establishing the 9th winner. (2 aces and 2 clubs are already ...|pg||
nt|petka: losers after the lead if W holds the CT). Therefore hearts are not good to play on.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  in this case, the opening bid meant that the club fit never came to light|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Lane asking questions on the auction - screen is now down|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|paulg:  lead of the @d2, lowest from xxx in partner's suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  for those who play MUD, it is not a bad leading agreement but just never play it in partner's suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happy in fact|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|paulg:  2NT shows the red suits, pretty much any strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch will bid probably bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H constructive|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  most play double shows points with the ability to penalise at least one suit|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  three rounds of diamonds preserving the king of spades as an entry|pg||

pc|hT|nt|paulg:  this looks a little tricky|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
