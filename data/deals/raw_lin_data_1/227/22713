pc|d3|nt|paulg:  East-West are Sam Punch and Liz McGowan from Scotland, they play a weak 1NT and four-card majors: system card at http://goo.gl/E0YPQ (PDF)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North-South are Antoinette McGee & Mamie MacCormac from Ireland, they also play a weak 1NT but with 5-card majors: system card at http://goo.gl/pnp5d (PDF)|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is a quiet 3NT where the only question is the number of overtricks|pg||

mb|1N|nt|paulg:  it looks like Punch and McGowan have swapped seats, a little unusual as most players have a preference especially when playing with screens|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  or perhaps they haven't :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  East-West showed some good understanding here|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|paulg:  many might think that 3@s is invitational and McGowan would have a quick accept|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  there is a trump promotion available on best defence, but Punch has given it too them directly and will now go down one|pg||
pc|sA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d7|nt|paulg:  but the club return has allowed her to pitch both diamond losers so the contract will make|pg||
mc|10|nt|paulg:  a little careless by both sides|pg||

qx|c19|st||md|1SQJ983HADKT5CK762,SAKT75HK4D874C853,S6HT52DQ963CAQT94,S42HQJ98763DAJ2CJ|sv|e|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  it might prove difficult for EW to avoid 4@h here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  South has a normal takeout double of 2@h, but may not be sure of their agreements here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will want to bid but her hand is not as good as it looks|pg||

nt|paulg:  Hi everyone, I think we've missed a pass here and NS are playing 4@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator will be able to correct this shortly|pg||
nt|paulg:  unfortunately it seems that the two tables in this match are not "linked" at the moment, so we are not getting comparisons|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|paulg:  Unfortunately this will require a lot of undos and we'll probably lose the play of the hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  but board 17 is a flat board and Scotland gain 2 imps on board 18|pg||

mb|1C|nt|paulg:  meanwhile, Patsy Meehan found a great lead to get the second undertrick for that contract|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|paulg:  Betty Cotter & Jean Kelly are North-South for Ireland - their system card is http://goo.gl/5BP8y (PDF)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  McGowan's two spades, and South's restraint, may remove any slam interest|pg||
mb|5H|nt|paulg:  slam does make, but at 50% it is a case of take it or leave it from a probability perspective|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Liz is made of sterner stuff and asks Punch to bid slam with a spade control|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Weak NT for Scotland and McGowan has no interest in game if partner cannot break the transfer|pg||
mb|6H|nt|paulg:  Tough lead for Kelly and this will probably concede a couple of overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator can correct the result for board 3 .. (chat to me if you need help doing that)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  this will work well here, but the five-level may not have been safe if Punch held @sKx for example|pg||
nt|paulg:  however the odds are that she has values in hearts and clubs, which makes it a lot safer|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice intermediates in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  Cotter does best to try and force dummy, but Punch's @c10 protects her|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|paulg:  good try by O'Neill, but unfortunately McGowan had no choice but to finesse in clubs|pg||

nt|paulg:  As a commentator I have to be even more circumspect than normal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  7 imps to Ireland on board 19 where the 2@h overcall was passed, so I make the score 46-27 to Scotland|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  not only was Sam Punch on my Vanderbilt team this year and most of my Spingold teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  her boyfriend is in the audience|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I was telly Betty Kelly's son how to access BBO on Twitter earlier today|pg||
nt|paulg:  A very good slam this time, but not an easy hand to bid opposite a weak 1NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  A perfect fit, when there are weak notrumps where you could not make game|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|paulg:  2NT will be a transfer to diamond and I guess 3@d denies support|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||
mb|5D|nt|paulg:  sorry, it is Jean Kelly here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North-South play four-card majors with a strong 1NT, hence the 1@h opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think this is a practical approach|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|paulg:  13 imps to Scotland on board 20 when Ireland did not bid the slam|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|d3|mc|12|nt|paulg:  Kelly can pick up the trumps now, but has a spade and two diamonds to lose|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Information on the Lady Milne is available at http://ladymilne.welshbridgeunion.info/|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  This is the first match of five over the weekend for these teams|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|paulg:  England, Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland are joined by a second team from the hosts, which this year is Wales and is called the WBU team|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  Time for a slam, although never easy to bid hands like McGowan's|pg||
nt|paulg:  An aggressive double by Punch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch's 3@d is natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I expect 4@d is keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|paulg:  if her partner had any useful values, then you'd expect her to be balancing with spade shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and it seems that McGowan agrees, she must expect Punch to hold a penalty double|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|paulg:  4@s shows 0 key cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  so McGowan may bid 4NT to ask for the @dQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  or may just bid 6@d as she expects Punch to hold three diamonds on this auction|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  well bid, but I expect it will be bid by the Irish too|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this layout you can make all the tricks, but unlikely to bid it missing one of the key cards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  if you recall board 19, Punch held AK109x in spades over the opening bidder|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|paulg:  and the general consensus is that double should be penalties here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|paulg:  EW play a convention called Kokish, so the auction will start 2@c-2@d-2@h-2@s-2NT to show 24-25 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  in the meantime, another 13 imps for Scotland as Symons/Adamson had a fine auction to 6@d on board 21|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  another bidding challenge hand, a lot of slams already in this set|pg||
mb|4N|nt|paulg:  and I expect they will finish in 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  then West will transfer to spades and bid 3NT, offering a choice of games|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  the main decision for North is whether to play in hearts or spades|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  unfortunately the Kokish sequence fails in a sense, as the weak hand will play the contract|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|paulg:  slightly tricky, but you'd like to ruff a spade and then draw trumps|pg||
nt|paulg:  and concede a spade|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  luckily that works here|pg||
nt|paulg:  11 imps for Ireland on 22 as they managed not to double 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulg:  I make the running score 72-38 to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  a trump looks the obvious play and it will leave declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Punch may be worried that declarer has another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps another trump|pg||
nt|paulg:  but she did get a correct count signal in clubs, so she knows declarer should be void in diamonds now|pg||
nt|paulg:  but these things are often less clear at the table in the heat of battle|pg||
