nt|rednaxela:  Clubs are obviously a weakness for N/S, but to lead one from AQJ doesn't look attractive.|pg||
nt|rednaxela:  J@s is quite likely.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|georgia19: 1NT?  E to the rescue|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: if you never take any overtricks, even in teams, you lose in the long run|pg||
nt|rednaxela:  Ideally, a doubling hand would be playable in three suits.  This one is playable in all four, and NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil352:  in fact many players concentrate on their slam auctions to find close slams, but being solid in the partscores will earn more over time|pg||
