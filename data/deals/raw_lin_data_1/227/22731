mb|p|nt|paulg:  meanwhile, Patsy Meehan found a great lead to get the second undertrick for that contract|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Betty Cotter & Jean Kelly are North-South for Ireland - their system card is http://goo.gl/5BP8y (PDF)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: Long think by Moore over 1NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  McGowan's two spades, and South's restraint, may remove any slam interest|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  slam does make, but at 50% it is a case of take it or leave it from a probability perspective|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Liz is made of sterner stuff and asks Punch to bid slam with a spade control|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg:  Weak NT for Scotland and McGowan has no interest in game if partner cannot break the transfer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|paulg:  Tough lead for Kelly and this will probably concede a couple of overtricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator can correct the result for board 3 .. (chat to me if you need help doing that)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|paulg:  this will work well here, but the five-level may not have been safe if Punch held @sKx for example|pg||
nt|paulg:  however the odds are that she has values in hearts and clubs, which makes it a lot safer|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|paulg:  nice intermediates in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  Cotter does best to try and force dummy, but Punch's @c10 protects her|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|12-14|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: On that last hand I suppose N was afraid of a bad trump break...but since she couldn't handle that, she should have played for the actual layout|pg||

nt|paulg:  As a commentator I have to be even more circumspect than normal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  7 imps to Ireland on board 19 where the 2@h overcall was passed, so I make the score 46-27 to Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  not only was Sam Punch on my Vanderbilt team this year and most of my Spingold teams|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  her boyfriend is in the audience|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I was telly Betty Kelly's son how to access BBO on Twitter earlier today|pg||
nt|paulg:  A very good slam this time, but not an easy hand to bid opposite a weak 1NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  A perfect fit, when there are weak notrumps where you could not make game|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|paulg:  2NT will be a transfer to diamond and I guess 3@d denies support|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  sorry, it is Jean Kelly here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North-South play four-card majors with a strong 1NT, hence the 1@h opener|pg||

nt|paulg:  13 imps to Scotland on board 20 when Ireland did not bid the slam|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|paulg:  Kelly can pick up the trumps now, but has a spade and two diamonds to lose|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg:  so probably down two but this aggressive bidding is typical of all the Irish teams in the Home Internationals|pg||
nt|paulg:  For those who have never operated a BBO vugraph, it is not the easiest job in the world especially in the Camrose|pg||
mc|8|nt|paulg:  Even though they are playing with screens they play very quickly and often fail to show the operator their cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  although, to be fair, very few people accuse Sam Punch of playing too quickly, but Liz McGowan tries to make up for it|pg||

nt|paulg:  An aggressive double by Punch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch's 3@d is natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I expect 4@d is keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|paulg:  if her partner had any useful values, then you'd expect her to be balancing with spade shortage|pg||

nt|vugraphzxa: Moore apologies for not doubling1|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|paulg:  4@s shows 0 key cards|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|paulg:  you would not normally raise to 3@s with the South hand, but the Michaels bid suggests that partner will have more than four|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  perhaps North would be better served bidding 4@c, but she does have a lot of wasted values in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: we have an interesting board here. EW have some spades, but is it enough for agame try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  We are still not linked correctly but we do have another slam hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's 4@s bid, with first round controls in three suits and six trumps does look conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and, indeed, this might encourage partner to do the wrong thing|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|petka: obviously not possible for EW to locate their 5-3 fit, and W will be looking at that heart void|pg||

pc|s4|nt|paulg:  but she will feel a little better now that the Irish have missed a biddable slam|pg||

nt|paulg:  I believe the running score is 72-38 to Scotland|pg||

pc|dA|nt|paulg:  Punch is a very aggressive bidder, so McGowan starts slowly ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but the 2@h bid is natural but confirms a sound overcall so she bids game|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  the normal lead but a welcome sight for Punch|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is still the problem of the heart losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  assuming trumps are 3-2, even if you draw trumps and pitch your club loser you still need a heart trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cK|mc|10|nt|paulg:  and you will run out of trumps |pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  whereas the table that opened played in a part-score|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh seems to have a simple 1NT bid, much to West's relief, but perhaps they play double as denying four spades|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  surprising how often that seems to happen|pg||

pc|c2|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore thinking|pg||
nt|petka: the spade and diamond aces are right, so this looks promising for S. The trick is not to set up a 5th loser before establishing the 9th winner. (2 aces and 2 clubs are already ...|pg||
nt|petka: losers after the lead if W holds the CT). Therefore hearts are not good to play on.|pg||
