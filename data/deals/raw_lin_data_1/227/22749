mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphzxa: Long think by Moore over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  McGowan's two spades, and South's restraint, may remove any slam interest|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  slam does make, but at 50% it is a case of take it or leave it from a probability perspective|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Liz is made of sterner stuff and asks Punch to bid slam with a spade control|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Weak NT for Scotland and McGowan has no interest in game if partner cannot break the transfer|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  Tough lead for Kelly and this will probably concede a couple of overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator can correct the result for board 3 .. (chat to me if you need help doing that)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  this will work well here, but the five-level may not have been safe if Punch held @sKx for example|pg||
nt|paulg:  however the odds are that she has values in hearts and clubs, which makes it a lot safer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|paulg:  nice intermediates in spades|pg||

nt|paulg:  As a commentator I have to be even more circumspect than normal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  7 imps to Ireland on board 19 where the 2@h overcall was passed, so I make the score 46-27 to Scotland|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  not only was Sam Punch on my Vanderbilt team this year and most of my Spingold teams|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  her boyfriend is in the audience|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I was telly Betty Kelly's son how to access BBO on Twitter earlier today|pg||
nt|paulg:  A very good slam this time, but not an easy hand to bid opposite a weak 1NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  A perfect fit, when there are weak notrumps where you could not make game|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  2NT will be a transfer to diamond and I guess 3@d denies support|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  sorry, it is Jean Kelly here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North-South play four-card majors with a strong 1NT, hence the 1@h opener|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|paulg:  so probably down two but this aggressive bidding is typical of all the Irish teams in the Home Internationals|pg||
nt|paulg:  For those who have never operated a BBO vugraph, it is not the easiest job in the world especially in the Camrose|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg:  Even though they are playing with screens they play very quickly and often fail to show the operator their cards|pg||

nt|paulg:  An aggressive double by Punch|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  Punch's 3@d is natural and game forcing|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  you would not normally raise to 3@s with the South hand, but the Michaels bid suggests that partner will have more than four|pg||
mb|2S|an| |mb|p|nt|paulg:  perhaps North would be better served bidding 4@c, but she does have a lot of wasted values in the majors|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petka: we have an interesting board here. EW have some spades, but is it enough for agame try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  We are still not linked correctly but we do have another slam hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's 4@s bid, with first round controls in three suits and six trumps does look conservative|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H = @H and a minor|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  and, indeed, this might encourage partner to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|greerm: a difficult opening lead, honours in every suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|petka: obviously not possible for EW to locate their 5-3 fit, and W will be looking at that heart void|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|paulg:  Punch will be feeling pretty bad at the moment ... conceding -770 and giving away a slam on consecutive boards|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|paulg:  and more so when she scores up and find out that her team mates bid and made the slam on 23 too|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe the running score is 72-38 to Scotland|pg||

nt|greerm: i think 4@S here at all 6 tables|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  our operator has corrected board 3 to four spades making|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will probably lead the @hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  Punch is a very aggressive bidder, so McGowan starts slowly ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but the 2@h bid is natural but confirms a sound overcall so she bids game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  the normal lead but a welcome sight for Punch|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is still the problem of the heart losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  assuming trumps are 3-2, even if you draw trumps and pitch your club loser you still need a heart trick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|paulg:  and you will run out of trumps |pg||
nt|petka: playing standard, the W hand actually must signal negatively, since the T would make it impossble to take 3 clubs if E holds AJx|pg||

nt|paulg:  North might well pass this|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|petka: Interesting. Does E know the spades are 5+? Mike Lawrence says no, but some pairs use a double of 1D to show one or two 4card majors instead of promising both majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  interestingly they reached game after passing the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  whereas the table that opened played in a part-score|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh seems to have a simple 1NT bid, much to West's relief, but perhaps they play double as denying four spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  outh being a short name for South, perhaps not the best one|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  surprising how often that seems to happen|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|petka: this is a guessing situation for inexperienced players, but for experts 3S is normally forcing here|pg||
nt|greerm: Grand National just had a false start|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore thinking|pg||
nt|petka: the spade and diamond aces are right, so this looks promising for S. The trick is not to set up a 5th loser before establishing the 9th winner. (2 aces and 2 clubs are already ...|pg||

nt|petka: A well-deserved disaster, bad bidding and wrong defense|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|yo_yo: what's the NT range?|pg||
nt|greerm: very slow as wales gradually gain overtricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  they may well bid to slam here as they have excellent controls and good slams|pg||
nt|greerm: strong i think|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|paulg:  with hearts agreed I'd have thought 4@c was the normal cue bid for North|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: can't be or south would have bid on|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  when they go through the hands in the post-mortem, Punch might consider that this hand is a better takeout double of 1@s than the takeout double she tried to make on board 22|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: who is winning ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  as North seems to have denied the ace and king of clubs, unsurprising that South signed off|pg||
nt|petka: The E hand is a problem in standard systems. A bit heavy for a simple 2S rebid, but the suit quality is a bit poor for a jump to 3S|pg||

nt|paulg:  and they did the important job of beating the contract|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|petka: This line, playing anyone for K singleton hearts, had its chance, but...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: neptune equester, 100-1 |pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  2NT shows a good raise to 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: here is the multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  another almost slam hand and the five level is safe if they decide to check for aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: Moore apologies for not bidding 5@C|pg||
nt|greerm: do you agree that double Kath?|pg||
nt|greerm: with 4@H and not 4@S ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: i certainly do not|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  1@s would have been more successful than double this time|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  and I think it is a better call, since the spades are not really strong enough to bid if partner bids clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but I am old fashioned|pg||
nt|greerm: Also i would have treated it as lebensohl, so too weak to bid 3@C for me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and I bid lebensohl with the east hand|pg||
nt|greerm: N not a bit perturbed :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  Just because we all overcall 1@s with very poor hands does not mean we cannot have a good one occasionally|pg||
nt|paulg:  lead of the @d2, lowest from xxx in partner's suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  for those who play MUD, it is not a bad leading agreement but just never play it in partner's suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happy in fact|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: it's about time these doubles were punished|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch will bid probably bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H constructive|pg||
mb|2H|an|transfer|nt|paulg:  most play double shows points with the ability to penalise at least one suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|paulg:  4@s in danger of losing a trick in every suit here|pg||
nt|greerm: i know some players who would not have passed as North here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  declarer does have some weapons though|pg||
nt|greerm: what think you K ?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|paulg:  three rounds of diamonds preserving the king of spades as an entry|pg||
nt|paulg:  and can then throw the losing club as East ruffs with her trump trick ... et voila, ten tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this looks a little tricky|pg||
nt|paulg:  since Punch has to pick up the hearts and diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: are you thinking of me going for -4 the other night?|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|paulg:  alternatively she may cash three rounds of diamonds pitching spades|pg||
