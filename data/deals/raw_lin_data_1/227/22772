nt|oleberg:  Monsted will have nightmares for weeks to come|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Welcome all|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Hi Ole|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: hi ole and henrik|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: hi , Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Can anyone help with systemcard for Eiriksson-Sigurjonsson?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|thorvald: here is a chance for a small pick-up for Schou|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South can make 3 N here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and even N with a heart guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: should be easy 3nt|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I am told EW play a natural system, maybe with transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Hi Torsten|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Good morning all  |pg||
mb|2D|an|!h's|nt|ady: e/w may reach 4 spades    but  may go down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a very quiet 4 @S for 420|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I'm your Danish commentator now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Welcome all|pg||
nt|dkkello:  danish trial -out  , |pg||
nt|skaftij:  There it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Hi David|pg||
mb|2N!|an|asking|nt|henrik_r:  Good morning Mr. Hansen|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  results http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1216.html|pg||
mb|3S|an|single !d|nt|ady: hi Kjeld|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Hi Stig|pg||
nt|oleberg:  east has now shown 17+ with an unbalanced hand and 5+ spades|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot; you might really want the heart to be led up to, rather than through|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: given the double that's right.  Without it, it's just random|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi folks, I'm your commentator in this round.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|stigw: The Multi coulndt knock E/W out this time.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  We start of with a board where the objective is NOT to win the battle for the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 2@c = nat. limited or 15-18 - 2@H = max 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 @S not veru optimistic bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  very|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead can make|pg||
mb|5H|nt|oleberg:  7hcp, one probably useless and a flat distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Splendid bidding E/W in my eyes.|pg||
nt|stigw: We see 2 of the most favoured Danish pair-combinations clash here at this table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: hi Stig|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, you don't know partner has only @HAx - if he has @HAxx or @Hxx, clearly your hand is better-off declaring|pg||
nt|athene: @HAxx or @HKxx sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Surpriding lead - with doubleton in pdÂ´s suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  South was a junior once , won the European title in 1970 http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=9046|pg||
nt|stigw: Might go down after this tantalizing lead.|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should go down  unless south takes first diamond  if east plays a spade to ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The way to make this one, would have been to take it in hand, and lead a diamond. But it is far from certain this would have been the best plan|pg||
nt|stigw: If declarer in the end could get timae to throw h loser on diamonds it makes, but....|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: 3NT would actually be a better contract, but both games make|pg||
nt|sommer: the jump to 3NT seems to be given on the agreement, that 2@S is "sound" raise|pg||
nt|stigw: I was switched I see to the other table.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  5@h will make, 3 @c going away on @d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oleberg:  Its to late now, but we are many that will look forward to telleing Hagen, that he made a mistake at the very first trick of the tournament|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stigw: Up and diamonds, no ?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: @SA, @SQ, @CK and run more @H's seems best|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sommer: ..or K, Q:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S is pretty sure to represent Denmark in open tournament  .., but had a slow start this weekend|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dkkello:  they play a strong club system|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The (impossible) way to defeat 5@H: Underlead the spades on the blind lead, and a clubswitch|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|dkkello:  E-V represent Denmark in Dublin  (females)  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oleberg:  Duck the diamond|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Although EW probably will make 2@H|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  True|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: if partner does have @Hxx then you want to play it since west might be underleading @HAKxx(x) but east won't, i suppose|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|dkkello:  This is an observationtournament , results so fare http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1214.html|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A return of the @S9 would have been better than the @HK|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S already on the national women team |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, a return of a passive club will even it out|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow-Hagen, Bjarnarson-Askgaard, Bilde-Graversen and Blakset-Schaltz are in contention for three spots on the Danish Open team for the European Championships|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzcq: houlberg thinking...|pg||
nt|thorvald: No entries so should she not just grab this ?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|athene: given the double|pg||
nt|dkkello:  V-E trying to make it on the open team ..|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|oleberg:  Well, the heart return was just as fine. Just dont rusj the diamonds|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  This tournament is one of the factors the selectors will take into consideration|pg||
mc|11|nt|stigw: He couldnt do better, very unlucky E/W|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|nt|thorvald: They will end in 2@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dkkello:  not to bad  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|prinsib:  Why not 2@D from W - followed by a RD?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: The last dbl i penalty -- other dbl was take-out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|prinsib:  they could have missed a 4-4 fit in spades|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dkkello:  how low can you go   |pg||
nt|prinsib:  second hand low, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: right Ib :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hard to guess what the lead is rom|pg||
nt|jron: would S dbl with 9xx or Txx in @h?|pg||
nt|jron: blakset is going to finesse I think|pg||
nt|prinsib:  I bed 10 Ã¸re, that he play the J/Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: bet taken - I say @h8|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4-card needed to a penalty double|pg||
nt|dkkello:  finesse i say|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I wouldn't put it past Graversen to double on power|pg||
nt|prinsib:  Deep Finesse says deep finesse ;)|pg||
nt|jron: I dont - remember he has already shown some length in @h with the first double, which was T/O|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: W takes some water|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and seems to be ready to play a card|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Good point|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he will go for a leffe if the 8 holds the trick i hope|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But in reopening position in this kind of auction you basically double on anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: folds his cards again - and we might be here for a while|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he he|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: @h8 in front of the deck|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Started as we hoped!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Jesper!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1520 - no swing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fourth best in your longest?|pg||
nt|ady: diamond  play before 2nd trump might have worked    south has to avoid an error|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: N: Nice lead pd|pg||
nt|stigw: Very difficult to reach the lay-down 3 nt here after the multi-start.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Note that the club had a lot of merit, Had West held the @C10 instead, the defence had been helpless|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Also nite the unblocking of the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Hi Stig|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3816.html for standing after round 9|pg||
mb|1C|nt|oleberg:  If EW gets the hand to themselves, and East opens 1@C, West will have shown 6-6 with his second bid|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think 2@s would have made|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dkkello:  6 @D looks right here  |pg||
nt|stigw: In the previous I mean.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   or 6NT     e/w     must avoid 4-4 club fit at slam level|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - my screen was dirty...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Should end up in 6 NT.|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@D is makeable here NS, and 5@S may save 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 4@d would have shown 55 @D and @H (Leaping Michaels)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|sommer: Martin doesn't have a propor raise, but he's trying to figure S' hand ..before passing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..I guess!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Think so, but he is on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|dkkello:  you are always slow Stig!  welcome|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp|pg||
nt|dkkello:  grand old man og danish bridge|pg||
nt|stigw: Interesting device that 2 H-opening.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  In principle NS only have 8 tricks in 3nt, but the ninth will surely come|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jesperdall:  thank god he doesnt have 7-6 then|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: They are safe to the 5-level, so west will survive investigation of slam.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In the other room West bid only 4 @S in this situation|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  do they have any tools to help them investigate safely below game?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  an "easy"  minor slam here |pg||
nt|thorvald: I would have bid 1NT on the East hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What is West to lead?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  @HA|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Right you are!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henrik_r:  EW CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/73y4mxl|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  N-S using a natural system with 12-14 NT  and 5 card major |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite inspiring watching both sides competing fiercely for the second non-vulnerable undertrick|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/bubcthc|pg||
nt|sommer: oh yes..again, the commentators curse:)|pg||
nt|stigw: Difficult to reach 3 nt now, but 4 sp will probably also make|pg||
nt|dkkello:  welcome Al Hollander  , american expert|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: What is 4@D?  Once there was a general rule not to m ake your first cue-bid in a void, but it may not have considered 6-6 hands|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So now south has shown an unbalanced hand with 4+ diamonds and 4 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The selection committee consist of, amongst others, Peter Schaltz, Rico Hemberg|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Obvious|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Then switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I said "in principle"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jesperdall:  It shows 6-6 according to Ole ;)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @D is probably not a cue bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if specifically shortage, t hen it's fine, I guess, even if it's in partner's known long suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Only with @S7; if he had @S6 instead he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Very accurate system :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I have a known 10-card fit, I cuebid my shortness even in partners suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Isn't he short in clubs also?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 hts indicates spades?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oleberg:  I feel confident they wont end up in clubs. West only has to look at his own hand, to see it can never be right|pg||
nt|ady: good point     communication problem in 6NT  on spade lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think 2 @H is a relay ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No, 2@d promise @h, wek or strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: week|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: weak:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: so this shows a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Making the jump to 3@D a very comfortable option|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Lets see, if they can stop on a dime in 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: ..investment?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Hi Al|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: can anyone explain reason for using this type of 2@H opener?|pg||
nt|stigw: No problem it seems - wd.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (Surely I couldn't)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If 4@D is non-forcing, south should pass|pg||
nt|sommer: could be worth 5 imps;-)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In principle, Sigurjonsson does not hear you|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: I'm told they use 3N to start cue-bidding of  high card values|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But partner does not know it is a 10-card fit?!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Well, he is infinitely longer in clubs than diamonds...|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Anyway, very tough problem|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  And sure easts hand could be more suitable for slam|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dkkello:  nice , with Stig an Al here I can concentrat on saying stupid thngs and they can tell about bridge|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oleberg:  Doesn't matter. If I know of 10 trumphs, I do it|pg||
nt|stigw: No Ady, 1 superflous trick makes it easy.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But it was to tough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oleberg:  But just change the @CQ ti the @HJ, and the game is excellent|pg||
nt|sommer: an almost certain -800 here, and in that case 5 imps compared to 5@D=|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: sorry    still 12 tricks   only need 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|thorvald: Just making|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dkkello:  east-vest trying to make it to the national team , who will be decided sunday after this tournament|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Which is also the superflous trick, that makes 6@D easy (on a spade lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW convention card   http://www2.bridge.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fDivisionsturneringer+2011-2012%2f2.+division%2fhold10-fie-christina.doc|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both in Danish|pg||
nt|dkkello:  asked about 2 @H .. I dont know , do we have a new convention?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Velkommen til Sejr|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stigw: OK, even if 6 nt best, but East are afraid of a H-lesd in 6 nt. |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But, after all, thats playing partner for perfect values, and partner did sign off|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=7454  =  stig werdelin|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West hopes for an unlikely @s Jack with pd|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|stigw: I think the convention - new or not new - just means, thet you have a normal 1 of a major with no side-suits - that means 5-3-3-2.|pg||
nt|sejr:  11-14 nt with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Yes, it can be 5422|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems you'd want to stay low with that hand type|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe 5-4-2-2, but then it seems more risky, I think.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes system  2M = 10-13 but unbalanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I think the reason is that you dont have this hand when you open 1@h. Is thar a good reason|pg||
nt|stigw: So its not that type here, unless Christina made a bluff !|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I dont like the 3 @S  ..|pg||
nt|stigw: If you play 12-14 nt, its a question of allowing a 5 card MA or not in the nt.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the CC only mentions 6@C/@D and 22(54)|pg||
nt|stigw: I havent their card, but no matter, 3 nt rolls home anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I can see the written explanation|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  If North had been the least bit interested she could have bid 3@S or 4@C instead of 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: it would for sure have been better for W to take the direct sacrifice in 5@S, hoping to put N overboard in 6@D|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|stigw: Dont go for overtricks in teams, well done.|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@h easy to make, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes , good morning Peter  |pg||
nt|thorvald: 5-6 in the majors, how to bid it ?|pg||
nt|sommer: isn't he wtrong enough to go "direct" via 1@H, 2@S?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..could be a misfit hand, of course|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 3NT is not, whta N wants|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dkkello:  "easy "   4 @H  |pg||
nt|sejr:  1H 8+ hearts or 12+ NT|pg||
nt|stigw: Lousy minimum from Gregers.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!S's|nt|dkkello:  20 against 20 here ,but looks like action!  |pg||
nt|oleberg:  If east gets the chance to bid heart volountarily, West will support, and they might get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=FG  a) 5+@H  b) BAL, 13+ HCP |pg||
nt|thorvald: That 2 @H bid looks strange to me, any special conventions ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  so east staymans and then 3NT - what's your lead?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can make 3 NT double-dummy...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  renember N-S dont play together on regular basis and a weak 2 can have many faces|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2NT for minor by N?|pg||
nt|thorvald: You will have to bid @Hs first, |pg||
mb|2H!|an|GF|nt|stigw: Only 15 !!! - tournament director !|pg||
nt|thorvald: The weak NT strikes again|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: a kib suggest double in East|pg||
nt|stigw: Here we see a super-strong 2 MA-opening (or is it super-weak playing strong ?).|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  N need a good hand to enter the bidding , obviously :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: OK, I will call:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|oleberg:  Or not obviously|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  How is to say that the have a minor fit?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  How -> Who|pg||
nt|sejr:  2S = 6 H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Interesting deal, many possibilities in 6NT East |pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c 10 coming down = 3@c tricks|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Ultimately squeeze in red suits |pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: 7@h is makeable|pg||
mb|4N|nt|stigw: Interesting developement, but surely E/W wont end up in 3 nt.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Wow, you agree with 4@H?|pg||
nt|sejr:  and minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: funny   i have one referenced where 1@H is 13+ bal, 1 where 14+ bal  and now sejr=12+|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  it took them 2 seconds to bid 4 @H |pg||
nt|sejr:  3D = 6331 the singlton uknown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=any 6(331)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  sejr faster|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzcq: 2nt was Lebensohl|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes I agree|pg||
nt|stigw: With at leat 8 + and a Ma-suit its of course GF opposite a 16 + any.|pg||
nt|stigw: If its only defined as "constructive", I consider it a bit to "Constructive".|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Presumably @s agreed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@s quickly defeated with @c ruff, let's see what East bids now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  zzzzzz|pg||
mb|d|nt|oleberg:  Diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: As cards lie, looks better for east to play 3N, as @D lead from north seems best for NS|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and Konow is know as a very thoughtfull (slow) player|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Partner has 14+hcp and we have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|thorvald: It would have been worse if partner opens 1 @D, then rebids 2@C|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jesperdall:  this lead may hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@S on the other hand, quite a bid|pg||
nt|stigw: Boesgaard gort the highest bid of course !|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@D is transfer, by the way ..NS play a "homemade" system called Nusine-klør (=clubs) ..named after Lars' former cat;-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their relay structure looks very similar to Viking Club|pg||
nt|stigw: One might misplay the sp-suit here, if left to one's own device.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Dbl. in first round surely for majors (or something ells) so he couldent|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S not afraid of bidding normally ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a bit lucky p had 5 @C  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|jesperdall:  interest suit in itself, diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: tht west a little conservative  might have re-bid 3 clubs    but final contract probably the same|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h = Acol|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|stigw: OK, nothing wrong. Maybe they okay Acol-2-bids, and then it makes sense.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes it seems good old-fahioned Acol Two opening|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzcq: S to E: In your younger days, you had a clearcut pass|pg||
nt|thorvald: Needing to ruf 3 @Cs or a ruffing finess in @D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jesperdall:  correct to play the 6 from dummy? not sure...|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Depends whether North has the 7 or 9|pg||
nt|othered1: if south decides to shift to @C, 10 is winning play|pg||
nt|thorvald: if 4@c is a cue, what is 4@h then ?|pg||
nt|sommer: can it stand a trumplead?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Eiriksson must have thought about the risk of @C ruff, but why did he bid 6@s all the same?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He shouldn't have bid 4NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stigw: Can anybodo telle me the differance between a Yarbouroug and "an Earl of Botwell" ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and strange to play the Q  here , ..  even easyer i must admit since I can see all cards!|pg||
nt|stigw: It needs luck in the cl-suit (4-3) or a winng finesse.|pg||
nt|pelu: I remember years ago that Ole Raulund - in charge of national team- stated : strong 2-openers cant be elected to national teams :):)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s8|nt|skaftij:  3NT?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  south should have considered this earlier and ducked smoothly|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  now it is easy for declarer to continue spades from dummy as done|pg||
nt|sommer: with a @Hentry in W, I think maybe a trumplead could have set it|pg||
nt|stigw: Or can he strip all the side-suits first ?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oleberg:  he should have done some more exploring, although it might have wrongsided 6NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oleberg:  Konow has always been slow and thoughtfull (Except once; when he dumped me as a partner)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2 trumpleads:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow carefull to unblock the @SAK|pg||
nt|pelu: total cross-ruff = 13 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzcq: 1@c was 16+ |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hagen did as well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jesperdall:  always hard for the defense in situations like this - trying to find a way to defeat the contract|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes he can, and will I guess.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sommer: as so often before, trumpleads are very often good against preference-contrakts|pg||
pc|d9|nt|thorvald: He might end up with 3 aces and 10 @H tricks|pg||
nt|stigw: wd, but a push I guess.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  True|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If you have to take a long huddle after your partners reply to 4NT, it is a good indication, that it was a wrong bid|pg||
mc|11|nt|skaftij:  Right indeed. Perhaps the D caused the huddle|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  I would assume that Dbl by South would be responsive asking North to pick a major|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: After some talk W calls for the TD|pg||
nt|dkkello:  maybe an hesitation situation , but|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Did South have a break of tempo after 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and now we are waiting for him|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  they are playing with screens , so ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: It was not an obvious hesitation -- but it was a little slow second pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and S has agreed that it was not a normal tempo second pass|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and Bilde DBL twice in this situations "always"|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Yes but in this auction it is odds on that they time was used in south|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: but S says that he had to consult the EW convention card to see what 3@d was|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But I agree that double in North is clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: SW is on the same side of the screen|pg||
nt|dkkello:  you cant really know that can you, but since south agreed then..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ok then|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: S agrees of the hesitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and S says that the second DBL from North is 100% the style Dennis Bilde has|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: Results http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/KlubTurn.html |pg||
nt|sommer: I'm now pretty sure, @S lead and continuation would have set it|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3814.html for standing after round 6|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This opening has its merits but sacrificing preempt|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-15|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  konow did well in the other room, selling out to 4 diamonds |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Let's see if South will reopen|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I bet she will|pg||
nt|dkkello:  me to|pg||
nt|pelu: remember that 1@H = max 15 HCP - so East can pass|pg||
nt|pelu: a jump to 2@S is 12-15 and 6 card suit but S is too dtrong - in my book|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  it is sometimes said, that women players lacks bidding-courage|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Now probably a reopening T/O double by East|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C is "weak" with both MA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  weak nt throughout|pg||
nt|stigw: "Gamma-result" is E/W 5 cl doublet 9 tricks, I guess.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Needs to find @d queen if defense shifts to @c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Similarly, you have to take a long huddle after winning first trick in a hurry as declarer when duck was apossibility|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: decided on the safe game    which looks right    |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  E are preemping e-v out of and @S contract|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It is not the case for any of the participants in this tournament|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stigw: Not for a while, but they will come later.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Otherwise, if 3 rounds of @h, exit in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: if 2 x @H and @C then no problem - just 2x@s and @cJ - and EW endplayed|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: Wonder what that bid shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: my guess is cuebid|pg||
nt|thorvald: A @D lead to get 2 tricks vs a @s contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: the problem for south is, that she only holds 3@s, so no she wishes that she bid something else than 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: would need a maximum weak 2   and suitability   like singleton spade|pg||
nt|stigw: Konows supermax (?) wasnt even tired to be detected, and with that lead it was perhaps wrong (but I really dont think so).|pg||
nt|barbyh: which could be beaten but still a good save|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (Not for any of the males either)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  btw. They are playing with screens, helps them when they need to think |pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Indicates you should have paused at trick one|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: but then we'll have to look at movie|pg||
nt|stigw: Not easy to reach 4 sp (not to mention the sacrifice in 5 cl in that case).|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dkkello:  N-S started very strong this session|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@D from W would have been "small+" slaminterest with 5-5 MA|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: *now|pg||
nt|thorvald: With a single @d in East all it takes is the right view in spades and clubs to make 6@s|pg||
nt|stigw: Nothing to reproach really here, but 4 H has chances.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now its a maximum 2@s only lacking a spade|pg||
nt|pelu: as I said S too strong for 2@S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: down after that lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jesperdall:  Wouldn't you be a bit worried about selling out to 4D as south?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sQ|pc|d7|nt|stigw: Now it always makes without guessing diamonds.|pg||

nt|dkkello:  vest : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8039|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oleberg:  Just a bit|pg||
nt|thorvald: trying to secure som @S-tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too dangerous for east to bid again opposite  AT MOST 14 HCP that could not super-accept|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the hands just fit perfectly with @C & @D as they are|pg||
nt|stigw: A perfect fit E/W in the side suits, but with the Di K wrong 10 tricks is no sure thing.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jesperdall:  Say north has AQxxx xxx x Axxx...|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Either @HK in East or a little help, e.g. @D lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that decent; you need the @HK on the weak hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would easily win all the matchpoints|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe conservative by E just to pass 2 H, but 3 di would probably be GF.|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2@S is defined as a 6-card and a good opening hand, I when available I think I would use that too|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The strength of 2@s ia maybe not clearly defined|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|nilsland:  6 @S is a good contract except for the spade break'|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  well, well, 6 spades looks good on paper|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S would require simply good breaks in both majors.|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  potential swing in schou's favour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, a) 6+@C b) 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What will East do over 5@d?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|oleberg:  West would never miss the defence against 4@H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|nilsland:  Diffucult to bid however|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  but always hard to bid a slam when the opponents open the bidding|pg||
nt|sommer: 12-14 NT and transfer |pg||
nt|stigw: The bidding was the critical thing here, and maybe pelu is right, even if the jump in 4-th hand should show exactly a hand like South's.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  There you are!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  any control issues in 4 spades?|pg||
nt|othered1: with @S 3-2, defense of 6@S that began with @C, @C, tapping dummy, would then require @H split (or stiff 10) as well.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS play 15-17 NT in 3rd position vulnerable|pg||
nt|stigw: Bad sits make any game very difficult for N/S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if DBL = 4@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 @S  =  minimun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just a maximum opener|pg||
nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I think that 2nt denied 4@hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w likely to get to 4@S    |pg||
pc|dK|nt|oleberg:  I don't know whether RD is strenght or Hx, but feel certain it virtually denies 3 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Switch the @SQ and the @CJ what would West lead then? I would guess diamonds ;) |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Will North bid 1NT or 2@C ?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Im asked when i 2S its not better to go for the overtrick by finessing in @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oleberg:  By bidding 1@S it can be seen, that West doesn't evaluate his hand to be woth a game-force, facing their opening style|pg||
nt|sommer: with one of the red aces right, this is an easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: this should be down a couple|pg||
pc|dT|nt|stigw: I would try 3 nt also here, even if I'm not a junior anymore !|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: you would be ok if someone had 2 trumps and 1 heart|pg||
nt|athene: take the force, draw 2xtrumps, then play @HAQ|pg||
nt|thorvald: It looks to me like 5@d was an interesting contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true, Bjarnarson DBL would have been negative  but with double @S stop and 4@H 2N might still make sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Agree|pg||
nt|stigw: Chances are there at lest now, but still very difficult (or impossible double dummy ?).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs lead  2nd/4th  [this includes LOW from xx]|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nilsland:  the same applies with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: may encounter some problems  with diamonds and sspades 4-1|pg||
nt|thorvald: In 4@S its safety first by why not go for that extrac trick ?|pg||
nt|stigw: At least is not vulnerable.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|stigw: Best to start running clubs here I think, and see if anything good happens.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stig - is low from small doubleton the normal lead in Denmark?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Gregers is looking at @h10|pg||
nt|stigw: Looks like 3 undertricks but we'll see.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This hand poses a classical dilemna, settle for penalty or go for vul game bonus|pg||
pc|hK|nt|stigw: Wrong to bid 1 sp in my opinion, but with partner limited to at most 15 it makes sence.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  !--lead would have been better - as very often|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  results  http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3809.html|pg||
nt|pelu: and 3NT not easy for NS|pg||
nt|stigw: I think wise to pass with the South hand even at this vulnerability, and as pelu mentioned 3 nt is by no means any "sure thing" here.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oleberg:  Right, still I would prefer to stay out, competent defenders usualy leads right in these situations. But of course it will make a reasonable amount of times|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It seems as West needs to guess @D to make |pg||
pc|h7|nt|thorvald: She needs to time this correct|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|stigw: I think it will go down on the bad breaks, but we'll see.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running score is just comparison of the 2 vugraph tables -- in the event scoring is actually cross-imps of all 5 tables|pg||
nt|stigw: Kello answered your question ahollan, but I'm not sure if correctly.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  On the lead of @S 5, North might go down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|stigw: South could even have hoped for 800 un a good day.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D (Multi) would work better here - normal bid by S over 2@D = 2NT|pg||
nt|pelu: they have only played 2 boards in Open room|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barbyh: best lead for defense|pg||
nt|barbyh: cant go down|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  Small @S to the Ace and @s back, North must duck to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news for declarer -- 5@C doesn't make either|pg||
nt|stigw: Not clear for South what is the best defence here, but it should be 3 down anyway|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|nt|oleberg:  Defending, taking your ruffs would have been easier|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|stigw: Trumph now ?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|nt|oleberg:  (Underleading @DA on the blind lead, for -3)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  A fourth round of @C would surely have doomed the contract|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barbyh: can only take 3 sp and 1 cl|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|stigw: Not good to establish Cl K.|pg||
nt|ady: home now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c6|pc|s7|nt|thorvald: She now knows that there are no way home, and should just get on to the next board|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - if North covers, defense has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - leading the 5|pg||
nt|stigw: Gregers probably thinks H are 5-0|pg||
pc|h4|nt|skaftij:  On board 15, East declared 5@h in the other room. @c lead and -1|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|stigw: Right, should make now.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzcq: short break|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It was easy for South to see, that a fourth club was needed, but impossible to communicate this to partner.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Agree, very very hard (impossible?) for North to figure this out|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I feel a little silly for eating 6 Mars-Icecream bars yesterday afternoon|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I assume that is because you *only* ate six?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now I have no Mars-Icecream bars :(|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, I'll have tom learn to buy more boxes|pg||
nt|thorvald: On a trumph lead, South would play @H, then ducking from East wouldnt that leave South with a problem|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  And true to character he should the overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: I am not 100% sure about who actually called for TD -- there were some discussions after the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: but it was W asking to see the N hand|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The tournament is pairs IMP-across-the-Field|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and then some more talk|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and then TD was called for|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  and we "only" have live broadcasts from 2 of 5 tables|pg||
nt|thorvald: Here the fast arrival prinicple should be applied, so being 3-4-1-5 he must be minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and now board 20 --- and S is trying to find a good bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: Graversen is just trying to figure out how low minimum can be, and figured it out|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|thorvald: Easy to play Double Dummy, but what should his plan be ?|pg||
nt|pelu:  in CR Hagen played @h in trick 2 and set up @HJ for his 10. trick (1 @D-ruff)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  Q  could be in V hand  but easy DD|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Graversen had played a @C ages ago. The operator just wanted to hustle Kello....|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: an everyone who thinks I had already seen the @c3 before I took the bet --- hmmmm --- might be mistaken :)|pg||
nt|prinsib:  If Martin ducks this one, I think he has played the hand before!|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Now S AND W leaves the table |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and goes to the mens room|pg||
nt|dkkello:  cant they go to the toilet before the game ? |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The declarer can counter a duck by playing @SK, @CK->A and then finesse East in @C ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Now I can hear E telling N about his thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: "Can it be wrong to do that" E asks N -- N shaking his head :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Look like a potential strong club with relays auction|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, 2@D is only weak MA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, unbal [1st/2nd], 4+@D, maybe longer @C|pg||
nt|stigw: Gregers didnt hear my piece of advice, but I think that could have made a difference after the di start.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  very common in Poland (and Denmark :)  )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one benefit of 1@D as unbal with 4+    North can raise here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after  nebulous Precision 1@D -- north hand difficult unless able to show BOTH minors|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|oleberg:   NT looks like a good reult in the other room|pg||

mb|2H|an|nat|nt|oleberg:  3|pg||
nt|stigw: He was able this time I see, but the sp-honours scream of nt, or at least not game in a minor.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C does not show both minors, just a "mixed raise" in @D    [see alert explanation from operator]|pg||
nt|stigw: no Al, the 2 h opener lost to 3 nt which wasnt bid at the other table (and neither 4 sp).|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@D = relay, invitational+|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@H = hearts, nothing about strenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: wn?|pg||

nt|stigw: No good game here, even if 4 H perhaps is makeable.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|thorvald: 3@C looks agressive, but still I would have bid 3NT in east|pg||
nt|sommer: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spades lay well|pg||

nt|skaftij:  2@h promises a good hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: S: Sorry - I should have passed 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: 44 imps stilll needed for Schou|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Left to their own devices, EW would have a walk in the park on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Stig -- i got that exactly wrong|pg||
nt|stigw: The 2-H-opening in deal 2 were at this table, closed room.|pg||
nt|stigw: But the scoreboard dosent show that, I must admit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA looks good for declarer, but no entry to dummy means still lose 2@C|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@S = 13-15 and this specific distribution|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jesperdall:  interesting lead!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If East wins this trick 3 N will go down|pg||
nt|thorvald: Pressure on declare from the start - if he get it wrong EW will switch to spades|pg||
nt|othered1: is there a case to p lay the ace?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think declarer has too few tricks for that|pg||
nt|thorvald: Ace might be an idea, but only because T of @H drops out|pg||
nt|sommer: as we see, 5@C is without chances..3NT would be far better|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Here West had to guess. he guessed right, but with enough guesses, you'll go wrong from time to time|pg||
nt|pelu: :) - he sh have bid 4 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ruff and @DQ intersting ploy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  I think he plays the queen - if it holds, he retains most chances|pg||
nt|thorvald: In closed room West ducked the @H-finess, so declare switched to clubs|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  same lead?|pg||
nt|stigw: Makes easily with the favourable lay-out, next deal please.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|thorvald: Spade and spade|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: J@H seems best|pg||
nt|stigw: OK to stop here, I will say - it needs a good portion of luck to make 10 tricks, and not vul the bonus is too small.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Needs both @dK and @hQ. OK game if vulnerable|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure u are right Stig, - look at the :)'s|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  so, now two top hearts pitching a diamond, then diamonds?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I wouldn't have done it either, but there is two tens, and a lot of controls|pg||
nt|sommer: the destiny of the contract depends on the @Cguess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Such heights the bidding has reached, I get dizzy|pg||
nt|pelu: standard rule: opp on 1-level: lead trump!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stigw: Diamond lead might make this shaky.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LetÂ´s see @H to the 9 - and KING...!|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks more likely to make    4 hearts likely down on the same diamond lead unless getting spades right|pg||
nt|dkkello:  great pas from E here  ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But the flat shape detracts, and the @D10 might not pull it's full weight |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Well Kjeld the online hand evaluator agrees with Rasmussen|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=J73+AK5+AQT+AKT2 is valued at 21.7 |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sommer: ..no guess:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Asking for a @s back|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|thorvald: Drop a @S and play @D - North will think you have no @Ds|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and a brave 2 @H of course|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: Askgaard bids are all Relays - saying nothing, asking for full distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Board 6 might not be bad for N/S after all, because maybe E/W can make 4 sp.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still think his plan was fine. With spades 4-1, he can fall back on a club-finesse|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  Certainly not KJ. K maybe|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still hard to find a way down|pg||
nt|barbyh: very|pg||
nt|thorvald: As suggested by a kib its better to grab @HA, drop a @H and a @C on the @DAK, but declarer will still need to guess the position, when West playes @HK|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|stigw: OK to stop low here with no sp-stopper.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I'd want to be in 5@d. Defense never plays trumps against me|pg||
nt|skaftij:  True|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dkkello:  run the queen best play|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|stigw: Fritzbøger is right regarding board 6, but how was the vulnerability (and maght others not be tempted to bid 5 sp) ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is best way to combine chances in @H & @C here?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|stigw: Normally you would be expected to bid 4 H on Norts's hand, but the 4-3-3-3 and minimum persuaded him.|pg||
nt|ady: discarding spade now an overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: of course west cannot see what we see|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
mc|8|nt|oleberg:  banking on the @SA to be onside|pg||
nt|henryb:  Did everyone look at the two wonderful April Fool's day articles on Bridgewinners.com. If you have not, go to|pg||
nt|thorvald: He need @SA in south and playing accordingly|pg||
nt|henryb:  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I just wrote on my facebook status that I was up early. (but it was to easy)|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: I have been operating BBO for some time -- but I have never had some much action as today |pg||
nt|pelu:  but in CR EW had the field open - no 3@C by N - and lot of space to bid - even 6@H would had won 12 IMP - so "only" 5 IMP extra for then grand|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  so 1 imp to schou - more coming that way on this board, perhaps|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  as they bid and made a heart game in the other room|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  that's more like a HC - Boesgaard game to me!|pg||
nt|stigw: No defence really when H behaved so nicely.|pg||
nt|ady: that was a good score for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still trying to calculate where it loses versus more obvious lines|pg||
nt|oleberg:  natural to misguess spades. With AQx in west, you need to finesse|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And if there was no other clues from bidding and play|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Then finesse is correct|pg||
mb|2N!|an|!C or !D preemptive|nt|henrik_r:  Probably pass, pass 1@D which can be 11-13 bal|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  4@h is not the greatest game and it is marginal to get to game|pg||
nt|dkkello:  just spoked to Bjarnasson ,who will play tomorrow instead of Bruun with Askgaard as usualy |pg||
nt|skaftij:  4@h not easy|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Thats the advantage of this kind of tournament, and selction of teams: If you play correct, and is unlucky, the observers can see it|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT = minor suit preempt|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The are drawbecks too, but in Denmarks case, I really believe it is the best way.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hagen - Konow play 3@c opening as both minors|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And 3@D as both majors|pg||
mb|r!|an|bid your suit p|nt|jesperdall:  it is a great game - its hard to bid and easy to make!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pretty trivial 2 @H contract E-V  |pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: At the other table NS never found the @S fit and vent down in 2@H - a terrible result|pg||
nt|thorvald: Board 3 that is|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@D is natural but unbalanced|pg||
nt|stigw: OK N/S again (deal 6 will turn up later).|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Rdbl highly likely asks partner to bid his suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: I must leave.  Thanks everyone and bye!|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Yes but West may decide to pass 1nt with the bad @H suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  true|pg||
nt|thorvald: Same results at the other table for Board 1 and 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Both Pass and RD asks for suit|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  surprised to see east pass - but he got another chance|pg||
nt|henryb:  If the auction starts 1N-2@d and W does not make a strong (e.g 3@h bid) |pg||
mb|4H|nt|thorvald: Much easier with a 15-17 range 1NT|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Tourg double, like I said, they do not lack bidding courage|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: East did claim 9 after trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Small break now|pg||
nt|stigw: She didnt dare to take the club finesse for the overtrick understandably.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Shr could try the Q, maybe S would cover|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I asked Gregers: 1@c-1@h is 14+ if balanced|pg||
nt|stigw: No swings in the first 2 deals.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Sure?|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: HC wont be happy when he sees there is no @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  East should NOT imho make a game try|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@C = Fourth suit forcing|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I wouldn't have doubled either, but then again I'm robbed blind all the time|pg||
nt|oleberg:  21C should be making|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@C|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good one for N-S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hagen is not a big fan of bridge in the early monrning |pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  staying out of game is good bridge - well bid EW, despite the loss of imps|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A little sof by West not to bid 2@H, after all it's white vs white (Where going down is punished least, and defeating oponents is rewarded least|pg||
nt|skaftij:  So their CC says|pg||
pc|c8|nt|thorvald: I think LB forgot that it could be a marmic, as EW are showing 8 @hs|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Then you can be sure!|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Any clue to what the difference is?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|stigw: I dont know if 2 cl as 4 th suit was gameforcing, but Boesgaard has his "stuff" as opposed to his partner.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I'm not certain, but it seems declarer must rise in dummy to win|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (But thats soubledummy)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no way to 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|stigw: Must go down on best defence here I agree.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West will duck twice the @D|pg||
nt|stigw: Looks ok wiht di Ace right.|pg||
nt|pelu: easy bidding, more diff if W open 1NT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes they don't forget system easily, very accurate|pg||
pc|cK|nt|thorvald: And better in North than in South|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: najor suit honours badlay placed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Nope, but wonder|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d3|nt|jesperdall:  So, 6 imps to schou|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To think about playing the Ace is not my cup of tee|pg||
nt|ady: well it is 23 combined  count with not a particularly good fit   sow ould have to belucky to make|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, and only 23 misfitting hcp together, but with a friendly layout it might have made (not now I think).|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  but they need a lot more of that|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Will we see them go to extremes to create swings soon?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|jesperdall:  No point in suffocating slowly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thorvald: In fact with 2-2 in majors odds are that North are 4-4-4-1 so 3@C is a terrible bid|pg||
nt|sommer: ya, the are misfits around the table, so he should have kept silence|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Maybe pass indicates a little strenght or fit. But I'm just guessing.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not unlikely|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|oleberg:  I think I'll ask them, when I get the chance|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Perhaps a D later would have different meaning, optional leave in or demand pass|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dkkello:  the substitut:  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=5101|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  it needs hearts to come in (52%) plus clubs (less than 50%) so about a 20%+ game|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The best guess so far|pg||
pc|s4|nt|skaftij:  North would probably enter with a bid showing both Majors over 1NT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dkkello:  board 4 ,other table in 6 H  ..|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|thorvald: What if spades are 4-2 |pg||

nt|pelu: for sure - but many pairs here open 1NT 11-14 - by system|pg||
nt|thorvald: If @hs 4-1 he must depend on spades 3-3 and here 4-2 is no problem, so just play accordingly|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Fairly simple 7@S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@D by East would have been a good start|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And 3@C by west a good continuation|pg||

nt|dkkello:  not that easy I think|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2@D was just that if East had a weak @D then that was where to play. 2@H would show a good han and semiforcinig. The Double was to show 18-19|pg||
nt|pelu: a free 1@S or jump to 2@S?, soft values and @D QJ ? I would only bid 1@S - partner has only promised 3+ !§ss |pg||
nt|oleberg:  transfer-rebids (I love it)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  agree with Ole ..but would pas myself :) I am a chicken|pg||

nt|dkkello:  3 @S now|pg||
nt|stigw: Michael will come again, but with what ?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I know Ole|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The transfer-rebid is made possible by the fact, that 1@D promisses an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Either love or hate it|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Not bidding 3@C is chicken. Not bidding 3@D is normal and sane.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Bjarnasson will be back tomorrow ,they too whant to play for Denmark.. |pg||
nt|stigw: Big swing in boar 4 where 6 H was allowed to make at the other table.|pg||

nt|thorvald: Now 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: Why should he ?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, actually I have mixed feelings about the few sequences where you bid NT to show clubs. Much to often it wrongsides 3NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oleberg:  (Four specific)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  mathias Bruun  former silver and bronce medalist , European champ a solid sub. you can say ;) |pg||

pc|h6|nt|henrik_r:  No comment|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: NS super-accepts are interesting   they show location of values where more common [i think] is to show weak/short suit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|thorvald: And pushing EW overboard - this looks like one down to me|pg||
nt|stigw: Terrible sits so 1 down at least.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|skaftij:  I'd have some more coffee if it did not spoil my sleep|pg||
nt|stigw: He didnt I see, and neither Gregers, that was a fault I think.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Schaltz - Blakset ended in 7@h on board  3 where Graversen made 7@h|pg||
nt|thorvald: West should perhaps have bid 2@c planning to bid @spades or double next time|pg||
nt|stigw: All pushes until now, but sure som swings are going to come.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  in the other room, north passed, east bid 1S, and soth overcalled 3C|pg||
nt|henryb:  Run rate up to 8.57 after this|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  and west bid the final contract of 3 NT|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  and the defense ran the first 6 tricks - deadly defense|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fine duck, now 4 heart-tricks are for easy picking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The cases where you have a singleton honour in major may rightside NT. |pg||

nt|barbyh: not enough pitches on the diamonds|pg||

nt|stigw: Or East should have given a belated sp-support at last with songleton diamond.|pg||
nt|pelu: why not? a free jump|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  heart to the king, heart, club king hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a truly vengeful Great Shuffler would have also dealt 2 losing trump tricks|pg||

nt|thorvald: there are in fact a lot  of possibilities|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: I will leave this open room open after the last board |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and announce the Danish Open Team for the EC in Dublin as soon as I get it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  a precision opening got N-S to 6 @S in the other room |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  They havn't made it easy for the selectors that is for sure|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @C is was|pg||
nt|thorvald: Imps across is mostly about getting the most out of the weak pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: results are here: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3816.html|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|thorvald: Remember NS plays strong 2 major|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: 2@S = STRONG ----- |pg||
nt|thorvald: And 2 aces in North should be enough for slam|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: "Are you kidding me" says W after the explanation from S|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But we have also seen a couple of times that Blakset-Schaltz still have a some work to do especially when playing a fairly complicated system|pg||
nt|dkkello:  only they and Peter Lund plays like it  |pg||
nt|thorvald: They will probaly get to 6@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and here Kello talks about 2@s as strong|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And Peter Lund is starting to soften up :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: not a fairly complicated system :)|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|henrik_r:  The challenge is to choose the black suit which is 3-1 / 4-0 as trumphs|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  dont try it at home kids , dangerous |pg||
nt|thorvald: 2NT is positive, might have @Cs|pg||
nt|thorvald: 3@c would be negative|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: 2nt = 7+hcp 0-2@ss|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  But as @C and @S are 2-2 it does not really matter on this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: 3nt = Running @s suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: 4@d cuebid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|thorvald: Graversen decided not to show his @cs|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  South denies a @C control IMHO|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and the fastest claim I have seen this weekend|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not a great advertisment for strong 2's|pg||
mc|12|nt|thorvald: Graversen should have bid 4@h|pg||
pg||
qx|c24|st||md|2SAKQJT73HKDTCKJ84,S98HQ842DKJ986CA7,S52HAT75DA5CQT653,S64HJ963DQ7432C92|sv|o|nt|sommer: defending IS difficult!|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and it's so easy for us, seing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure EW know that N has the 6+@d hand|pg||
nt|stigw: Should be a pick-up for N/S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  may make it|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  ok, gotta go - a lot of good bridge today from the players, thx!|pg||
nt|thorvald: In fact North might have discouraged in @S to get the @H shift, could that be wrong ?|pg||
nt|pelu: again @d = 4+ and unball|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This should be easy for Viking relay |pg||
mb|2C|an|11-15HCP, 6!C or 5!c+ 4ma|nt|oleberg:  If that double of 2@C threw them overboard, I'll vomit|pg||
nt|bensby2: but interesting if they are able to play the next games on a normal level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand      will east west get too high|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I think Hagen is right not to bid 1nt opposite a partner who passed as opener|pg||
nt|sommer: good preempt!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another weak nt|pg||
nt|stigw: Normal result, and I guess no or only small swing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Goulash allright|pg||
nt|thorvald: 5@d looks Ok to me|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D making, but almost impossible to bid|pg||
nt|stigw: 5 diamonds is a lucky make here, but can they reach that high ?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Question for kibz and commentators: If you can see the NS hands, but not EW, would you prefer 6@S of 6@C|pg||
nt|skaftij:  They just need to discover if there is a @C ruff in 6@s or vice versa|pg||
nt|skaftij:  :-)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|oleberg:  2@H = sound raise in spades|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Normally only 3-cards|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 10 tricks in the minors|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the ostot convention|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But maybe there was some disagreement about about the 2@D-bid|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now why will @dace not be led ....?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Because that is the dilemma South will face in a few bidding-rounds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@D = Relay (only invitational so far)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  must have|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4D|nt|oleberg:  But his partner opened in third hand, and the double indicates hearts will not behave|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural RDBL by passed hand opposite weak nt -- go figure|pg||
nt|stigw: I doubt, unless W goes crazy, and 3 di not enough probably.|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|oleberg:  2@H = hearts, nothing about strenght so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Roland, I do not see how to make 4@s. Perhaps I am blind|pg||
nt|oleberg:  damn, I agree :(|pg||
nt|thorvald: She should double to show 3-6-1-3 and 15-17 hcp|pg||
nt|thorvald: But probably afraid that it would show 4-card spades|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Did west maybe double 2@D|pg||
nt|oleberg:  ?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Did East really bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: he did :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  North may be unsure what is trumfs|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He has no immidiate problem, but if partner asks for the queen, he'll have to decide|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|henrik_r:  What ?!? Get into the fight Ole ;)|pg||
nt|sommer: I agree, N might have seen, a @Hshift could be needed|pg||
nt|thorvald: Perhaps Lars Should have played @S9 to show interest in @Hs at the previous board as suggested by Knut (his older brother)|pg||
nt|stigw: I dont like that rdbl as nat, but probably it wont mean anything here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  three top losers, but no way to get to 10 winners|pg||
nt|stigw: Come-back for 2 + 5 in deal 5, when 4 sp was defeated in the other room (well deserved)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Yes defeated on a @s lead|pg||
nt|stigw: Better rdbl this time.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Askgaard DBL was just showing strength|pg||
nt|stigw: The terrible thing now is, that East should be forced to bid after her previous rdbl.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Michael thinking about bidding???|pg||
nt|stigw: Well, now maybe|pg||
nt|thorvald: At Board 4 Lars Blakset Doubled and ended up in 4@s making|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT = max opening and @c-stop - now Askgaard dont like his @h-holding|pg||
nt|stigw: How do you like it partner, and the void in H talks against.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|sommer: 3@D is Rubensohl, transfer to @H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe it was Lund-Madsen who was thinking|pg||
nt|stigw: I dont think that Al, but Christina LM.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I am on the wrong side of the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Which by no means guarantie I wouldn't have done it|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Why?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Oh|pg||
nt|skaftij:  nope @h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: needs to run J@C early|pg||
nt|dkkello:  with strong club you might find a @S contract |pg||
nt|pelu: as I exp the S hand was too strong for 2@S jump|pg||
nt|stigw: He did it, wd - now it only remains to bring it home.|pg||
nt|thorvald: A @c lead and al looks bright, a @H and there are work to do|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: nice scramble by NS |pg||
nt|stigw: She overcome her doubt wisely enough, but doesnt get the role of a hero.|pg||
nt|pelu: but Stig - the 4@D = bad @H-stop - so that improved E's hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This may take  some time|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: time isn't an issue - 60 min left with 5 more boards to go (including this)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No obvious line|pg||
nt|thorvald: A ruffing finess in @cs looks like a plan to me|pg||
nt|stigw: The first swing came in deal 4, where N/S missed 4 sp here, bid bu Lars & Martin in the other room.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hagen may have seen this, but also knew it wouldnt matter. He holds both kings, and doesnt need the queen|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Last board -- and thx to all the commentators |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Maybe he felt he had already bid his values|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and all spectators |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Noth should have advanced I think|pg||
nt|thorvald: Im informed that 3@c would be som checkback stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  and E-V almost close the match for a tie , almost but think they will still win the tournament|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  And to the operators, who have done a great job as usual|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Except hustling the commentators for cokes|pg||
nt|prinsib:  Hopefully DBf will decide to use BBO much more ... after kibitzing bridge like this!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Who did such a thing ??:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|pelu:  S could pass the D - then RD from N = @DA and now 4@h by S|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzcp: and principle of fast arrival |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hustling you is not really hustling, more like "picking up"|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I didn't loose any cokes|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Then they didn't "pick up"|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I originate from Jutland, so I know a hustler when I see one|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Ahem|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I lost 3 or 4 I think  :(  as always|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  QED|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Its easy to avoid for you Kello. Simply never bet. On anything.|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: I will leave this table open|pg||
mc|9|nt|thorvald: I think its important to understand that the 4 players have played very well, but as all of us sometimes the system it selv gives bad results |pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and after a short break I will announce the Danish Open Team|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: TD is now announcing his decision about the 3@d DBL bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  allowed .. :)  ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and TD asks if NE have observed a break in tempo after the second pass from s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: TD says that W might (by asking about the N hand) have a problem --- but the decision by TD is that PASS is a logical alternative|pg||
nt|pelu:  if the sceen-mate is the first to claim break of tempo, then TD sh close the case = no case|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: I thought that was what I heard --- so TD decides 3@d undoubled minus 3|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I agree with Peter, but I do not think that the rule is iron-clad|pg||
nt|jron: another wrong ruling....|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: I have corrected the result now|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: I am quiet sure that there will be no appeal|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  That might be, but I would appeal as NS. (1) West is not the one supposed to call and (2) I disagree strongly with pass being a logical alternative|pg||
nt|pelu:  I have 5 spect: all say: wrong decision|pg||
nt|dkkello:  add one more |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Now Peter Schaltz and the danish captain Nils Mønsted is in the room|pg||
nt|jron: I do not think D from N is so obvious, but E has to address the problem|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think its the inital call that is wrong, No matter who called, the bridge player should see the double is ok, and do nothing more|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and now we will announce the Danish Open Team for the European Championship in Dublin|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, if NS should appeal, the "logical alternative" would (to me) be the most importent point to consider|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: And all the involved players are in this room now|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If pass is not a logical alternative, then there is, of course, no case|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Peter Schaltz now says:|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Rico Hemberg, Nils Mønsted and Lars Matiesen have decided:|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  There simply is no case because the wrong player called the TD|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: EC: Bilde-Graversen, Blakset-Schaltz, Konow-Hagen|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ok ...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, if NS admits there was a break of time, it would seem reasonable to look at it|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Mind Games: Bjarnarson-Askgaard, Bilde-Graversen, Schaltz-Blakset|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Thats that|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I was wrong and so was other  ..|pg||
nt|thorvald: Interesting|pg||
nt|dkkello:  bilde -graverseb , hagen -konow , schalt- blakset|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and the discussions about the team can now start -- but thats the decision |pg||
nt|dkkello:  ikke askgÃ¥rd-bjarnasson  , men de spiller mind games |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: EC: Bilde-Graversen, Blakset-Schaltz, Konow-Hagen|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Of course as every year there will be disagreement ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Mind Games: Bjarnarson-Askgaard, Bilde-Graversen, Schaltz-Blakset|pg||
nt|thorvald: Have all 4 pairs filed for participation in both tournaments ?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Should we try to have the same pairs for both tournaments ?|pg||

nt|stigw: I think 4 sp will be down on a di-lead overtaken by South followed by a cl-switch, so wd E/W.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember -- official results are actually cross-imps for all 5 tables, but BBO just knows about the 2 vugraph rooms|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not even for grand, if partner has three aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Come on, 4@C|pg||
nt|thorvald: Needing to strip clubs, play a @s to the king and endplaying west, not the best plan|pg||
nt|thorvald: Men du har nok ret i at efter indmelding på 1-trinnet er det oftere 5 farve, hvorimod indmelding på 2 trinnet fulgt af dobling oftere er 6-3-3-1|pg||
nt|thorvald: Sry, private chat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we know that 1@H is NOT  12-14 5@H bal|pg||
nt|pelu: we have a direct match here - the 2 NS pairs are candidate for the 3. place on national team|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+|mb|1D|nt|sommer: no, again it's double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: i like 6@D better than 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Well, a diffence of opinions :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|skaftij:  What if 5@h was @H Ace + King?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Dangorous to uÃ¥grade such a hand, but 2@C = 10-15 simply sucks to much|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It wasn't|pg||
nt|oleberg:  he had the @HK and the @CK|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: assume west PASS = forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  maybe he'll get to 6 and redouble for a gain of 12? :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  this table 5 boards ahead  ..  |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes he had both Kings as you said|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So he could be certain to both get the information he wanted, and torture partner in the proces|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And I know he finds that just a little funny|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|oleberg:  Whar about you guys, facing a passed hand, wouldn't you at least give it 3@C?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I would do something as North|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 1/2 @C  |pg||
nt|bensby2: at least 3cl|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now EW has all the room they need, to unearth the bad spade suit. And they will. (I'll bet you a box of Mars-Icecream bars.)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @H  must be a new gadget   ..    (se board 2 )|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I'm sure Konow will firgive|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|henryb:  needed run rate is 11, so 12 needed to start the move|pg||
nt|stigw: Al is right about the scoring, so we dont have any complete picture of who has done weel or bad, even if 1 of the teams here at these 2 tables wins comfortabely.|pg||
nt|stigw: How can you know (and say) that pelu ?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He will. He will probably not even notice Hagen enjoyed it,|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Mathias  are looking foreward to a Leffe after this session |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  a good reason to play 2/1|pg||
nt|duschek: A quiet board here - I like having a slow start :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  We are not taking that bet. We know you have no ice cream bars|pg||
mb|5C|nt|henryb:  good brain we share|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 3@s to show real support|pg||
nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and that you are a hustler|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, I could never lose, so whats the problem?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hustler? What?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It takes one to know one...|pg||
nt|pelu: only that I have heard - do u have other informations?|pg||
nt|stigw: No, I only wondered and therefore asked, thats all.|pg||
mb|d|nt|bensby2: 3nt is a better contract - this one can be down 1|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But he is the kind and forgiving type.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  splinter in support of hearts|pg||
nt|stigw: This sint as bad as it might look. Only 1 down I guess.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This should drift off by a trick or two|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Laydown in 5, so lets just go on.|pg||
nt|pelu: ok - Auken-Christiansen not in the run - so only 4 pairs left|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW did well to catch NS|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Unilateral offer, and a good one|pg||
pc|sA|nt|skaftij:  Need find @hQ in 2@h to make|pg||
nt|skaftij:  DD, best for East to win 4th @c and lead low @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: N: (commentating on S's writing) you should have been a boy. - S: No, because then we couldn't play Ladies Pairs :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  South misses out. Why didn't he bid 2@C somewhere along the line|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oleberg:  And a slow continuation|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West really has no clue what to lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oleberg:  :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Schaltz-Blakset a nwe pair - but working hard with system - Bilde-Graversen dont play next year - to in my opinion a close race|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bensby2: not any more|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: down 2 in the picture|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|stigw: Yes, but if only 1 down doubled in a contract thet might have potential to make, its no big deal Al.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to south, frozen @D suit|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @h was best|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|stigw: Might have made 6 without that switch.|pg||
nt|stigw: Might be 2 down yes.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|skaftij:  anything but @d|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|thorvald: Dont know :-)|pg||
nt|pelu: correction: I have just been told that Graversen- Bilde also play next year - sorry :(:(|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No way could he get pd to bid 5@c|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb:  when do you want N to bid 4@c. Over 3@s I think 4@c is 6-5 or more in the minors|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|dkkello:  when 2 great players plays together system not that important  I guess ?|pg||
nt|bensby2: important not to play spades to the king first time - but to the 9|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Again Rasmussen showed better judgement than the commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: short break|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  She passed and only careful play by declarer prevented a game swing|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|stigw: Q is best I think.|pg||
mc|9|nt|oleberg:  And his opponets have bid a confident 4@H in the face of his strong 1@C opening, and he has little defence|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: this is the last 14 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Welcome to Kello and Jacob Røn and ... and ... |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jron: hi everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dkkello:  and to be honest , theese 2 pairs are in direct contention for the final spot on the national team imho|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and a nice board to start the match|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Hi all|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|vugraphzcp: a grand slam -- will they bid it?|pg||
nt|jron: a well placed preempt in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Hi and welcome Henrik|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  7@H laydown, but 7@S in West can be defeated if North leads @H|pg||
nt|jron: a lot more difficult especially if S jumps to 5@c|pg||
mb|5C|nt|henryb:  wouldn't 7N be the best contract?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  North certainly put the pedal to the metal with 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Hi Henry -- and welcome -- it seems 7nt is best :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: but we are not there yet|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jron: Difficult to have the right agreementsfor a newlyfound partnership when you havent found fit yet|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jron: 5@h probably should be Forcing for a round but is undiscussed by most pairs|pg||
nt|henryb:  Quesstion, I think, is what are the right agreements. Should East really be doubling 3@c, even if that shows extra values?|pg||
nt|jron: Dbl is strictly T/O for EW so that seems reasonable|pg||
nt|henryb:  If X of 3@c shows extras, and creates a force at the five level -- I think it should -- should W be doubling 5@c?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  I do not think so|pg||

nt|ahollan1: frozen suit = whichever side leads the suit, takes 1 less trick than if opponent breaks the suit|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry I have to go - see u later|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So not that farfetched|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: S asks if W would have bid 4@h himself  without 4@c bid - answer: No|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: east will open |pg||
nt|oleberg:  It will be with 2@C then|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I disagree with the good-judgement. 3@C might easily have gotten EW to 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|henryb:  15.2 imps per board needed|pg||
nt|stigw: Interesting board this one - what is East's opening ?|pg||
nt|ady: as you said  |pg||
nt|oleberg:  And 3!X (which would never happen) is only -300|pg||
nt|sommer: a minor partial is max here..3@D NS, best?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: has to be 2 clubs  playing strong club|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West is opening a bottle of valium :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S  not 12-14, 5@S, bal  [open 2@S]|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thanks Peter, |pg||
mb|2H|nt|henrik_r:  Agree. I still think passing and giving the opponents a free run is loosing in the long run|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It is always said, that you should preempt less against bad opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|skaftij:  Easy 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  But we both know careless declarers who would start with a @S to the king and go down in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But somehow people are less inclined to accept the corrollary: You should preempt more against good opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: different aproach in the 2 rooms - and very different contracts :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Laydown in 6 even with both mi-K's wrong, but we'll see.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC mentions  "Bekkasin"   is that the 2N response structure??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Yes, 3nt is 1@h and values|pg||
mb|4C|an|cuebid|nt|stigw: And from now anything can happen.|pg||
nt|duschek: South doubles to get all three suits into the picture - better than 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: could be a swing here   3NT looks difficult|pg||
nt|dkkello:  4 @H not down yet   |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  When playing at toplevel they all think they are better than the opponents ;)|pg||
nt|thorvald: You should not open 2@h with 5-card @s - EW getting as deserved in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|skaftij:  Same bidding as in other room, same meaning of 1NT and 2@d|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1NT = GF|pg||
nt|stigw: 9 and 10 are hopeful for N/S here, the rest doesnt leave much room for them.|pg||
nt|stigw: Wth wrong gesses all around W might go down after this lead.|pg||
nt|stigw: But he really shouldnt go down, starting by playing sp, and later on finessing the H K.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Can hardly miss the grand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: @d9 is missing:)|pg||
mb|5D|an|3 aces|nt|sommer: 2@H is very close, but with 4c in W it may go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Schaltz has left the table...|pg||
nt|thorvald: A much more friendly lead at the other table|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Incidently, 4@H is probably down on the previous hand. Not enough tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Apparently N-S in this room play something resembling ACOL, so after 1@s-2@d-2@h north had no forcing bid in spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wow|pg||
nt|bensby2: interesting lead|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3nt seems unbeatable|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well a preempt might have made declarer more prone to play a spade to the king (But that is circumstansial, in my opinion)|pg||
nt|bensby2: but nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: S: What is 3@D? -- W: A bid...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will take some time but making in the end |pg||
nt|oleberg:  I can't see lead?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow is declarer so this will take quite some time|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No lead yet...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Ok thx, just Bensby rambling...|pg||
nt|sommer: I think Martin has to finesse @H8 to make, or?|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@C = Nat or 15-19 NT, 1@S = 0-5 or 6+ with @Ds, 1NT=15-15, 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2 @H-loosers and one in each other suit, seems ok to me|pg||
nt|skaftij:  It does place declarer at disadvantage. He'd like to play on @s before minors attacked|pg||
mb|5S!|an|asking for Q|nt|henryb:  12 unless he goes 4 down|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I bet my money on the defense|pg||
nt|smoller:  the 9th trick|pg||
nt|stigw: Lokks difficult to make with right defence, but ...?|pg||
nt|duschek: 9 tricks now - 2 spades, 1 heart, 2 clubs, 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I bet against Kello|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead   better|pg||
nt|duschek: Very difficult lead though - dummy will likely hold the major suits, and declarer has announced club stoppers|pg||
nt|stigw: Now it looks better.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  always always lead a @H  they thought us last summer |pg||
nt|stigw: I thought it was in the South hand.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  k @C after all , this is rama|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  South does not have an easy hand to lead from|pg||
nt|dkkello:  very nice , but ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Who has a nice butt?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The lead is not that far-fetched or rama-influenced|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Just helps speed things up :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  5@S must ask for the @HQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|bensby2: Berg - I was already know she was leading the king of club - before she did :)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, I see now|pg||
mb|6D|an|Q and !DK|mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Expensive @C10|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If partner has the @CQ, it will often work out, and if opponents has, the bare queen will work, but not the bare ace|pg||
nt|oleberg:  @@Bensby: How was I to know you knew?|pg||
nt|stigw: Sp and sp again might give problems, but ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a play after @S @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 4@h was a @c-cuebid|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ahollan1: i should leave play/defense analysis to Stig|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  taught  , sorry|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4@SX from board 22 was duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: bye for now - back again in 54 min|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  With hearts 4-0 it needs a little handling, but going down is very remote|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The lead og the @S10 might cause some trouble, taking out a communication early|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: played the other way up in open room on a diamond lead   but later east switched to K@S  so same 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Must not start by cashing H Ace this time, even if that could have beeen the right thing to do with another lay-out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  9 of @D   course of Scotland  :)  or am I crazy |pg||
nt|thorvald: A kibz suggest just ruffing 2 @Cs would even make it easier|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now he'll lead a club, thinking partner to be void|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzcq: sorry - only 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|stigw: The H finesse was the rescue after to times sp. Now ypu just take 3 H from top and cross-ruff.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I have to wake up|pg||
nt|skaftij:  He was on lead himself|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  like let him ruff a heart?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The lead had attitude in it|pg||
mc|13|nt|bensby2: but N hope that she can force S to shift to spades and that will be enough|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Maybe hoping to induce error|pg||
nt|oleberg:  This is so macho: Doubling 7@H and finding the lead that might beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: E: Did you double because of the many bids or because you have seen me play :) ?|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jron: Yes if forcing. Otherwise a jump to 6@h seems fair as well|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henrik_r:  If 5@H is forcing then yes|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  If double is the all purpose bid over 3@c, when does East bid something else?|pg||
nt|jron: Opps dont bid 5@c vulnerable on a 9-card fit so you shouldnt worry about two small clubs in partners hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  Without 4 card spade support of 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|thorvald: The Double of 5@c at board 26 looks wrong to me|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the bottom line.. Blakset- Schaltz is a new partnership    |pg||
nt|dkkello:  they have 3 x times the point nr. 2 has in this little tournament  |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and bottom line: great bidding by NS - and many EW pairs would have been in deep problems after that interference|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the will announce the national team today I been told , exciting |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and -- have you and your partner agreements about 5@h being forcing or not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Danish Open Team will be announced here after last board|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|luffe12:  what are your farvourite pick, then?|pg||

nt|ady: looks destined for 4@S|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  What would you do as South after 1@S?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  6@H is on, but on a finesse of the opening hand. Interesting|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Double or 2@h ?|pg||
nt|stigw: What was the dispute Torsten, do you know ?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A very speciel sort og lightner-double, with the meaning: Commentators wake up, I'm going to make a good play|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: what do you think about the @H lead after the splinter ??|pg||
nt|thorvald: Why the TD-call ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Andy, that has been safe for some time|pg||
nt|henryb:  How many times has Auken won it|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: the director has been called to the table by Kofoed.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Jens (Auken) and Steen (Moller) it is my impression have been the most successful Danes over many years|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: i don't know why, and now they just left the playing area.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  add Stig Werdelin and Peter Schaltz|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Schaltz is the one with most caps|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: and they're back..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought Werdelin was so slow that he never got to the finish of any match :)|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, 1NT-4@S, possibly via a transfer auction|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I am in the 2@H camp|pg||
nt|bensby2: 6 cl is an interesting contract here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@d weak multi|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Lol|pg||
mb|3S!|an|4!s usually not 4!h|nt|stigw: Another slam, its heating up I must say.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  :)  He is still thinking|pg||
nt|henryb:  on a hand from 1977|pg||
nt|ady: likely 10@D lead|pg||
nt|duschek: Incidentally, N/S play 1NT=15-18|pg||
nt|smoller:  This will complicate getting North as declarer|pg||
nt|ady: now maybe heart lead|pg||
nt|stigw: No swings in the boards lately, so it might end right here, or...........?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  If I double first and the opps preempt in @S then I am screwed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=a) 5+@H, 10-15 HCP  b) 4441@D, 12-15 HCP|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  16 imps x4  or so  ..  gee|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Me too. I expect opponents to bid a number of spades, and I feel comfortable doubling even 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = at least 55  and good hand in context of 10-15 hcp|pg||
nt|stigw: With this high standard it would amze me if they dont reach 6 cl, but sometimes your system might get in the way.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South thought NE took long time when East bid 3NT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would have liked to defend 3NT I suppose|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 nt N/S could be a chancy suggestion, and maybe work as a sacrifice here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: There was a break in tempo before the sleigh came back with the 3NT bid, and the question was if W was allowed to bid 4@d|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2NT must be for minors now, with longer @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|stigw: Come on Graver !!!|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Man or mouse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4 hearts  re transfer|pg||
nt|thorvald: Board 8 also a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  he showed a limit raise, apparently|pg||
nt|bensby2: strange slow bidding from Hagen|pg||
nt|stigw: If 4 cl is forcing with slam interest here, it would be perfect, but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Konow-Hagen got to 6@C after  1@H-1N//3@H   now that is impressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 3@h in that seq is 6@h and 5@c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@s = 4 card suit, denies other major|pg||
nt|oleberg:  How did it make? I don't see 13 tricks in plain wiew?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Draw trumps|pg||
nt|skaftij:  good line I would say|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Oh, i still cant count|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stigw: Or rat ?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The treatment of bidding 3@s has gained some popularity|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henrik_r:  Allthough a little timed I think Hagens 2@S is OK with flat distribution and two queens|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Maybe it is actually 6@D that is the right spot|pg||
nt|stigw: Still, after perhaps 3 H follwed by 4 Cl from South the way should be clear.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well if 3@H = specifically 6@H 5@C   that's just cheating [heavy sarcasm] :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Bu 4 H ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perfect if  6511|pg||
nt|stigw: Can South be sure of a di-control I wonder ?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Will Michael bid 3@s?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|duschek: Most players agree that 2@S by North would confirm 3-card support. I like to play that it shows a minimum too, redoubling with 3-card support and a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy -- if only we knew the inferences available to Bjarnarson|pg||
nt|skaftij:  or fox|pg||
nt|stigw: Only 9 & 10, and perhaps this one, can save N/S at this table I guess.|pg||
nt|thorvald: And on board 9 EW bid the marginal game|pg||
nt|stigw: So 9 probably + for N/S.|pg||
nt|thorvald: and made it :-)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|skaftij:  He will put up the Q|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, very well done by Konow-Hagen in the open room on 9, lets see about 10 then.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: still led 10@D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Denamrk has a close call between 3 or 4 pairs , who should represent Denmark  ,if also Mathias Bruun and Knut Blakset would play it wolud be even closer  ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Most troublesome vs 5@D is the natural spade-lead, but I play a low heart from dummy|pg||
nt|oleberg:  vs 6@D i meant|pg||
nt|bensby2: the are all winning 6cl, 6dia and 6H|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  A little timed by South only to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|oleberg:  As a kibz have pointed out, 6@H is in trouble|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Only one communication in North, and you need to get there twice|pg||
nt|stigw: He felt sure I can see, wd boys.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|skaftij:  Nope|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|thorvald: NS will loose an imp here 9 or 10 tricks are equal|pg||
nt|stigw: This could go down now after the wrong H guess. No, good duck actually once you did it wrong in the first place.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The idÃ©e is not to reveal to much about openers hand, and to remove easy lead-directibg doubles and overcalls (that are possible when you use ordinay stayman)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|stigw: One of dummys cl will go away on the sp.|pg||
nt|thorvald: he needs a spade-trick to ditch a @c so if east have @HK he probably dont have AK of @Ss|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|stigw: Right Thorval, but he couldnt be sure of the H K. Had he taken the first H with the ace he would probably have been down.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|skaftij:  Now that that you mention it, sometimes I could chop my fingers off when I have made a silly comment|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stigw: No swing  here either I guess - yes, an imp.|pg||
nt|duschek: Makes no difference on the lie of the cards, though - always 11 tricks unless declarer finesses spades|pg||
nt|ady: knowing of likely shortage of hearts in south hand   tried for different defense|pg||
nt|bensby2: you can just duck a diamond and throw to clubs on the diamonds|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stigw: One way or another it would have been an imp.|pg||
nt|duschek: Ah, now it does make a difference. West hoped for a singleton diamond when partner did not respect the lead-directing double|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sommer: as the cards lie, there's no big difference between 1NT and 2@S..guess, NS had a chance to score 1 imp|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|skaftij:  Biting your tongue off is of no use|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|nt|dkkello:  + 1|pg||
nt|oleberg:  How do you both get to dummy to finesse hearts and cash diamonds?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|vugraphzbg: Hagen asked to se Schou's hand.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bensby2: you are right - impossible|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And probably both more painfull and handicapping|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Going back to 26, I think the right approach for W over 5@c is to pass and pull partner's double to 5@h|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jron: Of course W could have played the @sJ at first, because then there wouldnt have been a endplay|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jron: W is probably still annoyed with board 26|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  this, at least the way I play, is stronger than a direct 5@h|pg||

nt|duschek: Thank you|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: Next match in 20 min.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  A strange thing to play bridge very early in the morning and very late in the evening  |pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: after the last board open room will stay open till the Danish team has been announced|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  4@H has some play, but do not think they will get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: after this board I will reenter board 26 to get the right play and claim|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hard to stay out of 3NT|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Didn't west miss a chance too, he should have ruffed the third diamond and played a spade, guaranteeing the set?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@D is a sound raise, with three-card-support|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Last oard, we start again 20.40|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 15 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: (11)12-14, 5@S, balanced|pg||
nt|thorvald: EW went overboard at the other table|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: old days  a passe out|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I prefer to play Dbl here as T/O of @H|pg||
nt|bensby2: they will be in 4|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Seems NS do the same|pg||
nt|stigw: This one doesnt look good for N/S here, but maybe a push after all (game is not a "wild stab", but will go down).|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 3@c = "mixed raise" - 4@c = competitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  hopefully more acton then  :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  action|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I prefer not bidding pass (ever) on a 6-diamonds-4-spades hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: With a double from Askgaard now, its difficult for Gregers Bjarnason to stay low (or pass).|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3816.html for results after round 8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stigw: Again the 2 Ma-opening with 12-14 in a 5-3-3-2 hand.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I was told  .|pg||
pc|c3|nt|duschek: E/W play 1NT=14-16 in 3rd/4th seat, so 1@D could be 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I agree, lol. We start 10.00 tomorrow:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  they could not have heard me this weekend|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|dkkello:  Thks Soeren , well done job :)  thks specs. see you  .. :)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: thx all, se you tomorrow|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The only leads that let East make are @H and @D|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If double is takeout of hearts, I double|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|stigw: Yes, nothing much to say about that.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dkkello:  whatever, they will end up in 3 @D  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  the main reason is that when opps bid in next hand is in a good position to DBL  |pg||
nt|stigw: opeless to make 2 nt I think, so probably no swing here.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oleberg:  Still, South must rise with the @HA and play a club|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  @@Berg: Agree even if I do not play equal level conversion|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The return of the @S4 couls indicate that|pg||
nt|thorvald: At Board 7 NS stole the contract, but mercifully undoubled and only loosing 7imps|pg||
nt|stigw: Board 10 was a gain for N/S here, as Hagen-Konow took 200 against 4 H (instead of bidding and maybe/maybe not winning 5 di).|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: North gave preference  knowing hearts could be 3 card suit   south having bid clubs earlier|pg||
nt|duschek: Konow might have held a doubleton diamond, but not after the opponents have supported clubs|pg||
nt|ady: looks destined for a push|pg||
nt|stigw: It levels all out.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: in normal room  1@S-P-P-DBL//P-2@C-P-??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or will North be able to balance with 1N?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but still I dont know about this opening .. ?!  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: retract that question -- forgot about @SQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  Chicago|pg||
nt|henryb:  start April 27, I think|pg||
nt|duschek: Hagen expects, or should expect, Konow to hold a 3442 or 3433 distribution|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stigw: Unmakeable, but OK to end up there.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  @@Henrik: Do you also agree, that orth holds 6 diamonds? :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  No|pg||
nt|oleberg:  No reason for South not to trust the @S4|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow could have made it harder on South by leading the @HJ looking like a man about to finesse the @HQ|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If partner has the @CA, it is down|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Konow cannot look like a man |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Ok "bewildered boy" then|pg||
nt|stigw: Perhaps if N continues Di now, W can be squeezed ?|pg||
nt|stigw: He did, what now ?|pg||
nt|stigw: Should perhaps have been covered, but still 1 down I think at least.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't think any chance he can make it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  right now 12 teams entered|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sommer: with a @H finesse, S can now escape one off ..but 300 were possible against a no-chance 4@S|pg||

pc|c2|nt|henryb:  yes; CDT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stigw: No, none whatsoever, 2 down now if South rises and play H.|pg||

nt|sommer: well done, Torsten|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, yet another push, but OK.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|skaftij:  When 1@d is unbalanced, I don't like 1NT being this sort of hand. I think a weak 2@d raise is better, even if it can be on a 4-3 fit |pg||
mc|6|nt|skaftij:  But that is systematic|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Discarding spades from both hands = "Play spades motherfuckers, I'll guess them" :)|pg||
