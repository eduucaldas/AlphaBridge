nt|paulg:  As a commentator I have to be even more circumspect than normal ...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|paulg:  not only was Sam Punch on my Vanderbilt team this year and most of my Spingold teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  her boyfriend is in the audience|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I was telly Betty Kelly's son how to access BBO on Twitter earlier today|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg:  so probably down two but this aggressive bidding is typical of all the Irish teams in the Home Internationals|pg||
nt|paulg:  For those who have never operated a BBO vugraph, it is not the easiest job in the world especially in the Camrose|pg||
mc|8|nt|paulg:  Even though they are playing with screens they play very quickly and often fail to show the operator their cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  although, to be fair, very few people accuse Sam Punch of playing too quickly, but Liz McGowan tries to make up for it|pg||
