nt|jron: her vælger Blakset at gardere sig mod hjerterforfremmelse til Syd, for Nord kan ikke have en singleton, når han ikke spillede den ud|pg||
nt|jron: Udmærket at lægge @c9, så Syd ikke kender fordelingen af klørfarven. Nu kan Nord have 87 blanke|pg||
nt|tias: Ja, det virker som en rimelig spilleplan. Eneste alternativ er vel op på esset, @s E og @s mod B?|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Monsted will have nightmares for weeks to come|pg||
mb|2D|an|multi|mb|d|an|12-16 bal or 17+|nt|thorvald: here is a chance for a small pick-up for Schou|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South can make 3 N here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and even N with a heart guess|pg||
mb|2H|an|corr|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w may reach 4 spades    but  may go down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a very quiet 4 @S for 420|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Hi David|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ady: hi Kjeld|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Hi Stig|pg||
nt|oleberg:  east has now shown 17+ with an unbalanced hand and 5+ spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot; you might really want the heart to be led up to, rather than through|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: given the double that's right.  Without it, it's just random|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: The Multi coulndt knock E/W out this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 @S not veru optimistic bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  very|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead can make|pg||
pc|c5|nt|oleberg:  7hcp, one probably useless and a flat distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Splendid bidding E/W in my eyes.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: well, you don't know partner has only @HAx - if he has @HAxx or @Hxx, clearly your hand is better-off declaring|pg||
nt|athene: @HAxx or @HKxx sorry|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Surpriding lead - with doubleton in pdÂ´s suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  South was a junior once , won the European title in 1970 http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=9046|pg||
nt|stigw: Might go down after this tantalizing lead.|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should go down  unless south takes first diamond  if east plays a spade to ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The way to make this one, would have been to take it in hand, and lead a diamond. But it is far from certain this would have been the best plan|pg||
nt|stigw: If declarer in the end could get timae to throw h loser on diamonds it makes, but....|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|oleberg:  Its to late now, but we are many that will look forward to telleing Hagen, that he made a mistake at the very first trick of the tournament|pg||

pc|hK|nt|athene: if partner does have @Hxx then you want to play it since west might be underleading @HAKxx(x) but east won't, i suppose|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: "KUN en 5-farve makker -- det er altså ikke nok til en 4@s" siger Vest efter spillet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Swahili?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Jeg vil gerne anmode om at vi forsøge på engelsk fra nu af |pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|tias: Yes. a lot of specs pointed out that askgaards H-L in trumps might be showing length, but i think Jron is right that its a trumpecho|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller:  det gÃ¦lder om at undgÃ¥ 6K|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: I hope its ok with you all :)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jron: awoiding 6@c is the target|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jron: 2@s is a relay asking for distribution w 18+ hcp|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|tias: exciting to see if this relatively new partnership will find the right slam|pg||
nt|jron: 3@c showing several distributions|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|jron: and if Schaltz remembers correctly 3N showing 3334|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: W explains 3nt as 3235|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  At the other table Konow - Hagen play relay precision and relayed to 6@D|pg||
nt|bensby2: It will be tough for west to avoid 6cl|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|mb|4N!|nt|vugraphzcp: 4@s explained as 5 controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|jron: according to my old notes East has shown 3235 w 3 NT and 5 ctrs w 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|jron: 4N asks; 5@c denies ctr in clubs (longest suit)|pg||
nt|tias: that should keep them out of 6C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: " I am planning the play now" -- "I am considering different contracts" says W to S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Not very loud -- but I have good ears :)|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jron: Eats correct response over 2@s is 3@d showing 3334-distribution, but W avoided trouble anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: and the 6@d bid made S laugh :)|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Started as we hoped!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Jesper!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1520 - no swing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fourth best in your longest?|pg||
nt|ady: diamond  play before 2nd trump might have worked    south has to avoid an error|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: N: Nice lead pd|pg||
nt|stigw: Very difficult to reach the lay-down 3 nt here after the multi-start.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oleberg:  If EW gets the hand to themselves, and East opens 1@C, West will have shown 6-6 with his second bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  6 @D looks right here  |pg||
nt|stigw: In the previous I mean.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   or 6NT     e/w     must avoid 4-4 club fit at slam level|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - my screen was dirty...|pg||
mb|2S|an|1/2 minors|nt|stigw: Should end up in 6 NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  thank god he doesnt have 7-6 then|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: They are safe to the 5-level, so west will survive investigation of slam.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In the other room West bid only 4 @S in this situation|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  do they have any tools to help them investigate safely below game?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|Splint, both minors|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|othered1: What is 4@D?  Once there was a general rule not to m ake your first cue-bid in a void, but it may not have considered 6-6 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  It shows 6-6 according to Ole ;)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @D is probably not a cue bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if specifically shortage, t hen it's fine, I guess, even if it's in partner's known long suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Only with @S7; if he had @S6 instead he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Very accurate system :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I have a known 10-card fit, I cuebid my shortness even in partners suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Isn't he short in clubs also?|pg||
mb|4D|an|nat|nt|oleberg:  I feel confident they wont end up in clubs. West only has to look at his own hand, to see it can never be right|pg||
nt|ady: good point     communication problem in 6NT  on spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|an|cue|mb|p|nt|othered1: I'm told they use 3N to start cue-bidding of  high card values|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But partner does not know it is a 10-card fit?!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Well, he is infinitely longer in clubs than diamonds...|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Anyway, very tough problem|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  And sure easts hand could be more suitable for slam|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Doesn't matter. If I know of 10 trumphs, I do it|pg||
nt|stigw: No Ady, 1 superflous trick makes it easy.|pg||
mb|5H|an|2/5 no !dQ|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|ady: sorry    still 12 tricks   only need 2 heart tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  east-vest trying to make it to the national team , who will be decided sunday after this tournament|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Which is also the superflous trick, that makes 6@D easy (on a spade lead)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stigw: OK, even if 6 nt best, but East are afraid of a H-lesd in 6 nt. |pg||

mb|d|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  1@C = Natural or 15-19 bal|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|tias: but the fact that East could deny @cs was enough to get them to the right contract|pg||
nt|jron: West could have pinpointed the ctrs if he wanted to. Probably didnt because it is a new partnership and the takes som practice to remember|pg||
nt|jron: 1@d shows @hs|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzcp: 1@s denies 4@s, denies 3+@hs with a minimum --|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: As cards lie, looks better for east to play 3N, as @D lead from north seems best for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  this lead may hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Depends whether North has the 7 or 9|pg||
