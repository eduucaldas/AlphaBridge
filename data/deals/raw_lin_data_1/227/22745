pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to beat 3, I think, but more difficult to find 10 tricks for Declarer|pg||
nt|clinch: Strange that W evaluated the earlier hand as a weak 2 and this one as a game acceptance|pg||
nt|oliverc: especially when partner a passed hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzbz: dummy is the correct to say....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with the other 2 suits patsy Meehan would double 1@H|pg||
nt|greerm: should be penalty but not sure if strong enough for either penalty or takeout|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|an|Weak|nt|yo_yo: Notice that Greenwood rebids NT with a singleton,  do you like that?|pg||
nt|dburn: several flaws for a weak two bid, but being in third seat cancels most of them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|greerm: I think all right when by agreement, persoa|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|greerm: personally, nty|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodvenn: probably xyz|pg||
nt|dburn: aggressive sort of lead - unlikely to be any real need to attack like that, but maybe unlucky to find it blowing a trick|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: xyz yes.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@d forcing to game artificial|pg||
nt|snorre: A passed 2@d GF in closed room?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pbmarstr: Maybe xyz zzzz!?!?!?!? at the other table too?|pg||
nt|greerm: this should make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|greerm: @C finesse or, more likely A, K and another both lead to home|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d6|pc|s6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Greenwood will be afraid the @C finesse will fail and they run lots of @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: is there a case for cashing A & K?|pg||
nt|greerm: the @H run less dangerous with 2 discards, so I think finesse next|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: still, wasn't the setting trick, so no vast damage done|pg||

nt|athene:  she threw south in with the heart hoping she had to lead away from it|pg||
nt|athene:  but that was never going to work - south was a passed hand and already turned up with 10 hcp|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|athene:  so playing ace and another club would be better|pg||
nt|athene:  north can win the king and then has to give declarer access to dummy|pg||
nt|athene:  so the fourth heart goes away|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|oliverc: 3NT not as good as 4@H, for sure|pg||
nt|clinch: 3NT looks a better contract than 4@h here, though they made light work of the latter in the other room|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, isn't there a danger in 4@h of losing 2 @s, a @h and a @d?|pg||
nt|oliverc: true, but 3NT no cakewalk on this lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|clinch: Assuming 4th best it looks nailed on|pg||
nt|athene: well if you believe the lead was 4th best, 3nt is ok|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: knock out the @HA, and even if east wins and shifts to a spade, you rise ace and concede diamond|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: you can't duck a spade shift because the defence might return to clubs and take @C@C@H@S@D|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|s4|pg||

nt|snorre: One of our best female pairs play NS in closed room, Ingunn Uran - Siv Thoresen. A new combination|pg||
mb|1H|nt|snorre: leading Butlerranking, so 2@d was an unnormal accident. http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0124/olrudlag-1214578687.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 15 facing 10 almost always gets to 3NT nowadays, with 4@h an alternative|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|dburn: 4@h more awkward, though - could lose two spades, a trump and a diamond|pg||

nt|athene: maybe they play 2nt as 21-22|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|clinch: nope, 20-22, just wild optimism|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: perhaps a 'state of the match' bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, the state is going to be much closer shortly|pg||
nt|athene: leading @HAQ rather than @HA and small is playing north for @HJ10 rather than @HK10|pg||
nt|athene: but on restricted choice, the latter is more likely|pg||

mb|p|pc|d3|nt|dburn: ugly lead problem for North - anything could work well or horribly|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pbmarstr: 2 @H is heart or 5-7 hp, 3 cards @S|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: or|pg||
pc|dK|nt|greerm: maybe a tad agressive this time :(|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: just a tad?|pg||
nt|dburn: question of how to play hearts now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzbz: natural, or a weak sp.support.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodvenn: good lead|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Do not think it is natural to win this contract now|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i do not think it si possible|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Oh yes. Heart to Ace, club finesse, club ace, spade ruff, diamond|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|greerm: looks like 4@D tricks plus 3 aces to E/W|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: when the ten falls under the ace, you... but if you don't cash the ace first, of course, that won't happen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whatever happened to 4th of longest and strongest|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: could be right - would be right on this deal - but not all that attractive into a 2NT opener|pg||
pc|d7|nt|greerm: some play the double of 2@H here showing a good hand with @H, others play it as a lead request|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: North just trying to defend passively|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|nt|greerm: looks like Di and Ciara have differing views, or maybe Di thought had enough anyway|pg||
nt|greerm: its certainly a good one to discuss with serious partnerships|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzww: how come both rooms play 3-3 fiton board 17?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: but seems to have abandoned the plan|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d8|pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|dburn: good recovery by Cook to leave O'Neill on play with that @h10|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|greerm: errors in defence means we et out for 1 down|pg||

pc|h4|nt|clinch: Tricky decision at trick one!|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||

mc|9|nt|clinch: In the end another IMP to Ireland|pg||
nt|oliverc: still anyone's match, though|pg||
nt|athene: yes a diamond back after the @SK would have done two things: leave declarer to lose two tricks to the @CAJx, and also start a force|pg||
nt|athene: now the defence can force in both red suits, and declarer has a lot of cards to knock out to use the club suit|pg||
