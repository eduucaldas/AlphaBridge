pc|hQ|nt|greerm: defence draw trump, then go about running side suit :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|greerm: not a safe one |pg||
nt|greerm: she knows North will bid 3@H with almost all hands with 4@H |pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: best to return a spade now, although declarer should not finesse of course|pg||

nt|vugraphzbz: dummy is the correct to say....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with the other 2 suits patsy Meehan would double 1@H|pg||
nt|greerm: should be penalty but not sure if strong enough for either penalty or takeout|pg||
mb|4S|nt|greerm: 4@H now for NS after a 2NT opening?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Notice that Greenwood rebids NT with a singleton,  do you like that?|pg||
nt|dburn: several flaws for a weak two bid, but being in third seat cancels most of them|pg||
nt|greerm: multi 2@D|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jferg: will ciara break?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|greerm: personally, nty|pg||
nt|greerm: S choices? 3NT 4@H or 4@C cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: NI can make 2@d so possible swing|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodvenn: probably xyz|pg||
nt|dburn: aggressive sort of lead - unlikely to be any real need to attack like that, but maybe unlucky to find it blowing a trick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|greerm: still a possibility of slam as far as South is concerned, |pg||
nt|jferg: hope this is a retransfer|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@D worries me hope they both know it is retransfer and not a cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: wont help Di already bid @hs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzbz: xyz yes.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@d forcing to game artificial|pg||
nt|snorre: A passed 2@d GF in closed room?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pbmarstr: Maybe xyz zzzz!?!?!?!? at the other table too?|pg||
nt|greerm: this should make|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|greerm: @C finesse or, more likely A, K and another both lead to home|pg||
pc|cT|nt|greerm: strange to retransfer to your own suit|pg||
nt|greerm: 4@H clearer for me, Ciara probably taking insurance with the 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jferg: maybe 4 hearts shows a better hand with no immediate b1st round control|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||

nt|snorre: One of our best female pairs play NS in closed room, Ingunn Uran - Siv Thoresen. A new combination|pg||
nt|phil352:  and would expect EW to compete further in @C anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: NS have been given dooley about their 2 level overcalls so Anne did not bid 2@D's :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|snorre: leading Butlerranking, so 2@d was an unnormal accident. http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0124/olrudlag-1214578687.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 15 facing 10 almost always gets to 3NT nowadays, with 4@h an alternative|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: 4@h more awkward, though - could lose two spades, a trump and a diamond|pg||
nt|eamongall: http://ladymilne.welshbridgeunion.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Lady-Milne-20122.pdf|pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil352:  the hand's not strong enough to overcall 2@D in the sandwich position|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: this is one of the flatter hands, we have seen last night and this morning, many swingy ones|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: nice to have some commentry.  was very lonely this morning :)|pg||
nt|jferg: expect 4 hearts which should go off on a dia lead|pg||
nt|greerm: 3 of these ladies have a lot of Camrose experience so we are in for a strong battle|pg||
nt|phil352:  anyway moving on to this hand...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: after 2 rounds match is here|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: Cook asking questions|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: not the time for an aggressive lead like a diamond, but @cQ is a likely contender|pg||
nt|dburn: but not any more|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: time for a sandwich then|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|snorre: Did really Fyrun pass 5@c??!!!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|weak|mb|d|nt|dburn: percentages probably favour passing this, but always a temptation to try for game vulnerable|pg||
mb|3D|nt|greerm: weak NT and our Ciara takes action |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: NI first blood when they "enjoyed" the 500 you referred to in hand 1 John|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: ugly lead problem for North - anything could work well or horribly|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pbmarstr: 2 @H is heart or 5-7 hp, 3 cards @S|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: or|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: maybe a tad agressive this time :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: @C lead anyone?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzww: just a tad?|pg||
nt|dburn: question of how to play hearts now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbz: natural, or a weak sp.support.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: good lead|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Do not think it is natural to win this contract now|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i do not think it si possible|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Oh yes. Heart to Ace, club finesse, club ace, spade ruff, diamond|pg||
nt|phil352:  EW looking to get doubled|pg||
pc|d6|nt|greerm: looks like 4@D tricks plus 3 aces to E/W|pg||
nt|greerm: heading for 4@H here which I think will make, in spite of the @D position|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzww: NI behind for 1st time in this match :(|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: when the ten falls under the ace, you... but if you don't cash the ace first, of course, that won't happen|pg||

nt|yo_yo: looks like one down to me|pg||

nt|yo_yo: good morning everyone|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|jferg: making di think ciara has it|pg||
nt|phil352:  I think E should know NS have marginal game values, or at least the majority. If you really want to bid this much you have to try 3@D or bid 2NT straight away. I prefer bailing after 3@C|pg||
nt|phil352:  generous switch|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: could be right - would be right on this deal - but not all that attractive into a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah  might make now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|greerm: some play the double of 2@H here showing a good hand with @H, others play it as a lead request|pg||
nt|greerm: i think it makes becasue defence can only get 2@D and 1@H|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: North just trying to defend passively|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|greerm: looks like Di and Ciara have differing views, or maybe Di thought had enough anyway|pg||
nt|greerm: its certainly a good one to discuss with serious partnerships|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: how come both rooms play 3-3 fiton board 17?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: but seems to have abandoned the plan|pg||

nt|ady: side suit splits bad for n/s  playing in diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: kelly will give it 3@Hs|pg||
nt|phil352:  important to just put the cards back in the board and move on|pg||
nt|phil352:  to borrow from poker, important to not go 'on tilt'|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: largely because of lots of weak no trumpers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like n/s will play in diamonds     will it be 5 or 6?|pg||
nt|eamongall: well maybe cotter will|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@D promising 1 or 2 majors, or some play possible 3@S too|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: too much wastage|pg||
nt|ady: even guessing the diamond position   just not enough tricks|pg||

nt|greerm: and now 3NT closes the auction|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|greerm: fortune favours the brave here|pg||
nt|phil352:  bd 19 NI went off in 4@S after taking club finesse the wrong way|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20 here    part score hand|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c - pass 5@c not absurd|pg||

nt|dburn: worst thing East can do is bid 4@c and then wonder what to do when 4@h comes back|pg||
nt|dburn: but of course she can't be sure that 4@h will come back - maybe 4@c will buy it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzww: O'Neill nearly opened 1@h|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: gtg  bye for now|pg||
nt|greerm: another potential for slam swings|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe 4@c will allow South to bid 4@h and give North a tough problem if East decides to save after all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|greerm: e/w playing weak NT making the rebid 1BT show a strong one|pg||

nt|greerm: 4@H would not be my choice with all those controls, but East motors on|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d5|nt|greerm: east knew partner had @HAK and @DA and @C A, and a NT rebid, must have thought about 7|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|phil352:  nice auction here|pg||

mb|p|nt|greerm: here is the result page again for running scores http://ladymilne.welshbridgeunion.info/results/|pg||

nt|yo_yo: no just making|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Burns will split the honours|pg||
nt|phil352:  but the game is too thin as long as defence can set up their clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pjs_ch:  this lets the strong hand play the hand; North has a very suitable hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I didn't put any money on the National, fortunately, since I would never have backed Neptune Collonges to finish in the first 39|pg||

mb|4N|nt|greerm: @SQ lead ?|pg||
nt|greerm: Di possibly asking behind screen about the 3D forcing or not and the 3@H bids|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  given the @SA is sitting badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzww: yes|pg||
mb|5D|nt|pjs_ch:  but South continues ??  Back to general principles, 30-31 hcp and a 4-4 fit will usually|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: S will play it|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  make 12 tricks if the opponents don't cash two - here it depends on the spade finesse|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  curious, that the start to the auction rendered the relay aspect of Puppet Stayman irrelevant :)  - well spotted, S|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  unless Val sitting West rushes to cash her ace, the contract will end one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  but cashing aces is a surprisingly effective defence against slams - most days|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: hope she leads it :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzww: it was not pretty for WBU|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  likely to be a spade partscore on this hand - with west getting to open 1@S in third seat|pg||

nt|eamongall: thats good ... we have lots of screens to be assembled at Euro championships |pg||
nt|greerm: another overtrick to NI, apparently resulting from differing NT opening strengths|pg||
nt|jferg: but 10 imps out|pg||
nt|greerm: this is a big 1@S overcall for south, will be tempting|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ady: should get out for down 1|pg||
nt|greerm: Ciara not usually shy in these positions|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: not my job.  Not included in Technical|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  probbaly 13 maybe 17 imps to NI on that last hand; still chances to even out the set|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  can't see chances to pull back 66 imps however  :(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|phil352:  normally i would advocate a trump lead here, but holding KQT is a different story|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 10 imps when NI miss the 4@S on the 6-4 fit|pg||

nt|phil352:  what do i know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  East forced herself into 3@S here by not supporting spades immediately|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks the limit for n/s if a diamond is cashed|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  1N could have been a much worse hand for spades, and she feared 2@S after 1N was an underbid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzww: cards not lying well for declarer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: this has chances if declarer gets spades right, which is likely after West's double of 2@d|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the hands fit remarkably well - only 1 hcp wasted opposite the singleton, so 3@S will probbaly survive|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are playing a Multi, so East did not have the option of opening a weak 2@d|pg||

nt|eamongall: so flat board after Sandy goes and fixes the score in other roomn |pg||
nt|vugraphzww: the Irish girls both play both hands as declarer.  No calling cards for them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: i cant fix it from here|pg||
nt|greerm: now we reach the last 2 hands already played in Open room|pg||
nt|greerm: slam on on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  two boards to go here - but these two have already been played in the other room|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  so we do have comparisons|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|greerm: but no hope of bidding it? |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  2NT = red suits|pg||
nt|ady: cant see more than 4 obvious losers in 3@C   but it went down 1 in other room|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  you can see the auction and play there from the "Other Table" tab in the "My Results" section of your display|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: put your mouse over the contract in other room to see if the bidding was the same ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C alerted , what is it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: North may balance now, and buy the contract lower than at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: or of course she may not|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  In the other room, North treated her hand as a weak two bid and 2@H was the final contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eamongall: looks on for losing at both tables now |pg||
nt|dburn: which will result in the loss of a handful of IMPs, as it probably deserved to do|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 2 times 140 .. thats about 7 imps |pg||
nt|greerm: more puppet|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yorkbeach:  East intended to raise 3@h to 4@h, which is why she is thinking of a slam|pg||
nt|greerm: 2NT anyone? a weak raise to 3S?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|greerm: no, trqansfer|pg||
nt|phil352:  if trumps are going to break 4-1, that's the split you'd like|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  here they've reached an 8-card rather than a 7-card fit with 4 top losers|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  going to expensive|pg||
nt|ady: very chance overcall  even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: Meehan tried to led out of turn!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  5@c = 0 or 3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what is going on?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  the doubling will start in a minute|pg||
nt|greerm: i'm told it is a 3 card limit raise|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: trump lead would have been better    might get home now|pg||
nt|eamongall: bet she was attempting to get a @C on the table |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: as pointed out   by kib  this switch also good enough as long as south ducks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: not sure why you would unblock the @d9 - if you're Scottish you would lead low to the nine if you wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Game forcing or 22+ bal   Punch has upgraded|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  East seems to have forgetton that she is facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  these things happen when the players are tired|pg||
pc|s8|nt|greerm: now must draw trumps else 2@D ruffs coming up|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jferg: any luck in the national greer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|greerm: when i was your age Kathleen, 3 aces and 2 kings represented a game force :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: stop going on about my age!|pg||
nt|greerm: i heard 2 horses put down|pg||
nt|jferg: saw 1 in trouble but my wagers are still running|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: thats never good :(|pg||
nt|greerm: anyone lese remember the old honour trick mehtod of hand evaluation |pg||
nt|jferg: must be nearly home in ireland by now|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  two diamond ruffs and the last diamond ditched on a top heart leaves|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: there is a hand evaluation site, i will look for it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pjs_ch:  declarer with two club losers and at worst 3 trumps to lose|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  which is a better score than 2@H got |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: well defended  part score going down in both rooms  so 4 imps for northern Ireland|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|greerm: looking good for declarer but the @S 9 is growing|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s6|nt|dburn: still, declarer can now run the eight - not in the Dictionary of Suit Combinations, but a play with a certain charm nonetheless|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  on to the next board|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  about 7 minutes left for the round|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: not a word was said :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the mark of players with a professional attitude|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set     thx all   thx kibs|pg||
nt|ady: thx Sandie|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: last board|pg||
nt|greerm: 90 to 73, a proper Irish score :)|pg||
nt|greerm: 5@C a good score for NI|pg||
nt|dburn: North would probably not have defended like that with @dKQ2, but one never knows|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: last board.  Thanks everyone, especially Patrick for his witty comments|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the last board for this table was also 2@H-1 in the other room, again with a 7cd fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil352:  so our first flat board|pg||
nt|phil352:  it's been an eventful set|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@c any 0-7 or strong, 1@h takeout of hearts, or perhaps...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzww: :)|pg||
nt|greerm: last hand here, low or zero? error level, wd both pairs|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  too kind; greatest thanks to you for putting the time & effort in to record the events,|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and to BBO for making it all possible|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C!|nt|yorkbeach:  very heavy overcall in reopening seat|pg||
nt|ady: some sort of mixed raise in hearts|pg||
nt|jferg: i see we got 2 imps for 4s +2 unfortunate club lead helped declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: all look quite happy|pg||
nt|phil352:  scotland have played solidly to stay on the right side of the big swings|pg||
nt|phil352:  but NI will rue a couple of poor decisions|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  doesn't is make you happy when the vulnerable opponents open a weak NT in third seat vulnerable|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  against you and you have 20 hcp  :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  here 2@C will show clubs and a higher suit; I'd always bid on with the East hand here although|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  as Al Roth might have said 'if I can just get past this round'|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@s OK as a contract until the spade break comes to light|pg||
mb|d|nt|pjs_ch:  you are in a known 4-3 fit and not doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but it might be doubled here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzww: and a few missed games :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best to win with K@S and play a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: will not inspire S|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  West has little choice here; Northmight have taken the attitude that nothing she bid was going to make|pg||
mb|3H|nt|greerm: in the other room Norma Irwin showed max weak hand with 5@S and 4@C, enough for her partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: we'll take them all against this strong Scotland team :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  and if so, defending was the best option.  South really going a bid overboard here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  partner's bid is surely weakness rather than strength (whichwoudl prefer to defend)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzww: N tempted to X but thought better of it :(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  oops|pg||
nt|ady: now will need to cross with a diamond|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: now should go down|pg||
nt|ady: first heart needed to be played from west hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this could go a lot down but not doubled South will survive|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can ruff 2@d in dummy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil352:  they'll get a few back here but still going to be about 24-6VPs to scotland|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: contract on again   |pg||
nt|dburn: though I suppose it might make despite everything - declarer can pitch clubs on diamonds (and East cannot attack clubs)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly OK now - ruff a heart and concede a spade, with everything under control|pg||
pc|h3|nt|greerm: ok specs, a vey difficult defence missed on the 3NT but really good play overall, remembering we can see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|phil352:  thanks to our excellent operator sandie millership|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hJ|nt|ady: North needed to cashj A@C and another   then   but in fact south might have been end played  if then declarer cashed the 2nd club   cashes a spade and esits to south with the 3rd ...|pg||
nt|ady: heart|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|greerm: I think short of tricks now, even with the @S finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: how would 2@c x have done?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|d3|nt|dburn: maybe East needed to shift to clubs after the @hA - tough defence to find|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok so with board 30 to come from open room its 57 all |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders had to cash @d and !A first|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @DA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  2C-X has on a quick count 6 top losers but coudl suffer a heart ruff too|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  still OK sorry|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: yes both sides played well|pg||
pc|hK|nt|phil352:  lunch break now, restart at 3.10 when this scotland team will be playing england, NI vs WBU and Wales vs CBAI|pg||
nt|vugraphzww: away to cry into my coffee :(|pg||
nt|phil352:  Scotland take abou 11vps advantage going into final match|pg||
pc|dT|nt|greerm: 12 imps to NI so 90-85, great entertainment, and some great play, ty all|pg||
nt|greerm: 13 imps|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yorkbeach:   http://ladymilne.welshbridgeunion.info/|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: only to be expected, all top players|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|mc|7|nt|pjs_ch:  I tend to bid after 2@C because if our other fit is in a major, it is much more difficult|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  for the defenders to chance a double as if it make it makes game|pg||
pg||
