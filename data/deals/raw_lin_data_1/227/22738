mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: this should fail but the defence will need to be careful|pg||

nt|clinch: I've played in teams at various times with 3/4 of these, and they are not shy in bidding|pg||
nt|dagold: the defence must not allow a second black suit trick|pg||

nt|dagold: @s or @d partscore|pg||
mb|1N|nt|clinch: David, any virtue in opening 1@c over 1@d here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: agressive overcall now when south transfers to hearts, E will probably balance|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dagold: I would not feel comfortable about passing 1N with E but difficult to bid with no methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|dagold: it doesnt feel right to defend 2@h on the E hand when partner has opened|pg||
nt|dagold: I would be happy to have not missed a game|pg||
nt|clinch: I guess 1@d opening would have been more effective|pg||
nt|clinch: this time|pg||
nt|dagold: they may open all balanced hands with 1@c|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|clinch: Says they open 1@c with bal 11-14, so maybe so|pg||
nt|dagold: in that system after a 1N overcall a possible defence from E is: 2@c=majors (44+) 2@d= 1 major and 2M=5M/4+m|pg||
nt|dagold: and their 1@d opener maybe unbalanced|pg||

mb|1N|nt|paulg:  meanwhile, Patsy Meehan found a great lead to get the second undertrick for that contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|paulg:  Betty Cotter & Jean Kelly are North-South for Ireland - their system card is http://goo.gl/5BP8y (PDF)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzxa: Long think by Moore over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  McGowan's two spades, and South's restraint, may remove any slam interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  slam does make, but at 50% it is a case of take it or leave it from a probability perspective|pg||
nt|paulg:  however Liz is made of sterner stuff and asks Punch to bid slam with a spade control|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Weak NT for Scotland and McGowan has no interest in game if partner cannot break the transfer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  Tough lead for Kelly and this will probably concede a couple of overtricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  Hopefully our operator can correct the result for board 3 .. (chat to me if you need help doing that)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  this will work well here, but the five-level may not have been safe if Punch held @sKx for example|pg||
nt|paulg:  however the odds are that she has values in hearts and clubs, which makes it a lot safer|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice intermediates in spades|pg||

nt|paulg:  As a commentator I have to be even more circumspect than normal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  7 imps to Ireland on board 19 where the 2@h overcall was passed, so I make the score 46-27 to Scotland|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  not only was Sam Punch on my Vanderbilt team this year and most of my Spingold teams|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  her boyfriend is in the audience|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I was telly Betty Kelly's son how to access BBO on Twitter earlier today|pg||
nt|paulg:  A very good slam this time, but not an easy hand to bid opposite a weak 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  A perfect fit, when there are weak notrumps where you could not make game|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  2NT will be a transfer to diamond and I guess 3@d denies support|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  so there will be no errors in this session, just the occasional misjudgement or unlucky guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  sorry, it is Jean Kelly here :)|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|paulg:  England, Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland are joined by a second team from the hosts, which this year is Wales and is called the WBU team|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Time for a slam, although never easy to bid hands like McGowan's|pg||
nt|paulg:  An aggressive double by Punch|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch's 3@d is natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I expect 4@d is keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|paulg:  if her partner had any useful values, then you'd expect her to be balancing with spade shortage|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  and it seems that McGowan agrees, she must expect Punch to hold a penalty double|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: Moore apologies for not doubling1|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|paulg:  4@s shows 0 key cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  so McGowan may bid 4NT to ask for the @dQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: redoubling!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  or may just bid 6@d as she expects Punch to hold three diamonds on this auction|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  well bid, but I expect it will be bid by the Irish too|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this layout you can make all the tricks, but unlikely to bid it missing one of the key cards|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|paulg:  perhaps North would be better served bidding 4@c, but she does have a lot of wasted values in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: we have an interesting board here. EW have some spades, but is it enough for agame try?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  We are still not linked correctly but we do have another slam hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's 4@s bid, with first round controls in three suits and six trumps does look conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and, indeed, this might encourage partner to do the wrong thing|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petka: obviously not possible for EW to locate their 5-3 fit, and W will be looking at that heart void|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch will be feeling pretty bad at the moment ... conceding -770 and giving away a slam on consecutive boards|pg||
mb|5C|nt|paulg:  but she will feel a little better now that the Irish have missed a biddable slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  and more so when she scores up and find out that her team mates bid and made the slam on 23 too|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe the running score is 72-38 to Scotland|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  this looks a fairly routine 3NT, especially with the diamonds 3-3|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|paulg:  our operator has corrected board 3 to four spades making|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will probably lead the @hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  Punch is a very aggressive bidder, so McGowan starts slowly ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but the 2@h bid is natural but confirms a sound overcall so she bids game|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulg:  the normal lead but a welcome sight for Punch|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is still the problem of the heart losers|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|petka: playing standard, the W hand actually must signal negatively, since the T would make it impossble to take 3 clubs if E holds AJx|pg||

nt|petka: a shot at 3N? some sort of strength double hoping to find 5+spades?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i would upgrade the North hand and bid 2@H, assuming it was forcing for one round, due to the club fit|pg||

nt|paulg:  North might well pass this|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|petka: Interesting. Does E know the spades are 5+? Mike Lawrence says no, but some pairs use a double of 1D to show one or two 4card majors instead of promising both majors|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  when they go through the hands in the post-mortem, Punch might consider that this hand is a better takeout double of 1@s than the takeout double she tried to make on board 22|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  as North seems to have denied the ace and king of clubs, unsurprising that South signed off|pg||

nt|clinch: 3 card raise is right - convention card at http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/fawcettmoore.pdf|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dagold: usually right to lead trumps against partscores, probably around 90% of the time|pg||
