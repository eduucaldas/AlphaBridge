nt|athene: my guess is, north has to bid this immediately to show weakness|pg||
nt|clinch: Fawcett will not have wanted to bid 2@d, but a pass would have been forcing on Moore|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south perhaps cant see that partner onlu has .0 points|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was clubs and a higher, was it?|pg||
nt|athene: what are south's options here? pass, 2@H, 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwx: Current standing after 4.5 matchs : SCO 104, WAL 93, IRE 74, ENG 69, NI 65, WBU 40|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i am sure that south wants to be in game now ,,but how to continue -perhaps souths bid must be forcing -am that means that north is not worth bidding|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@h would seem reasonable now|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D is north's weakest action here that still does not have to be a zero count; game might still be there|pg||
