nt|henrik_r:  Looks like a strong @C relay auction coming up|pg||
nt|duschek: This looks like a strong 1@C (16+) followed by a relay sequence, but West may interrupt the auction|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|an|artificial|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  1Nt is natural and gameforcing|pg||
nt|bensby2: 1nt natural gameforce|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It would have been better for EW to let NS find the club suit on 5/6 level|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Ole, Jacob, Kim and Mats: You have all play strong @C|pg||
nt|duschek: Do you know if they use relays on this auction?|pg||
nt|bensby2: yes|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  What is most annoying: Natural overcalls or artificial where suits are not always known?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I wouldn't expect it. (And I dont belive 1NT is a relay)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|oleberg:  I would expect 2@C to be stayman-like.|pg||
nt|duschek: North invites, but South has absolutely no extras|pg||
nt|bensby2: they ont use realys - I play Hagen-Konow system every maonday with either Konow or Filter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|oleberg:  Filter, who is well known to the whole world|pg||
nt|bensby2: :)|pg||
nt|duschek: 6NT is a decent contract on 31 HCP, though|pg||
nt|nilsland:  No Roland|pg||
nt|nilsland:  he wont anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Interesting, the spades will block if he plays low|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|duschek: When playing 6NT on about 32-33 HCP and balanced hands, the quality (or absence) of the jacks is very important. Here N/S have two very useful jacks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But of course he rose, guaranteing 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|bensby2: overcalls on the 1-level is not real annoying playing strong club (artificial or not)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|duschek: Obviously, 6NT is always down when East has the @CK, but otherwise it probably makes|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: Welcome all|pg||
mb|1N|nt|barbyh: hi , Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
mb|2S|an|!s+mi|nt|thorvald: here is a chance for a small pick-up for Schou|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South can make 3 N here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and even N with a heart guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: should be easy 3nt|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w may reach 4 spades    but  may go down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a very quiet 4 @S for 420|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I'm your Danish commentator now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Hi David|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|ady: hi Kjeld|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: Hi Stig|pg||
nt|oleberg:  east has now shown 17+ with an unbalanced hand and 5+ spades|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot; you might really want the heart to be led up to, rather than through|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: given the double that's right.  Without it, it's just random|pg||
pc|d8|nt|stigw: The Multi coulndt knock E/W out this time.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  3 @S not veru optimistic bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  very|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead can make|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|oleberg:  7hcp, one probably useless and a flat distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Splendid bidding E/W in my eyes.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: well, you don't know partner has only @HAx - if he has @HAxx or @Hxx, clearly your hand is better-off declaring|pg||
nt|athene: @HAxx or @HKxx sorry|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Surpriding lead - with doubleton in pdÂ´s suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  South was a junior once , won the European title in 1970 http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=9046|pg||
nt|stigw: Might go down after this tantalizing lead.|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should go down  unless south takes first diamond  if east plays a spade to ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The way to make this one, would have been to take it in hand, and lead a diamond. But it is far from certain this would have been the best plan|pg||
nt|stigw: If declarer in the end could get timae to throw h loser on diamonds it makes, but....|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
mc|11|nt|oleberg:  Its to late now, but we are many that will look forward to telleing Hagen, that he made a mistake at the very first trick of the tournament|pg||

nt|bensby2: looks like a good 6nt on Wests hand|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  2@D = Multi weak or STRONG |pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: EW cc from Bermuda Bowl in Veldhoven: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Iceland/BSJorgensen-Einarsson.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Or a good 6@C, but not that easy to get to|pg||
nt|duschek: Another point about playing 6NT on 32-33 HCP: If the hand is a misfit, the suit quality is extremely important|pg||
nt|duschek: The strong variant of 2@D always includes one of the major suits|pg||
nt|duschek: And is game-forcing|pg||
nt|smoller:  A slam, 6NT or 6@D must be played by West|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Que?|pg||
nt|duschek: Game-forcing hands with a minor suit as the primary suit are opened 2@C (which could also be a weak 2 in diamonds, Ekrens, or a strong balanced hand)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|smoller:  6@D however can be made also by East|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  2Nt probably shows @H as 3x would have showed @S (I guess from their CC)|pg||
nt|duschek: 2NT showed the heart suit. With a spade suit, West would have bid something on the 3 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: thats right Henrik and Jacob|pg||
nt|smoller:  12 top trick including one spade trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller:  6NT scores best|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|duschek: 11 HCP and good suits opposite a game-forcing hand - it is hard to imagine East stopping below slam|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It is hard to know, but my guess would be that East could not bid 3@C as natural or I believe (hope) he would have done so|pg||
nt|duschek: 3@C could be a general negative response|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  West endplayed into 6NT|pg||
mb|6D|nt|duschek: Or perhaps a waiting bid|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  No, East endplayed into 6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|duschek: When both players have lots of high cards, they can normally choose who is to be endplayed. Even during the auction it seems|pg||
nt|duschek: Basically, showing a game-forcing opening bid solved all problems for E/W|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|duschek: West can try for an overtrick by leading towards the @SK. If North has the @SA and ducks, declarer can then run all of his tricks, squeezing North if he also holds the @HK.|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  I do not like a preempt with so much defensive potential (@SA, @HQ, @CQ, @DJ)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But 3@S could easily strike gold|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (But I dont like the preempt either)|pg||
nt|duschek: Even if N/S open 2@S aggressively, I think 3@S is overdoing it with values which are more suitable for defending|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It could by I believe it is very much against the odds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But of course I shouldn't start two sentences in a row with "but"|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  by -> but|pg||
nt|duschek: East has a very awkward decision now|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But I did|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But East is gathering courage to pass|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I think he will butt out|pg||
nt|duschek: Well, is there any alternative?|pg||
nt|duschek: What would you bid with the same hand, but without the @HA?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I would stop playing bridge|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  But seriously, I would still pass as I think it is the cheapest alternative|pg||
nt|duschek: I think you are right. If East bids anything, and 3@S-X makes, he will be doubled and will go for a number.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, pass must be odds on. As Kit Woolsey wrote, it may not be the best alternative, but it is not possible to unearth what is better|pg||
nt|bensby2: but you will sweat the whole play - I looks like 8 tricks to North|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (He wrote it much more elegant though)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|duschek: Next question - what to lead against 3@S-X?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|smoller:  best lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  a small diamond, ensuring -1|pg||
nt|oleberg:  :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Specs says that East has an easy pass if he knows NS, but he doesn't, so it is anybodys guess|pg||
nt|duschek: Or if he knows Woolsey|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that the diamond lead is attractive, but the other leads are even less attractive|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I would have led the Ace of @H as preemptor [sic] probably does not have @HK|pg||

nt|smoller:  can be made now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oleberg:  Just play the spade suit for 0 losers|pg||
nt|duschek: Can you avoid a spade loser?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Once again: bridge is easier when seeing 52 cards than 13|pg||
nt|smoller:  oh yes, a small problem mr. Berg|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||

nt|dkkello:  12 tricks claimed i guess|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  not what schou is longing for|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|dkkello:  20 against 20 here ,but looks like action!  |pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  so east staymans and then 3NT - what's your lead?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can make 3 NT double-dummy...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  renember N-S dont play together on regular basis and a weak 2 can have many faces|pg||
mb|2N|nt|stigw: Only 15 !!! - tournament director !|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  N need a good hand to enter the bidding , obviously :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: OK, I will call:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|oleberg:  Or not obviously|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stigw: Interesting developement, but surely E/W wont end up in 3 nt.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzcq: 2nt was Lebensohl|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oleberg:  Diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: As cards lie, looks better for east to play 3N, as @D lead from north seems best for NS|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jesperdall:  this lead may hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@S on the other hand, quite a bid|pg||
nt|stigw: Boesgaard gort the highest bid of course !|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|jesperdall:  interest suit in itself, diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: tht west a little conservative  might have re-bid 3 clubs    but final contract probably the same|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: S to E: In your younger days, you had a clearcut pass|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jesperdall:  correct to play the 6 from dummy? not sure...|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Depends whether North has the 7 or 9|pg||
nt|othered1: if south decides to shift to @C, 10 is winning play|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|stigw: Can anybodo telle me the differance between a Yarbouroug and "an Earl of Botwell" ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and strange to play the Q  here , ..  even easyer i must admit since I can see all cards!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|jesperdall:  south should have considered this earlier and ducked smoothly|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 1@c was 16+ |pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|c4|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|duschek: 2@S by North would be non-forcing, so he must bid 2@D|pg||
nt|duschek: This is a relay, either game-forcing, or invitational with a balanced hand or club support (the balanced hand might also bid 2NT directly)|pg||

nt|oleberg:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: I think thats what Hagen explained -- and he raised two fingers after the 4@h bid|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Then 4@H showed one (which you wouldn't have guessed without me)|pg||
nt|duschek: 4@H would be the proper rebid in both instances, showing 1-1 in the unbid suits if asking for distribution (4@S=0-2, 4NT=2-0)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: or maybe the two fingers showed 1-1 in the unbid suits :)|pg||

nt|othered1: with @S 3-2, defense of 6@S that began with @C, @C, tapping dummy, would then require @H split (or stiff 10) as well.|pg||
mb|2D|an|4. suit|nt|ady: e/w likely to get to 4@S    |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|oleberg:  By bidding 1@S it can be seen, that West doesn't evaluate his hand to be woth a game-force, facing their opening style|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: But Hagen just argued that he was right: "One thing is logic - another thing is system" was his reply when Konow told him that 4@c should be strong|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  North is no way near a 2@D overcall unless he has a sidebet on how often he can go for 1100 in one session|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|nilsland:  yes henrik - and many more of my crazy ideas - they have all led up to me now being older and wiser :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|duschek: The CC of E/W actually says "1@S denies 4 card major", so it seems there has been a change|pg||
nt|duschek: That explains it - E/W play transfer responses to 1@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: its is ok now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: the 1@s bid was a mistake from me -- sorry all --- it was 1@h :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|duschek: Would you bid 4@H as North here?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Roland - why not add all the specs - so you know how we feel :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Close|pg||
nt|smoller:  Bjarni Einarsson and Adelstein JÃ¸rgensen was in the Icelandic team reaching quaterfinals in Spingold last year. There was also a Danish team in that round of 16 , "possibly the stronget round of 16 in brige history" according to Larry Cohen, |pg||
nt|smoller:  Bridge World Apil 2012|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The EW 1@C opening seems to be inspired by Super Standard (invented by Mats Nilsland, amongst others) showing 11+hcp 4+ @C unbal or 11-13/17-19 bal with 2+@C|pg||
nt|duschek: Assessing the North hand is hard - the @SKQ are not that good, but the diamonds might be useful|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bensby2: but still hard to bid 4 He when partner is just bidding 3 H|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  In this situation you need firm agreements about 2@H vs double of 1@H (assuming that also shows @H) |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  What is the difference|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|duschek: Actually, if South holds the @D10 instead of East, 4@H becomes very reasonable|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  most players treats D of 1 @H as a take out of spades, I think|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|bensby2: In my book Dbl just shows points without a clear bid - I think that works better|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I would actually prefer X simply to show some strenght|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Having played transfer for 10 years on and off, I agree with Nilsland|pg||
pc|c2|mc|9|nt|duschek: To sum up, Berg and Bensby recommend D=strength, 1@S=takeout of spades, 2@H=natural overcall|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|ady: now might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: @d9 is missing:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|henryb:  Apparently N-S in this room play something resembling ACOL, so after 1@s-2@d-2@h north had no forcing bid in spades|pg||

nt|dkkello:  I bet my money on the defense|pg||
nt|smoller:  the 9th trick|pg||
nt|stigw: Lokks difficult to make with right defence, but ...?|pg||
nt|duschek: 9 tricks now - 2 spades, 1 heart, 2 clubs, 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I bet against Kello|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead   better|pg||
nt|duschek: Very difficult lead though - dummy will likely hold the major suits, and declarer has announced club stoppers|pg||
nt|stigw: Now it looks better.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  always always lead a @H  they thought us last summer |pg||

nt|duschek: N/S open most hands with 10 HCP and a 5-card major|pg||

nt|duschek: This one has its pluses and minuses|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|duschek: 2@H shows an invitational raise with 3-card support|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@H = Sound raise, normally excactly 3 cards|pg||
nt|duschek: That way you can stay on the two level if opener has a minimum, rather than struggle in 3@S|pg||
