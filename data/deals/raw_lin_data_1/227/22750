nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Hi Ole|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: hi ole and henrik|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: hi , Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: here is a chance for a small pick-up for Schou|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South can make 3 N here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and even N with a heart guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: should be easy 3nt|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henrik_r:  Hi Torsten|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Good morning all  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: e/w may reach 4 spades    but  may go down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a very quiet 4 @S for 420|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I'm your Danish commentator now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Welcome all|pg||
nt|dkkello:  danish trial -out  , |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Hi David|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henrik_r:  Good morning Mr. Hansen|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  results http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1216.html|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: hi Kjeld|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Hi Stig|pg||
nt|oleberg:  east has now shown 17+ with an unbalanced hand and 5+ spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot; you might really want the heart to be led up to, rather than through|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: given the double that's right.  Without it, it's just random|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stigw: The Multi coulndt knock E/W out this time.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  We start of with a board where the objective is NOT to win the battle for the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 2@c = nat. limited or 15-18 - 2@H = max 8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  3 @S not veru optimistic bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  very|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead can make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oleberg:  7hcp, one probably useless and a flat distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Splendid bidding E/W in my eyes.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: well, you don't know partner has only @HAx - if he has @HAxx or @Hxx, clearly your hand is better-off declaring|pg||
nt|athene: @HAxx or @HKxx sorry|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  Surpriding lead - with doubleton in pdÂ´s suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  South was a junior once , won the European title in 1970 http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=9046|pg||
nt|stigw: Might go down after this tantalizing lead.|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should go down  unless south takes first diamond  if east plays a spade to ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The way to make this one, would have been to take it in hand, and lead a diamond. But it is far from certain this would have been the best plan|pg||
nt|stigw: If declarer in the end could get timae to throw h loser on diamonds it makes, but....|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sommer: 3NT would actually be a better contract, but both games make|pg||
nt|sommer: the jump to 3NT seems to be given on the agreement, that 2@S is "sound" raise|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Its to late now, but we are many that will look forward to telleing Hagen, that he made a mistake at the very first trick of the tournament|pg||
pc|s9|nt|stigw: Up and diamonds, no ?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|sommer: @SA, @SQ, @CK and run more @H's seems best|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or K, Q:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S is pretty sure to represent Denmark in open tournament  .., but had a slow start this weekend|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dkkello:  they play a strong club system|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|dkkello:  E-V represent Denmark in Dublin  (females)  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|oleberg:  Duck the diamond|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Although EW probably will make 2@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|athene: if partner does have @Hxx then you want to play it since west might be underleading @HAKxx(x) but east won't, i suppose|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dkkello:  This is an observationtournament , results so fare http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Resultat1214.html|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A return of the @S9 would have been better than the @HK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dkkello:  N-S already on the national women team |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, a return of a passive club will even it out|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow-Hagen, Bjarnarson-Askgaard, Bilde-Graversen and Blakset-Schaltz are in contention for three spots on the Danish Open team for the European Championships|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzcq: houlberg thinking...|pg||
nt|thorvald: No entries so should she not just grab this ?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: given the double|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oleberg:  Well, the heart return was just as fine. Just dont rusj the diamonds|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  This tournament is one of the factors the selectors will take into consideration|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stigw: He couldnt do better, very unlucky E/W|pg||
mc|9|nt|hawe45:  Not just an every-day-lead from @C J x x x x|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Started as we hoped!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Jesper!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1520 - no swing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fourth best in your longest?|pg||
nt|ady: diamond  play before 2nd trump might have worked    south has to avoid an error|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: N: Nice lead pd|pg||
nt|stigw: Very difficult to reach the lay-down 3 nt here after the multi-start.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Note that the club had a lot of merit, Had West held the @C10 instead, the defence had been helpless|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Also nite the unblocking of the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Hi Stig|pg||
mb|2H|an|5!h, 12-14, bal|nt|oleberg:  If EW gets the hand to themselves, and East opens 1@C, West will have shown 6-6 with his second bid|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think 2@s would have made|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  6 @D looks right here  |pg||
nt|stigw: In the previous I mean.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   or 6NT     e/w     must avoid 4-4 club fit at slam level|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - my screen was dirty...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Should end up in 6 NT.|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@D is makeable here NS, and 5@S may save 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 4@d would have shown 55 @D and @H (Leaping Michaels)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|sommer: Martin doesn't have a propor raise, but he's trying to figure S' hand ..before passing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..I guess!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Think so, but he is on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|dkkello:  you are always slow Stig!  welcome|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp|pg||
nt|dkkello:  grand old man og danish bridge|pg||
nt|stigw: Interesting device that 2 H-opening.|pg||
mb|d|nt|jesperdall:  thank god he doesnt have 7-6 then|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: They are safe to the 5-level, so west will survive investigation of slam.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In the other room West bid only 4 @S in this situation|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  do they have any tools to help them investigate safely below game?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  an "easy"  minor slam here |pg||
nt|thorvald: I would have bid 1NT on the East hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henrik_r:  EW CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/73y4mxl|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  N-S using a natural system with 12-14 NT  and 5 card major |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite inspiring watching both sides competing fiercely for the second non-vulnerable undertrick|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS CC in Danish: http://tinyurl.com/bubcthc|pg||
nt|sommer: oh yes..again, the commentators curse:)|pg||
nt|stigw: Difficult to reach 3 nt now, but 4 sp will probably also make|pg||
nt|dkkello:  welcome Al Hollander  , american expert|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: What is 4@D?  Once there was a general rule not to m ake your first cue-bid in a void, but it may not have considered 6-6 hands|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So now south has shown an unbalanced hand with 4+ diamonds and 4 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The selection committee consist of, amongst others, Peter Schaltz, Rico Hemberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  It shows 6-6 according to Ole ;)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @D is probably not a cue bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if specifically shortage, t hen it's fine, I guess, even if it's in partner's known long suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Only with @S7; if he had @S6 instead he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Very accurate system :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I have a known 10-card fit, I cuebid my shortness even in partners suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Isn't he short in clubs also?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 hts indicates spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I feel confident they wont end up in clubs. West only has to look at his own hand, to see it can never be right|pg||
nt|ady: good point     communication problem in 6NT  on spade lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think 2 @H is a relay ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No, 2@d promise @h, wek or strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: week|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: weak:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: so this shows a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Making the jump to 3@D a very comfortable option|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Lets see, if they can stop on a dime in 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: ..investment?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Hi Al|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: can anyone explain reason for using this type of 2@H opener?|pg||
nt|stigw: No problem it seems - wd.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oleberg:  (Surely I couldn't)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If 4@D is non-forcing, south should pass|pg||
nt|sommer: could be worth 5 imps;-)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: I'm told they use 3N to start cue-bidding of  high card values|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But partner does not know it is a 10-card fit?!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Well, he is infinitely longer in clubs than diamonds...|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Anyway, very tough problem|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  And sure easts hand could be more suitable for slam|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dkkello:  nice , with Stig an Al here I can concentrat on saying stupid thngs and they can tell about bridge|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oleberg:  Doesn't matter. If I know of 10 trumphs, I do it|pg||
nt|stigw: No Ady, 1 superflous trick makes it easy.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oleberg:  But it was to tough|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oleberg:  But just change the @CQ ti the @HJ, and the game is excellent|pg||
nt|sommer: an almost certain -800 here, and in that case 5 imps compared to 5@D=|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    still 12 tricks   only need 2 heart tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|dkkello:  east-vest trying to make it to the national team , who will be decided sunday after this tournament|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Which is also the superflous trick, that makes 6@D easy (on a spade lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW convention card   http://www2.bridge.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fDivisionsturneringer+2011-2012%2f2.+division%2fhold10-fie-christina.doc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  http://www2.bridge.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fDivisionsturneringer+2011-2012%2f1.+division%2fhold12-AskgBjar.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both in Danish|pg||
nt|dkkello:  asked about 2 @H .. I dont know , do we have a new convention?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Velkommen til Sejr|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|stigw: OK, even if 6 nt best, but East are afraid of a H-lesd in 6 nt. |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|oleberg:  But, after all, thats playing partner for perfect values, and partner did sign off|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=7454  =  stig werdelin|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|stigw: I think the convention - new or not new - just means, thet you have a normal 1 of a major with no side-suits - that means 5-3-3-2.|pg||
nt|sejr:  11-14 nt with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Yes, it can be 5422|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems you'd want to stay low with that hand type|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe 5-4-2-2, but then it seems more risky, I think.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes system  2M = 10-13 but unbalanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I think the reason is that you dont have this hand when you open 1@h. Is thar a good reason|pg||
nt|stigw: So its not that type here, unless Christina made a bluff !|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I dont like the 3 @S  ..|pg||
nt|stigw: If you play 12-14 nt, its a question of allowing a 5 card MA or not in the nt.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the CC only mentions 6@C/@D and 22(54)|pg||
nt|stigw: I havent their card, but no matter, 3 nt rolls home anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I can see the written explanation|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|henrik_r:  If North had been the least bit interested she could have bid 3@S or 4@C instead of 4@D|pg||
nt|sommer: it would for sure have been better for W to take the direct sacrifice in 5@S, hoping to put N overboard in 6@D|pg||
pc|d2|mc|9|nt|stigw: Dont go for overtricks in teams, well done.|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  1NT = 11-14|pg||
nt|oleberg:  4@H on for EW, a diamond will go on the spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@h easy to make, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes , good morning Peter  |pg||
nt|thorvald: 5-6 in the majors, how to bid it ?|pg||
nt|sommer: isn't he wtrong enough to go "direct" via 1@H, 2@S?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..could be a misfit hand, of course|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 3NT is not, whta N wants|pg||
mb|1H|an|8+GF|nt|dkkello:  "easy "   4 @H  |pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  20 against 20 here ,but looks like action!  |pg||
nt|oleberg:  If east gets the chance to bid heart volountarily, West will support, and they might get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=FG  a) 5+@H  b) BAL, 13+ HCP |pg||
mb|1S|an|Reley|nt|jesperdall:  so east staymans and then 3NT - what's your lead?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can make 3 NT double-dummy...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  renember N-S dont play together on regular basis and a weak 2 can have many faces|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2NT for minor by N?|pg||
nt|thorvald: You will have to bid @Hs first, |pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Only 15 !!! - tournament director !|pg||
nt|thorvald: The weak NT strikes again|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: a kib suggest double in East|pg||
mb|2S|an|8-11, 6+!h|nt|dkkello:  N need a good hand to enter the bidding , obviously :)|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  How is to say that the have a minor fit?|pg||

nt|othered1: As cards lie, looks better for east to play 3N, as @D lead from north seems best for NS|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and Konow is know as a very thoughtfull (slow) player|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Partner has 14+hcp and we have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|thorvald: It would have been worse if partner opens 1 @D, then rebids 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  this lead may hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@S on the other hand, quite a bid|pg||
nt|stigw: Boesgaard gort the highest bid of course !|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@D is transfer, by the way ..NS play a "homemade" system called Nusine-klør (=clubs) ..named after Lars' former cat;-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their relay structure looks very similar to Viking Club|pg||
nt|stigw: One might misplay the sp-suit here, if left to one's own device.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Dbl. in first round surely for majors (or something ells) so he couldent|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S not afraid of bidding normally ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a bit lucky p had 5 @C  |pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|jesperdall:  interest suit in itself, diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: tht west a little conservative  might have re-bid 3 clubs    but final contract probably the same|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzcq: S to E: In your younger days, you had a clearcut pass|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  correct to play the 6 from dummy? not sure...|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Depends whether North has the 7 or 9|pg||
nt|othered1: if south decides to shift to @C, 10 is winning play|pg||
nt|thorvald: if 4@c is a cue, what is 4@h then ?|pg||
nt|sommer: can it stand a trumplead?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|stigw: Can anybodo telle me the differance between a Yarbouroug and "an Earl of Botwell" ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and strange to play the Q  here , ..  even easyer i must admit since I can see all cards!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jesperdall:  south should have considered this earlier and ducked smoothly|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  now it is easy for declarer to continue spades from dummy as done|pg||
nt|sommer: with a @Hentry in W, I think maybe a trumplead could have set it|pg||
nt|stigw: Or can he strip all the side-suits first ?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hA|nt|oleberg:  Konow has always been slow and thoughtfull (Except once; when he dumped me as a partner)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sommer: ..2 trumpleads:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow carefull to unblock the @SAK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzcq: 1@c was 16+ |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hagen did as well|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  always hard for the defense in situations like this - trying to find a way to defeat the contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stigw: Yes he can, and will I guess.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sommer: as so often before, trumpleads are very often good against preference-contrakts|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|c2|nt|dkkello:  my point is that a goos defenser like Askgaard hates to lead away from a king here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sommer: ..contracts..even|pg||

pc|h7|pc|c8|pc|h9|pc|s2|pg||

nt|thorvald: From säffle @S there was a convention called Lissabon, where 4@C would agree on @h and 4@d agree on @S, this is probably what happened here from marins perspective|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the other table began with board 12, so we won't see any known results|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: needs spade lead to beat 6 hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|an|trsf|nt|jesperdall:  konow did well in the other room, selling out to 4 diamonds |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Let's see if South will reopen|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I bet she will|pg||
nt|dkkello:  me to|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|oleberg:  it is sometimes said, that women players lacks bidding-courage|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Now probably a reopening T/O double by East|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C is "weak" with both MA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  weak nt throughout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: decided on the safe game    which looks right    |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  E are preemping e-v out of and @S contract|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It is not the case for any of the participants in this tournament|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Not for a while, but they will come later.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|thorvald: Wonder what that bid shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: my guess is cuebid|pg||
nt|thorvald: A @D lead to get 2 tricks vs a @s contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: the problem for south is, that she only holds 3@s, so no she wishes that she bid something else than 2@s|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: would need a maximum weak 2   and suitability   like singleton spade|pg||
nt|stigw: Konows supermax (?) wasnt even tired to be detected, and with that lead it was perhaps wrong (but I really dont think so).|pg||
nt|barbyh: which could be beaten but still a good save|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (Not for any of the males either)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  btw. They are playing with screens, helps them when they need to think |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then we'll have to look at movie|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dkkello:  N-S started very strong this session|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@D from W would have been "small+" slaminterest with 5-5 MA|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: *now|pg||
nt|thorvald: With a single @d in East all it takes is the right view in spades and clubs to make 6@s|pg||
nt|stigw: Nothing to reproach really here, but 4 H has chances.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|nt|thorvald: Now its a maximum 2@s only lacking a spade|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Just a bit|pg||
nt|thorvald: trying to secure som @S-tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too dangerous for east to bid again opposite  AT MOST 14 HCP that could not super-accept|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the hands just fit perfectly with @C & @D as they are|pg||
nt|stigw: A perfect fit E/W in the side suits, but with the Di K wrong 10 tricks is no sure thing.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Say north has AQxxx xxx x Axxx...|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Either @HK in East or a little help, e.g. @D lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that decent; you need the @HK on the weak hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would easily win all the matchpoints|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe conservative by E just to pass 2 H, but 3 di would probably be GF.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|nilsland:  6 @S is a good contract except for the spade break'|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  well, well, 6 spades looks good on paper|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S would require simply good breaks in both majors.|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  potential swing in schou's favour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, a) 6+@C b) 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|2N|an|nat|nt|oleberg:  West would never miss the defence against 4@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|nilsland:  Diffucult to bid however|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  but always hard to bid a slam when the opponents open the bidding|pg||
nt|sommer: 12-14 NT and transfer |pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|jesperdall:  any control issues in 4 spades?|pg||
nt|othered1: with @S 3-2, defense of 6@S that began with @C, @C, tapping dummy, would then require @H split (or stiff 10) as well.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  NS play 15-17 NT in 3rd position vulnerable|pg||
nt|stigw: Bad sits make any game very difficult for N/S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if DBL = 4@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 @S  =  minimun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just a maximum opener|pg||
nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I think that 2nt denied 4@hs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: e/w likely to get to 4@S    |pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I don't know whether RD is strenght or Hx, but feel certain it virtually denies 3 spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Switch the @SQ and the @CJ what would West lead then? I would guess diamonds ;) |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Will North bid 1NT or 2@C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  By bidding 1@S it can be seen, that West doesn't evaluate his hand to be woth a game-force, facing their opening style|pg||
nt|sommer: with one of the red aces right, this is an easy make|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: I would try 3 nt also here, even if I'm not a junior anymore !|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: you would be ok if someone had 2 trumps and 1 heart|pg||
nt|athene: take the force, draw 2xtrumps, then play @HAQ|pg||
nt|thorvald: It looks to me like 5@d was an interesting contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true, Bjarnarson DBL would have been negative  but with double @S stop and 4@H 2N might still make sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Agree|pg||
nt|stigw: Chances are there at lest now, but still very difficult (or impossible double dummy ?).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs lead  2nd/4th  [this includes LOW from xx]|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nilsland:  the same applies with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: may encounter some problems  with diamonds and sspades 4-1|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|stigw: Best to start running clubs here I think, and see if anything good happens.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stig - is low from small doubleton the normal lead in Denmark?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Gregers is looking at @h10|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|stigw: Wrong to bid 1 sp in my opinion, but with partner limited to at most 15 it makes sence.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  !--lead would have been better - as very often|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  results  http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub18/Turneringer/Stilling3809.html|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oleberg:  Right, still I would prefer to stay out, competent defenders usualy leads right in these situations. But of course it will make a reasonable amount of times|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  It seems as West needs to guess @D to make |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|thorvald: She needs to time this correct|pg||
pc|d6|nt|stigw: I think it will go down on the bad breaks, but we'll see.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running score is just comparison of the 2 vugraph tables -- in the event scoring is actually cross-imps of all 5 tables|pg||
nt|stigw: Kello answered your question ahollan, but I'm not sure if correctly.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  On the lead of @S 5, North might go down|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|barbyh: best lead for defense|pg||
nt|barbyh: cant go down|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|hawe45:  Small @S to the Ace and @s back, North must duck to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news for declarer -- 5@C doesn't make either|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Defending, taking your ruffs would have been easier|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stigw: Trumph now ?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|oleberg:  (Underleading @DA on the blind lead, for -3)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  A fourth round of @C would surely have doomed the contract|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|barbyh: can only take 3 sp and 1 cl|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stigw: Not good to establish Cl K.|pg||
nt|ady: home now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|thorvald: She now knows that there are no way home, and should just get on to the next board|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  No - if North covers, defense has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - leading the 5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stigw: Right, should make now.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzcq: short break|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It was easy for South to see, that a fourth club was needed, but impossible to communicate this to partner.|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Agree, very very hard (impossible?) for North to figure this out|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I feel a little silly for eating 6 Mars-Icecream bars yesterday afternoon|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I assume that is because you *only* ate six?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now I have no Mars-Icecream bars :(|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, I'll have tom learn to buy more boxes|pg||
nt|thorvald: On a trumph lead, South would play @H, then ducking from East wouldnt that leave South with a problem|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|stigw: Wd E/W - might earn them a swing here.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: in the morning segment Ole Berg suggested a "kibbitzer-claim button" :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Between the top players I think that low from 2 is yhe preferred way, but a clear majority of the whole Danish bridge-community play high from a doubleton. |pg||

nt|dkkello:  very common in Poland (and Denmark :)  )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one benefit of 1@D as unbal with 4+    North can raise here|pg||

nt|stigw: He was able this time I see, but the sp-honours scream of nt, or at least not game in a minor.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C does not show both minors, just a "mixed raise" in @D    [see alert explanation from operator]|pg||

nt|stigw: The 2-H-opening in deal 2 were at this table, closed room.|pg||
nt|stigw: But the scoreboard dosent show that, I must admit.|pg||

pc|s8|nt|jesperdall:  interesting lead!|pg||

nt|othered1: is there a case to p lay the ace?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think declarer has too few tricks for that|pg||
nt|thorvald: Ace might be an idea, but only because T of @H drops out|pg||

nt|ralfwil:  has anyone of you heard about Miami Coup?|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  and a very healthy lead|pg||
nt|thorvald: Yes, it was a nice defence, and declarer went down as he did think the @Hk was onside, and didn't want to rely on @ss being 4-4|pg||
nt|stigw: Ok all - nobody has given in at this table untill now (except ovetrricks)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  As there are 12 tricks this demnostrates why we do not have a "kibitzer-claim" button ;)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was there a psychological play that gave declarer a chance for 1 more trick?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  But declarer had a blind spot. After the !10 appeared he had a safe route to 9 tricks by continuing with a low heart from hand|pg||
nt|sommer: would you have bidden 3@C, Thorvald?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  I agree, easy for us to see spades 4-4|pg||

mb|1C|an| |nt|thorvald: Looking at all 4 hands it looked stupid, but i think that the real error was not to advance jack of @c|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Double shows 12-16 balanced or 17+|pg||

mb|1S|an| |nt|ahollan1: 1@S=game force, 5+suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Was it bad for N/S? 4@s was a winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  North, for some reason not quite clear to me, chose to show the 21 hcp as 22-24 hcp|pg||
nt|thorvald: Did he claim before getting the lead at 3rd trcik ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: yes|pg||
nt|thorvald: Strange claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: i think it was an attempt to speed things up - first 6 boards has taken 65 min and only 55 min left for last 8 boards|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|henryb:  Not to Flannery|pg||
nt|thorvald: Interesting how to play this|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  He gave up bridge instead (Bergen, that is) preferring teaching to playing|pg||

mb|2C|an|8-9|mb|p|mb|2D|an| |nt|henryb:  and write of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Not easy to find, but wouldn't a spade lead and continuation sink this?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Nope|pg||
nt|oleberg:  No, no communication|pg||
nt|thorvald: But 4NT was in jeopardy because the 4-0 break in @c|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  so, now two top hearts pitching a diamond, then diamonds?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I wouldn't have done it either, but there is two tens, and a lot of controls|pg||
nt|sommer: the destiny of the contract depends on the @Cguess|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|stigw: Diamond lead might make this shaky.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LetÂ´s see @H to the 9 - and KING...!|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks more likely to make    4 hearts likely down on the same diamond lead unless getting spades right|pg||
nt|dkkello:  great pas from E here  ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But the flat shape detracts, and the @D10 might not pull it's full weight |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Well Kjeld the online hand evaluator agrees with Rasmussen|pg||

mb|2S|an| |mb|p|nt|thorvald: Drop a @S and play @D - North will think you have no @Ds|pg||

mb|2N|an| 5332|nt|ahollan1: Askgaard bids are all Relays - saying nothing, asking for full distribution|pg||
nt|stigw: Board 6 might not be bad for N/S after all, because maybe E/W can make 4 sp.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|henryb:  Certainly not KJ. K maybe|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still hard to find a way down|pg||
nt|barbyh: very|pg||
nt|thorvald: As suggested by a kib its better to grab @HA, drop a @H and a @C on the @DAK, but declarer will still need to guess the position, when West playes @HK|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what is best way to combine chances in @H & @C here?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|stigw: Normally you would be expected to bid 4 H on Norts's hand, but the 4-3-3-3 and minimum persuaded him.|pg||

nt|ady: of course west cannot see what we see|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|oleberg:  banking on the @SA to be onside|pg||

nt|thorvald: He need @SA in south and playing accordingly|pg||
nt|henryb:  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: Hi Jacob|pg||
nt|oleberg:  What about ruffin' @S8 in hand, the one round of clubs, then two rounds of diamonds ending in dummy, last club, diamond to the ace, and claim|pg||
nt|stigw: I think 4 sp will be down on a di-lead overtaken by South followed by a cl-switch, so wd E/W.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember -- official results are actually cross-imps for all 5 tables, but BBO just knows about the 2 vugraph rooms|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|oleberg:  Come on, 4@C|pg||
nt|thorvald: Needing to strip clubs, play a @s to the king and endplaying west, not the best plan|pg||
nt|thorvald: Men du har nok ret i at efter indmelding på 1-trinnet er det oftere 5 farve, hvorimod indmelding på 2 trinnet fulgt af dobling oftere er 6-3-3-1|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Whar about you guys, facing a passed hand, wouldn't you at least give it 3@C?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  I would do something as North|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 1/2 @C  |pg||
nt|bensby2: at least 3cl|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Now EW has all the room they need, to unearth the bad spade suit. And they will. (I'll bet you a box of Mars-Icecream bars.)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @H  must be a new gadget   ..    (se board 2 )|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|henryb:  needed run rate is 11, so 12 needed to start the move|pg||
nt|stigw: Al is right about the scoring, so we dont have any complete picture of who has done weel or bad, even if 1 of the teams here at these 2 tables wins comfortabely.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dkkello:  Mathias  are looking foreward to a Leffe after this session |pg||

nt|bensby2: important not to play spades to the king first time - but to the 9|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Again Rasmussen showed better judgement than the commentators|pg||

nt|oleberg:  And 3!X (which would never happen) is only -300|pg||
nt|sommer: a minor partial is max here..3@D NS, best?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: has to be 2 clubs  playing strong club|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S  not 12-14, 5@S, bal  [open 2@S]|pg||
mb|3N|an|Values, single !h|nt|henrik_r:  Agree. I still think passing and giving the opponents a free run is loosing in the long run|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It is always said, that you should preempt less against bad opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|an|cuebid|mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  But we both know careless declarers who would start with a @S to the king and go down in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But somehow people are less inclined to accept the corrollary: You should preempt more against good opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: different aproach in the 2 rooms - and very different contracts :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Laydown in 6 even with both mi-K's wrong, but we'll see.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC mentions  "Bekkasin"   is that the 2N response structure??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Yes, 3nt is 1@h and values|pg||
mb|4H|an|cuebid in !c|nt|stigw: And from now anything can happen.|pg||
nt|duschek: South doubles to get all three suits into the picture - better than 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: could be a swing here   3NT looks difficult|pg||
nt|dkkello:  4 @H not down yet   |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  When playing at toplevel they all think they are better than the opponents ;)|pg||
nt|thorvald: You should not open 2@h with 5-card @s - EW getting as deserved in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ady: now might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: @d9 is missing:)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sommer: 2@H is very close, but with 4c in W it may go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Schaltz has left the table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Apparently N-S in this room play something resembling ACOL, so after 1@s-2@d-2@h north had no forcing bid in spades|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Wow|pg||
nt|bensby2: interesting lead|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  3nt seems unbeatable|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well a preempt might have made declarer more prone to play a spade to the king (But that is circumstansial, in my opinion)|pg||
nt|bensby2: but nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: S: What is 3@D? -- W: A bid...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will take some time but making in the end |pg||
nt|oleberg:  I can't see lead?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow is declarer so this will take quite some time|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: No lead yet...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Ok thx, just Bensby rambling...|pg||
nt|sommer: I think Martin has to finesse @H8 to make, or?|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@C = Nat or 15-19 NT, 1@S = 0-5 or 6+ with @Ds, 1NT=15-15, 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2 @H-loosers and one in each other suit, seems ok to me|pg||
mb|6S|nt|henryb:  12 unless he goes 4 down|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I bet my money on the defense|pg||
nt|smoller:  the 9th trick|pg||
nt|stigw: Lokks difficult to make with right defence, but ...?|pg||
nt|duschek: 9 tricks now - 2 spades, 1 heart, 2 clubs, 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I bet against Kello|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead   better|pg||
nt|duschek: Very difficult lead though - dummy will likely hold the major suits, and declarer has announced club stoppers|pg||
nt|stigw: Now it looks better.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  always always lead a @H  they thought us last summer |pg||
nt|stigw: I thought it was in the South hand.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  k @C after all , this is rama|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  South does not have an easy hand to lead from|pg||
nt|dkkello:  very nice , but ..|pg||

nt|stigw: Sp and sp again might give problems, but ...|pg||

nt|duschek: Yes, 1NT-4@S, possibly via a transfer auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  :)  He is still thinking|pg||

nt|duschek: Incidentally, N/S play 1NT=15-18|pg||
nt|smoller:  This will complicate getting North as declarer|pg||
nt|ady: now maybe heart lead|pg||
nt|stigw: No swings in the boards lately, so it might end right here, or...........?|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  If I double first and the opps preempt in @S then I am screwed|pg||

nt|dkkello:  16 imps x4  or so  ..  gee|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Me too. I expect opponents to bid a number of spades, and I feel comfortable doubling even 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = at least 55  and good hand in context of 10-15 hcp|pg||
nt|stigw: With this high standard it would amze me if they dont reach 6 cl, but sometimes your system might get in the way.|pg||
mb|3D|an|4. suit|nt|ady: 4 hearts  re transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  he showed a limit raise, apparently|pg||
nt|bensby2: strange slow bidding from Hagen|pg||
nt|stigw: If 4 cl is forcing with slam interest here, it would be perfect, but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Konow-Hagen got to 6@C after  1@H-1N//3@H   now that is impressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 3@h in that seq is 6@h and 5@c|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|henrik_r:  Allthough a little timed I think Hagens 2@S is OK with flat distribution and two queens|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Maybe it is actually 6@D that is the right spot|pg||
nt|stigw: Still, after perhaps 3 H follwed by 4 Cl from South the way should be clear.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well if 3@H = specifically 6@H 5@C   that's just cheating [heavy sarcasm] :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Bu 4 H ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perfect if  6511|pg||
nt|stigw: Can South be sure of a di-control I wonder ?|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|duschek: Most players agree that 2@S by North would confirm 3-card support. I like to play that it shows a minimum too, redoubling with 3-card support and a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy -- if only we knew the inferences available to Bjarnarson|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: still led 10@D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Denamrk has a close call between 3 or 4 pairs , who should represent Denmark  ,if also Mathias Bruun and Knut Blakset would play it wolud be even closer  ..|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Most troublesome vs 5@D is the natural spade-lead, but I play a low heart from dummy|pg||
nt|oleberg:  vs 6@D i meant|pg||
nt|bensby2: the are all winning 6cl, 6dia and 6H|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  A little timed by South only to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|oleberg:  As a kibz have pointed out, 6@H is in trouble|pg||

nt|duschek: Ah, now it does make a difference. West hoped for a singleton diamond when partner did not respect the lead-directing double|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sommer: as the cards lie, there's no big difference between 1NT and 2@S..guess, NS had a chance to score 1 imp|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: Next match in 20 min.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  A strange thing to play bridge very early in the morning and very late in the evening  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: next set   Konow-Hagen against Bjarnarson-Askgaard   and  Schaltz-Bekkouche against Graversen-Image|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well done N-S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: begins in about 15 minutes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henrik_r:  4@H has some play, but do not think they will get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: after this board I will reenter board 26 to get the right play and claim|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Didn't west miss a chance too, he should have ruffed the third diamond and played a spade, guaranteeing the set?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@D is a sound raise, with three-card-support|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: Last oard, we start again 20.40|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: 15 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: (11)12-14, 5@S, balanced|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: old days  a passe out|pg||

nt|henrik_r:  Seems NS do the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  hopefully more acton then  :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  action|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I prefer not bidding pass (ever) on a 6-diamonds-4-spades hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|stigw: Again the 2 Ma-opening with 12-14 in a 5-3-3-2 hand.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I was told  .|pg||
pc|sT|nt|duschek: E/W play 1NT=14-16 in 3rd/4th seat, so 1@D could be 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzcq: I agree, lol. We start 10.00 tomorrow:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzcq: thx all, se you tomorrow|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  The only leads that let East make are @H and @D|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If double is takeout of hearts, I double|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dkkello:  whatever, they will end up in 3 @D  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  the main reason is that when opps bid in next hand is in a good position to DBL  |pg||
nt|stigw: opeless to make 2 nt I think, so probably no swing here.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg:  Still, South must rise with the @HA and play a club|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  @@Berg: Agree even if I do not play equal level conversion|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The return of the @S4 couls indicate that|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: North gave preference  knowing hearts could be 3 card suit   south having bid clubs earlier|pg||
nt|duschek: Konow might have held a doubleton diamond, but not after the opponents have supported clubs|pg||
nt|ady: looks destined for a push|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: in normal room  1@S-P-P-DBL//P-2@C-P-??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or will North be able to balance with 1N?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but still I dont know about this opening .. ?!  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: retract that question -- forgot about @SQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  Chicago|pg||
nt|henryb:  start April 27, I think|pg||
nt|duschek: Hagen expects, or should expect, Konow to hold a 3442 or 3433 distribution|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stigw: Unmakeable, but OK to end up there.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  @@Henrik: Do you also agree, that orth holds 6 diamonds? :)|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  No|pg||
nt|oleberg:  No reason for South not to trust the @S4|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Konow could have made it harder on South by leading the @HJ looking like a man about to finesse the @HQ|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If partner has the @CA, it is down|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Konow cannot look like a man |pg||
nt|henrik_r:  Ok "bewildered boy" then|pg||
