nt|djneill:  try 2 diamonds, see break, give up on @c plan, @h finesse|pg||
nt|djneill:  but yeah 2 diamonds would ruin the last entry I think|pg||
nt|djneill:  3-2 @d more likely than @h finesse though, hmm|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: unless north pitches a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: but then you get the hearts right|pg||

mb|4H|nt|runnerup:  and here -no real game -but surely will be bidden |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|henryb:  I don't think Muller was worth 4@h.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  maybe needs to play a small @d to partners K -to get the beating ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: thank you Henry! a huge thank you to Max Abram and Herman Drenkelford for making this tournament possible|pg||
nt|henryb:  Over the two way 2@c perhaps the right action is to pass and bid 3@h over 2@d - P - P|pg||

nt|adriaantje: low @D required now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  east must jump with K -in @d if declarer plays one from table -taking the 1. trick there |pg||
nt|henryb:  Either a spade or a low @d works now (as long as E goes up with the K|pg||
nt|henryb:  A spade is simplest|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|adriaantje: ah, I see|pg||
nt|henryb:  then win the @h and play another spade|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and entryes are dead yes|pg||
nt|adriaantje: as dead as de Wijs-Muller are feeling after the last board :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  they really have only one good board on the set: the one where the opponents stopped in 3@h|pg||
nt|adriaantje: I'm guessing they lost their 1st position|pg||
nt|adriaantje: to...|pg||
nt|adriaantje: Brink-Drijver most likely|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lankveld and Bos have had a very good set so far|pg||
