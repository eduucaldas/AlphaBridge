mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|vugraphzbn: Jansma didn't want to open preemptively in hearts because of his good support for spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: his spades probably worried him most|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: Muller-de Wijs far ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: Paulissen-Jansma missing 6H was good for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: but going down in 5D was of course very bad for them|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzbn: Jansma has left|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: but then Paulissen will play a diamond from dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: declarer knows that south has the heart ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: so a heart is now a guaranteed way to make both spades|pg||
