nt|vugraphzbm: hi all and welcome back!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|adriaantje: hi again|pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes a vulnerable 3NT, 4@H or 5@C.  passing seems normal for East, but it won't work out as well|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer will score at least 5 trumps and a @D, maybe more|pg||
nt|adriaantje: Brink-Drijver are currently in 1st place, but a very tiny difference with their regular teammates Muller-De Wijs|pg||
nt|adriaantje: who are in 2nd place|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|adriaantje: yep, they lost some imps, but they didn't lose their current 1st place|pg||
nt|warrens:  a @C now will hinder the defense's communications|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|adriaantje: but they need to be very careful now, the tiniest mistake can take their current win away|pg||
nt|warrens:  if the defense gets 2 @D ruffs, declarer will score 6 @S's and 1 @D for -300|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think this is almost a double dummy problem for Brink.  He knows the @S split is 5-0, knows @H's are either 5-2 or 6-1 after the K was overtaken and can guess that @D's are 4-2|pg||

nt|kemperg: they did not hear you:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: good thing too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: Verhees is playing diamonds immediately so that he can pitch a heart if he needs it|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice, communication broken|pg||
nt|kemperg: your typing is to fast for me Han:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzbn: wackwitz actually played the heart 2|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: can verhees make this?|pg||

mb|p|nt|warrens:  a relay sequence starting with 2@C should get us there|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|warrens:  do they play 2@C as natural or as a relay over 1M?|pg||
