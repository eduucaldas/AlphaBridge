mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|clinch: OK, score at other table on this board was 110 to EW|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: amusement at the table|pg||
nt|clinch: 1@h from E was the only bid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|clinch: So N opened a dreadful suit; E overcalled on a worse one|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|h5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|clinch: Board 13 was a push in 4@s minus one; on board 14 Hackett has rested in 1NT and should gain 5 IMP|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|clinch: here, looks as though declarer has found a way to make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|clinch: so another 1 IMP to Hackett|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d9|mc|9|pg||
qx|o10|st||md|4SAK32H84DQ7532C86,SJ764HKJ76DTCA743,SQT985HQ92D984CKQ,SHAT53DAKJ6CJT952|sv|b|nt|clinch: Score now 28-0 to Hackett by my calculation|pg||
nt|clinch: On this board Skelton went to 4@h off one in closed room|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|darrene2:  The score is incoreect - Hackett is 22 IMPS ahead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|clinch: Looks hard to see how 4@h could go down|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|clinch: Presumably E was forced|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|clinch: Maybe a double @c finesse?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|clinch: Board 15 was a push at +90 to EW|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: Middleton - O'Connor spiralling up here|pg||
nt|clinch: Can't see 6 making...too much work|pg||
pc|sT|nt|clinch: Will probably be forced to finesse hearts the wrong way, and things could collapse|pg||
nt|clinch: It will take a while, I think|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|clinch: On 16 NS are playing in 3@h after EW did indeed compete to 2@s|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h5|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

pc|s5|pc|hA|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|clinch: 3@h on 16 went one down, so 5 IMPs to Skelton, making score 28-5 to Hackett by my calculation|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|an|weak|mb|d|mb|3S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|clinch: On this board in other room NS made 11 tricks in @d, but were in 4 only|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|clinch: Can see that 11 tricks are possible, either by running the spade or winning and double-finnessing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|clinch: Neither happened|pg||

pc|h8|nt|darrene2:  Seems there is a problem with the scores - sorry all - we will restart at 1.30pm|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: 1NT presumably forcing, showing a variety of hands|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|clinch: Apparently 2NT natural not available in this sequence....would have been Lebensohl, so 3@d showed extras|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|clinch: Shortly declarer will have a good count on the hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|clinch: @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: and looks to have 4 @d|pg||
nt|clinch: So is marked with 3-5-4-1 shape|pg||
nt|clinch: but maybe she needed to finesse Q@d to have a chance|pg||
nt|clinch: Doesn't really want to play anything from dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|clinch: Now N has a difficult discard|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|clinch: Well, maybe not... as long as she hangs on to 3 winners she's ok |pg||
pc|d4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|clinch: Looks as though this will be -1 for a push, and 33-5 to Hackett at the half|pg||
