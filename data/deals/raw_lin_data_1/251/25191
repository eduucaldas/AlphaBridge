pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||

nt|panosk: question what he plays after the 9@C drops from S?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

nt|gracelin: this event.|pg||
nt|panosk: gazzilli is a gd convention that handles effectively some of the problems of the natural system |pg||
mb|p|nt|efrahim: north did not evaluate his hand accurately ... his @H length means that partner is definitely short in that suit ... he has no minor suit losers either... |pg||
nt|adonis18:  would probably make 11 tricks:)|pg||
