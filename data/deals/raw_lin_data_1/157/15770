nt|vugraphzty: 2N GF asking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im sure Robson will provide us with the answer|pg||
nt|capercliff: with a 9-card fit it would certainly be right, but with 8 maybe A 1st|pg||
nt|vugraphzty: Robson has head in hands, thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: also Robson will not want an early heart from south|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a tricky hand to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly many options |pg||

pc|d9|nt|lestergold: Robson is n ot a fast player|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: has to knopck out 2 aces 1 level too high|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes he has to block the suit by going up with A|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2NT  or 2@C?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you given the pioint a board scoring element there was a serious risk in unblocking as it allowed an overtrick|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i can see downsides to that play such as being forced with clubs but i regard the heart suit as being a greatwer worry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 5@c?|pg||
nt|capercliff: would be a good shot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It's great when you can see all the cards |pg||
nt|capercliff: its stiff as the cards are|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely he wont sell out to 41h at these colours|pg||
nt|capercliff: he is probably wondering if 4@s is better|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: as it happens 4@h is best of all|pg||
nt|capercliff: or not|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: or the "flexible" double |pg||
nt|capercliff: why is 4@h best?|pg||

pc|h7|nt|lestergold: because its going light|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|capercliff: opting to defend here is a big view|pg||
nt|capercliff: it could very easily be a double game swing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree. You can rate NS as having at least ten hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe a X after 3@h was better|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed it is a view but Allfrey does have defence and biodding over 4@h is an almost certsin negative score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you should have a fit your way as well|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: This Gold cup team will take some beating in this competition Forrester and bakhshi in the other room|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|capercliff: the other room didnt think his hand was a 2nd chair VUL 2@h opening|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|capercliff: and loses a double part score swing as a result|pg||

nt|jtr: Although he is facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jtr: May not stop low enough here though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: If north opens, NS likely will find a game and none is very good|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh they might now|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS are sound openers|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, an inferior weak 2 as Zia explained|pg||
nt|jtr: Not easy to sort this one out|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Or a very strong balanced hand|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|capercliff: i couldnt imagine passing with the West cards on the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in spite of all th e points of course qx clubs not exactly working poins|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can south pass this?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ironically 5@d wins the board against 3n as its only 1 lahy|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: shy|pg||
nt|lestergold: Saelesmin recognises the club weakness of course |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose that's a cue bid  and who can blame him, a lovely hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a cue bid hes is simply bidding out his shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: even with a 4 card @s suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you have four spades - but it really does pay to get in first|pg||
nt|lestergold: push coffee break hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well4@h perhaps is a cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i do not agree with it if so|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: and his pardf has taken it as showing 5@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this shouldbe 1 off still wins against 3N|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: very difficult with the @H split|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 tricks must be lost|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: otherwise it's a very good contract|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: its much better than another game thats for sure|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|capercliff: a very good turn around after a shaky start by Robson and company|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||

nt|yo_yo: it will all collapse in a minute|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: he must play trumps now and then run dims 1 0ff the best he can do|pg||

pc|d8|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: well most impressive player here has been Allfrey in my opinion|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: but as you say, better than 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: at point a board its good|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: on ehand he could have made |pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: otherwise he has shown very good judgmenet in the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: and defended well|pg||
nt|capercliff: bye|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye for now folks|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i thin salesminde realised that 11 tricks wwere extremey unlikely with his|pg||
nt|lestergold: hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his pass of 4@h was the best chance for game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone, more tomorrow|pg||
