nt|psridhar: match between 2 UK teams-will it be anything like our india/pak cricket match? can any knowledgeable spectator tell us? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Termed as Bronze medal match  ,   i wouldnt know  how.|pg||
nt|rv: presume India is eligible for only 1 medal then|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|rv: in that case Oz and India will take Gold and Silver (not necessarily in that order), the next national teams are Scotland and Wales, hence this match might decide fate of bronze ...|pg||
nt|rv: medal|pg||
nt|rv: one of Ind 1 or Ind 2 will lose out then|pg||
nt|psridhar: one feedback is they are friends so a friendly match ahead- india/pak cricket also between friends but somehow resembles a war :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: india 2 lost badly  last rnd|pg||
nt|rv: running scores updated Buddy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: they are doing it|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am also told big brother england is needed as oppo to set the adrenalin flowing -ok i understand:)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rv: Scotland must be in contention for even semis spot if they have beaten Ind 2 by  abig margin in last round rite?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|psridhar: and finally the hit below the belt from another spec-" no spot fixing likely " |pg||
