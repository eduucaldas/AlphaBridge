mb|2C!|nt|pelu: Aakirkeby is from the smalest distrikt. Bornholm - and Ravenkilde from Vejle in Jutland|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Bocchi has no a natural and a strong 1@C opener :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine grand slam in spades; you just need to cash the 'right' honour first|pg||
nt|peachy: If NS sacrifice in a minor, they might be sweetly surprised to make, just takes correct club guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D on the right viuw in @C - and only a @H-ruff can defeat 4@S|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That's a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a clue will be that you won't get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you have to figure out why|pg||
nt|tomi2: either leader has 3 spades with the queen or no spade at all? :)=|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yep|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7NT is perhaps better, sometimes you can make it even if you misguess spades|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: would u all bid only 1 time in N? many would bid 4NT over 4@S = 6+@d and 4 card @c |pg||
nt|peachy: I would not jump|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think they will get to 7@S|pg||
nt|pelu: outside Hobro|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: or not|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D asks for the @SQ, and 6@S says she has it but no other king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a grand slam we all want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks 4@H already showed her @HK so she doesn't want to bid 6@H there|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|momad: Well bid by Jensen. He is fast and not afraid of anything|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: If 5@D asks for trump queen which I think it does, what would 5@S be then?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|tomi2: this board can cause a swing that you cant repair in lots of other boards by playing well. and this is just "luck" if oth other table plays 7@S and wins / fails...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Sabine tried to show a 6th spade with no queen by jumping to 6@S?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: well most play that 5@S would deny the queen and anything else shows it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|pelu: 2-3 0r 4@D is not the problem - would u bid over 4@S?? |pg||
nt|peachy: Then again, if I did jump, which is reasonable, partner then knows to ecxpect a marvelous hand when vul against not-vul|pg||

mb|p|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Can be difficult to stop Sabine|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|7D|mb|p|nt|athene: i assume 3@C showed values so south should be moving here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone prefer 2NT rather than double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt gets your hand across so you aren't going to miss a game if it's there, but double might be a bit safer i suppose|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: They are still on board 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the slam decisions on 2 and 3 must wait a little|pg||

nt|momad: I was wrong|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: i guess you take the club finesse and then if east turns up with @CQxxx so you can't run them, you just need to bring in 2 spade tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|athene: Sabine has said in print that she likes bidding 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C as it can be very hard for opps to sort out major-suit fits and stoppers for notrumps|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the same applies for 2@C over 1@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|momad: Good result for Nord in closed room|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|athene: it's sensible to be able to bid clubs naturally over a short club, i think  - you just use 2@D as michaels or whatever|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|oleberg: Jeg mente du|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: non forcing free bids would have allowed south to bid 2@H here and let her partner decide to bid on 3 level|pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: if you wanted to get cute here you would play transfers (2@D = hearts, 2@H = spades, 2@S = diamonds)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: These are difficult hands to bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can clik on the teams name and see players (some even with a cpicture)|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 1nt with south rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one can make much|pg||
nt|athene: the idea you can then make a non-forcing bid in diamonds|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|tomi2: I see even Zaleski from France is playing in this event|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Isn't that hand worth about 3@D?|pg||
nt|athene: Sabine gets her 2@S bid out but she would prefer north to bid so she doesn't have to use it|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|momad: I like the opening by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@D = multi but prob a 18-19 NT in the system|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|athene: on the principle that even if it makes it's not a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 380 will still hurt|pg||

nt|tomi2: but he also made a "take out" double od 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure she fully expects this to make but decides that anything else might well be worse|pg||

nt|athene: maybe he was just relying on the auction to show he couldn't have anything|pg||
nt|peachy: the bidders' distribution begins to be asn "open book" which will then indicate diamond lead from either hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|athene: i.e. north to bid stayman should have both majors or values, and he hasn't got spades, ergo...|pg||
nt|pelu: just a bid to help opp ti find the best lead :(|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Good bid by Guido Ferraro|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: and to get partner on wrong foot|pg||

pc|h4|nt|pelu: but I dont understand franco here - a bad bid from East - but even worse from him|pg||

pc|s4|nt|peachy: Franco took the reigns, he should have trusted partner placing the contract after partner asked and was not happy with 3-card heart support|pg||

nt|jni33:  Hej Morten -- vil du bruge lidt tid pÃ¥ at "kommentere" :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: yes good sensible bid although south could still have had four hearts there|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|peachy: I|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm venturing a guess that they play control or step responses :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: EW yönünde 1.ler Ünal ÖZÇOPUR-Zahit AKSOY %59.00 |pg||
nt|pelu: looks like 2@C asking for controls - 2@S= 3 controls - 3@S suit|pg||
nt|jni33:  I would never bid 4@s with that N hand vul aginst non vul -- would you ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Now come to the last board of this segment and the next round would commence in 20 minutes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 6NT a little hasty|pg||
nt|pelu: After 4 matches (out of 11): One-Eyed Jacks and Odense 86 VP, BK Nord 82. Ravnkilde No6 and Åkirkeby no 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What is their NT range I wonder, 14-16?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|emre kaya: 2.ler Ayþegül EROÐLU-Birgül KÖSE %54.00|pg||
nt|athene: EW are 14-16? or sabine just feels happy at the moment?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whatever it is, she will pass now|pg||
nt|athene: not with four hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Maria Dam Mortensen, our hard working and excellent operator at Køge|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Logical pass of 2@H by E.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|emre kaya: bu skorlara göre ÞEN-SAYILKAN çifti çok avantajlý görünüyor turnuvayý kazanmak için |pg||
nt|peachy: control responses, while often useful, do tend to drive the auction high very soon|pg||
nt|pelu: do they just shuffel the bidding cards a see what bid will fall on the table :) - 7@S a great contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: 3@H then|pg||
nt|peachy: E csannot support spades with a 4S bid, for fear that W passes it, what should she do?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: Try tto pronounce Køge if you are not from Scandinavia :)|pg||

nt|athene: and well done to declarer for playing the trumps that way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right, the  ø  is special and the   g   is mute|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: if she led towards her hand, or led the queen, south would not be going wrong|pg||
