nt|athene: ruff-and-discard is a good move|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 2 VPs for a win, 1 VP for a tie and 0 VP for a loss. A difference of 10 points counts as a tie|pg||

nt|henryb:  Nah. Preparing for Newspaper reporting where the players are always West, East and South|pg||
nt|henryb:  Sandqvist cut in on the regular table|pg||
nt|paulg:  Charlsen was a member of the Norwegian Open team in the Europeans in July|pg||
nt|paulg:  He and his regular partner, Hoftaniska, now play on the De Botton team for some events|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: looks like losing 2 heart tricks    but may still get home|pg||
nt|henryb:  Because so much more rides on the Imp results -- a game swing typically is worth about 3VP, -- players tend to play for their contract and only for overtricks when the contract is not at risk|pg||
nt|ady: always going to be difficult for the defense even without the club lead    west has not entry to play a club|pg||

mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mug: and a negative double with 8 pts and only three hearts feels extremely risky|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I never understood why it's reasonable to concede 670 at IMPs|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D might have been more prudent|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, it isnt quite IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is, mostly|pg||
nt|mug: but you get paid something for +200 instead of +110 and sometimes it's more than 200 if opps are out of line|pg||
nt|jtr: She was going for the KOD against a partscore|pg||
nt|mug: it is mostly IMPs in my view|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphztz: West claims - draw and take the @H finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I suspect this will keep N-S out of the respectable 4@s contract|pg||

nt|henryb:  I suspect that N-S will find it difficult to reach their best suit|pg||

nt|henryb:  He can make this but probably will not|pg||
nt|henryb:  If Stockdale had realized that silence is golden, N-S would have gotten to 2@h|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||

nt|lestergold: to be fair it is somewhat unlucky and will probably be a push|pg||
nt|henryb:  the negative double might have presented a road map, but he failed to read the map|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|12/14|nt|paulg:  i think that Salisbury-Tedd play a fairly simple style, so the double probably guaranteed both majors|pg||

nt|henryb:  well, no|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: this looks mildly inconsistent|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|henryb:  good judgment by N not to leave the double|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: west at this vul not willing to take he risk that 4@h may make|pg||
nt|henryb:  and well judged by W to save|pg||
nt|lestergold: played carefully it does make altho its a very dicet contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: assuming that 3NT was NF |pg||
nt|henryb:  6@h needs the @s finesse and nothing terrible in @h. 6N needs rather more|pg||
nt|vugraphzty: Rosen: "everyday auction"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  it makes 5, Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if East was going to go to 4@H, it doesn't cost to cue 4@C|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: indeed as cards lie|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, its reasonable. Stockdale had no slam interest until partner showed up with a heart fit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 5 is not biddable!|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, four if E-W play three rounds of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and indeed, the lack of such a cue makes it odd that West went on over 4@h|pg||

nt|athene: better than finessing and catering for QJxx with east|pg||
nt|mug: communications tricky now on diamond back|pg||
nt|athene: yes diamond return makes it very tricky|pg||
nt|athene: you have to cash the @H10 don't you|pg||
nt|athene: and squeeze west in three suits|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|athene: a strategic squeeze|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: Still has to read it|pg||
nt|athene: now if he throws a spade you can unblock the club and then lead a low spade!|pg||
nt|athene: that's a very unusual position|pg||
nt|athene: you are squeezing him out of a potential long diamond winner|pg||
nt|jtr: Might play West for 4@ds|pg||
nt|jtr: and 3@ss|pg||
nt|mug: now sure I follow you Bill|pg||
nt|mug: what happens if West throws a spade now?|pg||
nt|jtr: She is blocked in @cs|pg||
nt|athene: then @CA, small spade off dummy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|paulg:  70 imps in 11 eleven boards, indicative of a scrappy set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|paulg:  perhaps both teams settling down into the event|pg||

nt|paulg:  by the swede or the norwegian?|pg||

nt|mug: well played|pg||
nt|athene: operator, tell Heather well played from us :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: throwing a spade was definitely the way to test declarer the most, though|pg||

pc|h2|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|vugraphztz: "Rigal theory" - amazing how often it's right to lead declarers 1st bid suit vs NT|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps 3@C is natural?|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, then you have no way to show a good or bad 3@d bid|pg||

nt|jtr: Needed to play for KQ@h onside|pg||
nt|mug: everything is natural FG, easy to remember|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe you never consider a 5-5 hand bad:)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: It's only bad if partner is 5-5 in the other two|pg||
nt|mug: just pass with a misfit, little gained from wriggling|pg||
nt|jtr: More important with 2/1 and a 1NT response|pg||

pc|s5|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  don't double me! ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: as cards ;ay n/s can make 3NT    but difficult to play for KQX hearts onsside after 2 spade opening|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: Tedd may have vhosen the right time to be cautious|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  i guess 3@h shows some values, given the alert and subsequent 4@h call|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: but to no avail and sandqvist has bid the pips off his aceless wonder and will get lucky|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: er second best lead|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: has Sandqvist in effect provided a road map here to Salisbury|pg||
nt|paulg:  Doubtful. I don't think many have been able to decode Sandqvist's bidding style|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever the result what do u folks think of Sandqvist's bidding here?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: @H10 discard?|pg||
nt|ady: west might have dropped J@S 3rd round|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: ruffs with his money in effect|pg||
nt|lestergold: should still be 1 off|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think his bidding probably scares his partner as well as the opponents, but he has had a lot of success with it over the past few years|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: can this make now?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
