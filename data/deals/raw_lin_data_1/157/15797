nt|vugraphztz: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S at both tables - but 5 IMPs and the 2VPs for the board depended on the defence that was played.|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|lestergold: he was on a guess Zia could have been stealing a heart trick for all he knew|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: He does that in certain situations|pg||

nt|starkist: meant this is another eggie one only|pg||
nt|athene: does anyone know what 3@C is showing?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a special rule for you, Mike. |pg||

mb|3N|nt|henryb:  or vice versa|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is true for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: That seems right|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Of course you support your own son, or your own country in some big championship. The spectators would expect no less.|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: true and obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy hand to defend|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: Yes, i thought he might lead that|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eback for Forrester|pg||
nt|brolucius: North must decide whether to cash the @CQ now.|pg||
nt|jtr: He will get out with a @h after cashing the @cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: North is going to get mullered in the majors one way or the other|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: North cashes the @CQ so he doesn't get endplayed with it later|pg||
nt|jtr: He is tempted by the @sJ maybe|pg||
nt|athene: a small heart is likely to work as declarer will surely put up the king |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he will put up the Q:)|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see Zia making this|pg||
nt|athene: forrester knows declarer has nothing in hearts at all, since he isn't playing on them - very likely a void|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much tanking by north can only help Zia|pg||
nt|athene: a singleton is just about possible i suppose|pg||
nt|jtr: @d10 from Crouch might have helped a lot|pg||
nt|brolucius: North must have concluded that a heart is too risky, since he will probably have to give dummy a second heart later.|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: Forrester asking about other bidding options Zia had over 3@c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: There we go|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Yes, very good, David.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: Could not resist temptation|pg||
nt|brolucius: Who can?|pg||
nt|athene: no good - he had to unblock the ten didn't he?|pg||
nt|athene: then he could have gone @SA, @DAK, @CJ throwing all the small hearts, and another spade towards dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: To endplay North yes|pg||
nt|athene: but now when he does aall that forrester DUCKS the @S10|pg||
nt|jtr: Now North can duck the @s10 and keep off play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: and leaves him in hand with a load of minor-suit losers that crouch is happy to gobble up|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer did not know where the @SK was, though.|pg||
nt|athene: well, maybe justice was sort of served in that it was hard to defend and hard to play as well|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2N!|mb|d!|nt|henryb:  Crouch will be surprised to take two tricks with his 10-high, and disappointed that he cannot win truck 13 with the @d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d in closed just a little too expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ycbc.co.uk/lederer2010.htm  for standings before the last round. These two teams are tied first|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a bit wild at Love All - with such a flat hand.|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Wow, Gold goes to 5@D too.|pg||

nt|lestergold: at the risk of domestic disharmony i do not agree with gold's 5@d bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, nor I.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very good of you to be so impartial, though. Roland will nod his head. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: if forrester wins the first heart with the ace that might make gold get the clubs wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crockfords (de Botton) with a fair chance of overtaking both of them if they can get a big win against Young Chelsea while these two teams have a tight match|pg||
nt|jtr: Crouch cant read the pips for sure|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|henryb:  Under the "LAW" it is wrong: you have 9 trumps, the opponents have either 9 spades or 9 hearts, so 18 total tricks -- maybe|pg||
nt|lestergold: well put it this way junior Gold finds a lot more fault with my bridge than i do with his what a surprise|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jtr: But a @c doesnt look urgent|pg||
nt|athene: ok it looks as though he was goin gfor that|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had no count on the spades, I suppose, so did not know whether a spade was safe.|pg||
nt|athene: it's a very common strategem to play an unnecessarily high card in third seat from a sequence, to try to induce declarer to misplace the remaining high cards|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester did well to hide the @hK|pg||
nt|athene: you see it a lot - ace from AK, from AKQ, and so on - if you think partner won't be deceived or it won't matter if he is|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is never right: if they make 10, you are down 3; if they make 9, you have a fantom|pg||
nt|jtr: But then played a @c to save the guess|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2N|an|minors|mb|3D|an| |mb|5D|nt|josknecht: there was perhaps an inference that N held D queen short when he put declarer in dummy at trick 3 instead of returning a club|pg||

nt|Walddk2: as Zia must have a club honour|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it won't help him much|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gillis chose a takeout double on second round instead of the immediate heart overcall which seems better on the north hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho the suit is bd even more dangerous to take the action  chosen by gillis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Forrester may escape for down 1 here. However, when we get to the comparisons on 34, 35 and 36, the All-Stars have potential gains|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not least as the BAM aspect is concerned|pg||

nt|xenya: true:)|pg||
nt|josknecht: tough choice, worked well here, perhaps the percentage bid after N has passed since chances of 5 spades reduced. meanwhile N might have 4 spades & 3 hearts so double could get hurt|pg||
nt|josknecht: i would be more worried about missing clubs than spades. but it is not as if X will necvessarily get you to that strain either even when pd has them|pg||
nt|xenya: also the double at the 4-level may not be strictly takeout for them|pg||
nt|josknecht: i would doubt that but u may be right|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well done by the organisers to have this match on in the last round|pg||
nt|lestergold: Alll stars had a poor start yesterday|pg||
