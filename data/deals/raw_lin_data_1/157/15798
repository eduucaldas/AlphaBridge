mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: 4@S beatable if Lauria finds diamond lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i expect a lot more bidding|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 3@H is pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: some of it perhaps today|pg||
mb|5S|nt|yuval10: 4@h making is a good result for France, since you have 4 losers with a @s lead and the obvious @d continuation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and double was probably takeout of spades, hence the 4@H bid|pg||
