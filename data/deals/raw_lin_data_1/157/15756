mb|d|nt|mug: I spent a week in Philadelphia brainwashing DB to pass marginal opening hands, seems it hasn't quite worn off yet|pg||
nt|athene: now east might double 2@S for takeout, if that's what it means|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: lower range weak 2 in a major or strong balanced|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|athene: hmm ok i was assuming north would bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mug: no advantage opening shoddy hands like that in my view|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: i wonder is he just trying to become dummy?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both Souths quite rightly open with a weak two on their hand. It is nonsense to insist on two of the three top honours, even when you are vulnerable. The point of pre-empting is to ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cause problems for the opponents.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|mug: 2NT a good bid by Frank To, I think|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mug: but I'm not sure Barry Myers had any reason to continue to game|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: well he can make it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|h5|nt|mug: probably by passing @H10, double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: does he have to play for avoidance in clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: oh right, he can double hook the hearts yeah|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mug: routine for most commentators|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: no other chance - he can't set up the long club even if he could do it without letting south in|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: because that would mean losing a diamond and two clubs along the way|pg||
nt|mug: more realistically he's playing for three diamond tricks and @HJ to fall|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: NS standard count, reverse attitude|pg||
nt|athene: he might end up trying to throw north in with a club to lead into the hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess he will know that can't work|pg||
nt|athene: since north didn't open he can't have everything he has AND the @CK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Forrester's @S2 on the third round may have suggested a good club card.|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: Frank leaning back, hands on the back of his head|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the @C2 is clubs, if it's honest|pg||

nt|vugraphztz: Friendly table|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: I wonder if West was tempted by 3NT. East would still be able to overrule him.|pg||
nt|mug: he can make this double-dummy|pg||
nt|mug: going to take some good guessing in practice|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would rather lose the lead to north, for two reasons: firstly to protect the heart tenace|pg||
nt|athene: secondly because north can't continue the force on dummy without giving up the @CJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|athene: that might mean he plays ace and a trump rather than the double finesse|pg||

nt|vugraphzty: 2N GF asking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im sure Robson will provide us with the answer|pg||
nt|capercliff: with a 9-card fit it would certainly be right, but with 8 maybe A 1st|pg||
nt|vugraphzty: Robson has head in hands, thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: also Robson will not want an early heart from south|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a tricky hand to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly many options |pg||

nt|athene: yes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|athene: EW might do pretty well in 5@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H too much now by North.|pg||
nt|athene: what do you do with east after 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: geniuses bid 4@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H looks right, unless they have something different available.  |pg||
nt|athene: some play 3NT is a 4@H pre-empt with a little bit of defence|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess that might be pushing it a bit|pg||
nt|mug: bit much to bid at the four-level at the colours|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|d|mb|4H|nt|athene: also allowing 4 of a minor or a double seems a very big price to pay|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not really descriptive of a side queen and no other defence.|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D a mixed raise I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D reverse bergen or some such|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: 3@d shows 1 or 2 @D with 6/9 points and 4 card @h suit|pg||
nt|mug: West has nothing to say, but East can come again with a double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: lol why on earth would you want to show 1 or 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: oh well i am sure they have their reasons|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Do you not have a method for that in your system, Bill? |pg||
nt|athene: ok, so East was a delayed genius|pg||
nt|athene: it just doesn't seem possible to get into the 5-4 club fit on this hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: East's first double probably denied four spades, so he is happy to suggest a 4-3 fit now.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: David's wife and son now kibbitzing him - a family affair :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Have they arrived on the wrong deal?|pg||
nt|athene: well if he finesses against the @S10 he loses a club ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: Forrester's double may pay dividends after all.|pg||
nt|athene: but getting to hand to do that isn't easy|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Rescued by a lack of entries.|pg||
nt|mug: a devilish hand to play|pg||
nt|mug: he can't go too big in case the roof falls in|pg||
nt|athene: it's extremely awkward because even with trumps 3-3 if he just plays queen and another, they can force in hearts and the @DA is still out there|pg||
nt|mug: but how to go small?|pg||
nt|athene: if he plays diamonds first he accepts north gets a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mug: could be a big defensive crossruff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: but if you cash the @SQ then play a diamond, south might win, cash the @S10, and force|pg||
nt|mug: damage limitation|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: and if he started with four trumps you are dead|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes an even trump break is a killer because you run into a defensive crossruff - there's a funny hand in David's book of bridge disasters where someone is in 4@HXX and he ...|pg||
nt|athene: assumes trumps are 4-0 and fiddles around and goes down to the vicious 2-2 break|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|3H|mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i can see downsides to that play such as being forced with clubs but i regard the heart suit as being a greatwer worry|pg||

nt|capercliff: would be a good shot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It's great when you can see all the cards |pg||
nt|capercliff: its stiff as the cards are|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely he wont sell out to 41h at these colours|pg||
nt|capercliff: he is probably wondering if 4@s is better|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: as it happens 4@h is best of all|pg||
nt|capercliff: or not|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: or the "flexible" double |pg||
nt|capercliff: why is 4@h best?|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|capercliff: opting to defend here is a big view|pg||
nt|capercliff: it could very easily be a double game swing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree. You can rate NS as having at least ten hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe a X after 3@h was better|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed it is a view but Allfrey does have defence and biodding over 4@h is an almost certsin negative score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you should have a fit your way as well|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|hJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 31h was a weak bid and burn may have been putting the pressure on as players do at these colours they expect oppos to sacriffice and will take risks to induce a pgantom save|pg||
nt|lestergold: phantom|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzty: sorry down 1|pg||

nt|lestergold: but at these colours doesnt have to be a mountgain|pg||
nt|capercliff: with 5 @c's and 4@s it is obvious of course, but Burn also felt he was too strong|pg||
nt|lestergold: if pard has a weak hand with 5 spades , 2@c overcall is going to miss game even sometimes game on with a  Moysian spade fit|pg||

nt|brolucius: Scramble will be the most popular interpretation because West did not double on the first round. But opinions no doubt differ. |pg||
