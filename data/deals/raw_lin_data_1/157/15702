pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|marcsmith: declarer has to guess spades (or diamonds) to make 5C tho|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wonder what 4@S was but they are fine|pg||
nt|marcsmith: assuming that defence just plays two top hearts |pg||
nt|marcsmith: last train, perhaps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzat: i have been told " 2 nt shows hearts as per there system"|pg||
nt|suketbombi: has to play a low @S  towards Q and all will be fine|pg||

nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|figo: great H pips with Declarer |pg||
nt|marcsmith: seems natural to draw trumps and eliminate the diamonds before touching spades which will naturally put you in the West hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will try another @H as nothing is more attractive|pg||

nt|figo: south was hoping for dble by N instead of 2S|pg||
nt|dslee: should be a push again|pg||
pc|c5|nt|suketbombi: cannot explain 4@S or else|pg||
nt|marcsmith: perhaps 3N showed 3-6 in majors in their methods|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, unfortunately N does not have a hand to X|pg||
nt|marcsmith: various ways of playing 3NT in this auction -- one thing it doesn't show is a balanced hand|pg||

nt|petergill: 7@C needed !QJ10 trebleton in one hand - unlucky or not unlucky?|pg||
nt|petergill: about a 1% chance - I've been in worse grands, but not often|pg||
nt|petergill: QJ10 trebleton in @H's I mean|pg||
nt|sunit: tight match, low scoring too|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes this too wud a push bd |pg||
nt|figo: sry Mahesh , lost connection|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Back Arvind|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed EW gained 3 IMPs by playing the better game|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6S is good|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed you can make 7 as cards lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: next match is Hemant Jalan vs Promila Saraf at 12.20pm|pg||
nt|suketbombi: last hand 4@H went 2 dn as both cud get their ruffs and 3 aces|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not so easy to bid it maybe with the combined 20 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo: till 12th rd , every team would feature once on BBO and 13th to 23rd round , it matches will be selected according to teams  involved and their standing in the table|pg||

nt|marcsmith: NS have a cheap save against 6S but don't want to push them into the grand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzat: Lucky you Debgiri|pg||
nt|marcsmith: although have to guess hearts to make 7S|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: http://61.247.239.200:8080/cba/jspCWB2010index.jsp|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: well - do you open 1@D or 2@D with S hand?|pg||
nt|figo: Oh , Chotan passed with 11 :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: EW risk getting locked into hearts here|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: all tables have bridge mates here ...so scores updated after every deal|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marcsmith: 7H can be made too but would go down in practise probably|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not so easy for EW to get back to spades now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 4C splinter agreeing hearts|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5C from South now at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: @SKQJ and @DKQ in one hand on a spade lead is also OK (on a squeeze) on a non-@d lead, so 7@C is more like 1.2% chance|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5D from Sandra?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5NT pick a slam perhaps from Sandra -- that would get them back to spades|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5D more likely tho|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 7@C can go 6 dn cannot be cheap Marc:) in fact north as declerer wud have been 7 dn|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes i see on DA lead|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|marcsmith: no 5H is wet IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: some chance for EW to go overboard here|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|vasanti: game going values but cards badly placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 6H may go down on club lead -- has to ruff, ruff diamond and play H to J to make probably|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6S easy tho|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzat: brb...will claim|pg||
nt|petergill: Paul Hackett and Gunnar Hallberg won the World Senior Teams in Philadelphia earlier this month, but are lying only 16th of 14 teams after almost 2 days' plays here|pg||
nt|petergill: that old argument about not bidding grands in case they're in game at the other table haunts the Chairman's team today|pg||
nt|petergill: 16th of 24 teams I mean|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, I had to take an elevator down 8 floors and smoke :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Thought you would go walking :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo: England may face some trouble here |pg||
nt|dslee: too old mahesh :(|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5H may go down too if declarer gets the trumps wrong|pg||
mb|5C|nt|figo: interesting deal this|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: spades makes trivially |pg||
nt|marcsmith: winning line is @D ruff and @H to J -- not clear|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@H is fine here Marc whichever way ruff 2 @CS pith one on @DA and can at lest loose a @H & a club |pg||
nt|marcsmith: that relies on spades breaking of course|pg||
nt|suketbombi: asuming one of the majors is 2-2 or @H q is stiff|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no either major break|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes that works in 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Arvind|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H A @DA ruff a @D ruff a @C and hope for one major break|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes that works in 5|pg||
nt|marcsmith: have to guess hearts in 6|pg||
nt|figo: Scots are currently well placed at 2nd position with 240 VPs|pg||
nt|marcsmith: of course 6S much better|pg||
nt|marcsmith: is that Luis Figo?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Luis Figo of bridge|pg||
nt|figo: :), his fan, when he was at his peak :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure but West must be expecting 4 @Hs for the splinter hence settled for @hs|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: :) safe landing did not understand what was sudhakar aiming for|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo: now 5D|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, 2@S is kind of unlimited - so S has to keep the bidding alive|pg||

nt|marcsmith: favourable diamond position|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo: once South heard cue bid from N who has already gone with slow 3S , and then no ace , south's 6S has better prospects|pg||

nt|marcsmith: 2S seems particularly timid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: East's hand too strong for a 15-17 NT. It's worth 17.85 on the Kaplan & Rubens Hand Evaluator|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i think it's a huge overbid for East to bid on over 2@S|pg||
nt|figo: in other room , 3H was bid on 2s |pg||
nt|marcsmith: Haggis rode his luck at the other table|pg||

pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: NS close to making game here on friendly lie|pg||
