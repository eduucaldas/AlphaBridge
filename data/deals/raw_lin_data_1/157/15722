mb|p|mb|2D|an|!|nt|rodal f: N to shoose between @S and @C?|pg||
nt|chick: 16 HCP and 5332 is a very difficult hand to bid.  If you open the major and pard bids 1N for example, every rebid you can make is a lie|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Best at @S NS is 9tr|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|chick: Lavings saved them|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|chick: my guess would be that 2@C showed clubs and major, 2@D asked the major|pg||

nt|chick: he needs to make this for a push, but not looking good|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|chick: strange, but with a mediocre 4135 hand, it's easier to overcall 1N than 1@H|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for NS is available under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26/Australia.aspx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: delay as Hung as 1 blue and 12 red cards|pg||
nt|davidstern: What suit is blue|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Team Horwitz has 5 youngsters  - and Horwitz|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i hate to ask what SNOT stands for :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury   2@H=I'm so ashamed|pg||

nt|davidstern: So a nice close match these are 33-48 of a total 64 in this final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room, which started with board 15, using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|djneill:  there was a 3 IMP carryover from the RR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, Adam West playing with Ron and Joe South with Neill|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Prescott-Noble-Bilski in whatever combination play play what's called Modified Polish Club|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2N=(19)20-22|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Klinger has always struggled with counting points|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bot on loser count, 1@S is clear|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: This is the final of the Sydney National Open Teams (SNOT)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphA2: Playing 4 x 16 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really have very little resemblence to Polish Club |pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Al and specs|pg||
nt|loganrun: A slam in hearts or NT as long as you play the diamonds in the appropriate way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough for North; 3@D not quite enough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but X too risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and for your future viewing plans, full vugraph schedule with all times local to you is found here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for non-americans, adam west played Batman on TV, and Joe south was a country singer (games people play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the operator may fill those in, though Adam West would be great to see|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bill is West and Paul is South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he also sang the classic "dont it make you wanna go home?"|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphA2: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Welcome to a wet windy cold rainy sydney day|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Seniors Teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: North probably thinking about 6@D - assuming 3@S is a raise|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: BW - the simple answer to all slam questions|pg||
mb|2S|nt|loganrun: Hi David - a suuny Melbourne welcomes you|pg||
nt|loganrun: sunny|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oooo   Andy is playing with Nabil     in the PABF it was Andy-Adam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok Ron is clearly a NT-o-phile, last hand 1NT with 5 good hearts, now 1N rebid with 6 hearts|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: South has a max. with good trumps - there must have been a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and claims|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW carding   standard count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Prescott caught a pretty nice dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: ron understandably treating his hearts as a 4.72 card suit on second round, then accordioning the out to 5.6 on next round|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S 3-3 is pretty friendly too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|loganrun: Declarer has got himself a bit tangled up here|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Bit is very charitable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Noble won the Qualifying -- that accounts for their 11 imps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: the only remaining consideration is to not lose more than two trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|djneill:  8 tricks looks easy but 9?|pg||
nt|djneill:  must rely on his one Ace up his sleeve, the fact opponents think he has 5 hearts, not sure if it can be done|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how the new partnership would treat North's 2nd DBL instead of the chosen 3@D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|djneill:  it is hard for me to think outside the box on defense, if declarer made a "judgement", defense is hard enough|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: take that 110 and RUN|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice stop partner|pg||
nt|loganrun: South hoping that the same happens at the other table with them in slam!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't know why EW didn't want their @C trick|pg||
mb|1N|nt|djneill:  no results from open room yet|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok they finished 31|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, 5+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C= multi-purpose   a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: that's the last time i'll copy/paste THAT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh yeah -- 1@C was 1-Round Force|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: an excellent hand to defend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can make a case for X rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand is a breather...|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes, Marshall would you have responded 3NT on this North hand?  It is close|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||
nt|loganrun: South punting here - could be off 2 controls here|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|peachy: we are fortunate to have al here to explain all the bids|pg||
nt|peachy: when I am kibitzing, I appreciate that a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice "all" is spelled with small letters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Prescott gave any thought to 3N instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: not for .05 second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or it wasnt apparent|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H being NF, he understandably shose the trump contract|pg||
nt|peachy: chose*|pg||
nt|peachy: the tenaces would have been nice though, to have lead come into|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|vugraphA2: Or if you have an ipad http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil asking iff Andy has something good for him and Andy says INDEED|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|vugraphA2: Notice Nabil falsecards on every trick - so predictable|pg||

nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout at 2-level   i assume that also applies at 3-level|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could miss a laydown 6C even facing PH, or play doomed 3N with 5C spread|pg||
nt|djneill:  well, North cooperated by not transferring, this looks a little odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  unless not play transfers|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: l in 2 spadesBruce transferred and Pau;|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that description actually covers 1@D, 1@H & 1@S opener's  filling in the correct suit for the 5+|pg||
nt|djneill:  astuted of the caped crusader|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Paul stuffed up - thank goodness|pg||

pc|dK|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: too fast for me -- i'm still thinking about whether declarer was supposed to attack @D before @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Daily Bulletins from the World Championships that just ended in Philadelphia -- they actually printed a reminder that Declarer was allowed to ask an opponent to confirm none ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when failing to follow suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: East looking puzzled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not more than me|pg||

nt|tejjyid: natural-esque|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill:  so South is playing on the fact West must play the penalty card on the first @h, even if he holds the @hK!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if N id unsure what 5H means, what he does knwo uis that almost all his strength consists of cards that S probably doesnt care about since only red suits have been bid|pg||

mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: all N has is a fifth heart, but it does not feel like enough. after all S did not opoen 2C. in fact S indeed did even HAVE a 2C opener, yet slam was hopeless, so that says it all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|means h|nt|vugraphA2: Interesting position for North|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: If I open at all which I will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N is attractive...let them figure it out on lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand was just destined for trouble -- there is no science for bidding hands with 5@D 7@C and singleton Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You know you cant get doubled and you are playing for the money|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Partner has 10 outside diamonds|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(17)18-19 BAL-Semi BAL|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H a good bid for North here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: spec suggest that in fourth seat, 3m should be a transfer to 3N:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: there's a fun twist for the viewers|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C - 18/19 bal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Reese describes a set of hands where raising the overcall with a Doubleton honour is best; this seems like one|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok normal 1@c opening, but 1@d is the equivalent of a 1@h response|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting theoretical/practical issue for W on first round -- make sure u show the four spades and clarify strength later? or make sure you shoiw values and fish for spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: later? i am in the latter camp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: reese never heard of LOTT|pg||
nt|djneill:  (and 1@h would have been a 1@s response)|pg||
nt|djneill:  a Jacobini transfer|pg||
mb|3H|nt|loganrun: ty Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=Puppet 2N|pg||
nt|djneill:  but East does not have to accept - 1@h promises @h tolerance|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: I would try 3@D on second round inviting 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If partner passes here you get the worst of both worlds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what 4th seat 2@D opening is for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, double vs. 2C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: an artificial 2C rebid is a useful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he divine the @H situation??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NO, he never did, and yet still managed to bid quite well. WHich suggests something about LOTT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|vugraphA2: I cant believe North is thinking here|pg||
nt|peachy: the moment.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS may be playing rosenkranz X & XX so forced to XX to show an honor, which a raise over the double would deny|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3H is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now simple Stayman|pg||
mb|4D|nt|peachy: that decides the fate of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now maybe an overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid 2@C as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: why would this EW auction ven be forcing? ne of the problems with an initial double|pg||
nt|djneill:  with various checkbacks available, the jumps may be forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  3NT was odd however|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: i mean, from W point of view why would 3C be forcing?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm suprised @C was adequate|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not that odd -- 11 of his 14 points are in unbid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: he is thinking how lucky he is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice pressure bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: amazing pass, given the @D Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the D flaw ntwithstanding|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes it depends if West is looking for slam potentially since East has a slam oriented hand with a @s cue|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: but probably just make|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|peachy: he needed just one heart trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is possible that 3N there was a spade cuebid, allowing them to use the step bid of 3S as a grope of some sort|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: just delaying the inevitable claim for 9 tricks ??|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2c was puppet to 2d i think, but the pass is simply not consistent|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: best lead to give defense a chance was king of clubs. looks absurd of course but it is amazing how often it is right from this holdiong|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: when in dummy  I think trump gives play for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using 2@C opening this way, they can actually get out in 2@H/@S via transfers   interesting concept|pg||

nt|marlowepi: will NS go on over 4S?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|loganrun: Another 'percentage' action|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: surprising push there|pg||
mb|3D|an|spades|nt|tejjyid: OK, I have to go, but that should raise the average standard of the commentary|pg||
nt|tejjyid: c u all later|pg||
nt|djneill:  2NT inquiry, 3@d showing @s we guess|pg||
mb|d!|nt|vugraphA2: Try again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multitasking is hard|pg||
nt|loganrun: West knows what is happening with the biggest hand at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx andrew see you:)|pg||
nt|djneill:  9 card fit + oxygen = game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: EW have 3N but NS play 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You left out the invesrted commas :EASY"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we could all leave, that would be an infinite increase|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this time David wanted  BBO to offer    delete PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is Lavings -- asks 5-card Major AND size|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, S owes N a 1D opening, i think, even red|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=12-13 HCP, not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4cards, INV|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: unlucky|pg||
pc|d4|nt|loganrun: Unfortunately this will not work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from earlier hand I'm a bit surprised Bilski chose DBL rather than 1@S    maybe the difference was bidding over 1@H rather than a minor|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: we have seen a plethora of singleton Kings this match|pg||
nt|djneill:  North obliges South with a @d lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: 10 cold anyway it would seem|pg||
nt|djneill:  now it is not so clear, South should now play the @hA in order to get a signal from North|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 3 on the one board was my fav.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 fell to the Ace -- but the 3rd snuck through to beat the contract|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|peachy: kibitzers' dream to have interesting boards!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and all three were offside|pg||

nt|djneill:  hmm, entries now to set up the clubs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why bother?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|loganrun: Hoping partner might have 1 heart (out by 2)|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes that makes more sense|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished board  9 -- but they started with  15  so we're not as far ahead as some think|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Mike throwing those winning clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-16 HCP, 5+@S, unbal |pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't matter on this layout -- but i'm still wondering|pg||
nt|loganrun: Fine line between - genius and goat|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe it is W who opened 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: can make 8 spades on round suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 2 boards left in our room  the other room still has to play EIGHT  [8]|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphA2: Yes well spotted|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 21 was a similar auction to 3@h, and 22 both tables got to the doomed @s game|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: sexier than the clkub ruiff for 14|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Mike counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: He will guess club ruff for 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will do it -- but don't let your children see the use of 4N with unstopped @D suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to INSERT PASS|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|ahollan1: on the intricate auction that led to 6@C+1 here -- the other room played ... 3@D!!!|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1H - on the way to 6 at least|pg||
nt|djneill:  North throws in a little @d action to attract a raise or something|pg||
mb|3D|an|hmeans spades|nt|marlowepi: 4N?  avert eyes, o ye of faint gizzard|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Whibley doesn't know that his void is working|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E could easily have openeing bid with no D control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has super max for bidding to date|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|loganrun: Justin believes that Michael will not open the same 1H hand as he did!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 1@S is usually unbal -- but this is 3rd seat |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Howard still blasts knowing they're off  2 keycards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphA2: If east has no diamond contro how bad will 5@S be|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphA2: Claiming|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: ke says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh do the replies to 4N inform about diamond control?|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Well done Mike says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i dont know their system|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: 2 key cards so must have @D control problem arises if one key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, exactly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: It is a little different game when light openings are systemic|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: the 4 card major struck in open room|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why it would make a difference|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I fixed the bidding have a look at top|pg||

nt|ahollan1: just 2 more boards for our table in this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i missed a trick - thought there was going to be a trump left in dummy |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: We have another game from this tournament in 3 days time. Hope you can join us|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and such a boring one to start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose, 1 round forcing 1@C|pg||
nt|loganrun: Bad spade break stopped the grand and the 3-1 trump break - things are tough eh|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Whibley started with 2@C rather than Prescott's DBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: South says 1NT is clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. W is a LOT closer to bidding 4H over an invitation than E is to bidding 4. for several reasons, in fact...for example, if they do bid 4S how will you feel?|pg||
nt|djneill:  seemed like a good shot, very unlikely to set that 4@s otherwise on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe  the psychic transfer|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: North maybe throwing smoke in the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Suction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here ius something u dont see every day. a 20/20 hand with no voids and eaxh side can make gam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry only one void|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Lavings in deep thought|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tactical bidding situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugrapha2: South thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may stop EW from competing -- but what about partner?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems like 3@S overstates the non existent defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: but i think it is called something else in New Zealand and Australia|pg||
nt|loganrun: At this vul - perhaps 'Suck'tion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=constructive   7-10 HCP, 3+@S|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Three obvious losers but some work to be done here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H splinter?   is that really the agreement or just Nabil's intent??|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: So we can see the OR went -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still NS have a sac but 5@S home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear what N is up to, without knowing their understandings. might be trying to buy it in hearts as cheaply as possible by pretending to sound slammish|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  West, a passed hand, has a great hand for @h - a 4@h here seems reasonable - as East might have 16-17 so a 3@h is courtesy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugrapha2: Hung grinnign whne he puts down dummy|pg||
nt|djneill:  oof|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: 2S presumably constructive, as otyherwise E just has an inbvite|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: suddenly Nick is too scared to type to the room     in Zone 7  Suction is known as TWERB|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: essentially  a suit bid shows  either  a) the next suit up   or   b) the other 2 suits|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: and a questionable invite at that, with bad trumps and a gaggle of queens|pg||
nt|loganrun: North had both!! - just in case partner forgot|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sort of cant see selling to 4S, but maybe 3S was trying to fetch a D noise from S, so when that didnt happen N thought the save might be too expensive or that iin one way or ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another 5H did not have enough upside/downside ratio|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: Noble would take down 1 in a second if they gave him the option|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: sorry i mean a questionable co nstructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: OOps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: never the suit that was bid    but since the artificial call is non-forcing  it brings a lot of uncertainty to the opening bidders side|pg||
