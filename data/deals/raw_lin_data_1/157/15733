mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am not in love with 3@D next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wth a dubious @SK|pg||

nt|jbgood: sometimes you got to do what a man/woman's got to do - bidding being one of them|pg||

pc|dT|pc|cT|pc|d4|nt|tomi2: Bocchi and Auken played together in last year's Europeam Championships in San Remo, I was allowed to play my first boards in that event against them. They did not have too many ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: agreements and not even a convention card, maybe that has changed since then|pg||

nt|hedyg: seems he was afraid of being tapped out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is a fantastic result for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S can make of either minor if they guess clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5|pg||
nt|hedyg: well the bid of 3@d by N not to my taste|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: normal intermediate jump overcall|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: there is nothing normal about the N hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's too strong|pg||
mb|3S|an|weak|nt|Walddk2: It's a 4-loser hand after all|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 4 losers|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Roland :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: maybe too strong but you can say the same for 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Consonni should have doubled 3@S to show the unbid suits and tolerance for diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 4NT should show 6-4 in minors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that too wild?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Roland, vulnerable it is wild|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Never 4NT with 7-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: well hey! i prefer 4NT to pass!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers suggesting 3@S overcall asking for spade stop, but for that the heart void is a serious flaw|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|hedyg: you are picky Martin LOL|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are we being influenced by south's clubs we all see|pg||
nt|hedyg: a tiny flaw|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: But 4NT by North can't be right in the long run. What does partner choose with 1-3 in the minors?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: rehi - had to reboot|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 6 card suit |pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Jon|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: anything is better than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and a solid 7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: ok the 6+ suit :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: 3@D followed by 5@C gets the suit lengths right at least|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe he should have bid 5@d in the first place|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: What do you call AKQJ10xx?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: i dont think you can bid 5@c with 4 cards|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|tomi2: Bocchi has no a natural and a strong 1@C opener :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine grand slam in spades; you just need to cash the 'right' honour first|pg||
nt|peachy: If NS sacrifice in a minor, they might be sweetly surprised to make, just takes correct club guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D on the right viuw in @C - and only a @H-ruff can defeat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: That's a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a clue will be that you won't get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you have to figure out why|pg||
nt|tomi2: either leader has 3 spades with the queen or no spade at all? :)=|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a pure guess as I said|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: of course, sacrifice in these colors is seldom a good idea|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7NT is perhaps better, sometimes you can make it even if you misguess spades|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: would u all bid only 1 time in N? many would bid 4NT over 4@S = 6+@d and 4 card @c |pg||
nt|peachy: I would not jump|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: I think they will get to 7@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: or not|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D asks for the @SQ, and 6@S says she has it but no other king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a grand slam we all want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks 4@H already showed her @HK so she doesn't want to bid 6@H there|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 5@D asks for trump queen which I think it does, what would 5@S be then?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|pc|h3|nt|tomi2: this board can cause a swing that you cant repair in lots of other boards by playing well. and this is just "luck" if oth other table plays 7@S and wins / fails...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Sabine tried to show a 6th spade with no queen by jumping to 6@S?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|nt|athene: well most play that 5@S would deny the queen and anything else shows it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: 2-3 0r 4@D is not the problem - would u bid over 4@S?? |pg||
nt|peachy: Then again, if I did jump, which is reasonable, partner then knows to ecxpect a marvelous hand when vul against not-vul|pg||
mc|10|nt|pelu: but next time pd will have @HA and not @CA :(:(|pg||

nt|jbgood: against 5 @h...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can you make it if they lead a spade?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade lead seems to beat 5@H|pg||

nt|pelu: pass and 5@D = one-man-show :)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Can be difficult to stop Sabine|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|peachy: In fact, the current trend (according to some articles from experts lately) is to have Forciong Pass "On" only  *When the caddy knows it is forcing*|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: Sabine has said in print that she likes bidding 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C as it can be very hard for opps to sort out major-suit fits and stoppers for notrumps|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the same applies for 2@C over 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|athene: it's sensible to be able to bid clubs naturally over a short club, i think  - you just use 2@D as michaels or whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|tomi2: non forcing free bids would have allowed south to bid 2@H here and let her partner decide to bid on 3 level|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose there has to be a good hand for negative free bids every so often |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: can 4@S make? - 3Nt makes easy|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp Franco to make 4@s :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if you wanted to get cute here you would play transfers (2@D = hearts, 2@H = spades, 2@S = diamonds)|pg||

nt|emre kaya: bu elde partskor yarýþmasý þeklinde geçicek|pg||
nt|emre kaya: çok heyecanlý deðil|pg||
nt|emre kaya: e-w ekip @H ile yarýþacak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not at the table|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Zia once said: "A lady who speaks so little  ... I'll marry her right away"  :)|pg||
nt|pelu: S X (as penalty) and N bid 3@D?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: in my book the X is not penalty|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand up now. Thank you to FIGB for bringing this event to BBO. Also thanks to our operator Daniela for an excellent job!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|emre kaya: halbuki ns ekipte puan biraz daha fazla|pg||
mb|3S|nt|emre kaya: yok þimdi düzelecek tabiki bu tip hatalar canlý yayýnlarda olabiliyor |pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: no diamond overcall|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but DBL isn't penalty - i think menas medium force (but i prefere use this with 3@D...|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to run, bye everybody!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably the choose of dbl with only 2@D because AQ in the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|pelu: Daniala are u sure that East passed over 1@D - not a negativ D? - that makes the 4@H more risonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: that's taking diplomatic silence to an unfortunate extreme if you ask me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She is a cautious bidder I think it's fair to say|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: 4@H is a bid with 52 cards - Franco know sgl/void in @s in East|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are all trying to be diplomatic|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the fit in one red suit is sure|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|emre kaya: 2@S çok iyi bi kontrat NS için yapýlýr gibi duruyor|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Anyway, last board of the match in this room|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Daniela, our terrific operator in Salsomaggiore|pg||
nt|athene: @HA?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to Bill and Tomi, my excellent fellow commentators|pg||
nt|athene: i was expecting an ace but not that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H is a little ingenous|pg||
mc|11|nt|bridge_one: in this situation the sgl in @S isn't a value, because east know tha partner can read that|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge is so easy if u bid your own hand - here a D from East over 1@S|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - 51H sh be void in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose last hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bye Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: by Giorgio - and all spects :)|pg||
