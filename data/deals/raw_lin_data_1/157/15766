mb|5D|mb|p|nt|tomi2: Bocchi has no a natural and a strong 1@C opener :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine grand slam in spades; you just need to cash the 'right' honour first|pg||
nt|peachy: If NS sacrifice in a minor, they might be sweetly surprised to make, just takes correct club guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D on the right viuw in @C - and only a @H-ruff can defeat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That's a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a clue will be that you won't get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you have to figure out why|pg||
nt|tomi2: either leader has 3 spades with the queen or no spade at all? :)=|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 7NT is perhaps better, sometimes you can make it even if you misguess spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: would u all bid only 1 time in N? many would bid 4NT over 4@S = 6+@d and 4 card @c |pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: or not|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D asks for the @SQ, and 6@S says she has it but no other king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a grand slam we all want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks 4@H already showed her @HK so she doesn't want to bid 6@H there|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: If 5@D asks for trump queen which I think it does, what would 5@S be then?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|tomi2: this board can cause a swing that you cant repair in lots of other boards by playing well. and this is just "luck" if oth other table plays 7@S and wins / fails...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Sabine tried to show a 6th spade with no queen by jumping to 6@S?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: Sabine has said in print that she likes bidding 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C as it can be very hard for opps to sort out major-suit fits and stoppers for notrumps|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|tomi2: non forcing free bids would have allowed south to bid 2@H here and let her partner decide to bid on 3 level|pg||

nt|athene: if you wanted to get cute here you would play transfers (2@D = hearts, 2@H = spades, 2@S = diamonds)|pg||
