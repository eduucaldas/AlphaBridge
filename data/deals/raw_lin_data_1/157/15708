nt|vugraphzat: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Defence should prevail with the clubs 4-2|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a raise to 2NT--which I do not like.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: sorry lost connection|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: I have to admit I'm in the 1N-3N camp.|pg||
nt|garnetts: with AQxxx in a minor it will be 5 tricks a lot of the time and you should bid 3NT in my view because partner will never know that|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: For once we agree Gad |pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect this will a swing for Wales|pg||
nt|vugraphzat:  it asks strength. 2N is min 3C is max|pg||
nt|suketbombi: disaster|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d2|pc|c7|nt|kista: 4@s i guess|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|viren169: Is it too late to change my mind!?!?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|garnetts: The crux of this hand comes next --|pg||
nt|viren169: Whatever opener has.. 3N is a good bet most of the time!|pg||
nt|viren169: Oh dear... Flat board - I lost again!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|viren169: What would you have bid David with East's hand?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is an interesting auction--North could not find a bid over 2@H --but in my view should have over 3@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: @CT lead wod have been a hit:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I would have bid 4@H as East|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzat: open room in 4@h im told|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H pre-emptively is likely to get them in too often |pg||

pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|viren169: North had 1 eye on the vul I guess...|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: after 3@H North might try 3NT  for the minors or in view the double implies minors as he might have acted before with spades |pg||

nt|pelu: diff to defeat 4@S - after 2x@h and @D - take 2x@s - @C to !Q - @C10 to J - N can ruff but the 5. @C can be ruffed in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|pelu: would u all bid 3@C when u have a passed pd?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: and would u open 2@H with a 4 card @S?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: it is safe alright...but if u hvv a pd who flashes a red card on oppo cont based on your o/c then it is risky|pg||

nt|garnetts: its the old issue though --you are likely to have a fit unless East is being sneaky trying to catch you |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: last board for the day...tomorrow morning 9.30 session 19|pg||
