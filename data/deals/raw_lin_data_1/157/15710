mb|p|mb|2S|nt|viren169: I have to admit I'm in the 1N-3N camp.|pg||
nt|garnetts: with AQxxx in a minor it will be 5 tricks a lot of the time and you should bid 3NT in my view because partner will never know that|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||
