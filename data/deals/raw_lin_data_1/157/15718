nt|Walddk2: 10-12 and 1-2|pg||
nt|daman: if North opens 1NT    East will leap in I'm sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: Hi everyone, we ara waiting for new boards and should start in a minute|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a double showing a minor/major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nine matches of 24 boards over nine Wednesdays. This is the first half of a match from round 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Quite symmetric in @S+@D, with both K onside.  Difficult to play @H 4-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|daman: must be playing weak NT|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|p|nt|daman: this could be very perilous for EW|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rmb1: Weak NT still common in Berks/Bucks where Mueller team is from.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for the tournament website with standings after round 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: west breathes a sigh of relief, I'd expect.|pg||
nt|daman: North just snatched defeat from victory|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

nt|daman: if they get frisky|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks tough to find 12 tricks, especially as cards lie|pg||
nt|daman: tough to find 10|pg||
nt|daman: sorry 11|pg||
nt|daman: according to the CR |pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: It's not unreasonable to go down in 5 on this layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: How are you going to play it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I agree|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe the defense was suboptimal,  since they'd be satisfied with a plus against a 5-level contract.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|daman: Ed     try not to use words with more than 2 syllables     it gives me a headache :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Would 4@D be better than 3@D to show @H support and shortage|pg||
nt|daman: that was a strange auction|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: I guess Chadha wanted to show a mild slam try with 4 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems normal to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps 3@H would not have been forcing.  I'm not big on leaping around with realtively weak support of a secondary suit.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: then maybe 4@D would have been a better bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Now it's time for declarer to find the best way to 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: I suggest cross-ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: that's what south thinks, too|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Still seven trumps and @SA @CAK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: Except for the surprise in @C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We just overruff if South ruffs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rmb1: If South had ruffed EW make the rest|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can ruff. play @HKQ and then clubs, losing just a club ruff|pg||

nt|danilo1: overbidding possibility for NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks in @s on N if not @s had been 3-0 unlucky!|pg||
nt|danilo1: played by N ... 6@S really good contract ... but unlucky|pg||

nt|mrt2000: how DID N manage to pass 4@S?|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good brakes according to the @s split. Probably a win. But I thinh declarer is a little bit disappointed so far|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mrt2000: but much better now !!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but  now:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I rather believe that South should not bid just 4@S ... North is not very maximum, so his pass on 4@S OK for me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 3@s so N can bid 4@c|pg||

mb|1N|an|12-14|mb|p|nt|danilo1: probably same reason :)|pg||
