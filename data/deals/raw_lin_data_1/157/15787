nt|Walddk4: Dorthe and Peter|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|tomi2: they used to play natural against me then but they can have worked on a system, one spec believes they play some kind of strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Aakirkeby is from the smalest distrikt. Bornholm - and Ravenkilde from Vejle in Jutland|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tomi2: Bocchi has no a natural and a strong 1@C opener :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine grand slam in spades; you just need to cash the 'right' honour first|pg||
nt|peachy: If NS sacrifice in a minor, they might be sweetly surprised to make, just takes correct club guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D on the right viuw in @C - and only a @H-ruff can defeat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: That's a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a clue will be that you won't get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you have to figure out why|pg||
nt|tomi2: either leader has 3 spades with the queen or no spade at all? :)=|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a pure guess as I said|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: of course, sacrifice in these colors is seldom a good idea|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|garnetts: Is 1@S enough?   21S likely to be forcing |pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: sorry Ravnkilde from north Jutland|pg||
nt|momad: 6ru kan vinde|pg||
nt|garnetts: Certainly 1@S shows  plus values unless playing equal conversion |pg||
nt|garnetts: However this should make |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S imo shows values of more then an opening hand + length of @S suit.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|momad: Det ligner en 13'er til Rødovre|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7NT is perhaps better, sometimes you can make it even if you misguess spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: a heart lead would have scared East--would he dare play a club to the K|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: would u all bid only 1 time in N? many would bid 4NT over 4@S = 6+@d and 4 card @c |pg||
nt|peachy: I would not jump|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: I think they will get to 7@S|pg||
nt|pelu: outside Hobro|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: or not|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D asks for the @SQ, and 6@S says she has it but no other king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a grand slam we all want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks 4@H already showed her @HK so she doesn't want to bid 6@H there|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well you need a foricing bid after a takeout double and it is practical to play jumps as one round forces reserving the cue bid to strong support |pg||
pc|d7|nt|momad: Well bid by Jensen. He is fast and not afraid of anything|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 5@D asks for trump queen which I think it does, what would 5@S be then?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: But there may well be other methods but agreement is as ever required |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a claim  coming |pg||
nt|rnmalik: minimum 9 on the table.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: this board can cause a swing that you cant repair in lots of other boards by playing well. and this is just "luck" if oth other table plays 7@S and wins / fails...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Sabine tried to show a 6th spade with no queen by jumping to 6@S?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|athene: well most play that 5@S would deny the queen and anything else shows it|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: 2-3 0r 4@D is not the problem - would u bid over 4@S?? |pg||
nt|peachy: Then again, if I did jump, which is reasonable, partner then knows to ecxpect a marvelous hand when vul against not-vul|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|athene: i assume 3@C showed values so south should be moving here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone prefer 2NT rather than double?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: 2nt gets your hand across so you aren't going to miss a game if it's there, but double might be a bit safer i suppose|pg||

nt|momad: I was wrong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: i guess you take the club finesse and then if east turns up with @CQxxx so you can't run them, you just need to bring in 2 spade tricks|pg||

nt|momad: A big position by N|pg||

nt|oleberg: Good thing this hand happened after the kids have been sent to bed|pg||
nt|momad: I am told that south D 2d|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then maybe north was to passive?|pg||
nt|oleberg: But still difficult|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|tomi2: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2010/CXSQMX/turno.asp?serie=1&turno=1&girone=1 this should be the direct link|pg||
nt|Walddk2: These are difficult hands to bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can clik on the teams name and see players (some even with a cpicture)|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 1nt with south rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one can make much|pg||
nt|athene: the idea you can then make a non-forcing bid in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D N-S the maximum it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|tomi2: I see even Zaleski from France is playing in this event|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Bocchi must be a bit worried about his partner bidding diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: but he decides to face that problem when and if it occurs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is 3@D now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Natural I would say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With club raise you bid 2@S or 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Isn't that hand worth about 3@D?|pg||
nt|athene: Sabine gets her 2@S bid out but she would prefer north to bid so she doesn't have to use it|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT down 1 in CR - lauria play @C7 - but why in 3Nt - 4@S easy game|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Not getting results from OR-slow .|pg||
pc|h2|nt|momad: I like the opening by S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: 2@D = multi but prob a 18-19 NT in the system|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: or might she consider passing?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why bid 3 when you can be doubled in 2 :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|athene: on the principle that even if it makes it's not a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 380 will still hurt|pg||
nt|athene: clearly she didn't expect Bocchi to have a singleton diamond for a t/o double (effectively) of hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: This an annoying symetrical distribution hand where 3NT is better than 4@H |pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: but he also made a "take out" double od 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure she fully expects this to make but decides that anything else might well be worse|pg||
nt|pelu: no entry to dummy so decl has to play @Hs from hand - and make 5@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: likely stiff club lead |pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|d3|nt|garnetts: ZP we used to call this type of contract --Zero play|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: OK, only 1 overtrick then|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Ruff even|pg||
nt|athene: exactly what you show when you double one suit for takeout then double another suit, is something any regular partnership should discuss|pg||
nt|athene: you either play the first double just shows strength so the second one is takeout shape|pg||
nt|athene: or you play that the first one should have the right shape and the second one just shows extras|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: why 3@S - in this bidding West never has a 4 card major - just a bid to help opp|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: great decision, with bad hearts W opted for 4-3 spades|pg||

pc|d8|nt|athene: maybe he was just relying on the auction to show he couldn't have anything|pg||

pc|d2|nt|garnetts: I would bid 4@H too --but I would also pass the opening bid--matter of taste |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: i.e. north to bid stayman should have both majors or values, and he hasn't got spades, ergo...|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1N|mb|d|mb|p|nt|peachy: I|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm venturing a guess that they play control or step responses :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: EW yönünde 1.ler Ünal ÖZÇOPUR-Zahit AKSOY %59.00 |pg||
nt|pelu: looks like 2@C asking for controls - 2@S= 3 controls - 3@S suit|pg||
nt|jni33:  I would never bid 4@s with that N hand vul aginst non vul -- would you ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Now come to the last board of this segment and the next round would commence in 20 minutes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 6NT a little hasty|pg||
nt|pelu: After 4 matches (out of 11): One-Eyed Jacks and Odense 86 VP, BK Nord 82. Ravnkilde No6 and Åkirkeby no 10|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: What is their NT range I wonder, 14-16?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|emre kaya: 2.ler Ayþegül EROÐLU-Birgül KÖSE %54.00|pg||
nt|athene: EW are 14-16? or sabine just feels happy at the moment?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whatever it is, she will pass now|pg||
nt|athene: not with four hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Maria Dam Mortensen, our hard working and excellent operator at Køge|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Logical pass of 2@H by E.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|emre kaya: bu skorlara göre ÞEN-SAYILKAN çifti çok avantajlý görünüyor turnuvayý kazanmak için |pg||
nt|peachy: control responses, while often useful, do tend to drive the auction high very soon|pg||
nt|pelu: do they just shuffel the bidding cards a see what bid will fall on the table :) - 7@S a great contract|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H then|pg||
nt|peachy: E csannot support spades with a 4S bid, for fear that W passes it, what should she do?|pg||
nt|garnetts: the lead really matters here--must be a club I think |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Try tto pronounce Køge if you are not from Scandinavia :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: one down on the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, if they find it|pg||
nt|athene: south has found it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win in hand and a heart up. Then what?|pg||
nt|orhoj: This is the last board. Next round start at 15.05 (in 20 minutes) - Odense-BK Nord|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: You are unlikely to get it right|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|emre kaya: deklerasyonda anlaþmazlýk çýktý bakalým nerde duracaklar|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What if partner has the singleton queen?|pg||
nt|pelu: only a @C-lead can defeat 6@h|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In OR it was the Q@S.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: then he does not have @SA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can not even cross the o:)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|athene: yes, not trivial|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|emre kaya: kuzey karo çýkamazsa 6@H yapýlacak|pg||
nt|orhoj: last board - next round start 13.25 (1 hour) - Odense - One-Eyed Jacks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: and well done to declarer for playing the trumps that way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right, the  ø  is special and the   g   is mute|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: if she led towards her hand, or led the queen, south would not be going wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only now does South realise what might have gone wrong|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: goodbye, spade losers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From down 1 to +2 perhaps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Not sure why it's there at all, you can't hear it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all. CU.|pg||
