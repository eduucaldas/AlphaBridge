nt|marlowepi: game here ns|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for NS is available under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26/Australia.aspx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: delay as Hung as 1 blue and 12 red cards|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Team Horwitz has 5 youngsters  - and Horwitz|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury   2@H=I'm so ashamed|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Hi all for the final set|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even so -- with 4333 converting to penalty had to be an option|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: lots of work for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: And Hung wearing his traditional cap making it harder to see his reactions|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Andy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|loganrun: All the action is with South at the moment and his mental toughness is tested with 2 slam decisions|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: Ruff and discards best defence here|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Prescott not sure what is going on.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: too fast for me -- i'm still thinking about whether declarer was supposed to attack @D before @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Daily Bulletins from the World Championships that just ended in Philadelphia -- they actually printed a reminder that Declarer was allowed to ask an opponent to confirm none ...|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: Same score likely maybe doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they printed that because each NCBO [National Contract Bridge Organization] is allowed to set rules about who can/can't ask|pg||
nt|peachy: It was a difficult hand to play, but leaving 3SX in would have been worse, it might have well made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what about OUR mental toughness???|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: another multi-purpose 1@C probably better than PASS|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H from west wide range opposite a limited 1@H opener|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: A club ruff is a trick the defence would get anyway likely declarer will lose 1-1-1-1 for one down|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphA2: Any other Vul I would have bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D is the ONLY positive response  shows any hand with 6+ HCP|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: for west or east?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think WEst can bid the 4th without fear of criticism|pg||

nt|loganrun: oops - who can blame North?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: David -- you get encouraged at other vulnerability when partner passes twice??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's true the 4441 is a bit sterile, but, overall, that's a big hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: only if they think you have to be very weak rather than just very offensively oriented. and in any case they wont bid one if they dont fiind a fit they are confident is adequate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if you dont expect to make can bid it, they probably sacrifice|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Because presumably West must act|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that lets NS escape when they have a runout spot and u were making|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how could defense stop that after the @D lead?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly for Southy the thoughtful 3@D bid has turned into information that makes West very confident abloutslam|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the method played by EW for 1N X Pass seems theoretically questionable because it giuves the opps the whole two level when E is 2 suited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E has a 2 suited runout, the n it is fine, but withg a hand that might produce a game ui think a different call is in order, e.g. 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: On the 4@S going down 2 and you asked what the result at the other table might be 5@H -2 and 9 imps to Noble|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Both sides need to avoid trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Sorry 5@HX -1|pg||
