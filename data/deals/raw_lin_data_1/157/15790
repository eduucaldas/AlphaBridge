mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Looking back at the deal, Bill, do you think it is right to cash one top heart or two before going for the ruffs? There seem to be risks in both approaches.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: yes, sometimes you do want to cash both so you don't get the king ruffed |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: 2 seems ok Maybe pitch another @c on the 4th|pg||
nt|athene: but here if you just take two ruffs and then play ace and a spade, that solves all problems i think|pg||
nt|athene: just play for spades to break 3-2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, you can then afford a top heart to be ruffed.|pg||
nt|athene: right because it would be with the master trump at that point|pg||
nt|vugraph814: playing area much quieter than yesterday|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraph814: even Zia's table :)|pg||
nt|athene: the @D9 is a nice card for declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: This seems easier and she may win the board|pg||
nt|athene: she might be asking if the @D10 can be something cute like AJ10xx|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraph814: susan did ask if 10s can be anything "special"|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: at pure imps scoring you don't care, but with the BAM element, maybe you should be slightly interested in your second overtrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|12/14|mb|2N!|nt|jtr: Might stop in 2@s here|pg||
nt|jtr: oh wow!|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East was a bit lucky to end in the right minor suit. Always a risk when you show a two-suiter on 6-4 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: An awkward auction for NS|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South is a passed hand and North has a lot in the minors. Oh, he has bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|athene: if you try to go for a penalty and then find you can't double, you are often very poorly-placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: here of course south is limited as a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: but if he weren't it wouldn't even be clear if 3@S was forcing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: Quite surprised North didnt double 3@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would open 1@S on most 11-counts with 5 spades, so North's 3NT is a bit ambitious.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, more upside than passing 3@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's true of every overbid!|pg||
nt|athene: on the bidding you would expect diamonds to be 5-3, which is much worse news for prospects in 3nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he might have the @HK|pg||
nt|brolucius: East seems to have concluded that North holds only two spades and West will therefore have five.|pg||
nt|brolucius: More likely, really, that North is attempting 3NT on the basis of a spade fit.|pg||

pc|c5|nt|brolucius: That will be limit-or-better raise with four trumps, since East has gone on anyway. |pg||
nt|jtr: They did well to reach the game at least To limit the damage|pg||
nt|athene: everyone happily responds to opening bids with nothing these days but it can go wrong, as NS found in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: still if south had just opened a sensible 1NT, all that would have been avoided|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||

nt|ady: looks like losing 2 heart tricks    but may still get home|pg||
nt|henryb:  Because so much more rides on the Imp results -- a game swing typically is worth about 3VP, -- players tend to play for their contract and only for overtricks when the contract is not at risk|pg||

nt|lestergold: to be fair it is somewhat unlucky and will probably be a push|pg||
nt|henryb:  the negative double might have presented a road map, but he failed to read the map|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention the disposal of @d losers|pg||

nt|viren169: Declarer will lose control of this hand now|pg||
nt|viren169: And wished he had opened 1@D|pg||
nt|ady: well  no 10@D    but if diamonds need to be ruffed out  likley there will be an overruff  so might as well take trump finesses at trick 2   and hoped for 3-3  and 10@D comes down |pg||
nt|vugraphzty: sorry I've gone wrong in the play somewhere|pg||

pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Yes, the killer|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to ruff two hearts you can't afford to cash the @SA if you want to take the finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: True.|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not quite that trivial|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer's worry is that North had 4@ds|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe best to try a @d now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure cashing the @HK was right - more danger of an overruff now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: refusing the spade finesse to ensure two heart ruffs was safe for ten tricks on a 3-2 trump break|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure i would touch trumps at this stage|pg||
nt|athene: and also avoids a possible diamond ruff|pg||

pc|h2|nt|paulg:  i guess 3@h shows some values, given the alert and subsequent 4@h call|pg||
nt|ady: hand 8   contract 4@H  so Olympiad catching up|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: er second best lead|pg||
