nt|psridhar: also with the grand hand kushaari wd hv bid more than just 2c|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari's 2@c limited hand to 17 hcp, his jump to 3@s bid out his 3-1-5-4 shape and showed max (16-17) based on his earlier action (upto 17)|pg||
nt|rv: overall well bid by Kushari and especially Laltu for making crucial final decision|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S for me just show distrbution - if pd bid 3NT npw then he can invite with 4NT (no suit = not for keycard)|pg||
