mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@h is a big bid with so few points|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|paulg:  i expect 2@s is game forcing |pg||
nt|paulg:  and they may get to another 5@d missing three top tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course, no game makes legitimately|pg||
nt|paulg:  but to beat 3NT you must lead a club and defend accurately|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but i don't think Murdoch will stop at 3NT after the reverse|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  hard to imagine partner holding a reverse with only one ace, when you have three kings|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  as Jake has mentioned, could even get to the diamond grand slam if there is confusion over 1 or 4 key cards|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|ralfwil: 8-card suits on S as well as N|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  perhaps it went fast at the end and he did not pitch all his diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 3NT is a 4-level minor pre-empt, or a flawed solid suit?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: in the old days it was a running suit, but time has changed.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hemant jalan  , leads alpha    75-0|pg||
nt|mango joe: wow!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|paulg:  difficult for East to move on, despite his controls|pg||

nt|mango joe: who won the final Ian?|pg||
nt|ian111:  both sides can make 10 tricks in a minor|pg||
nt|ian111:  which final ?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Hemant or Scotland?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Commonwealth Games Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzat:  Hemant Jalan leads Alpha by 75-0:   Arun Jain leads Magic Eyes( thailand) by 22:   Australia leads Formidables 51-19|pg||
nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||
nt|mango joe: India has a lot of depth in bridge, many ggod teams|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|nt|mango joe: was 4@D forcing here? I think not|pg||
nt|ian111:  hard to stop, but a lack of Aces ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  3C usually FG|pg||
nt|mango joe: esp after S opens|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  there is little worse than leading a trump to cut down dummy's ruffs and seeing 3334 put down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|ian111:  slight danger if CA led|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||

nt|paulg:  unless he leads a club|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: murdoch waiting for P to lead:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  this is a situation where North might underlead the ace of hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ian111:  needs a H guess and C finesse|pg||
nt|ian111:  could try 3NT and hope to avoid a H lead|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||
nt|paulg:  a slam swing on board 25 has given Hemant Jalan some breathing room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i show two-suiters these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: yet to get a push board|pg||
nt|ian111:  not easy to bid the thin but good 5C|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c is much easier than 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Ian|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ian111:  hi |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  not an easy lead for East to read, although to beat the contract he has little choice about playing West for an honour|pg||
nt|paulg:  or playing West for 98xx|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mango joe: at least the @H guess was easier|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzat: Aus vs Ind 1 for the silver and bronze medal.....Scotland have won the Gold Medal ...|pg||
