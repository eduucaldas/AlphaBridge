nt|Walddk4: Dorthe and Peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|tomi2: they used to play natural against me then but they can have worked on a system, one spec believes they play some kind of strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Aakirkeby is from the smalest distrikt. Bornholm - and Ravenkilde from Vejle in Jutland|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|tomi2: Bocchi has no a natural and a strong 1@C opener :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine grand slam in spades; you just need to cash the 'right' honour first|pg||
nt|peachy: If NS sacrifice in a minor, they might be sweetly surprised to make, just takes correct club guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D on the right viuw in @C - and only a @H-ruff can defeat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: That's a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a clue will be that you won't get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you have to figure out why|pg||
nt|tomi2: either leader has 3 spades with the queen or no spade at all? :)=|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a pure guess as I said|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|peachy: of course, sacrifice in these colors is seldom a good idea|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Is 1@S enough?   21S likely to be forcing |pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: sorry Ravnkilde from north Jutland|pg||
nt|momad: 6ru kan vinde|pg||
nt|garnetts: Certainly 1@S shows  plus values unless playing equal conversion |pg||
nt|garnetts: However this should make |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2@S imo shows values of more then an opening hand + length of @S suit.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|momad: Det ligner en 13'er til Rødovre|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7NT is perhaps better, sometimes you can make it even if you misguess spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: a heart lead would have scared East--would he dare play a club to the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: would u all bid only 1 time in N? many would bid 4NT over 4@S = 6+@d and 4 card @c |pg||
nt|peachy: I would not jump|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: W have showed 14-16NT, E have showed GF with 55 in major|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: I think they will get to 7@S|pg||
nt|pelu: outside Hobro|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: or not|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D asks for the @SQ, and 6@S says she has it but no other king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a grand slam we all want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks 4@H already showed her @HK so she doesn't want to bid 6@H there|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well you need a foricing bid after a takeout double and it is practical to play jumps as one round forces reserving the cue bid to strong support |pg||
pc|hK|nt|momad: Well bid by Jensen. He is fast and not afraid of anything|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 5@D asks for trump queen which I think it does, what would 5@S be then?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|garnetts: But there may well be other methods but agreement is as ever required |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a claim  coming |pg||
nt|rnmalik: minimum 9 on the table.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2: this board can cause a swing that you cant repair in lots of other boards by playing well. and this is just "luck" if oth other table plays 7@S and wins / fails...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Sabine tried to show a 6th spade with no queen by jumping to 6@S?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|athene: well most play that 5@S would deny the queen and anything else shows it|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 2-3 0r 4@D is not the problem - would u bid over 4@S?? |pg||
nt|peachy: Then again, if I did jump, which is reasonable, partner then knows to ecxpect a marvelous hand when vul against not-vul|pg||

nt|pelu: pass and 5@D = one-man-show :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Can be difficult to stop Sabine|pg||
nt|peachy: there is no Forcing Pass in this sort of auction when the 4H was not bid constructively.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: EW can make 4@S but may find difficult to bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: @S-lead to defeat 5@H - and that sh be a notmal lead from East - u cant exp a @D-trick here|pg||
nt|garnetts: very friendly cards for declarer here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: In fact, the current trend (according to some articles from experts lately) is to have Forciong Pass "On" only  *When the caddy knows it is forcing*|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Club !A will beat it right away of course|pg||

nt|athene: play for @dQxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: that would just be one hurdle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he would also have to guess @CJ|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like the 2@D bid - why not 3@C - East will normal have a 5 card @C - and after support he will go after 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|rnmalik: another partial.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: i assume 3@C showed values so south should be moving here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone prefer 2NT rather than double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt gets your hand across so you aren't going to miss a game if it's there, but double might be a bit safer i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: They are still on board 1 in the other room|pg||

nt|tomi2: doubleton queen of clubs onside, this deal will not be misguessed :)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: @SK and duck a @C (in 1Nt) in 3NT u need @Cs 2-2|pg||
nt|momad: I was wrong|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: i guess you take the club finesse and then if east turns up with @CQxxx so you can't run them, you just need to bring in 2 spade tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|momad: THis might be a winner|pg||
nt|oleberg: It will take accurate defence to beat it|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: so you finesse against the nine|pg||
nt|momad: S shows 4 spades with 2H|pg||
nt|momad: A big position by N|pg||
nt|oleberg: West has to discourage hearts, but cannot spare the 9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: west obviously expects something different to what he has just seen in dummy |pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oleberg: The way to defeat it would have been to switch, wait for west to get in with the @DA, and then lead the @HJ to scoop dummys 10|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oleberg: But that wouldn't work, if west had discouraged with the 9, as declarers 8 would then be high|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: 5@C a better game - if @Cs 4-2 make with @hJ in S (max 3)|pg||
nt|oleberg: But perhaps he should have done it anyway, playing partner for the @H8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s9|nt|momad: Martin Schaltz says you should play standard attitude (lav = AFVISNING) when there are two or three small in dummy...|pg||
nt|oleberg: Sounds interesting|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h4|nt|athene: he can't be all that helpful that the defence will let him build a spade trick, but it doesn't hurt to try|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: Sabine has said in print that she likes bidding 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C as it can be very hard for opps to sort out major-suit fits and stoppers for notrumps|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the same applies for 2@C over 1@C|pg||
nt|oleberg: How about J107|pg||
mb|2H!|an|18-19HCP, bal|mb|p|nt|momad: Good result for Nord in closed room|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: it's sensible to be able to bid clubs naturally over a short club, i think  - you just use 2@D as michaels or whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|oleberg: Jeg mente du|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: non forcing free bids would have allowed south to bid 2@H here and let her partner decide to bid on 3 level|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose there has to be a good hand for negative free bids every so often |pg||
nt|momad: 3 diamonds cashing and 1½ spade loser|pg||

pc|dK|nt|pelu: can 4@S make? - 3Nt makes easy|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp Franco to make 4@s :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I admit I would not have looked beyond the J@S for a lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: if you wanted to get cute here you would play transfers (2@D = hearts, 2@H = spades, 2@S = diamonds)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C play of vital importance.|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|garnetts: Notice an intial spade lead would not lead to this situation--passive leads can be taken too far |pg||
nt|rnmalik: exactly|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should give a ruff and discard--then I think East is back to a guess|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|sT|nt|garnetts: Very hard to work it through in defence--but when all else looks bad take the line of least resistence |pg||
nt|garnetts: Finesse the club then I think all is well--even were it to lose--because you still control the spade suit |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|athene: she can't use south's failure to lead a trump to her advantage, really :) he would not lead from a void or Qxx and those are the only two holdings you are worried about|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They did not bid slam on board 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here we have it|pg||
nt|tomi2: dont know what kin of carding they use but the fact, that bocchi never played his 10 but only smaller cards could be a club for sabine, that her partner has @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 6@S was 3 down but 4@S should not be 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala did not open the West hand, that was the difference|pg||

nt|tomi2: interesting to see this :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: These are difficult hands to bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can clik on the teams name and see players (some even with a cpicture)|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 1nt with south rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one can make much|pg||
nt|athene: the idea you can then make a non-forcing bid in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D N-S the maximum it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: I see even Zaleski from France is playing in this event|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: Bocchi must be a bit worried about his partner bidding diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: but he decides to face that problem when and if it occurs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is 3@D now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Natural I would say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With club raise you bid 2@S or 3@C|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that hand worth about 3@D?|pg||
nt|athene: Sabine gets her 2@S bid out but she would prefer north to bid so she doesn't have to use it|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT down 1 in CR - lauria play @C7 - but why in 3Nt - 4@S easy game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: Not getting results from OR-slow .|pg||
pc|d2|nt|momad: I like the opening by S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: 2@D = multi but prob a 18-19 NT in the system|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: or might she consider passing?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Why bid 3 when you can be doubled in 2 :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|athene: on the principle that even if it makes it's not a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 380 will still hurt|pg||
nt|athene: clearly she didn't expect Bocchi to have a singleton diamond for a t/o double (effectively) of hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: This an annoying symetrical distribution hand where 3NT is better than 4@H |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: but he also made a "take out" double od 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure she fully expects this to make but decides that anything else might well be worse|pg||
nt|pelu: no entry to dummy so decl has to play @Hs from hand - and make 5@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: likely stiff club lead |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Eleonora must have been pleasantly surprised when she saw dummy|pg||

pc|dK|pc|c4|nt|garnetts: ZP we used to call this type of contract --Zero play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can count upto 9 only.|pg||
nt|garnetts: take it lead a club--exit Q@S and and await your tricks |pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: OK, only 1 overtrick then|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: @S to A and @H back can give S a posibility to misplay|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c6|nt|peachy: their responses might not be what we expect, 2N appears to be transfer to clubs, or relay|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Ruff even|pg||
nt|athene: exactly what you show when you double one suit for takeout then double another suit, is something any regular partnership should discuss|pg||
nt|athene: you either play the first double just shows strength so the second one is takeout shape|pg||
nt|athene: or you play that the first one should have the right shape and the second one just shows extras|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|peachy: great decision, with bad hearts W opted for 4-3 spades|pg||
nt|peachy: I think 3 also that 3S was unnecessary, W has his 14, just accept the invite|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure - she has gelp for pd's @H-stop|pg||
nt|peachy: *her*|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: I would bid 4@H too --but I would also pass the opening bid--matter of taste |pg||
