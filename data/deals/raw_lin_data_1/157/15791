mb|d|mb|2C|nt|athene: this time 5minorX isn't so bad|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mcphee: i like the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|mcphee: from the other room|pg||
nt|athene: yes 1nt is not so bad|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: definitely too strong for 14-16 but maybe ok for 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|mcphee: wow, may be no stpping W|pg||
nt|mcphee: rather E|pg||
nt|athene: well, just looking at EW you want to be in slam don't you?|pg||
nt|mcphee: you do?|pg||
nt|athene: 4-2 hearts, 2-1 spades and it's not going to present any problems|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: For sure|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is true|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3-0 spades and you might need 3-3 hearts and the right spade guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: however not that often you have slam when opps open the bidding|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: but lets see how he manages|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcphee: so a few imps will exchange hands here|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: he knows he's not favourit now though|pg||
nt|athene: i guess on the bidding he knows hearts can't be 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: and no point playing to ruff hearts hoping that north has the long hearts as well as the trumps|pg||
nt|mcphee: E did a lot of bidding for the hand he held imo|pg||
nt|athene: after the negative double, you know hearts aren't 3-3 and they may be 5-1 so that makes the slam a bit worse but it's still not that bad|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c3|pc|s5|nt|mcphee: so may wonder why E did not make a 2@C bid to show both majors|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: He needs to set the long heart up for his 11th tricj so squeezes don't look promising either|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|henryb:  because he was 6-5, perhaps|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|henryb:  in general with 5-6 Michaels is okay, as partner with equal length will bid hearts. With 6-5 you should generally bid spades, then hearts|pg||

nt|yo_yo: the Lederer is an annual event held in London for 8 invited teams|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well i assume they have a wat of getting to 4@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzty: 3@C said i have a  4 card Major|pg||
nt|lestergold: Saelesmin considers slam posibility|pg||
nt|yo_yo: even you and I could make this one Mike|pg||

nt|lestergold: overtridks if they dont cash spades|pg||
pc|d3|nt|capercliff: run the Q?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ridouble finesse isnt rweally right because you are missing the 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzty: 2N GF asking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im sure Robson will provide us with the answer|pg||
nt|capercliff: with a 9-card fit it would certainly be right, but with 8 maybe A 1st|pg||
nt|vugraphzty: Robson has head in hands, thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: also Robson will not want an early heart from south|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a tricky hand to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly many options |pg||
pc|dT|nt|capercliff: he would like to set up @d's so as not to guess the @h position|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: Robson is n ot a fast player|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: has to knopck out 2 aces 1 level too high|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes he has to block the suit by going up with A|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Dixon with all the entries has the long club|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm well he is capable of such|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder if the 3@D was a reverse smith peter, asking for @C|pg||

nt|lestergold: rubber players tend to play quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: want to get the best value for their table money|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: 2NT  or 2@C?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you given the pioint a board scoring element there was a serious risk in unblocking as it allowed an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: i can see downsides to that play such as being forced with clubs but i regard the heart suit as being a greatwer worry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 5@c?|pg||
nt|capercliff: would be a good shot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It's great when you can see all the cards |pg||
nt|capercliff: its stiff as the cards are|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely he wont sell out to 41h at these colours|pg||
nt|capercliff: he is probably wondering if 4@s is better|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: as it happens 4@h is best of all|pg||
nt|capercliff: or not|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or the "flexible" double |pg||
nt|capercliff: why is 4@h best?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: opting to defend should be the winner here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mamos: not pretty|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: here the lead from Jxxx is punished|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: point a board scoring  that's unusual in UK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: because its going light|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|d6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|capercliff: opting to defend here is a big view|pg||
nt|capercliff: it could very easily be a double game swing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree. You can rate NS as having at least ten hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe a X after 3@h was better|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed it is a view but Allfrey does have defence and biodding over 4@h is an almost certsin negative score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you should have a fit your way as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: Malinowski added a couple of points to his hand for his own card play but dont think it will help him here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|capercliff: seems to be natural with that shape|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|capercliff: passing 4@h is agaisnt the odds|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: 31h was a weak bid and burn may have been putting the pressure on as players do at these colours they expect oppos to sacriffice and will take risks to induce a pgantom save|pg||
nt|lestergold: phantom|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzty: sorry down 1|pg||
nt|capercliff: double by Allfrey may not have been responsive for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: Allfrety is a gold cup winner he has been here before|pg||

nt|athene: south hoping his partner can overruff here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should one really lead an honour from KQxxxx against 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: with @DA10x north would return the ten so Burn knows the position|pg||
nt|athene: you should lead the king if partner has three small, roland|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: but actually Janet's diamond spots were so small, they would be blocked then anyway|pg||

nt|lestergold: but at these colours doesnt have to be a mountgain|pg||
nt|capercliff: with 5 @c's and 4@s it is obvious of course, but Burn also felt he was too strong|pg||

nt|athene: yes, there's no point doubling if it doesn't set up a forcing pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: the lure of the vul game|pg||
nt|athene: or if pass isn't forcing you should play takeout doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphztz: deciding between an keepinh the D for an endplay - or ducking to break the comms I guess|pg||

nt|lestergold: handgood decision by South to defend|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: in spite of all th e points of course qx clubs not exactly working poins|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can south pass this?|pg||

nt|lestergold: Saelesmin recognises the club weakness of course |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose that's a cue bid  and who can blame him, a lovely hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a cue bid hes is simply bidding out his shape|pg||
