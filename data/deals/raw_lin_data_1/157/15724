nt|vugraphA2: a few mins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: game here ns|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for NS is available under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26/Australia.aspx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: delay as Hung as 1 blue and 12 red cards|pg||
nt|davidstern: What suit is blue|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: Team Horwitz has 5 youngsters  - and Horwitz|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i hate to ask what SNOT stands for :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
nt|super nova: 2d = Hearts or the black suits.|pg||
nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||
nt|super nova: Pitt team had a 3 imp carry forward,|pg||
nt|super nova: but they lost the first set 47 - 0. so they were quite behind.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|super nova: The second set Pitt team won 47 to 13.. seems that 47 is having a role to play in todays match.?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury   2@H=I'm so ashamed|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Hi all for the final set|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: if N had gone more slowly, he would very likely have been allowed to play the cold 4H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|super nova: The defence should be able to take, 1 heart 2 spades and a diamond and a club. |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard count & attitude    odd/even on 1st discard|pg||
pc|s7|nt|super nova: but can defeate the contract 1 trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|super nova: (2 more spades that is).|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: NS playing 2/1 EW Polish Club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd of 4 16-board sets|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|super nova: If Evans had of had a big hand she could bid 2nt forcing enquiry over the 2d bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: the responses would have been 3c = min blacks.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|super nova: 3d = min hearts|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everybody, kibitzers :)|pg||

nt|loganrun: This is 2 off any way from here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    but they started this set with board  31 |pg||

nt|davidstern: So a nice close match these are 33-48 of a total 64 in this final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room, which started with board 15, using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|djneill:  there was a 3 IMP carryover from the RR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, Adam West playing with Ron and Joe South with Neill|pg||
nt|super nova: I believe that Lorna and Kalmin are top womens players originally from South Africa.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hello everyone it's a pleasure to be here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Prescott-Noble-Bilski in whatever combination play play what's called Modified Polish Club|pg||
nt|super nova: Evans Djurovic recently finished 23 in the World Womens pairs.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=(19)20-22|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Klinger has always struggled with counting points|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bot on loser count, 1@S is clear|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: This is the final of the Sydney National Open Teams (SNOT)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Playing 4 x 16 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really have very little resemblence to Polish Club |pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Al and specs|pg||
nt|loganrun: A slam in hearts or NT as long as you play the diamonds in the appropriate way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough for North; 3@D not quite enough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but X too risky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he has a 7th @H to make up for the suit quality :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and for your future viewing plans, full vugraph schedule with all times local to you is found here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for non-americans, adam west played Batman on TV, and Joe south was a country singer (games people play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the operator may fill those in, though Adam West would be great to see|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bill is West and Paul is South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he also sang the classic "dont it make you wanna go home?"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much response from Neill only 16 highs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphA2: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Welcome to a wet windy cold rainy sydney day|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Seniors Teams|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: North probably thinking about 6@D - assuming 3@S is a raise|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: BW - the simple answer to all slam questions|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Hi David - a suuny Melbourne welcomes you|pg||
nt|loganrun: sunny|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oooo   Andy is playing with Nabil     in the PABF it was Andy-Adam|pg||
nt|super nova: Seems like a relatively routine hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok Ron is clearly a NT-o-phile, last hand 1NT with 5 good hearts, now 1N rebid with 6 hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the @H game missed|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: South has a max. with good trumps - there must have been a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and claims|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW carding   standard count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|peachy: Prescott caught a pretty nice dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: ron understandably treating his hearts as a 4.72 card suit on second round, then accordioning the out to 5.6 on next round|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: @S 3-3 is pretty friendly too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|loganrun: Declarer has got himself a bit tangled up here|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Bit is very charitable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Noble won the Qualifying -- that accounts for their 11 imps|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|peachy: the only remaining consideration is to not lose more than two trumps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|djneill:  8 tricks looks easy but 9?|pg||
nt|djneill:  must rely on his one Ace up his sleeve, the fact opponents think he has 5 hearts, not sure if it can be done|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how the new partnership would treat North's 2nd DBL instead of the chosen 3@D|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|sT|nt|djneill:  it is hard for me to think outside the box on defense, if declarer made a "judgement", defense is hard enough|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|d2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: take that 110 and RUN|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: he's got it -- well done|pg||
mc|6|nt|kiwibridge: 150 very cheap|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: director called says Ally|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Sorry, for board 17. Just tempo issues|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: TD is for previous board apparently|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice stop partner|pg||
nt|loganrun: South hoping that the same happens at the other table with them in slam!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't know why EW didn't want their @C trick|pg||
nt|super nova: I wouldnt open a weak 2 H at this Vul.|pg||
nt|super nova: With this questionable suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  no results from open room yet|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok they finished 31|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, 5+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C= multi-purpose   a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: that's the last time i'll copy/paste THAT|pg||
nt|super nova: I remember once in the worlds one commentator was saying that the player was caught speeding with a bad suit and a weak hand.. yes -800 in 2h x.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: oh yeah -- 1@C was 1-Round Force|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: an excellent hand to defend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can make a case for X rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand is a breather...|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes, Marshall would you have responded 3NT on this North hand?  It is close|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||
nt|loganrun: South punting here - could be off 2 controls here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: we are fortunate to have al here to explain all the bids|pg||
nt|peachy: when I am kibitzing, I appreciate that a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice "all" is spelled with small letters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Prescott gave any thought to 3N instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: not for .05 second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or it wasnt apparent|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H being NF, he understandably shose the trump contract|pg||
nt|peachy: chose*|pg||
nt|peachy: the tenaces would have been nice though, to have lead come into|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Or if you have an ipad http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil asking iff Andy has something good for him and Andy says INDEED|pg||
nt|super nova: I personally like the TD lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: seems Bilski needs one of the black Kings onside|pg||
pc|h2|nt|super nova: I am trying to pump down declarer so that my trumps become longer than theirs.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|vugraphA2: Notice Nabil falsecards on every trick - so predictable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pull trump eliminate @D pitching @H    exit @H -- let defense break @C|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Klinger clkaimed i1 down|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugrapha1: sorry lost play will give yu theresult|pg||
nt|super nova: of course it wouldnt help much on this deal.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like @H was still a transfer even with the overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: however a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd imagine Bill would have woken up had Ron reopened with 2@S rather than X|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|super nova: So long as Dec does not try to set up a heart trick too early they will have an easy run to 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugrapha1: Sick of this Table Paul goes too fast|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C seems clear to me. it is not as if one fears a lead directing doub;e|pg||
pc|s4|nt|djneill:  here a showup squeeze on West but @c split|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphA2: Nabil just working out if hearts could be 4-1 how best to play it|pg||

nt|lml: but one minor problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+@D|pg||

nt|djneill:  West ducked the @d as the only chance to set, but also to stop a squeeze from operating sometimes|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: nothing can tell u how much i hate opening 1@d n rthe West ards|pg||
nt|lml: do you like 3NT?|pg||
nt|super nova: Djurovic is a bit top heavy for 3nt.|pg||
nt|lml: way|pg||
nt|super nova: I would start with X to see which way things are going.|pg||
nt|lml: but Evans may not pass |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a very makeable but thin 4@S NS|pg||
mb|r|nt|super nova: oh 5d is an excellent bid on this hand.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could miss a laydown 6C even facing PH, or play doomed 3N with 5C spread|pg||
nt|djneill:  well, North cooperated by not transferring, this looks a little odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  unless not play transfers|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that you cant make a minor slam which is certainly a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|lml: so this might work out well for east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: And Hung wearing his traditional cap making it harder to see his reactions|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Andy|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|loganrun: All the action is with South at the moment and his mental toughness is tested with 2 slam decisions|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as the distribution lies,, it doesnt work :-D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: declarer will do well to hold this to down 1|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Prescott not sure what is going on.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too fast for me -- i'm still thinking about whether declarer was supposed to attack @D before @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Daily Bulletins from the World Championships that just ended in Philadelphia -- they actually printed a reminder that Declarer was allowed to ask an opponent to confirm none ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when failing to follow suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: sometimes doing the wrong thing can work out. touch of the green|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: uh oh  i think the swing just went back to defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if a 4.5 loser hand openes 1N, what do you need to open 2N? and then 2C must be a slam-forcing opener...|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: Same score likely maybe doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they printed that because each NCBO [National Contract Bridge Organization] is allowed to set rules about who can/can't ask|pg||
nt|peachy: It was a difficult hand to play, but leaving 3SX in would have been worse, it might have well made|pg||

nt|djneill:  West may want to bid here, for surely East is never leading a @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok transfer overcall, allows West to shape out with interesting hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
nt|lml: andeast-west should push north south to the 3-level.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 4@H from west wide range opposite a limited 1@H opener|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: A club ruff is a trick the defence would get anyway likely declarer will lose 1-1-1-1 for one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Any other Vul I would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  right you are South doubled 2@h for takeout|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think W should raise to 3H to make it tougher|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry,  1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|tejjyid: should be no trouble to bid 4@H now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Oh!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for west or east?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think WEst can bid the 4th without fear of criticism|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if the rest of the boards will be this flat|pg||
nt|loganrun: oops - who can blame North?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fact of not redoubling marks 3H by W as competitive|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: David -- you get encouraged at other vulnerability when partner passes twice??|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: I',m sure East would have rasied with the @DA in plce of the K, or a singleton somewhere, but it's hard to say that this hand necessitated it|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: i'm paranoid too -- but for good reasons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy Hung seems to be on Michael Prescott's side this hand|pg||

pc|s5|nt|vugraphA2: Andy's 2@D bid may have hidden the 4/4 spade fit although Nabil may "reverse" now|pg||

nt|fabsayc: even if you dont expect to make can bid it, they probably sacrifice|pg||
nt|tejjyid: here NS have given EW too much room|pg||

pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: right. and no matter what E showed, why couldnt it go all pass after the double?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does W always RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how could defense stop that after the @D lead?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly for Southy the thoughtful 3@D bid has turned into information that makes West very confident abloutslam|pg||
nt|frankaus: the sping nationals in its 9th day  - 60 a day  - for some - |pg||
nt|lml: On Board 5 where Kalmin didn't untangle the play in 2@H the other table made an overtrick and so won 6 more imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: spring|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry abput not alerting but her friend is supposed to bwe doing that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: the method played by EW for 1N X Pass seems theoretically questionable because it giuves the opps the whole two level when E is 2 suited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E has a 2 suited runout, the n it is fine, but withg a hand that might produce a game ui think a different call is in order, e.g. 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: On the 4@S going down 2 and you asked what the result at the other table might be 5@H -2 and 9 imps to Noble|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Both sides need to avoid trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Sorry 5@HX -1|pg||
nt|tejjyid: illustrates the theme that bridge is ablout balancing information for partner & info for opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is multi-purpose  and  1-round force |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 10-20, 5440, 4+@C  b) 12-21, 4@C(441)  c) BAL, 21-22 or 25-26|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a surprising outcome for that bid when LHO has opened 2C. still it might have been the key to the city if LHO was slated to end in 3N and had a spade tenace|pg||
nt|lml: no worries as you say|pg||
nt|lml: I love that expression|pg||
mb|3N|nt|frankaus: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not keen on 2N with so much playability in spades, even though pd is a PH|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, it's only the huge EW fit that makes it fraught|pg||
nt|djneill:  meanwhile back in the real world, the other table stopped in 2NT on brd 18 after East chose to rebid hearts rather than NT|pg||
nt|lml: well actually I love Australia.  Will you adopt me?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: you bewdy glad yu do|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for those who like to see very long descriptions     1@C=a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Anybody for 1@S now by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting second action by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S is privy to the info that E mnight have a stiff spade, then yes|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: No need to bid 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=17-21 HCP  5440 or 4441 with short @C/@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Bilski was struggling to recall if this was the right rebid, now Prescott is trying to work it out too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm cheating -- looking at notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  @H win in South  @H win in North  THEN @C|pg||

nt|djneill:  wow, 5@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: damn i thought i was here to ESCAPE the real world...|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: prescott looks at 4@D incredulously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D would be right shape for a weaker hand than the 3@H rebid|pg||
nt|peachy: this would be a tricky hand to bid in any system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A+ for your homework Al.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|nickf: I think North bid 6H, not Westr|pg||

nt|djneill:  lol|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphA2: East looking puzzled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not more than me|pg||
nt|loganrun: South had to throw a top heart and win the first heart and lead back to north's Queen - very tough|pg||

pc|dA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: noit without play|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil knows Mike likely has a penalty double of 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- there were more tricks available in @D than declarer will see in @C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: unbalanced real suit is my guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: standard-ish|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok good info thank you Judy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: pushy 3NT may need some assstance from the defence|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: Nick -- tell them they both remembered incorrectly :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tejjyid: natural-esque|pg||
nt|lml: well the club return was a killer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|djneill:  so South is playing on the fact West must play the penalty card on the first @h, even if he holds the @hK!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if N id unsure what 5H means, what he does knwo uis that almost all his strength consists of cards that S probably doesnt care about since only red suits have been bid|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: in this case a club lead seems a better bet than a heart lead in my view|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: in that case i mean|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphA2: North knows he likely has this beaten by playing @DJ and @DK|pg||

pc|d3|nt|djneill:  I think you are right|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like David's inference about declarer having a penalty DBL of 1@H -- even though he pulled -- but why lead @H then??|pg||

nt|super nova: 1c Opening|pg||
nt|super nova: would you bid 2c spades and another?|pg||
nt|super nova: I like to play weak and strong micheals.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: all N has is a fifth heart, but it does not feel like enough. after all S did not opoen 2C. in fact S indeed did even HAVE a 2C opener, yet slam was hopeless, so that says it all|pg||
nt|frankaus: S is a bridge teacher - represented Aus in Cannes some time ago|pg||
nt|super nova: This doesnt qualify so I would bid 1s over call.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Interesting position for North|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: If I open at all which I will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N is attractive...let them figure it out on lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand was just destined for trouble -- there is no science for bidding hands with 5@D 7@C and singleton Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You know you cant get doubled and you are playing for the money|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Partner has 10 outside diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: NO WAY would I open 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(17)18-19 BAL-Semi BAL|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H a good bid for North here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: spec suggest that in fourth seat, 3m should be a transfer to 3N:)|pg||
nt|lml: I like a spade.  The @CQ is not a good card|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: there's a fun twist for the viewers|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C - 18/19 bal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Reese describes a set of hands where raising the overcall with a Doubleton honour is best; this seems like one|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok normal 1@c opening, but 1@d is the equivalent of a 1@h response|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome Jamie Ebery|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting theoretical/practical issue for W on first round -- make sure u show the four spades and clarify strength later? or make sure you shoiw values and fish for spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: later? i am in the latter camp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: reese never heard of LOTT|pg||
nt|djneill:  (and 1@h would have been a 1@s response)|pg||
nt|djneill:  a Jacobini transfer|pg||

mb|p|nt|loganrun: ty Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=Puppet 2N|pg||
nt|djneill:  but East does not have to accept - 1@h promises @h tolerance|pg||
nt|super nova: WOW 16 imps.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphA2: I would try 3@D on second round inviting 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If partner passes here you get the worst of both worlds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what 4th seat 2@D opening is for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, double vs. 2C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: an artificial 2C rebid is a useful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he divine the @H situation??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NO, he never did, and yet still managed to bid quite well. WHich suggests something about LOTT|pg||
nt|super nova: sorry board 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: east-west wimped out so it was not a question at this table|pg||
nt|frankaus: they found the X ruff in 6@C|pg||
nt|super nova: This shows a forcing 6 card heart suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: I cant believe North is thinking here|pg||
nt|peachy: the moment.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS may be playing rosenkranz X & XX so forced to XX to show an honor, which a raise over the double would deny|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3H is forcing|pg||
nt|lml: some wires got crossed|pg||
nt|super nova: But it seems that east doesnt like their hand.|pg||
nt|lml: east-west do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand I cant see what they can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they make 3NT??|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: now simple Stayman|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: that decides the fate of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now maybe an overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid 2@C as well|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as in 'it is not clear what they make'|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: why would this EW auction ven be forcing? ne of the problems with an initial double|pg||
nt|djneill:  with various checkbacks available, the jumps may be forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  3NT was odd however|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, from W point of view why would 3C be forcing?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm suprised @C was adequate|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: not that odd -- 11 of his 14 points are in unbid suits|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: he is thinking how lucky he is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice pressure bid|pg||
nt|lml: not clear|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: amazing pass, given the @D Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the D flaw ntwithstanding|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes it depends if West is looking for slam potentially since East has a slam oriented hand with a @s cue|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but probably just make|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|peachy: he needed just one heart trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is possible that 3N there was a spade cuebid, allowing them to use the step bid of 3S as a grope of some sort|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H = likely + will prob be a + imps as well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: just delaying the inevitable claim for 9 tricks ??|pg||
nt|lml: they do have to make it though|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: 2c was puppet to 2d i think, but the pass is simply not consistent|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead to give defense a chance was king of clubs. looks absurd of course but it is amazing how often it is right from this holdiong|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: seems to be on the right track|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: when in dummy  I think trump gives play for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using 2@C opening this way, they can actually get out in 2@H/@S via transfers   interesting concept|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing is an amazing euphemism:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: the defense is not going to work out for north-sotuh|pg||

pc|h4|nt|vugraphA2: Mike asking Barry "you are the one with the spade stopper why not bid 3NT over 2@S"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 3@C was INV   [with 2N covering the weak or forcing variety]|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|tejjyid: yes, best chance for ruff |pg||

nt|ahollan1: down a bunch -- how many percentage actions do you take?|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok, North was giving a little credit to West to ducking the first heart|pg||

nt|super nova: On the deal where they made 2h,.. but then no no down 2. They are in 4h at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  potentially|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a six is not a big card, but it is a winner when the other 12 cards in the suit have been played |pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: another easy 3N:)|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: before you ask the answer is YES|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another transfer explanation|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok South doubles the completely artificial 2@d bid to indicate some strength, some play it shows balanced, some a takeout of a major in particular|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will NS go on over 4S?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|loganrun: Another 'percentage' action|pg||
nt|lml: on Board 9 the defense lost their way a bit and 3NT made.  Declarer ran 4 hearts and West through a club which was fatal|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: OK, I have to go, but that should raise the average standard of the commentary|pg||

nt|ahollan1: from earlier hand I'm a bit surprised Bilski chose DBL rather than 1@S    maybe the difference was bidding over 1@H rather than a minor|pg||
nt|super nova: North decides to show their 6-5 shape. fair enough.|pg||
nt|super nova: Ace of diamonds and diamond continuations I would imagine to be the best defence.|pg||
nt|lml: on a non-diamond lead the diamond can go away|pg||
nt|super nova: With the east hand you want to pump declarer.. and D is the unbid suit.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: we have seen a plethora of singleton Kings this match|pg||

pc|hA|nt|vugrapha2: Hung grinnign whne he puts down dummy|pg||
nt|djneill:  oof|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|super nova: I think jurovic likes Kalmins auction also.|pg||
nt|lml: once south bid they were destined for spades|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: the lure of the vul game is too much|pg||
nt|super nova: This wont play too badly.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: 2S presumably constructive, as otyherwise E just has an inbvite|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|super nova: 2d diamonds and a spade off the top.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|super nova: KH on side but the and singelton KC,|pg||
nt|lml: not going to make|pg||
nt|super nova: The 9 of spades is a monster card.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: are we done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in a sense well-judged, in that in the other room EW did go to 5S (cold) and were doubled|pg||
nt|lml: you need to have a rule about who pushes for the vul games.  You cant have both sides pushing|pg||
nt|super nova: Evans will likly start with pass.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thanks operator, commentators, noisy cheering spectators|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a reasonable auction for preceding board would be 1S - 2S -3H - 3N ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room still has 3 boards to complete|pg||
nt|super nova: 2s|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs or the reds.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so last board here, no swing, then the last few to come from the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D is the only positive response   ANY 6+ HCP|pg||
nt|super nova: North will want to punish 3c,.. but south will not like to co-operate with that.|pg||
nt|lml: no if south has a way to show both majors I think she will|pg||
mb|1H|nt|djneill:  this table is significantly faster than the other, difficult for Judy but good to watch|pg||
nt|djneill:  or @dA and @d hook if West follows, securing 5@d, 2@h, 1@s, 1@c|pg||
nt|lml: right now|pg||
nt|lml: thats the bid I use too|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphA2: South elected to double in the OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with spades surely n the way S sgould maybe do more than 2D....but his defense is fart from negligible...toughh problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no respect --- NS always interfere over the EW multi-purpose 1@C opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: far:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|djneill:  South could try the @sA and @sQ, spurning the finesse - if they take @sK then 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think this can make|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final hand for our table --- shouldn't pre-gloat, but congrats to Team Noble    and 4 of the Juniors on Team Horwitz are collecting their 2nd consecutive 2nd place finish in the ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: big Australia Open Team even|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is best not to take the spade finesse even not looking at the hands :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: I think the engravers already plugged his pen in Al|pg||
nt|djneill:  normal looking auction if N-S are bidding it|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @h lead seems marked, the unbid suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: tehe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that DBL was over a 1@H transfer response   |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think we missed a double by north or something|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry to miss th play but 10 tricks madeby south|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok thanks Judy|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry I was a bit slow, but next session in one and a quarter hours...thx everyone for yr patience|pg||
