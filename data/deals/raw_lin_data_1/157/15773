mb|p|nt|pelu: Aakirkeby is from the smalest distrikt. Bornholm - and Ravenkilde from Vejle in Jutland|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: Bocchi has no a natural and a strong 1@C opener :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine grand slam in spades; you just need to cash the 'right' honour first|pg||
nt|peachy: If NS sacrifice in a minor, they might be sweetly surprised to make, just takes correct club guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D on the right viuw in @C - and only a @H-ruff can defeat 4@S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: That's a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a clue will be that you won't get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you have to figure out why|pg||
nt|tomi2: either leader has 3 spades with the queen or no spade at all? :)=|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a pure guess as I said|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|c6|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7NT is perhaps better, sometimes you can make it even if you misguess spades|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: would u all bid only 1 time in N? many would bid 4NT over 4@S = 6+@d and 4 card @c |pg||
nt|peachy: I would not jump|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: I think they will get to 7@S|pg||
nt|pelu: outside Hobro|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: or not|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D asks for the @SQ, and 6@S says she has it but no other king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a grand slam we all want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks 4@H already showed her @HK so she doesn't want to bid 6@H there|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: If 5@D asks for trump queen which I think it does, what would 5@S be then?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomi2: this board can cause a swing that you cant repair in lots of other boards by playing well. and this is just "luck" if oth other table plays 7@S and wins / fails...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Sabine tried to show a 6th spade with no queen by jumping to 6@S?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: well most play that 5@S would deny the queen and anything else shows it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|pelu: 2-3 0r 4@D is not the problem - would u bid over 4@S?? |pg||
nt|peachy: Then again, if I did jump, which is reasonable, partner then knows to ecxpect a marvelous hand when vul against not-vul|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Can be difficult to stop Sabine|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Anyone prefer 2NT rather than double?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: Sabine has said in print that she likes bidding 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C as it can be very hard for opps to sort out major-suit fits and stoppers for notrumps|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: it's sensible to be able to bid clubs naturally over a short club, i think  - you just use 2@D as michaels or whatever|pg||

nt|Walddk2: These are difficult hands to bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: you can clik on the teams name and see players (some even with a cpicture)|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 1nt with south rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one can make much|pg||
nt|athene: the idea you can then make a non-forcing bid in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D N-S the maximum it seems|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|tomi2: I see even Zaleski from France is playing in this event|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: Bocchi must be a bit worried about his partner bidding diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he decides to face that problem when and if it occurs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is 3@D now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Natural I would say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With club raise you bid 2@S or 3@C|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Isn't that hand worth about 3@D?|pg||
nt|athene: Sabine gets her 2@S bid out but she would prefer north to bid so she doesn't have to use it|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT down 1 in CR - lauria play @C7 - but why in 3Nt - 4@S easy game|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pelu: 2@D = multi but prob a 18-19 NT in the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or might she consider passing?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Why bid 3 when you can be doubled in 2 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: on the principle that even if it makes it's not a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 380 will still hurt|pg||
nt|athene: clearly she didn't expect Bocchi to have a singleton diamond for a t/o double (effectively) of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: but he also made a "take out" double od 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure she fully expects this to make but decides that anything else might well be worse|pg||
nt|pelu: no entry to dummy so decl has to play @Hs from hand - and make 5@c|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Eleonora must have been pleasantly surprised when she saw dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where on earth did partner get @DQ10 from when they doubled me?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Ruff even|pg||
nt|athene: exactly what you show when you double one suit for takeout then double another suit, is something any regular partnership should discuss|pg||
nt|athene: you either play the first double just shows strength so the second one is takeout shape|pg||
nt|athene: or you play that the first one should have the right shape and the second one just shows extras|pg||
