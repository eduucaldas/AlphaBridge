nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: Team Horwitz has 5 youngsters  - and Horwitz|pg||

nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
nt|super nova: 2d = Hearts or the black suits.|pg||
nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||
nt|super nova: Pitt team had a 3 imp carry forward,|pg||
nt|super nova: but they lost the first set 47 - 0. so they were quite behind.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|super nova: The second set Pitt team won 47 to 13.. seems that 47 is having a role to play in todays match.?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if N had gone more slowly, he would very likely have been allowed to play the cold 4H|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Klinger has always struggled with counting points|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bot on loser count, 1@S is clear|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: This is the final of the Sydney National Open Teams (SNOT)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphA2: Playing 4 x 16 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really have very little resemblence to Polish Club |pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Al and specs|pg||
nt|loganrun: A slam in hearts or NT as long as you play the diamonds in the appropriate way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough for North; 3@D not quite enough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but X too risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and for your future viewing plans, full vugraph schedule with all times local to you is found here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for non-americans, adam west played Batman on TV, and Joe south was a country singer (games people play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the operator may fill those in, though Adam West would be great to see|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bill is West and Paul is South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he also sang the classic "dont it make you wanna go home?"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphA2: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Welcome to a wet windy cold rainy sydney day|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Seniors Teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: North probably thinking about 6@D - assuming 3@S is a raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: BW - the simple answer to all slam questions|pg||
pc|h2|nt|loganrun: Hi David - a suuny Melbourne welcomes you|pg||
nt|loganrun: sunny|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oooo   Andy is playing with Nabil     in the PABF it was Andy-Adam|pg||
nt|super nova: Seems like a relatively routine hand.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok Ron is clearly a NT-o-phile, last hand 1NT with 5 good hearts, now 1N rebid with 6 hearts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: South has a max. with good trumps - there must have been a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and claims|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: EW carding   standard count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: Prescott caught a pretty nice dummy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: ron understandably treating his hearts as a 4.72 card suit on second round, then accordioning the out to 5.6 on next round|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S 3-3 is pretty friendly too|pg||
pc|d5|nt|loganrun: Declarer has got himself a bit tangled up here|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Bit is very charitable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Noble won the Qualifying -- that accounts for their 11 imps|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: the only remaining consideration is to not lose more than two trumps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|djneill:  8 tricks looks easy but 9?|pg||
nt|djneill:  must rely on his one Ace up his sleeve, the fact opponents think he has 5 hearts, not sure if it can be done|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how the new partnership would treat North's 2nd DBL instead of the chosen 3@D|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|djneill:  it is hard for me to think outside the box on defense, if declarer made a "judgement", defense is hard enough|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: take that 110 and RUN|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: that's the last time i'll copy/paste THAT|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: oh yeah -- 1@C was 1-Round Force|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: 4s|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I can make a case for X rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand is a breather...|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes, Marshall would you have responded 3NT on this North hand?  It is close|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||
nt|loganrun: South punting here - could be off 2 controls here|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: we are fortunate to have al here to explain all the bids|pg||

nt|loganrun: The club pitch in the end swayed him to go wrong|pg||
nt|lml: looks like a lot of clubs east-west|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|lml: but one minor problem|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+@D|pg||
nt|lml: looks like 6NT would make east-west if you can get there|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid suggest the right line of play|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-16 HCP, 5+@H, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout at 2-level   i assume that also applies at 3-level|pg||
nt|djneill:  West ducked the @d as the only chance to set, but also to stop a squeeze from operating sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: nothing can tell u how much i hate opening 1@d n rthe West ards|pg||
nt|lml: do you like 3NT?|pg||
nt|super nova: Djurovic is a bit top heavy for 3nt.|pg||
nt|lml: way|pg||
nt|super nova: I would start with X to see which way things are going.|pg||
nt|lml: but Evans may not pass |pg||
mb|5D|nt|super nova: oh 5d is an excellent bid on this hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could miss a laydown 6C even facing PH, or play doomed 3N with 5C spread|pg||
nt|djneill:  well, North cooperated by not transferring, this looks a little odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  unless not play transfers|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: l in 2 spadesBruce transferred and Pau;|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that description actually covers 1@D, 1@H & 1@S opener's  filling in the correct suit for the 5+|pg||
nt|djneill:  astuted of the caped crusader|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Paul stuffed up - thank goodness|pg||
nt|djneill:  right, if minors were reversed might get a lead-directing double of stayman (@cxx)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cannot approve 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even so -- with 4333 converting to penalty had to be an option|pg||
nt|super nova: oh.. but that was b/c it now gave East another chance.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: lots of work for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that you cant make a minor slam which is certainly a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|lml: so this might work out well for east-west|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|s6|pg||

pc|d7|pc|c5|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: too fast for me -- i'm still thinking about whether declarer was supposed to attack @D before @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Daily Bulletins from the World Championships that just ended in Philadelphia -- they actually printed a reminder that Declarer was allowed to ask an opponent to confirm none ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when failing to follow suit|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok transfer overcall, allows West to shape out with interesting hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 4@H from west wide range opposite a limited 1@H opener|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Any other Vul I would have bid 4@S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tried to bid 1S but not allowed:)|pg||
nt|lml: the idea is that if you get to a slam that has a 5% chance and it makes you lose moral imps (But gain real ones) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Lavings   asks 5@H/@S AND size|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is AUS = morals = a beer after each hand, or a chardonay |pg||
mb|1N|nt|tejjyid: nice lead directing bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3@S more or less invites opponents to bid slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: liquid imps|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: now 6@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only if they think you have to be very weak rather than just very offensively oriented. and in any case they wont bid one if they dont fiind a fit they are confident is adequate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if you dont expect to make can bid it, they probably sacrifice|pg||
nt|tejjyid: here NS have given EW too much room|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pd is balanced and S will be motivated to pass the double on a lot of shapely hands|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: are you ready for the next bid....|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry it is W who isthinking not Krock|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over here both EW players m,ight have bid diamonds on the first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would anybody else overcall 1@S [in lieu of DBL?]|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Only if Dbl guaranteed both majors|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=12-13 HCP, 5@S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: also one should have agreements here NS about what is fit showing and what is one suited and/or what is interested in saving against a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: haviong trouble understanding N reluctamce to support hearts. if he had 5 of them he would have pened 1H|pg||
nt|djneill:  Klinger is not unhappy!|pg||
nt|djneill:  talk about 100 honors|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started playing weak or kamikaze NT 35 years ago -- i'm sure i NEVER discussed East's sequence of the delayed 3@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphA2: But .... Pass= Penalties or two touching suits|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: So 3@H showed majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what strength??|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If Nabil finds a diamond lead this will be BAD|pg||
nt|peachy: landed well with that action|pg||
nt|lml: do you know what East meant 1@s to be?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: right. and no matter what E showed, why couldnt it go all pass after the double?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does W always RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Because presumably West must act|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that lets NS escape when they have a runout spot and u were making|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Redouble on the basis it is penalties or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if overcalling 1@C has changed now that transfers are used over 1@C-P and 1@C-DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S might have bid 4D for example|pg||
pc|d8|nt|djneill:  must be in 4@h|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: well, pluses and minuses i guess|pg||
pc|dT|nt|frankaus: nat F|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has opened a hand with almost 9 losers, and in almost his worst suit. one would think he would be thrilled to support hearts|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i do t think Ron would openm 1S with that shape|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|djneill:  what if East opened 1@s and South bid 2@h|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like a transfer to 1NT but it wasnt alerted|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphA2: Ouch now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|frankaus: maybe a transfer advance = 1C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: Nabil choice of 3@C rather than PASS might not get the majority of votes   another sequence that doesn't get mentioned in print|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how could defense stop that after the @D lead?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly for Southy the thoughtful 3@D bid has turned into information that makes West very confident abloutslam|pg||
nt|frankaus: the sping nationals in its 9th day  - 60 a day  - for some - |pg||
nt|lml: On Board 5 where Kalmin didn't untangle the play in 2@H the other table made an overtrick and so won 6 more imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: spring|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry abput not alerting but her friend is supposed to bwe doing that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: the method played by EW for 1N X Pass seems theoretically questionable because it giuves the opps the whole two level when E is 2 suited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E has a 2 suited runout, the n it is fine, but withg a hand that might produce a game ui think a different call is in order, e.g. 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: On the 4@S going down 2 and you asked what the result at the other table might be 5@H -2 and 9 imps to Noble|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Both sides need to avoid trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Sorry 5@HX -1|pg||
nt|tejjyid: illustrates the theme that bridge is ablout balancing information for partner & info for opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is multi-purpose  and  1-round force |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 10-20, 5440, 4+@C  b) 12-21, 4@C(441)  c) BAL, 21-22 or 25-26|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a surprising outcome for that bid when LHO has opened 2C. still it might have been the key to the city if LHO was slated to end in 3N and had a spade tenace|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not keen on 2N with so much playability in spades, even though pd is a PH|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, it's only the huge EW fit that makes it fraught|pg||
nt|djneill:  meanwhile back in the real world, the other table stopped in 2NT on brd 18 after East chose to rebid hearts rather than NT|pg||
nt|lml: well actually I love Australia.  Will you adopt me?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: you bewdy glad yu do|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: for those who like to see very long descriptions     1@C=a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=any 7+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Anybody for 1@S now by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting second action by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S is privy to the info that E mnight have a stiff spade, then yes|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: No need to bid 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=17-21 HCP  5440 or 4441 with short @C/@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Bilski was struggling to recall if this was the right rebid, now Prescott is trying to work it out too|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: prescott looks at 4@D incredulously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D would be right shape for a weaker hand than the 3@H rebid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||

nt|djneill:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: East looking puzzled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not more than me|pg||
nt|loganrun: South had to throw a top heart and win the first heart and lead back to north's Queen - very tough|pg||

nt|fabsayc: unbalanced real suit is my guess|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: natural-esque|pg||
nt|lml: well the club return was a killer|pg||
pc|c9|nt|djneill:  so South is playing on the fact West must play the penalty card on the first @h, even if he holds the @hK!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if N id unsure what 5H means, what he does knwo uis that almost all his strength consists of cards that S probably doesnt care about since only red suits have been bid|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: in this case a club lead seems a better bet than a heart lead in my view|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case i mean|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i mean, double vs. 2C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: an artificial 2C rebid is a useful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he divine the @H situation??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NO, he never did, and yet still managed to bid quite well. WHich suggests something about LOTT|pg||
nt|super nova: sorry board 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: east-west wimped out so it was not a question at this table|pg||
nt|frankaus: they found the X ruff in 6@C|pg||
nt|super nova: This shows a forcing 6 card heart suit.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphA2: I cant believe North is thinking here|pg||
nt|peachy: the moment.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS may be playing rosenkranz X & XX so forced to XX to show an honor, which a raise over the double would deny|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3H is forcing|pg||
nt|lml: some wires got crossed|pg||
nt|super nova: But it seems that east doesnt like their hand.|pg||
nt|lml: east-west do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand I cant see what they can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they make 3NT??|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: now simple Stayman|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: that decides the fate of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now maybe an overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid 2@C as well|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as in 'it is not clear what they make'|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why would this EW auction ven be forcing? ne of the problems with an initial double|pg||
nt|djneill:  with various checkbacks available, the jumps may be forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  3NT was odd however|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: i mean, from W point of view why would 3C be forcing?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm suprised @C was adequate|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: not that odd -- 11 of his 14 points are in unbid suits|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: he is thinking how lucky he is|pg||

nt|lml: not clear|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: amazing pass, given the @D Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the D flaw ntwithstanding|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes it depends if West is looking for slam potentially since East has a slam oriented hand with a @s cue|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: but probably just make|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: he needed just one heart trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is possible that 3N there was a spade cuebid, allowing them to use the step bid of 3S as a grope of some sort|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H = likely + will prob be a + imps as well|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: just delaying the inevitable claim for 9 tricks ??|pg||
nt|lml: they do have to make it though|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2c was puppet to 2d i think, but the pass is simply not consistent|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: best lead to give defense a chance was king of clubs. looks absurd of course but it is amazing how often it is right from this holdiong|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: seems to be on the right track|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: when in dummy  I think trump gives play for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using 2@C opening this way, they can actually get out in 2@H/@S via transfers   interesting concept|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing is an amazing euphemism:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: the defense is not going to work out for north-sotuh|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: George Rosenkranz's Mexican 2@D [from Romex] and the 2@D version used by some of the Italian pairs doesn't allow stopping below 2N|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Opp really said that after S miscounted? conduct & ethics|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil feeling like one of the seven dwarves - leave it to you to guess which one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never remember who is oldest of Nabil & Andy|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: No it was said in a very nice way and certainly no offence taken|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well they only have to count to seven|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: They are good friends|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Older is Andy so this is younger|pg||

pc|d8|pc|sT|pg||

nt|marlowepi: multitasking is hard|pg||
nt|loganrun: West knows what is happening with the biggest hand at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx andrew see you:)|pg||
nt|djneill:  9 card fit + oxygen = game|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: EW have 3N but NS play 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You left out the invesrted commas :EASY"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we could all leave, that would be an infinite increase|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT by N may make here|pg||

nt|super nova: As it turns out 4s is a cake walk.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: this time David wanted  BBO to offer    delete PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is Lavings -- asks 5-card Major AND size|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, S owes N a 1D opening, i think, even red|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: multiple potential games.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=12-13 HCP, not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4cards, INV|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Unfortunately this will not work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from earlier hand I'm a bit surprised Bilski chose DBL rather than 1@S    maybe the difference was bidding over 1@H rather than a minor|pg||
nt|super nova: North decides to show their 6-5 shape. fair enough.|pg||
nt|super nova: Ace of diamonds and diamond continuations I would imagine to be the best defence.|pg||
nt|lml: on a non-diamond lead the diamond can go away|pg||
nt|super nova: With the east hand you want to pump declarer.. and D is the unbid suit.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: we have seen a plethora of singleton Kings this match|pg||
nt|djneill:  North obliges South with a @d lead|pg||
nt|lml: but the clubs are friendly and the trumps not too badly behaved so should make|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: holey moley - suh 8magination|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: 10 cold anyway it would seem|pg||
nt|djneill:  now it is not so clear, South should now play the @hA in order to get a signal from North|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugrapha2: 3 on the one board was my fav.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 fell to the Ace -- but the 3rd snuck through to beat the contract|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|peachy: kibitzers' dream to have interesting boards!|pg||

pc|h3|nt|djneill:  hmm, entries now to set up the clubs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why bother?|pg||

nt|loganrun: Hoping partner might have 1 heart (out by 2)|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes that makes more sense|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished board  9 -- but they started with  15  so we're not as far ahead as some think|pg||

nt|lml: well north has to decide to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|lml: or 10|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|d4|nt|vugraphA2: Ace of clubs and squeeze South|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-16 HCP, 5+@S, unbal |pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't matter on this layout -- but i'm still wondering|pg||
nt|loganrun: Fine line between - genius and goat|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe it is W who opened 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: can make 8 spades on round suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 2 boards left in our room  the other room still has to play EIGHT  [8]|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Yes well spotted|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 21 was a similar auction to 3@h, and 22 both tables got to the doomed @s game|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: sexier than the clkub ruiff for 14|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Mike counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: He will guess club ruff for 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will do it -- but don't let your children see the use of 4N with unstopped @D suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to INSERT PASS|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: on the intricate auction that led to 6@C+1 here -- the other room played ... 3@D!!!|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1H - on the way to 6 at least|pg||
nt|djneill:  North throws in a little @d action to attract a raise or something|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4N?  avert eyes, o ye of faint gizzard|pg||
mb|2S|nt|super nova: I woudl bid 1nt. to show some poiints|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Whibley doesn't know that his void is working|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E could easily have openeing bid with no D control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has super max for bidding to date|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: I understand that South didn't want to bid 1NT without a stopper but now she has a problem|pg||
nt|super nova: Then North can Double 2s to say they have 3 potential places to play.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|loganrun: Justin believes that Michael will not open the same 1H hand as he did!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 1@S is usually unbal -- but this is 3rd seat |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Howard still blasts knowing they're off  2 keycards|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If east has no diamond contro how bad will 5@S be|pg||
nt|super nova: South already knows about the 5 hearts .|pg||
nt|super nova: So they can bid 3d.|pg||
nt|frankaus: downgrade to 12-14 1NT by N mayhave stolen the pot|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphA2: Claiming|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphA2: ke says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh do the replies to 4N inform about diamond control?|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Well done Mike says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i dont know their system|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: 2 key cards so must have @D control problem arises if one key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, exactly|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: It is a little different game when light openings are systemic|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4 card major struck in open room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|super nova: But after the pass by south over 1s, it is not as clear for north to X|pg||
nt|lml: they can defeat this though and go plus so not so bad|pg||
nt|lml: they weren't making 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: not sure why it would make a difference|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I fixed the bidding have a look at top|pg||
nt|djneill:  aggressive lead but a @d results in the same thing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: good point Frank|pg||
pc|c6|nt|loganrun: As you said - Al - all about 'percentages'|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: just 2 more boards for our table in this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i missed a trick - thought there was going to be a trump left in dummy |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: We have another game from this tournament in 3 days time. Hope you can join us|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and such a boring one to start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose, 1 round forcing 1@C|pg||
nt|loganrun: Bad spade break stopped the grand and the 3-1 trump break - things are tough eh|pg||
mb|1N|nt|super nova: 2c|pg||
nt|super nova: D or Majors|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: Whibley started with 2@C rather than Prescott's DBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: South says 1NT is clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. W is a LOT closer to bidding 4H over an invitation than E is to bidding 4. for several reasons, in fact...for example, if they do bid 4S how will you feel?|pg||
nt|djneill:  seemed like a good shot, very unlikely to set that 4@s otherwise on this auction|pg||
nt|super nova: I would X = some values with south.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe  the psychic transfer|pg||
nt|lml: I guess it depends what you play double as.  |pg||
mb|2D|nt|peachy: North maybe throwing smoke in the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Suction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here ius something u dont see every day. a 20/20 hand with no voids and eaxh side can make gam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry only one void|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Lavings in deep thought|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tactical bidding situation|pg||
nt|lml: I think pass is the normal call.|pg||
nt|super nova: As 2c doesnt have an Anchor suit I usually play it as 'some values' |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: South thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may stop EW from competing -- but what about partner?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems like 3@S overstates the non existent defense|pg||
nt|super nova: The same as over multi '2d' opening.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but i think it is called something else in New Zealand and Australia|pg||
nt|loganrun: At this vul - perhaps 'Suck'tion|pg||
nt|lml: I like Kalmin's auction|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=constructive   7-10 HCP, 3+@S|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Three obvious losers but some work to be done here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H splinter?   is that really the agreement or just Nabil's intent??|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: So we can see the OR went -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still NS have a sac but 5@S home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear what N is up to, without knowing their understandings. might be trying to buy it in hearts as cheaply as possible by pretending to sound slammish|pg||
mb|2S|nt|djneill:  West, a passed hand, has a great hand for @h - a 4@h here seems reasonable - as East might have 16-17 so a 3@h is courtesy|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: Hung grinnign whne he puts down dummy|pg||
nt|djneill:  oof|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|super nova: I think jurovic likes Kalmins auction also.|pg||
nt|lml: once south bid they were destined for spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: the lure of the vul game is too much|pg||
nt|super nova: This wont play too badly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2S presumably constructive, as otyherwise E just has an inbvite|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: 2d diamonds and a spade off the top.|pg||

pc|d4|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: sort of cant see selling to 4S, but maybe 3S was trying to fetch a D noise from S, so when that didnt happen N thought the save might be too expensive or that iin one way or ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another 5H did not have enough upside/downside ratio|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Noble would take down 1 in a second if they gave him the option|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: sorry i mean a questionable co nstructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: OOps|pg||

pc|h9|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: i believe Bilski's PASS places @DQ in West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that help declarer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think so - @DK  @D [intending to finesse]   losing only the last trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it all depends on how strong Bilski can be for PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alternatively   @D3-2  then @DA  @DK  @H9 scoring @S7 en passant|pg||
