nt|paulg:  a slam swing on board 25 has given Hemant Jalan some breathing room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i show two-suiters these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||

nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ian111:  hi |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|paulg:  not an easy lead for East to read, although to beat the contract he has little choice about playing West for an honour|pg||
