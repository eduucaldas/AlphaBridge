nt|rado: agressive DBL by N may produce @D lead|pg||
nt|blewah: this is the last round of team match|pg||
nt|haans: Points to Fantoni|pg||
nt|ady: sort of pushed to game|pg||

nt|kastan88: hi all again|pg||
nt|sybarra: is is for recording the play |pg||
nt|bernix: i rather assume NS are using nf free bids|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Constantin Stancescu|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: clubs lead to break|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia is never afraid|pg||
nt|mamos: either one down or the whole lot?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double is the correct approach, 2@c would describe less|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over t/o x 1@s still fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but personally i expected 2@d by Boye|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for North was easy pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still wld pull to at least slam|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, mistake in bidding, now on trick 5|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this rates to make 8 or 9 tricks, depending on guesswork|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Mike Hi Steve|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning all   we have had a small problem here on Board 1 but hope to bring you the result shortly|pg||
nt|haans: Mackwell compare score with which European pair?|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers= "does 2@S show extras", answer= yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: heya Bob and Liliek, welkum aboard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: TV|pg||
nt|mcphee: 450 and no one wins this board|pg||
nt|westjava: so,the law now on this table,Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probalbly normal contract here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makes also 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: well not doubled     but Europe might win this one|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@s isnt everyones choice I would guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has brought a box of tissues to the table, blows his nose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because she knows 17 at hand, 12-13 at opener, and say 6-7 at east, so South 0-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Resume in 12 mins. Sorry lost play on 7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N off balanced, only points out values|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: US players sitting other way round - will change display shortly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Negoescu - Briciu is not a regular partnership, but let's hope that they'll do well today|pg||
nt|bobholl: if n @H lead may be even 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@s should be 8-10, so 3@h invitational with losers @h i guess|pg||
nt|haans: have been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: good bidding partscore only|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Point a board|pg||
nt|haans: Meckstroth started with good tactical bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: peculiar there wasnt a transfer first time. The tactics of point-a-board?|pg||
nt|mamos: aggressive start from Justin|pg||
nt|mamos: ahh  I see transfer|pg||

nt|haans: view as  played as BAM |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: are we correct here, operator?|pg||
nt|haans: Operator Playing against which piars (compare with?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: pls ignore profile|pg||
nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Liliek:)   welcome|pg||
nt|blewah: hi pak Liliek|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to make 5@d a complete guess because of two way @c finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then 5 minor/s good save|pg||
nt|tez: if dbl again pd could bid 5@c|pg||
nt|haans: 2@Cx make no game|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: dummy may be a disappointment to declarer|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: good|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: the normal 4@H (down a million)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: where NS make game with their 18HCP :)|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S seems ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 5 losers off two, in case @cK pinned off one, without double still good while 4@h fine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Tez|pg||
nt|anton72: too agressive start :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Among the soundtracks she has done are Forrest Gump, Good Will Hunting and the last five Woody Allen movies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW carding is UDCA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@h required|pg||
nt|haans: you for the kill |pg||
nt|haans: good start|pg||
nt|danilo1: Dble would be too agressive, but pass, not 5@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes it was the board slam missed at both tables|pg||
nt|haans: happy dummy :)|pg||
nt|bernix: difficult to reach 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: penalty doubles have died in IMPs|pg||
nt|milton_se: in any case, NS have given away a lot of information|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S @D @H 4 made |pg||
nt|edmunte1: the romanian team in Stara Zagora has only 3 members of the team that won the Romanian Teams Bridge Championship last year|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS are a strong pair, member of Greece national team that finished 29th this year in Ostende|pg||
nt|haans: Good pass by Doron Y|pg||
nt|anton72: defence need to find @s switch |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|haans: better lead than a diamond|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven tricks seems likely though|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant:)|pg||
nt|westjava: tourney website : http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|sybarra: Europe won the morning session 8-4. Aggregate score in the Buffett Cup: Europe 56 - USA 64|pg||

nt|udo: was2 @H alerted,,( both majors) ?|pg||
nt|stc: with KJ N have take the finesse the 1st time|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: W thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|haans: rare to bid 5m if 3nt possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin studies this trick in depth|pg||
nt|ady: e/w would have comfortably won the board in the very safe game of 5@D    part score only in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: nine now|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: declarer will try to restrict losses since even 1 trick may score a win|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: UDCA for NS|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: will he be able to keep it to down 2 only? or the inevetable down 3....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that means entry problems in case 2@c allowed to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|blewah: the americans plays 2/1, while the germans strong club, 4 card major with canape possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the individual each team has to use a single system, even when playing in practised partnerships. |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we have "std. american" and "std. european" |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: although both are a 2/1GF system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would lead to play at hand and concede all picture cards to opps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: may end with just +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: connection down in other room will have to restart this one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: surprisingly @hQ falls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so 7 more winners at W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok |pg||
nt|h_karluk: US lost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably K now|pg||

nt|bobholl: he doesn't know about all the @C in S so ?!|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems "we" play on |pg||
nt|haans: can not do worse|pg||
nt|tez: i prefer 2@h..not double|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: @DT finesse and +1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far off four?|pg||
nt|haans: prefer 4@H instead of double of 3@H|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed.. and on a combined 17 HCP-count noboady would come any nera 5@D, 8 crd fit|pg||
nt|ady: hi   was in open room   but needed here    4@H  in OR    might make as cards lay|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rado: still endplay position after cashing all @C and @H|pg||
nt|mamos: or back to eleven|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nothing in the play|pg||
nt|bobholl: have to discard properly to let it make exactly but they will i guess|pg||

nt|sybarra: overkilled  sabine |pg||
nt|jeanhari: he didnt discards his diamond?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he did i guess otherwise not 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yeah, missed a card there - but claim right after|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@H as they lay   but can they get there?|pg||
nt|ady: nice start for Europe    they need it|pg||
nt|haans: you must do as Fantoini did Get the feel|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  92 EUR 76 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and found!!! |pg||
nt|h_karluk: +420 cool, just exit with a @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and forced to ruff sluff|pg||
nt|milton_se: didn't Agge have another pard then?|pg||
nt|haans: but now?|pg||
nt|haans: may one play slow without @DK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: 10-14 with @C|pg||
nt|kastan88: CCs for both team you may find here: http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The players are playing this board the wrong way around|pg||
nt|tez: may have 4@h doubled 2 down:)|pg||
nt|haans: the right answer? Tez: i prefer 2@h..not double|pg||
nt|stc: and a rare good save at bad vuln|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|edmunte1: Briciu, Filip and Ionita were also members of romanian team that finished 27th in Ostende|pg||
nt|stc: will N risk a Staymann ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the twins are comparing with Levin and weinstein  who are playing Helgemo and Helness who have scored +130 in  3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe won 16-8 this morning|pg||
nt|bobholl: they are always playing fast if you don't like it :)|pg||
nt|ady: hert game for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: prev board in fact 2N mostly played as Leb|pg||
nt|ady: heart|pg||
nt|haans: non will miss that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant lebensohl|pg||
nt|mamos: i wonder if the players like these little six board sets ?   seems very staccato |pg||
nt|edmunte1: lucky contract for Bulgaria in the OR|pg||
nt|haans: yes we may expect 10 imp to Bulgaria here|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision with W hand after weak two from E|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S ... coffy board |pg||
nt|haans: 2nt or 4 any for me|pg||
nt|anton72: 4 @h is possible |pg||
mb|1N|nt|rado: very light 3rd pos 1@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: scoll down on the home page,  beautiful picture, looks like old castle |pg||
nt|westjava: classic!|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@h seems playable for EW |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it's a lovely playing room, big oil paintings,  exposed brickwork, and a stag's head on the wall|pg||
nt|edmunte1: hard to reach  for Croatia here|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2@d from Kalin is Multi|pg||
nt|haans: West  did some oberbidding in Ov|pg||
nt|stc: no more ? do they play weak NT ?|pg||
nt|stc: of course EW may stretch to 5@s on the @c position|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: many guesses in @s contract|pg||
nt|rado: now E might bid some constructive fit raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cool Liliek, jill is a great personality, always humble and she doesn't even play a lot of bridge  world championships, trials. most of her close woman friends aren't even bridge ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Geoff disagreed abt Klinger's 100 winning tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: ah, this one was a "player's hand in the way of the card" issue :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there Ron described overcall principles|pg||
nt|haans: yes so CC say|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's not common to bid 3 doubles with 3 spades and club void|pg||
nt|tez: its my choise:)|pg||
nt|haans: simple to bid and to make|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d either weak major ..mulri|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be i'd bid 2@S |pg||
nt|danilo1: * coffee |pg||
nt|anton72: but not so percentage.....|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-0 Hampson here|pg||
nt|rado: 6@H makable now|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no clue about the rest of their bidding. Lets see if they finish in 4/5/6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|westjava: or 3 nt|pg||
nt|blewah: 3nt will face @s threat|pg||
nt|blewah: though @cq is dropped|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h x if all pass wld b an interesting scenario|pg||
nt|haans: Convention Cards: http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H 2@C(drury 2@H i predict|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad @D for 2nt|pg||
nt|stc: here I do not agree with 1NT, X or even 1@s looks better to me|pg||
nt|bobholl: miss @S now|pg||
nt|stc: yes 1@s should be perfect here|pg||
nt|stc: a free bid shows a good hand anyway|pg||
nt|stc: S is not here to pass !|pg||
nt|anton72: guess part score in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|ady: may be a heart guess for 10 or 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: J of @H is a very fine card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good raise by Auken, but maybe 2@H would have won it too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant say somebody decides to start directly 41h|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be a negative double we would all make |pg||
nt|tez: multi|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will show good @S so they are there|pg||
nt|haans: nowday 3@H transfer min|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
nt|blewah: for 9 tricks if @s led|pg||
nt|sybarra: but Sabine Auken is quite agressive |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins play very aggressive 4 card majors  with 1NT 14-16 so open 1M on hands like this routinely|pg||
nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||
nt|stc: looks like a win for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey Ant, gl there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back, you'll watch Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde for Europe and Jill Levin & Jill Meyers for USA, www.buffettcup.com|pg||
nt|jeanhari: close call here, as would be the play in 4@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i have no sympathy to 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: K@D lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: >|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The convention cards have been slightly modified I believe, but I don't know where sadly|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probst had a hard choice between 3@s and 3NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: bidding 3@s could have missed 3nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: NS won't reach @C now i guess|pg||
nt|stc: good chances to make|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: even 10 points counts as a win so Justin trying for the NT bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3rd and 5th leads|pg||
nt|westjava: you know every thing,Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a nice slam @s there|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi jackson|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit 4@h|pg||
nt|ady: not certain to make 10 tricks in hearts    depends how club suit is handled|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "did you pass Gerber?" :)|pg||
nt|haans: small spade?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c more descritive than 2@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *descriptive|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think 1@H-3@C is inv with clubs though|pg||
nt|sybarra: and she as safe spot in @D's |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days your pard bids spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: the indy format is interestign |pg||
nt|sybarra: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compares. |pg||
nt|sybarra: That player will always be in the same seat at the corresponding table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: will put board 7 in later|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right for decl|pg||
nt|bernix: hi hans. since you're on your own apperently i will help out if you dont mind|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@H is good weak (should be), than West must bid 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: odds for game making|pg||
nt|anton72: also 5 @d is cool|pg||
nt|anton72: looser in @h going over Q @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have opted for no-trumps in this scoring method   might have come unsuck on a club lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely would have|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa - "I might have passed a splinter"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe dbl over 4@s wld lead to 4@s disaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i read 3N-3 on myscreen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: OR Jeff and Eric lucky, they are regular partners|pg||
nt|stc: normal bid, hard to imagine more than -2, he could also make with k@c on side !|pg||
nt|anton72: no|pg||
mb|5H|nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 4+fit and some defense:)|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d maybe forced|pg||
nt|westjava: East will support, of course|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT for north south no problem|pg||
nt|tez: unagressive|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is a 50% NV so you have to guess rigth in those situations |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: I did not think a @C would be led after the splinter|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: they make all the tricks on the normal @DK lead|pg||
nt|haans: would have tried @DK lead|pg||
nt|haans: raising tend to overbiodding all the time|pg||
nt|tez: very lucky 4@s|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mamos: no heart guess now |pg||
nt|blewah: this is a sequence of invitational @h supp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ant, i hope our boss did not read your words abt a convention:)|pg||
nt|ady: dont think europe will get anything from this hand |pg||
nt|mamos: NS only have on loser |pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, 5-6 finesses and 4@s is there :)|pg||
nt|tez: %3:)|pg||
nt|rocketer: .|pg||
nt|stc: goog decision of W|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: I think East shd take an extra action|pg||
nt|westjava: might be 3@H better|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks better |pg||
nt|haans: urkk|pg||
nt|bernix: simple but you still have to find the trump queen|pg||
nt|mdgraham: awkward contract, this. |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
nt|westjava: so do I|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't be staying bidding NT but 3NT is best manche|pg||
nt|sybarra2: difficult for you Ant, |pg||
nt|edmunte1: 3nt is not a maker here, so more IMP's for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|bernix: in 6|pg||
nt|haans: 52% for slam so no shame when you miss it|pg||
nt|anton72: if defence switch in @d after A @s .... 10 tricks ..loose 2 @c and A @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|stc: the good choice to play on @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: good he didn't lead the T of @C|pg||
nt|mamos: the cards mostly lie well for EW   probably made game if they had bid it |pg||
nt|mamos: one|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 12 tricks isn't easy|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everything on the right spot here, the fate of contract depends trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 too high  but NS can make @C contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: EW should stay passive to play it down|pg||
nt|bobholl: think i would have bid 3@S on first opportunity :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: might be keeping low because of the scoring I guess|pg||
nt|westjava: West down grade her stiff @DK|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh just as bad :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff sluff|pg||
nt|haans: need 1 trick more|pg||
nt|stc: but only 6 tricks if the defense stays passive|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: double dummy AK winning line|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard layout|pg||
nt|h_karluk: limitted enries to table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *entries|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S9 may come into it, if South can get enough ruffs in his hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: Justin against Weinstein|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a difficult game to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Sabine Auken sometimes visits USA, a nice lady from my unit 160, district 7 <Miss Joyce Hampton> hires her for top events and they win&scratch in teams|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C denies @S control?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: then 5@D now? (@S control)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it shows a mixed @h raise and very nice help to opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I swear my P key is having an off day :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Am told 2@C is a mixed raise, 3 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S2 out of the hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: Sabine not comfortable with 3 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice one easily would employ a losing hook|pg||
nt|haans: i counted 9 losers 9 p|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: DOUBLE and get the point|pg||
nt|haans: or support spades later|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even 1N is available by N|pg||
nt|haans: just simple finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there aren't all that many entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: NS was vul|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have started very well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so hard to say a tie or anyone would win the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: giorgio helped|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Skafti Jonsson|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|oliverc: No problems from here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: x not a must|pg||
nt|sybarra: just wants to give you a problem Ant |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thx Roland, hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mamos: Fantoni Nunes in 3@C at the paired table   so Bob Hamman need to make to win the board|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer will attempt eleimination here|pg||
nt|jacksond: sememta/duboin have stopped in 4s in other room so this wiil be a swing |pg||
nt|jeanhari: tempting to balance with 2NT with north hand over 2@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rado: DBL may give room for NS to find better place|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this puzzles me 100%. OK I am lost....|pg||
nt|rado: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably wld ruff at tb, @c pitch at hand wld better|pg||
nt|bobholl: this won't be good for europe most players will open E hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an endplay to North available|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h i thk max showed..3@s inv|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh @D signal ?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jan_jansma: OK, 6@D was a try for 6NT|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 or 7 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: restricted choice in @C and no rpoblem|pg||
nt|bobholl: still searching for 12th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: Brogeland is in 6@S in OR  |pg||
nt|mamos: sorry it was  NUnes  Boye was South|pg||
nt|mamos: and made|pg||
nt|kastan88: in all matches, Europeans bid 6@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: good for europe (and tension in the matches)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Rodwell scratches his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: fans and refans his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has leaned back on his chair, one arm draped over it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: Nunes did a nice hold-up with @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: I still only count 8|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi!|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry all esp shirley  business phonecall |pg||
nt|sybarra: enplayed at trick 2 |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Richard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Levin, wants to lead a @D but is likely pickling pards @D trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: Ant, is Bobby in a trance?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes Aggelopouls played with Koukuselis in Ostende|pg||
nt|bobholl: why anxious to be on lead other than @H play|pg||
nt|haans: urkk|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mcphee: well I guess not:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortness might be your partner's winner, why not to lead it before declarer dumps somewhere|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @c lead was best|pg||
nt|ady: would have had to duck if K@D led|pg||
nt|bobholl: did they play @H and let one grow ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: making??|pg||
nt|edmunte1: http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/ the official page, waiting for inputs|pg||
nt|milton_se: seems impossible|pg||
nt|edmunte1: +110 sems improbable|pg||
nt|bobholl: thank you |pg||
pc|s9|nt|jan_jansma: with no clue|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: he will just bang down @HAK|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (slowly)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, much thought at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: may try the spade up now?|pg||
nt|westjava: or now a @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Closed room are in 3@H, so all a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play @H to the ace and a club up also |pg||
nt|westjava: she still count Levin's hand|pg||
nt|blewah: @h has to guess but @s will likely give in to N from the bid|pg||
nt|blewah: and if n continues, will create trump problem|pg||
nt|westjava: make decision, a @H drop or finesse |pg||
nt|blewah: yes, that would be my prediction too for W|pg||
nt|westjava: dont touch your @S, Arya:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is likely certain where the K of @H is,  question is layout |pg||
nt|h_karluk: forgot to cash @dK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: BAM is Super MP Best pairs (team) close to always win :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes after @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considering @D8|pg||
nt|blewah: so Eur in this tm has won the match regardless what will happen to the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  93 EUR 81 ****   Europe ahead in all 3 matches Now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: blocked his way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but this way North positionally squeezed|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will be back with the @D |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or @S I mean|pg||
nt|haans: do not like discarding|pg||
nt|danilo1: declarer has no loosing option in @D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|udo: 10 tricks now,,,,,good score|pg||
nt|haans: S will not pass this time but why start with 2nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt was certainly higher risk  but was successful in OR|pg||
nt|tez: what dou you bid with ozden's hand..2@s or 2@c(drury)?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe payback for not bidding game :)|pg||
nt|tez: if partner has @c ace ..he must shift @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't think there's any way to do this|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|haans: close to sqz tempo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Avram Kreisberger|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i prefer to calculate this in |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 11 or 12 tricks   no difference here|pg||
nt|ady: 660 wins the board|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i liked Tony's pass over 3@d, keeping Probst in the dark about @h fit |pg||

nt|oliverc: from here 4@H a @S and a @D is the lot|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: flash back hand|pg||
nt|mamos: the problem for me with BAM is that when you know the result at the table as here  3NT=  what happens at this table now is irrelevant ... :(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far Europe near to win it|pg||

nt|h_karluk: so far this deal is a potential candidate to the bulletin|pg||

nt|oliverc: Can Fantunes keep low enough here?|pg||
nt|oliverc: excellent score|pg||
nt|udo: looks like 4 @S EW here|pg||
nt|rado: from E side if partner has singleton @H or @C and normal opening 4@S would be easy|pg||
nt|westjava: @S was my choice|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jon Sveindal|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: so a push at the end of the day |pg||
nt|sybarra: and re hi all |pg||
nt|ady: down 2   a didaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not much problems with @d hook|pg||

nt|anton72: 4 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: This is quite funny. On the European CC we see negative doubles through 3@S, on the American through 7@H!|pg||
nt|haans: here we go :)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c..i bet|pg||
nt|stc: a tricky board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: that 110 doesnt look too flash a score on  2..anyone in NT will surely amass at elast 120|pg||
nt|haans: trying for 6nt?|pg||
nt|rado: now some 5 level battle:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: was afraid of over ruff may be|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needed very little at the table|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Thankfully this board is the correct way arround :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 losers for EW|pg||
nt|haans: leve opps with the two first @D|pg||
nt|bernix: let's see if the turcs manage to reach 5@d after 2-suited opener|pg||
nt|bernix: this one looks interesting. both sides can win game in a major|pg||
nt|danilo1: but 2NT pass (correct bidding) may make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|udo: what is the westhand worth?   for me straight 4@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-1|pg||
nt|ady: might get overboard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but slam for NS|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2@s is a 2 suiter with @s|pg||
nt|haans: good to dind hearts suit|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H then a good save|pg||
nt|bernix: a club lead would beat 5@d but difficult to find from south hand|pg||
nt|haans: most experts say NOT Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: thats a new one|pg||
nt|haans: 7NT a finesse away|pg||
nt|haans: most do not pass anymore taking the chance|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... in fact .. will just go 1 trick less down :)|pg||

nt|mcphee: i suspect they win that one|pg||
nt|westjava: agree|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio Duboin (born September 30, 1959 in Turin, Italy) is an Italian bridge player. Duboin has won four World teams championships along with six consecutive European teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: championships and a seventh European in 2010. For many years his regular partner was Norberto Bocchi; now he plays primarily with Antonio Sementa.|pg||
nt|jbgood: no records of the play in the OR - Broge will not be happy to lose that board|pg||
nt|Walddk7:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d then maybe 2@h|pg||
nt|mamos: seems a normal result|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||

nt|sybarra: oops sorry,  wd Bobby :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries they r both fm th family|pg||

nt|edmunte1: probablyNS playing a strong club system, that's the only way i can understand pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: that was quick :)|pg||
nt|haans: plus for Radisic-Altman|pg||
nt|haans: more here :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be imp to Israel|pg||
nt|bernix: +1 is wrong isnt it|pg||
nt|bernix: 10 tricks only|pg||
nt|vugraphzra: sorry =|pg||
nt|haans: Final word: bbhants: and he played it well to that point!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: only small @S from hand makes it|pg||
nt|stc: you can play J from dummy for Hx in S or small to the dummy for Hx in N|pg||
nt|stc: small from dummy is good only for stiff H in S|pg||
nt|stc: on a good day you make 4@s with ew hands, not today|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S all pas is possible|pg||
nt|anton72: horoble hand|pg||
nt|anton72: 33 points 2 fits ...no slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a good solid result|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: he got an easy win prev hand, so they are even|pg||
nt|bobholl: show up is the rigth expression |pg||
nt|h_karluk: nah, i expect the field wld be in 5@d with same tricks, to me a tie|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and south may reopen, who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: 10-14 again|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops 9-13|pg||
nt|rado: here 2NT 5+@s INv+ maybe|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: unfair.... You have their system in front of you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes this will happen often|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes checks the convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no doubt checking if 3@H or some such bid shows 5-5 Majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia laying in the bushes|pg||
nt|mamos: and it seems ok to consult your own card :)    a couple of times I think teams have been helping the oppo witheir system :)|pg||
nt|haans: score is not decide here we just have to carry along|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Should Zia just pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: strectched mini roman|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 4 carder|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks if 1NT is forcing|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H could be 4 cards when 4@s4@H(32)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: north surely looking for slam here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: now they may and are unlucky|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     1NT likely|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult choice for N 3Nt or 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: here EW win 5@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a friendly group |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Quite refreshing to see players being allowed to check their own cards imo|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.00 BST, in about 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho:  aggressive lead here by rodwell cost s costly trick|pg||
nt|haans: max 3@H|pg||
nt|tez: muranli/ozden playing first time i think at vugraph |pg||
nt|haans: double looming here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes asks for the card - he hasn't brough one with him|pg||
nt|bobholl: is this in the system notes i doubt it :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hopefully that shows 55 majors  :)  on both sides of the table  East and West :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it seems EW don't have any European system cards with them|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes that is in notes 55 majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: than i would bid 4@H as W|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers suggests that they just tell each other :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: meanwhile the director brings them a copy of the system|pg||
nt|mamos: Its a sensible gadget |pg||
nt|riccho:  it is on the card 4@d =5+5+MAJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it is not clear if the 4@D bid is actually on the system!|pg||
nt|bobholl: but did nunes know it ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Note 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Ah, think Eric's found it now|pg||
nt|riccho:  He looked on the cc, didnt he?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i still believe a questionable decision|pg||
nt|h_karluk: let's wait Fulvio's result|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the overtrick was critical  for a Eorope gain|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately an unmakable contract |pg||
nt|bernix: i would have opened south hand with 2@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: edit : stretched|pg||
nt|jbgood: voidshowing 4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: need to put some brakes on soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this one is THE VERY WILD contest. Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: von arnim and hamman picked double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe was dominant half of the round|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bobby decides to stay on defence in case they also reached 6@d things may change|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H I mean|pg||
nt|bobholl: NO strong @C now ?|pg||
nt|stc: did well to stay low|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: @S's? What @S's?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but maybe some east west (a minority) might decide to compete with ie 5@h <prev board>|pg||
nt|ady: interesting     win and play back 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia lent Rodwell his 3@H card two boards ago, and now has to ask for it back :)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: don't know, just guessing|pg||
nt|milton_se: don't think they play a strong C -- se board 1|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: Opening Bids get weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld ask Fulvio's idea in Facebook:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knew very good :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Claudio is pleased he remembered correctly :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: he cannot misclick as we, So Nunes knew|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He guessed that he remembered the bid correctly|pg||
nt|haans: a Ekren version at least 54 in M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  surely 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 6@d pick a major suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Fulvio did not use any convention vs 15-17 1N blindly at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|haans: Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|edmunte1: identical bid as in OR|pg||
nt|edmunte1: ok, they play natural|pg||
nt|haans: Kib say that Ozden-Muranli may play vugrapgh for 1st time|pg||
nt|haans: and they are new players|pg||
nt|bernix: 2@s looks weired to me|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: in BAM you scores nothing for second best contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: normally 11-15 any 4441|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: and 3@S = 2@S and 6@H, Rado?|pg||
nt|rado: unfortunatelly don't remember LOL|pg||
nt|rado: with trumps 3-3 4@S will be ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: We seem to have a mild technical hitch, but hopefully the broadcast will continue|pg||
nt|westjava: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wld be happy to play this board 31c by N|pg||
nt|haans: 1 trick short|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c by North|pg||
nt|yvesj49: cheap defence in @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not found.....|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @C lead beats 3 NT|pg||
nt|stc: no play on a @c lead|pg||
nt|stc: @d will also do, he will not put the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: was told the twins' NT is 14-16 ... but that doesnt look right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 3-2 is  68%  (not 28)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: "how light do you open"|pg||
nt|mcphee: gazilli in  action|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well bid by Jason|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken claimed 10 tricks, but Meckstroth was very honest and declared that the @DK falls, so 11|pg||
nt|ady: duck   or take and switch to a sspade    easier defence    duck|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably North enquires and South shows max with Heart feature|pg||
nt|mamos: so Rodwell goes for the magic NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both M aces favorably placed|pg||
nt|tez: results http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|stc: he can play on @s and make or on @d and go down|pg||
nt|stc: wrong, wrong, a @c after K@s is good enough to beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: J of @H and Q of @S my guess|pg||
nt|kastan88: all USA pairs went for 3NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS playing udca and 2/4 leads in standard bulgarian way |pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|haans: Ekren is rocking the boatth Truct they make misstake|pg||
nt|bernix: how is he to know that pard has equal length in majors ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: unlucky opening bid (probable @H lead) ... I agree with 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: -1 next|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East must be unlimited since West is thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so long|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@h a bit dangerous, East may go past 3NT w/o something in @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this is the final contract, NS have to be careful not to block the hearts - we can assume South will lead one |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: when we pass 1NTx we have a balnced and|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fulvio liked his @s Qtx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff preferred double with same hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which indicates there were also strong NT opening values|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now we are about to see which strategy would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bear in mind this is super matchpoints|pg||
nt|haans: Jacks of low value|pg||
nt|bernix: although my partner does not appreciate w2 bids with 2 outside tricks|pg||
nt|haans: well we have all done worse|pg||
nt|haans: Running score http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/  + klick on results|pg||
nt|tez: woow|pg||
nt|gmarco24: wasn't easy to push to 6 with xxx@d|pg||
nt|haans: no good preformance all around|pg||
nt|tez: will altman lead small @d for @s ruff|pg||
nt|haans: boath|pg||
nt|bobholl: first steal a @D then @S makes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: For Europe 4 Norwegians there : Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Brogeland- "you pulled out of slam again!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes's played cards are difficult to see from this vantage point, so please don't read too much into the pips etc :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't 5@D that already ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Hampson : "I just didn't want to get doubled :)"|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   mixing hands up|pg||
nt|kastan88: from europeans only Nunes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you want to win the board just trust your luck, place @c9 to righty |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and play a spade towards table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anyways after the opening lead quick tricks are : 1@s, 4@c and 2 @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer should produce extra 2 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|haans: for a spade ruff|pg||
nt|tez: i played 2 times  Balkan Bridge Championship|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzrj: leads- 3/5th, small card encouraging|pg||

nt|mamos: ty all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say one is @h K|pg||
nt|stc: could even go down here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: the italian slam on 3 gives a 2-1 lead to Europe|pg||
nt|oliverc: despite the 4-0 trump break, this looks like it should make|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 3-3 among 6 is 36|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gazilli - A complex method of rebidding after a major opening and forcing 1 no trump response, involving an artificial forcing rebid of 2 clubs by opener to handle awkward rebid ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hands. Similar in effect to the Bart Convention but handles more hand types.|pg||

nt|bobholl: sry @C|pg||
nt|stc: not anymore, NS should open @d early|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: Boye supposed to find 2 more tricks|pg||

nt|sybarra: *info |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa thought he had lost that trick, but Bobby kindly tells him the Ace won it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me @D more likely |pg||
nt|h_karluk: but who knows could touch another card|pg||
nt|bobholl: now @S makes :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: Europe leading 3-0 here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably a dia after @c|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: no clubs loser|pg||
nt|ady: contract on again  |pg||
nt|mamos: and now has a Spade  for the Club discard|pg||
nt|ady: really think Q@C at that stage could not cost|pg||
nt|ady: board for Europe |pg||
nt|ady: sorry square    3@H  made in OR|pg||

nt|Walddk7: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that ended with a tie|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably 2@s caused to a misunderstanding, that's why Antonio might think goodish with short club|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if duboin thot 4@C was shortness i am surprised he did not move over 4@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Roland|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio could easily land to 4@h after 2@h -- just fast arrival principle|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer claims|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or may want to put him table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but no reason for that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a dia would work better|pg||
nt|edmunte1: going down now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: In Bam you sometimes score nothing for the best contract  all that matters is the score :)|pg||
nt|rado: because of vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: does vuln matter in this form of scoring much?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ant do you keep teams CC that i posted yday, way too long fave list here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the winners are already known : US|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: a push|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still tied|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Now Duboin thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe only made nine tricks so a board to USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Your vugraph operator has been given a cup of coffee, so no excuses for missed cards now|pg||
nt|kastan88: Fantoni (South) played this hand 4@S 2 down after @H lead, tried double finesse in dias|pg||
pc|s6|nt|westjava: yes Bob,was rather strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: its on the website hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just underlead it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and let Nunes enjoy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when declarer's doubleton Q falls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far same way|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|westjava: thats why I agree with you, a dime stopped|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 4@C was the hand W expected 4@D would be a last train sort of cue bid|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: FN are probably the best pair in the world, so strange to see them in a 5-2 fit here|pg||
nt|rado: true:) but habbits|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (sorry if I offended all the other world-class pairs here)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: but 7 is in from this hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwi_joker: again, here, they are playing in a ridiculous contract when they have a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes sir, worths to analyse, musing position|pg||
nt|oliverc: now can just exit with the Q@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting enough, Europe wins when the matches playing in US, US wins in Europe |pg||
nt|bobholl: @S no ather chance|pg||
nt|bobholl: other|pg||
pc|s8|nt|diumraid: Current in running scores for the Buffett Cup USA 28 EUR 20. To win a continent needs to obtain 100 points. We are in Ruuning in Round 4 of 5 today.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice squeeze against E now|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Toni|pg||
nt|danilo1: no pressure for anyone in defense ... calm -1|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: unlikely to get diamond right  will probably settle for down1|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quick cmlaim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||

mc|11|nt|h_karluk: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|haans: good play Helgemo|pg||
nt|westjava: why not ruff @S and hope 3-3|pg||
nt|mcphee: so we finally predicted correctly that Europe wouod win board 3|pg||
nt|mcphee: gitleman taking just 10 tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|westjava: yup:)|pg||
nt|westjava: on the same lead Bob!|pg||
nt|westjava: 9 of @H|pg||

nt|westjava: Zia-Hamman also loose their match|pg||
nt|mcphee: that board is also a possible swing|pg||
nt|jacksond: no style points for norwegians there looking for slam missing three aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: re hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: You have missed two very exciting partscores and one less exciting slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: did we find out the bang?   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess that would be a flat result|pg||
nt|haans: did not need that |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N>2@h was brave enough, 1@d <2@h> easy|pg||
nt|passell: big swing on the discard|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C as save suggested but will score bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of info there |pg||
nt|h_karluk: another tie|pg||
nt|milton_se: worth 3 :)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Giorgios miscounted|pg||
nt|tez: easy 7@h but hard to bid|pg||
nt|haans: slam try?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the good defence against 1nt proved to be worth 5 imps|pg||

nt|stc: in this case dec has to take the @s hook and go -1|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2S|nt|mamos: major minor battle|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good luck to our operators, the guys at the table are REAL PROFESSIONALS, i believe 2nd day everything would become easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The hotel's router is having an off-day|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bobby upgrades his hand|pg||
nt|boyklas: hi all|pg||
nt|anton72: hand is too strong for this opening !!!!|pg||
nt|anton72: he have only 5 TOP loosers|pg||
mb|3S|nt|westjava: I suspect it|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D |pg||
nt|mcphee: a handy toy in fact|pg||
nt|westjava: can explain,Bob?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N might well be a choice here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: antonio sementa is 19th rank in world grandmasters list|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D open|pg||
nt|westjava: I am told 18-19 balance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to have a worldgrandmaster title you must be world champ and lotsa placing points|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D for strong 18-19 balanced hands, balanced, no 5 card suit I believe is how this pair use it|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 5 card suits alter a hand a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps we can "re enact" the boards at the end |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, I have the play written down, so I can enter after the players have played board 26|pg||
nt|sybarra: since we started, I am not sure the router has had an "on" day |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so good result for europe|pg||
nt|riccho:  the scoring is very easy today: the better score wins one point, the worse loses one; thats all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is not an easy board for both sides|pg||
nt|haans: black again Red|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: do assume 2@S som form or reverse Flannery |pg||
nt|mamos: ahggressive bidding as usual from NS  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s ok, depends @h guess - two way @h J hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: believe me they are good enough|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if US wins one more board wld win a Buffett point|pg||
nt|h_karluk: J2N |pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgehands.com/J/Jacoby_2_Notrump.htm|pg||
nt|h_karluk: US won 1st point|pg||
nt|haans: little to strong for 3@H non vul?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: not a standard 3@h opening for Probst|pg||
nt|april7: partscore of 1 @S onl, but N might overbid over 2@H by W|pg||
nt|haans: Dbl = normal double or 17+ fivecarder|pg||
nt|haans: 7nt a make|pg||
nt|haans: rare pass by Cernat|pg||
nt|bobholl: do they play precision or polish @C ?|pg||
nt|stc: probably 4@h -1|pg||
nt|anton72: that is about 16 points with balanced hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcphee: this saves a lot of energy|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Bob|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nine out of ten everyday slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Justin consults the notes, and Hampson helpfully plays the 2@C bid for him|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough for 3@D ? i wouldn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: (the players are allowed to refer to the notes as they are all made to play a "standard system")|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: NS have suggested that 2@C be drury regardless of the notes :)|pg||
nt|tez: 4@s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Aggregate score after 2 rounds: Europe-USA 8-16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam for Ns|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@H or 4@S here look the lightly spots|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h looks odd|pg||
nt|haans: does 2@S show extra?|pg||
nt|blewah: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: :):)|pg||
nt|westjava: re hi all|pg||
nt|bobholl: so a bad score is just one point :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  lead directing 3@c I like this|pg||
nt|mamos: is drury part of American system ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nv,  and stepping into the fray |pg||
nt|h_karluk: one may go subterfuge especially there were not any established partnership|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|bernix: they wont stop in 1@s, north is worth a raise|pg||
nt|haans: chats them now?|pg||
nt|bernix: massive diamond fit can make 6|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard to find the slam|pg||
nt|anton72: 16 +|pg||
mb|5D|nt|h_karluk: ty Roland|pg||
nt|haans: rare 3rd hand opening in vul|pg||
nt|haans: good 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW leads are quite compex, and their explanation is rather hushed - sorry!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think low show even engouraging, or odd discouraging|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a psyche|pg||
nt|bobholl: thin drury but unlucky 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with all thses 10 and 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: and rodwell skips the spades |pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT gamble again|pg||
nt|sybarra: going for the NT again |pg||
nt|riccho:  3NT is not everyones choice I guess|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bad board for USA 4@s 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: happy to avoid @d lead|pg||
nt|mamos: ten in Spades nine in NT here|pg||
nt|sybarra: the other minor suit K and down it would go |pg||
nt|riccho:  It would have been worse after a @d lead...|pg||
nt|sybarra: this gamble will not pay off |pg||
nt|mamos: someone with time could check all the boards but i guess the NT gamblers are a long way ahead in this event|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: From what I have seen so far this weekend, 1NT-3NT with 6M322 seems to be winning so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does he duck the club K?|pg||
nt|sybarra: how to make +1 in nt,  I do not see a way |pg||
nt|haans: must find the clubs void|pg||
nt|bernix: east has to sniff out @c void|pg||
nt|danilo1: I would open 1@D as East|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mamos: 5@D making so Italians certainly needed to bid 5@S|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H made harder for EW|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd hand wins again|pg||
nt|mamos: in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: Duboin decided to enter the bidding in the OR - cost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they have many special gadgets but unfortunately yet not much hands occurred to show that skills|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d was another option for west players|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo - "never accept gifts from opps"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and as east even pass to 2@d would be available|pg||
nt|yvesj49: finesse @h lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo pls|pg||
nt|haans: many many raise with just a 4 carder minimum value|pg||
nt|bernix: i stick to the LTC. with 6 losers i am worth a raise|pg||
nt|anton72: because of opening may be E-W wil not get it part score in @d|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: i thought walddk7 new at th town and not experienced like boss, but i m caught :) gr8|pg||
nt|rado: 8 or 9 tricks might produce this lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: re Lilied and arya:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *Liliek |pg||
nt|h_karluk: are we sure Boye's 2@d cue passed?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: worked this time|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: overbidding sometimes do|pg||
nt|edmunte1: :)|pg||
nt|haans: kbc is not the way to do it|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think they can, they play spiral scanning after the RKCB so they will find the first control round in Clubs|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2 or 3 NT now? (to recover pass) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: queit part-score - looks like one off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D 3@h 1@C at least|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes, the defense must admit a trick it seems at some stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: @D3,@D8 being considered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: normal contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass forcing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ice slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is -4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: not enough |pg||
nt|h_karluk: NS vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: EW nonvul|pg||
nt|april7: N is very careful here, nothing against 3 @S though|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
nt|gmarco24: EW play 1D defence overcalls|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't show is "impossible" negative|pg||
nt|stc: anyway, 1NT looks strange to me|pg||
nt|stc: but 6NT is the best contract|pg||
nt|anton72: who can imagine 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: and 6@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA.|pg||
nt|mamos: Helness  passed 2@S|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 2@H|pg||
nt|riccho:  its more like a pairs tourney than|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or maybe , oh ok now thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: again conservative approach rewarded|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wild slam, rather a novel problem|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, 2@d would be @d/@s|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead best|pg||
nt|anton72: they did it |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  on trump finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good bidding by norway here |pg||
nt|mamos: ta just looked at CC  -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: In fact in the match yesterday both US and Europe had to check they were playing Drury, and they both were|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quite dangerous......|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s super accept|pg||
nt|haans: may have a problem with ace asking|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos: slightly odd position for West  p opens the bidding  oppo bid a slam and you need to save|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2 clubs losers|pg||
nt|haans: @D finesse |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia off for a comfort break|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He appears to be suffering from a cold|pg||
nt|mamos: certainly quite tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: wont finesse the @H :)|pg||
nt|mamos: likely to go down methinks|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth be even 2 down|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wd Bob|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6@h|pg||
nt|tez: not my style dbl with altman hand|pg||
nt|bernix: but will east continue after finding that 2 aces are missing ?|pg||
nt|haans: West may bid 6 after 5|pg||
nt|boyklas: yes...this is more possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would if QJ of @H were Kx|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt for he had to much|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but there are 4 @h losers|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: most use WJS so 2@S could not be a minimum hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: as you have a lot of stress rebidding over a 2NT rebid from partners|pg||
nt|westjava: and 2nt is forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Italians try a new partnership : Augustin Madala  Antonio Sementa, i guess in five years that will give good results|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2/1 passed hands are nonforcing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can fail on the same position|pg||
nt|ady: possible to go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: so there!!  wd Bobby |pg||
nt|milton_se: very tough by Nego but the cards lie well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @S will make i guess thanks to fav @S position|pg||
nt|haans: best direct 4NT 4 aces|pg||
nt|haans: in my book raise now to 4NT is quant|pg||
nt|stc: reached by less scientific aproach|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice result if natural bidding you "ll reach 6@D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d over x would give much chances, ie responder would raise to 4@c --  i know it tells 6/4 @h+@s|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h not easy to find|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a wrong input by operator, was not a psyche|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries, happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: thanks for spotting it though :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: spade guess for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4N rkcb 0314 - last asked suit|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think east may have bid 3Spades as a Q-bid would be better|pg||
nt|haans: @DT good card|pg||
nt|stc: and loose 3IMP|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,2nt opening is ghost for me!|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they may make|pg||
nt|haans: win some lose same|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be not good enough W may guess rigth (i would'nt)|pg||
nt|danilo1: declarer must guess @D after @C lead, no tempo if he does not pick ip 5 @D tricks|pg||
nt|haans: odds for flat board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|blewah: nootice the low @s played by meyers, making sure her p have entry to her hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might suggest cashing a bunch of tricks |pg||
nt|blewah: *notice|pg||
nt|sybarra: typing same Arya,  very important |pg||
nt|bobholl: after @D K spades are guessable may be :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: yes lots of specs agree may be down two|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure Fred is saying "thx pard"   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still retains control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 controls + @h Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: i hope 1@c alerted|pg||
nt|udo: perfect fitting hands,,,,,@S 3-3|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would think everyone here was alerted :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hA+9 would be interesting|pg||
nt|jeanhari: @D K will make guess easier|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @H ruffs in S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c was drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, as soon as West looked for his notes everyone knew he was checking for Drury, so NS allowed them to agree it regardless of the convention card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: dbl very questionable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's ok Ant, so far so good|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double indicates clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead directing|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I get the impression the dbl was made partly for lead-direction and partly for comic value after the discussion :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hehe|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now migth beat it anyway|pg||
nt|ady: lucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont have sympathy to 2@s there, to me clear cut 2N|pg||
nt|haans: had 2@S been natural and forcing?|pg||
nt|anton72: exactly that is game but .... with 20 points this is not serious ....1 finesse and 3-3 break @h ...about 16 % chance|pg||
nt|stc: must cash @d now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|oliverc: everything|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true mf|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board I will re enter some of the play on the 3NT, then move to 12|pg||
nt|haans: thinking or no connect?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably Tony taking his time|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos: with 11 points|pg||
nt|mcphee: those 2N jump rebids also eat up room creating little issues|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: well played|pg||

nt|sybarra: probably going to watch a few pitches on spades first |pg||
nt|mamos: partly it depends on if he thinks 3NT or 4@S is the likely contract at the other table|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: Jumping to 2M = to weak to bid natural :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I can imagine that at some tables EW will be bidding minors|pg||
nt|haans: 1@d-1@S-2@d- do you have cards for 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they did it with a delay and different way, w passed, then after xx |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for non-americans Bob or Bobby are acronyms of Robert|pg||
nt|april7: I am pretty sure that they will be in 3@S in CR|pg||
nt|gmarco24: generally, it's better when you are defending, showing leads etc. but can be quite self-destructive as here was|pg||
nt|haans: ace aking with @DK as ace?|pg||
nt|stc: BIG OOPS|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say allowed by both then @c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but @h 8 still firm even covered|pg||
nt|jbgood: Sælensminde is back to playing Broge's "old" system - more or less the same Broge played with Odin Svendsen i Pau this summer|pg||
nt|ady: Fantoni needs to duck diamond|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff's 1@d opening quite interesting, probably he has different ideas when both nonvul|pg||
nt|haans: in Swedenen we bid 4NT direct = only 4 aces|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it|pg||
nt|bobholl: may make now indeed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: luckily didnt of course :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bobby Levin, has always been known as "bobby" |pg||
nt|bernix: in OR you mean|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: found a good line to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 10 of @H's dropped |pg||
pc|h5|nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems speedy gonzales at the field, gl Russell|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: nice short auction :)|pg||
nt|udo: 5th push board in a row|pg||
nt|udo: now way to go wrong, and no way for 11|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@c pre-sacrifice, might want them to put into a doubt they miss 4@s or not|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly lucky result NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fine result in my book|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we focus on the field, all around sharks :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to be honest, 1@h seems a good idea to me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 3rd seat, passed partner, both nonvul|pg||
nt|haans: as so often no Strong Jump Shifts any more|pg||
nt|boyklas: 2Spades is invitational with 6 spades|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two hearts and a spade for defenders|pg||
nt|westjava: some one told me : nt=trf to 3@c, 3@d=trf to 3@h: to play or slam try, 4@h mild slam try @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to convince declarer|pg||
nt|haans: Fantoni played late|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks boye for @d pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sorry, just too quick for me there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Tried to catch up on the last few tricks, but I'll get the result in when they finish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think +620 |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: last board on th way|pg||
nt|kastan88: meanwhile USA is 2 up in Match A and B|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good discards|pg||
nt|gmarco24: as i said, 2@d would be @d/@s 4+4+|pg||
nt|tez: if duck first @s..|pg||
nt|haans: then thats out|pg||
nt|bobholl: if N has the long @C the chance for Kx is better |pg||
nt|haans: did all see how quite we were|pg||
nt|stc: ruff a @c, let j@h run|pg||
nt|bobholl: decision time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a spade would have been good for EW|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: @HQ chance play|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell attacking his side suit first|pg||
nt|Walddk7: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out regardless|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer claims after touching trump|pg||
nt|jacksond: of course helgemo/helness didnt play in Pau so Norway didnt do well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.clairebridge.com/brogelandcollage.htm   many photos there|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @D6 exit?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not for me with bad @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is Super Matchpoints|pg||
nt|april7: except if N doesn't X but bids 1 @S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oliverc: yes, wd|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the other room,  no way she can win the bd |pg||
nt|westjava: wow, USA fly too high at other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as east no splinter was available|pg||
nt|mamos: needs to get Clubs right to keep it to one down  --  |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess @cA+ruff ---which @dtop + ruff also same given layout|pg||
nt|haans: nothing is more difficult in bridge than defense|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|edmunte1: after Probst have shown DA+|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hard to see|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: meant no way she can lose the bd |pg||
nt|yvesj49: 9@h|pg||
nt|edmunte1: @S and @DK, it would have been pretty normal to play him fot 2722|pg||
nt|tez: q of @h was right play|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: uh oh ok undo|pg||
nt|april7: yes,OR|pg||
nt|bernix: i know law abiding players who raise with south hand|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this match will have basketball result|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i hope Ozden won't step on the line this time  :D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/brogeland-lindqvist.pdf  and convention card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: daclarer cant draw trumps and start on clubs, would be short of f trumps so plays clubs  right away|pg||
nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|april7: for some the hand is on the verge of a X but could also bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|stc: BIGGER OOPS|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: played with espen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the idea there|pg||

nt|h_karluk: but many chances, total 14 boards|pg||
nt|blewah: pass was the good decision by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Last board in this set now|pg||

nt|sybarra: last bd of this match |pg||
nt|sybarra: back in about 1 hour |pg||
nt|riccho:  hmm. He should have finessed in @h...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: never met him|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe 1.5 - US 3.5|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Last board, hope you've all enjoyed the event. |pg||
nt|edmunte1: 5 IMP's for Croatia|pg||
nt|haans: full control in defense like it|pg||
nt|haans: me 2:)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: slam chances now|pg||
nt|boyklas: i meant after 3D to bid 3S as a q-bid with fit in D|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 6@C  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: that was painful|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: yipes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: winner Europe in this segment|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S the winner|pg||
nt|bernix: true. i am a 1@s bidder but X is OK, too|pg||
nt|tez: good result for turkey-edirne..4@h was down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S max|pg||
nt|anton72: Aces loving Romanian team :) 2-nd board they have all |pg||
nt|stc: wow, 6@c !!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: bcos of stiff @s Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i thought his name is robert|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: does Levin have a transfer bid|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46****|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 5@d but a novel problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: well well 3N must be a bad minor pre-empt|pg||
nt|mcphee: bad suit that is what I mean|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N always cold|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you Bob|pg||
nt|h_karluk: friendly layout there|pg||
nt|westjava: I never do thet|pg||
nt|westjava: *that|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N not cold from S at all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @cQ lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: we return with Hampson-Weinstein  vs Helgemo-Justin H on this table, and many more pairings on the other tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: In about 25 mins|pg||
nt|bobholl: europe has won this match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: when Zoric played small on @CQ, Roussev could have maked it|pg||
nt|haans: cards form 5@H|pg||
nt|haans: understand that but how to bid with spades?|pg||
nt|stc: IMO the hand is too good for 3@c|pg||
nt|stc: not really, If the A@c is missing, there is no danger of discards on the K@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  at the other table, Stefanov (North) played a @s at trick 3 himself, killng the entry to the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: EW will surely bid and make 4@S here|pg||
nt|udo: same biding so far|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see what can go wrong if dec plays trump before @d (keeping the 10@h in dummy)|pg||
nt|udo: in the other room 2@H-4@H followed now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or @c lead and @h back|pg||
nt|westjava: what's wrong with 3@D opening?|pg||
nt|blewah: strong club|pg||
nt|yvesj49: without the jack ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken; "Oh lovely"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because that's last board|pg||
nt|haans: North double very rare today|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S looks like sucide|pg||
nt|boyklas: 3Spades|pg||
nt|anton72: 4 @s is good defence here|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you promise 2 from top 3 acceptable|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: they were good enough : 1 Boye BROGELAND - Espen LINDQVIST Norway 0.82 2. 2 Claudio NUNES - Fulvio FANTONI Italy 0.71|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bloody result in OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Eric decided to a sacrifice|pg||
nt|bernix: north seems to like off-shape doubles|pg||
nt|stc: 6@h only 800|pg||
mb|2C|nt|westjava: strong @C in action|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @S game force? |pg||
nt|bobholl: brogeland also in 4@H as predicted|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo: "the ususal stuff"|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell might have considerted double|pg||
nt|riccho:  double finesse in @h = 25%. Better than a sure -1 isnt it?|pg||
nt|diumraid: For what its worth BUFFETT RUNNING SCORES USA  107  EUR  85   with 7/8 boards to go|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S is agood save,except EW finds the @D ruffs by underleading twice the AK:):)|pg||
nt|boyklas: GF 5+S|pg||
nt|bernix: we're 3 boards ahead of OR which plays rather unhurriedly|pg||
nt|boyklas: 6+ sory|pg||
nt|stc: 5NT for mionors ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S no make|pg||
nt|haans: will they land in 3nt?|pg||
nt|westjava: strong suit I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia now thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Taps his pass card|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure his "given" name is Robert,  but I have known him for more years than either of us will admit....always bobby |pg||
nt|h_karluk: East not a passed hand, over x supposedly sys on|pg||
nt|bernix: kib is pointing out that 1@s actually promises @s & @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C slam will be easier but that's pure luck|pg||
nt|haans: cards right for decl|pg||
nt|bobholl: good proposition but is he brave enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: board being played with Sontag as N!!!|pg||
nt|oliverc: can they stop at 3@S?|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps they are playing transfer pre-empts|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html|pg||
nt|bobholl: escaped a @C lead  the guessers|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Weinstein apologieses, "I went for a little difference@@|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe.....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: b|pg||
nt|haans: 0GUCCI: 4h for EW  ME: right without clubs ruff|pg||
nt|stc: too good because of 8 @cs and the extra K |pg||
nt|stc: If W X now, there is an ethic problem...|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: honestly surprised to 1@s overcall, 2@s fine in many books, glad Ron Klinger did not see that overcall|pg||
nt|haans: odds for going wrong in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: heheh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i won't be here, instant matchpoints in USA, also wld b busy as a player and appeal committee, gl everybody|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must find @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: just three red tricks to lose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean direct wjo|pg||
nt|westjava: 7 cards fir 4@D??:)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H is transfer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a fast table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they bid and play very quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia: "hopefully not too much"|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C K OR J lead puts 6@S 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have,  but only has Ax in spades,  last thing he wants to hear is  4 @S |pg||
nt|h_karluk: which Nunes did not follow the same route like Eric|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around, congrats to both teams|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: pedjabre: 1@s from N would be @s+@c |pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: if so that wont work|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|haans: but tempting|pg||
nt|ady: might stop out of game|pg||
nt|westjava: *for|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in practice very hard to find @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, last board now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: restart in 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "She has a better takeout double than you :)"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and my homework wld b done, wow|pg||
nt|mamos: hard to show the North hand any other way|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i prefer double instead of 3@h if it's not played as penality, the suit is just too weak for 3@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C presumably a fit-non-jump, as South is a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  this scoring is named "board a match"|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  97 EUR 77 ****   after this round|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very nice organization|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kiwi_joker: might be tempted to play this one in NT instead of spades, because of the allure of the higher score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems angels whisper to try 5@d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easier to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most players prefer to pick a M suit opening lead |pg||
nt|mcphee: how hard is it to find A@H lead against 3N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Boye Brogeland, still the world's top ranked Junior|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D, natural and @S support, do you play this, Shirley?|pg||
nt|haans: Have a good time Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks sir:)|pg||
nt|ady: not a great 3NT    but it makes|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C did say no game for me|pg||
nt|ady: gl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: many skilled operators and top players were there|pg||
nt|bernix: does not work out particularly well on the actual setup. 4@sx is a good save |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: diet coke with gree lime time, brb|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *green lime|pg||
nt|jacksond: its a long story hamdi but of course Boye is World champion and it was unfortunate that for whatever reason Norway didnt field their strongest team in the last ewuroean ...|pg||
nt|jacksond: Championships|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: a short suit game try at the 2 level. I never saw that before|pg||
nt|rado: will declarer find Q trumps:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|sybarra: I play 2/1 |pg||
nt|westjava: the same|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT is on but lucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: haha Ant, cool|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com |pg||
nt|edmunte1: best lead|pg||
nt|stc: note that 3NT had no play at all|pg||
nt|stc: NS preempted them selfs out, hoping ops are in a bad spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm.. didnt think it would die at the 2 level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@h cue not fit as obv seen, just stopper|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all pass expected here|pg||
nt|oliverc: Even 3@S may be too highNunes may go one more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i agree with all bids there except finall pass by Jill|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not a bridge book double, opener hand but 2 cards clubs, 3 wld be a bridge book double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: We are indebted to Roland Wald for such great provide|pg||
nt|anton72: brave DBL :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT could have been down if you have 6@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|westjava: I play precision|pg||
nt|ady: Europe home in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H2 being considered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two way @c hook there|pg||
nt|haans: only three spades do no agree with 3@S|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt minors 5/5..ozden says i have 10 card in minors..not important|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Mackwell boys have played BAM before Sure they know |pg||
nt|mamos: it's difficult to imagine this auction at imp scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@d could be fatal|pg||
nt|haans: solid bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand  Im not sure shed quite expect this shape from South   but game reached :)|pg||
nt|ady: so far|pg||
nt|haans: question is could N pass 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: AJtx|pg||
nt|jbgood: club shift?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it is needed - 3@h will go down 1 on any defense (but one)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wasn't Norway's decision, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected twelve players from different countries of Europe|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed Oliver|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think wld bring +660 for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Thank you everyone, this is the last board of the set. We restart in around 30 mins.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's makeable|pg||
nt|april7: now 12 tricks available|pg||
nt|bobholl: if S had passed iso 5@H would they have bid 6 i doubt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: oh Lisa there|pg||
nt|ady: only needed to share the hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c also, 3@h uh oh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gtg, bye guys, god bless|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: bye!|pg||

nt|haans: tricky|pg||

pc|c4|nt|blewah: 1 down 2 to go for guessing A/Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: S totally quiet with 3 aces may not be easy to see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board is finished I will load up 1 again and enter some of the play |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @c Q hook marked|pg||
nt|haans: but does not know that|pg||
nt|bernix: best is @d6. declarer has to make a crucial discard|pg||
nt|haans: right :)|pg||
nt|stc: @h now|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems straightforward eleven tricks|pg||
nt|ady: meyers mad a tight 1NT hand 16|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bernix: what's the point in ruffing a @d? i dont see it|pg||
nt|haans: decl hate to have to guess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17  the 460 looking good to maybe win the match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we are 6 tables all days|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hook obv|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 1N, 2@d dislike|pg||
nt|edmunte1: still worth only 1IMP|pg||
nt|bernix: but is in the confortable position that he cannot misguess|pg||
nt|haans: Objection: lalislol: @D6 tells decl where all the cards are|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|haans: but could he he did not have cards to slam|pg||
nt|mamos: she|pg||
nt|haans: Well done all day Ant|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: This board will not be scored at this board :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will open 3N against you more often then:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant long minor|pg||
nt|westjava: fault no.1|pg||
nt|bobholl: 12 tricks on a double squeeze (rodwell found it) but in @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H made now|pg||
nt|haans: Most point out that @CT was what made this deal|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|westjava: for gambling 3nt, I lead a gambling honour at other (M) suit|pg||
nt|jacksond: 2NT in other romm was a grwat result for europe and was  likely to win board anyway.|pg||
nt|kastan88: B-A-M sounds as former known Soviet trans-Siberian BAM (Baical-Amur magistral)|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be that is reason to stop BAm counting|pg||
nt|riccho:  Bd 5 is a next-to-sure winner for europe (my prediction ary lousy... :))|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @H lead stops 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The europeans seem to have a stanglehold on this match  needing just half from the last two boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: and the good 3@S will bring them at least a 1/2|pg||
nt|bobholl: ouder als mijn dochter (1975)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: That was the last board, thanks all. We restart in 25 mins.|pg||
nt|bobholl: thanks ant your perfonce was as usual very good |pg||
nt|bobholl: performance sry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposedly +650 for NS|pg||
nt|danilo1: pretty @S10 :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: does he think N has 5@S |pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: diet coke sweetened with splenda also good, however i prefer diet coke lime|pg||
nt|haans: sry she|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which may be vital when there's unknown minor suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes fans his hand|pg||

nt|oliverc: 8x left|pg||

nt|sybarra: and this is last hand of toruney,  and now the parties begin I suppose|pg||

nt|skaftij:  WD!|pg||

pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: wonder could do same abt clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around, good work operator, seeya|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Thanks.  Just one more set, starting in 30mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sorry, it was 10 tricks, I misunderstood the claim.|pg||
nt|xenya: oh sure -- not the next one though -- later -- is that OK?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bobholl: he only has to count the @S and if not high cash @C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done indeed!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: match won bye Europa|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|edmunte1: he has to guess @c in the ending if Agge will keep all the clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can't be enjoying this - East has been squeezed twice, and now this pin of the @DQ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  :-)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, a pause?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
mc|8|nt|bobholl: coming :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nice defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 made|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for example, 1@h<1N>pass, 2@c <2@h> would lead to 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: after the double hampson should bid 5@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because South would be confident partner has 8 hcp and spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: That was the last board of this set; restart in 25 mins|pg||

nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|haans: Final word: Helgulf2: as he didn't, he obviously had KJ9:-)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably didn't |pg||
nt|haans: new slam|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt i would open S|pg||
nt|stc: note the best performance of N in bidding and card play :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: to put it mildly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 23/17 and this time hard layout, could be a bloody one|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Great result for Bulgaria in OR|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1NT by South ?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jan_jansma: Will East get his @S in in time?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: probably|pg||
nt|haans: same here im sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: sure didn't :)|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H had been hard to beat if played by West|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s looks cold here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a small chance of getting too high|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: 4@S ?|pg||
nt|rado: E will expect better suit for 2nd pos preempt vuln|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D good save NS|pg||
nt|haans: yep 100 of 100 times|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: or something similar but conventional|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no, he will be on lead himself|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: if they get to 3NT|pg||
nt|stc: I expect pass and XX from N|pg||
nt|bobholl: very risky system if you have to open 1nt V versus NV :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: wasnt much to say say on that hand |pg||
nt|bernix: i must say i would not have bid 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: vul dare not bid more|pg||
nt|bobholl: but @C will save them|pg||
nt|stc: sure, not a good slam|pg||
nt|anton72: good bid by Nanev|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oliverc: looks ok|pg||
nt|haans: Here's a link http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php if you feel like browsing through the past presentations. |pg||
nt|sybarra: Ant  are these the bds we missed? or live action? |pg||
nt|haans: i do not like it but I would|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: play is not that easy|pg||
nt|edmunte1: this is that kind of board when you don't have to lead your partner's suit :)|pg||
nt|haans: save may cost to much|pg||
nt|haans: best to have East  as leader|pg||
nt|bobholl: diminished @H Q|pg||
nt|danilo1: pass by North? |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: small @D now and it's easy|pg||
nt|ady: thin game    but hackets are aggressive|pg||
nt|mamos: 170 looks a good EW score|pg||
nt|mamos: 4 losers?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 2NT maybe positive with @C? (or any bal positive)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: I think the latter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: One missed board entered|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probst going for the money due to vulnerability|pg||
nt|bobholl: he thinks :)|pg||
nt|haans: pass or xx as support|pg||
nt|danilo1: but I would jump to 4@S with 5 ... especially after 2@H Dble|pg||
nt|bobholl: i didn't mean this way but works equally well|pg||
nt|stc: 2Nt for minors ?|pg||
nt|anton72: new ...200 or 300 coming|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North has a bit in reserve but wisely passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: fasten your seat belt pls!|pg||
nt|haans: Who can understand Radisics bidding?|pg||
nt|stc: no, 3@c for @cs|pg||
nt|bobholl: we don't know their agreement for pass :)|pg||
nt|stc: if need K finesse any many extras|pg||
nt|stc: trumps 3-2, @c friendly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably 4@S was "fast-arrival"|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: poor game   needs to avoid anymajor suit losers and bring in the 4th diamond to discard a spade|pg||
nt|mamos: right i see yep sorry   lots of work to do|pg||
nt|ady: OR  got no higher   should be all square|pg||
nt|jbgood: can even affort 2 club losers and still win the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: perhaps jill should have raised hearts as north with her good shape|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2nt 16-18 here|pg||
nt|april7: a very light opener,but only a NT game |pg||
nt|bobholl: bit weak for a reverse but what else|pg||
nt|boyklas: me too, i havent got any other good option, and the 2D is too little for this hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|westjava: Europe on fire, that's all:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: back to real time now|pg||
nt|westjava: ok Ant|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I'll enter the other's bidding and play when I can|pg||
nt|westjava: good,saving you time Ant|pg||
nt|blewah: dbl is 4M 5m i suppose|pg||
nt|edmunte1: wow|pg||
nt|haans: cluibs 3-3 make it|pg||
nt|haans: but look out for spade lead|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H 1 down|pg||
nt|stc: note tha 3NT have some chances on a @s lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jan_jansma: blackwood for @C here, I think|pg||
nt|blewah: so Auken probably "cheated" to her p|pg||
nt|westjava: after pass, just balancing I think|pg||
nt|blewah: but see von Arnim didn't take the joke|pg||
nt|bobholl: knows ?! position of @H T now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: easy 7 tricks but?|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to go wrong now|pg||
nt|westjava: I bid pass with that hand, forever|pg||
nt|haans: openings go down and down|pg||
nt|gmarco24: his partner obviously not  :)|pg||
nt|haans: looks like Altman can|pg||
nt|tez: why not 2@d before|pg||
nt|stc: most of the time is weak or business|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins,Running Scores,the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have taken the plunge|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers's bidding shows 5 hearts, but not a good suit. Levin showed 4@Ss|pg||
nt|april7: everything works fine for declarer making 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 1@d= 11-20, 3+@d|pg||
nt|stc: 1 IMP for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H lead in other room :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes but 3@h only invitational+|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. |pg||
nt|haans: trumf queen again|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|edmunte1: i agree with 2@h, lots of controls and most of points in suits|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@S and a @H lead ?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: declarer will test @s, then @h|pg||
nt|haans: you know that one opps did say I like the lead of ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: however, looks like great guess by brothers ... 4@S is probably -1 (to -2)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the silly ?! double migth let 4 make|pg||
nt|anton72: A here made contract|pg||
nt|anton72: = 13 imps back for CONTRA|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so 4@s = non rock-bottom minimum|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mamos: this may prove too expensive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: namaskar ravi dost, zia and hamman vs duboin, sementa in this room:) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: opps i m sorry slipped|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Very well done by NS|pg||
nt|haans: spade 9 in right place|pg||
nt|edmunte1: or no :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that would depend on what 3@D meant - whether it was GF or a high-card raise to 3@s. |pg||

nt|rado: E did well to blast to 5 level even little hope to make 5@c |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C split complicates matters|pg||
nt|mcphee: reducing a table entry to just 1|pg||
nt|stc: unlucky lead, very unlucky|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzrj: discards = att|pg||
nt|sybarra: may misguess this hand,  the balance is on a real piece of cheese |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|oliverc: Berkowitx opts for a passive exit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: born eight and a half years before I was born (1954 end), i am glad to catch his articles, books, cool|pg||
nt|oliverc: rather than risking opening up a round suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he was born in 1946|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i dislike that @d2 pitch|pg||

nt|oliverc: looking like +1 only now|pg||
nt|oliverc: North cannot be endplayed to lead a @C|pg||

nt|april7: the 10 of @S made the hand safe|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D lead can also be made (duck 2 @C)|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: easy 3N for NS players|pg||
nt|haans: nowdays 2nt are more forcing than in the old days|pg||
nt|haans: do not like that opening|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks available|pg||
nt|bobholl: at last a simple 4@H|pg||
nt|anton72: think no :)|pg||
nt|anton72: they get it 6 90 %|pg||
nt|anton72: 3 NT |pg||
mb|4C|nt|oliverc: 3NT looks pretty inevitable here|pg||
nt|mamos: JJ play 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2nt=20-21|pg||
nt|stc: a simple 4, a tricky 6 :)|pg||
nt|anton72: 1-st they agressive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the cards seem to be running in a NS direction this set|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: Rockwell compare score against Helgemo-Helness|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@c > 16+|pg||
nt|oliverc: might see a result here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but th problem would they land there|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,good spot in 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: e/w may well play 4@S|pg||
nt|blewah: not so eventful slam|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 4@S for NS|pg||
nt|anton72: 2-nd they lost 1100 in previous boards|pg||
mb|5C|nt|h_karluk: Meyers see quick tricks at her hand, anyways what about clubs and hearts |pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT by West is on|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @D very !! nice contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: not sure Bobby overcalled with 1N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless aliens changed that nice guy|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, alerted but no explanation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Russell|pg||
nt|oliverc: there are defences to precision that would overcall 1NT here :)|pg||
nt|westjava: and NS will save by 5@D?:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: meyers wastes not time reaching 3N:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there's a passed partner|pg||
nt|mcphee: i bet against save|pg||
nt|haans: many use support x only with extra|pg||
nt|haans: and again|pg||
nt|haans: raise?|pg||
nt|haans: good chice|pg||
nt|boyklas: sorry have to go, ty all see you at the next match|pg||
nt|danilo1: even by East|pg||
nt|stc: you need "only" two cards on side|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: no reason for Berkowitz to do anything other than bid it|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1NT probably round or sharp given the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expected a double |pg||
nt|mcphee: thot levin might dble but he chose 4N minor suit t/o|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio smelt the danger|pg||
nt|blewah: EW play 4card M|pg||
nt|haans: urkkkkkkk|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wouldn't bid 2 nt as west but some number of @C|pg||
nt|danilo1: reasonable 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: yep 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|anton72: 25 %|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: BAM rare in Europe played in Reisinger in USA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Oliver but in USA ( as i live there ) Precision Defense Systems only manufactures. Standard machine guns :))))|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1@s denying 4 spades|pg||
nt|tez: undo pls|pg||
nt|bobholl: 25% is better than a "roland" slam|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: she know noe 4 card support ...and will continued i think over 4|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit less than 25|pg||
nt|stc: I agree, after -1100 in a short match the should risk|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lol|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a partial in no-trump|pg||
nt|edmunte1: it was a maker on any lead, so just a small loss for Romania|pg||
nt|haans: books have been written about leading from Jacks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: defence seem likely to cash six tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: Zia might do best to pass this   but trf looks normal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe Bob would double if he had one club short and one spade more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: meanwhile let's not forget Zia fans ; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O37j3G2SwgU   :)|pg||
nt|haans: preemtive raise cost this time|pg||
nt|ady: this should be overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 4th, 2nd from bad. Right side up on trick 1, then upside down after|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin asks about the 1@C - shows 4 unless 17/18 4333|pg||
nt|mcphee: or natural:)|pg||
nt|haans: have not bid 2@C on that for many many years|pg||
nt|danilo1: West want to wait the lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @D lead ?|pg||
nt|anton72: some missunderstanding here|pg||
nt|anton72: points is not importanr for this pair :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
nt|stc: But, as we know nobody plays minors anymore :(|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: this would give him a better chance to play 2@h or 2@d|pg||
nt|oliverc: You will almost never see players at this level look for a  Major fit with 4333 shape|pg||
nt|haans: west hand 1 trick in 3@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not sure Levin's decision|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: not clear at all how o play this|pg||
nt|haans: bidding = but we may be lucky|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwi_joker: 3Nt should be a fast -2|pg||
nt|diumraid: ******  LIVE IN RUNNING ****** BUFFETT CUP ******   USA  38 -  EUR 22  ******  Last Round of the Day.  Teams tomorrow with another 72 points at stake. ******|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks like -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo: Nicer in spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helness laughs :)|pg||
nt|ady: flat 17   nice tops   but needs good clubs to have a decent play|pg||
nt|haans: slam a hearts finesse away|pg||
nt|haans: yep 1 spade trick then|pg||
nt|danilo1: on @D lead, tempo for @S trick(s)|pg||
nt|bobholl: they expect a @H lead so :)|pg||
nt|anton72: but not now|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't but isn't his partner limitred to 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: limited|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 imp back or no....doesent matter ...20-10 for BMP|pg||
nt|anton72: is he is|pg||
nt|anton72: I just make some guessings|pg||
nt|anton72: what to play ...they decide at table|pg||
nt|twcho: rehi|pg||
nt|bobholl: after @S lead being in 4@H won't make 6|pg||
nt|xenya: correct|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely even Roland would not want to be in a slam here|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mamos: against three NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: unless this brogeland is a son of Boye Brogeland|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice double|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S, forcing and 4 cards support|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The slam score was wrong- +1 is correct, sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: impressed that n/s got to game,  slow start |pg||
nt|anton72: new DBL for 1 down :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but look at the breaks - spades 3-3, clubs 3-3 with the king onside|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seeing all 13, he would|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sure I would, it's a terrible slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I just said that in the other room|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oliverc: @D, @H, 2 @C and a @S|pg||
nt|ady: major suit switch will leave declarer short   and that is certain to come|pg||
nt|mamos: or more if this @DK wins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considers @D10|pg||
nt|h_karluk: since 2 boards a tad aggressive approach to cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose this 4N was to play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's|pg||
nt|westjava: switch to @C now|pg||
nt|westjava: or never:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: she would enjoy to @c switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just low towards hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think this may be a long think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: musing|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C switch would not be welcome at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin as gone for a comfort break, a kibitzer sits in|pg||
nt|jbgood: good communication E-W to win another board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: significant double|pg||
nt|rado: E might have 1-2 hcp only, so declarer  has a chanse|pg||
nt|haans: lot of thinking :)|pg||
nt|anton72: some spectacors said poss -2 ...yes that is correct ...but with current lead|pg||
nt|anton72: let see the lead ...not easy realy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/DM1COpeningBid.html  Defense Methods Against 1 Club Opening Bids|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2@d=GF relay|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing artificial system now..pls dont try at home:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@d no 4 majors|pg||
nt|haans: Good advice: Tez: they are playing artificial system now..pls dont try at home:)|pg||
nt|haans: Turkey did bid the Grand on board 5|pg||
nt|bobholl: loss not great :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: say 1N received than 1N (16-18) after reasonable range in competition and not against the odds |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
nt|westjava: means thar score now is 3-1, Ant?|pg||
nt|westjava: *that|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no, score is now entered, 2.5-4.5 is correct|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I'll re-enter the play before the next board|pg||
nt|edmunte1: just a simple matter of probabilities|pg||
nt|april7: if @S is led after ace of @H N must set up the @C suit to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: why ? A@d, @h finess, discard 2@s on @ds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if they bid and make it against you - it's not your day |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: yes we have all seen better opening bids|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west also contributed well, cool x |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@h invitational, 5@h... hmmm, that's not it  :)|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos: her first thoughts were best :)|pg||
nt|westjava: bingo!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now : 7 @d in bag, 2@c also|pg||
nt|mcphee: the good news is Sementa has a second @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so th tenth either spades or hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no transportation problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have 4 tricks Hamdi|pg||
nt|gmarco24: let's try this one|pg||
nt|skaftij:  of course you spotted the slam Roland |pg||
pc|h9|nt|edmunte1: 4@h still a bridge too far|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: natural lead i think 1 p for each pair|pg||
nt|xenya: @H finesse is not safe in 4|pg||
nt|anton72: think here is not a bridge school|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: in 4 yes ...but if u play 6 ?.....|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin: "what's 1@S-3@D" - answer: "inv"|pg||
nt|haans: finesse in hearts for 3 hearts|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Nunes scratching his head now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: certainly in thought :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: clearly he was hoping his @S were running|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: so South did well to win the first @S|pg||
nt|haans: artificial systems is like marriage  you must stay with you long time partner|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: my Gran would have approved of that lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *edit: then|pg||
nt|westjava: lovely @H4|pg||
nt|danilo1: actually, @H lead best for defense (saves overtrick)|pg||
nt|anton72: think he have to play trumps imideatly after lead ...but he afraid from 4-2 break|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: also Bob Hamman fans, i have the chance to watch their play here in USA,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeIw1XMZfeU   :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Now will take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Rich, welcome aboard, nice to see you joined us|pg||
nt|reisig: Hiya :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure Bob, they will get their winners to set it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 bridges :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@h=relay, 2@s=5@c, 3@c fit and RKC, 3NT=2+Q@c and probably spiral scan after it|pg||
nt|haans: spiral scan is Bid suit you do not have control in|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|westjava: and contract is 4nt:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we all see|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin is back, and North/South send out a kibitzer for some diet cokes|pg||
nt|haans: will end with @D finesse|pg||
nt|april7: two ways, either ruffing finesse in @D or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|haans: yep can try clubs first|pg||
nt|stc: a match of missed oportunities|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
mc|9|nt|h_karluk: edit: 1@s|pg||

nt|h_karluk: it was indeed a subtle line|pg||
nt|ady: all square same in OR|pg||
nt|westjava: a mathematical count problem solved by Dubuin:)|pg||
nt|haans: and also count in that you may stress opps and can get IMP at other board|pg||
nt|april7: N didn't even try, is 1 P worth nothing anymore???:):)|pg||
nt|haans: holy again|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: unfortunately we were not able to watch all cards played|pg||
nt|jbgood: only one down?|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: Croatia scored 11 on board 14, so we have a close finish|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d best shoot|pg||
nt|haans: NS may bid 3nt (23 hcp) :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: what does 2@D show?|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|mamos: is this a  hand for science?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky day of Steve Weinstein|pg||
nt|stc: and a making line if E have had one more @h instead of the @d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easy make :)|pg||
nt|haans: Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: :)   a two up transfer :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass is a sure thing|pg||
nt|oliverc: Auken perhaps not counting the hand right there. partner HAS to have either the K|pg||
nt|oliverc: or J of Spades to make up their 1@C Opening|pg||
nt|westjava: *Duboin|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4 or 5@D?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 I think|pg||
nt|haans: every time you ask you will allsways be told "random deals "|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: normally many people plays it xfer to spades|pg||
nt|stc: this is how you win 100 times the cavendish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt off one, whatever|pg||
nt|sybarra: a precision 2 @C  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6+ clubs |pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c 6+ 10-15 usually no 4M|pg||
nt|westjava: Arnim-Auken system, looks like close to precision I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I was only using precision as a generic description of the 2 @C bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and you are not sure about @c A, K|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: someone gets a text message loudly in the room - everyone looks|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 4@s normal spot|pg||
nt|haans: no game for NS|pg||
nt|danilo1: may be interesting board ... if West wait (he should) ... and if 2@D is Forcing|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: http://www.masterpointpress.com/general/bbum.html|pg||
nt|jacksond: looks impossible for declarer to get out for one down which would be a half|pg||
nt|blewah: closer to ultra canape, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: if you roll the dice and bid slam then in the newspapers, if goes down would feel worst, because the players there know their business very well|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: well  you'd want to be playing with a partner with whom you had very secure agreements on this auction ........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5@s misread|pg||
nt|oliverc: Do we know exactly what 4@H meant?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : tenace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no we do not know|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, no discussions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok, no worries|pg||
nt|april7: without @S stop I'd rather bid 2 @H than 1 NT|pg||
nt|haans: 1@Sx no game if make|pg||
nt|haans: kibs say 4@H 4@H|pg||
nt|bernix: 4@h loses 3 aces and ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but can 2@D be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The USA players all suffering different degrees of jet lag|pg||
nt|edmunte1: kalin will upgrade due to 10 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: 1ntx no game if make|pg||
nt|haans: novel bid :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blewah: prec obligates 5 card M|pg||
nt|westjava: back to the Italy at '70 era, arya?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: that 4@D looks costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 2@D shows 9 cards either way|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding on a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: surprised they didnt double 4@D (at this form of scoring).|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass saves the day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: not the fastest auction in the world|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can make 11 tricks in hearts    but might settle for 10?|pg||
nt|westjava: helpfuly|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand to play |pg||
nt|blewah: maybe. i was not borned yet :)|pg||
nt|westjava: Roman and Neapolitan, a wonderful nostalgic...|pg||
nt|haans: i rather pass as soon as possible|pg||
nt|april7: to high already on !G leads!!!|pg||
nt|april7: @H leads|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 7 tricks the limit here for NS|pg||
nt|haans: urkk|pg||
nt|haans: may i enter a novel bid: Pass|pg||
nt|haans: in 2/1 time a bid that aint forcing?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This could be interesting for a small deal|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: ask me , my jet lag lasted a month|pg||
nt|haans: well vul game|pg||
nt|bernix: and i cant see east leading anything else|pg||

pc|s5|pg||

nt|danilo1: some does it :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|mamos: Zia knows what he has   we know what he has   |pg||
nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
nt|haans: Good make me get for @HT|pg||
nt|bernix: failure due to lack of aces|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
nt|oliverc: so ruffing high and exiting with the Q@S should have been a sensible line of defence|pg||

nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||

nt|gmarco24: "i have clubs"?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: or perhaps he did and risked 6NT   not inconceivable at this form of scoring|pg||

nt|h_karluk: footnote : it was hard enough to understand for a 12 years old kid, but today i got the great value |pg||
nt|oliverc: I have to go. thanks everyone.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeya buddy|pg||
nt|stc: A@h and @h will do|pg||
nt|westjava: she choose @S first|pg||
nt|sybarra: going for @s...probably doesnt matter |pg||
nt|blewah: 10 tricks and win the board|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: most are still playing IMP im sure|pg||
nt|haans: in their mind|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|oliverc: LOL. Fantoni had to start with 3 @s's to beat this|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, cash AH@C|pg||
nt|haans: question is Had 2NT from South been lavinthal so 3@C did show a strong hand?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: medically referred to as "desynchronosis," is a physiological condition which is a consequence of alterations to circadian rhythms.|pg||
nt|westjava: did you open 1nt or 1 @H, Bob?|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  Jet lag results from rapid long-distance transmeridian (east-west or west-east) travel, as on a jet plane.|pg||
nt|mcphee: i open those hands 1N|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|westjava: 5332,right?|pg||
nt|mcphee: the bidding is easier when you open 1N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me simple 1@h, melih ozdil of new york also likes to begin with 1N since long years|pg||
nt|westjava: AK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: BAM in Super MP take your tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin asks about carding - "standard"|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Decl might have tried to muddy things by ducking a @h, who knows, maybe defense clears @s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: this is ahand that shows this scoring methods difficulties  playing imps we would have bid Board 24 by now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: catchy board|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Saelensminde asks about signals in the trump suit - answer SP|pg||

nt|haans: nov 2 for more Balkan Bridge|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|mcphee: even 5-4-2-2 with certain provisions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't believe it|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't believe the TD should step in and announce one team can't win - any more than we do in the Spingold or Bermuda Bowl and a team is down 25 with one board to go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean @c9 got a trick 1st round|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice play! |pg||
nt|danilo1: in OR, Israel missdefended 4@S (also played by South) ...so first 10 IMPS for Romania|pg||

nt|mamos: an everyday Zia auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: just the odd mutter|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here we go guys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the penultimate board there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still total 12 boards there Ant?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, 12 boards this match|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: an extra up trick |pg||
nt|haans: 5 boards much can happen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  That @s7 did not do much good in the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: a declarer missplay on board 5 provided Romania 10 more IMP's|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: I think last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in weak NT maybe 5 cards junk major suit|pg||
nt|blewah: 1 point for that board was not fair she shuld be rewarded for her play too|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember 1 @H could be 4 card|pg||
nt|edmunte1: offshape 1nt by Probst|pg||
nt|haans: Many get violent if you open 1nt with 2-5-4-2 but have my choice|pg||
mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: handle with care , use it in your own risk|pg||
nt|westjava: 1 point + clap clap|pg||
nt|edmunte1: too many con's imho|pg||
nt|edmunte1: offshape and maximum|pg||
mb|3H|nt|westjava: sure|pg||
nt|rado: quiet 3NT here:)|pg||
nt|april7: 1@C 1@S 2NT and then pass or 3NT, which I doubt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcphee: When I lead the K the J always pops down in the dummy also:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks then we have 3 more including this one|pg||
nt|jacksond: started on bd 15 so 3 more|pg||
nt|blewah: 2nT 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|haans: unusual rare pass by North|pg||
nt|april7: to strong for 1NT, E's hand!!|pg||
nt|tez: no slam here?|pg||
nt|haans: prefer 5@C to 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big opportunity for QUANTUM here. 4@S is close to making and 4@H should have been beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: 3NT never quiet at BAM :)|pg||
nt|westjava: Levin think about 5@C...|pg||
nt|haans: well if you see it as 18 point taken|pg||
nt|haans: not even gards for game|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@D-2@C-P-P- ... and Fight starst with Dble|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Â¤@Hs on few values, but souths aces pull their weight|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Do they change pair to compare with?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: that's a good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|mamos: No Haans I thin they compare throughout with same opponent|pg||
nt|bernix: rare but not unusual. rather normal|pg||
nt|haans: to pass nowdays is not normal :)|pg||
nt|bernix: he cant refrain from balancing now|pg||
nt|april7: but there are limits!!!|pg||
nt|bernix: i tell you i would have passed whenever it was my turn|pg||
nt|haans: fighting for nothing|pg||
nt|bernix: will go down in 2@h instead of collecting +50 in 1nt|pg||
nt|april7: 1 or 2 down in 2@H, depends on declarer- or defence play|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S+!@H+2@D|pg||
nt|gmarco24: easy to set this|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C normal 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|5H|nt|h_karluk: Boca Raton Florida players lucky, this year i was busy a lot, hope in 2011 will visit there to see some familiar faces, including Larry Mori, SC-FL not much distance|pg||
nt|westjava: aha:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: NS play upside-down count|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a trick taking game and i am not volunteer to fool my partner at any phase of the game|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant|pg||
nt|blewah: or 3nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't make 4@H on best defence|pg||
nt|skaftij:  no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: no we started at 15   so although session length has been changed 14  we have two to play after thisboards to 12 |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 12 boards a session|pg||
nt|haans: 10 board should be 14|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spade lead, club switch|pg||
nt|isp: but 4@s?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mamos: declarer's hand is a little lacking ................:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 2@h and x as passed hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: Broge has a problem - will he go for the @d game (or slam)? or NT?|pg||
nt|jacksond: disadvange of the splinter is that it allowed north to indicate a lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes right :)|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFET CUP - USA  64  EUR  56  ****|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probably 3@h=5card|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1@s is like 1nt  forcing bid, Kaplan inversion|pg||
nt|haans: Well done Muranli|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: For many of us it has been a first seeing BAM in action|pg||
nt|reisig: I live in the same area|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i know|pg||
nt|jbgood: the former - it is only 420 against the overtrick for 430 in NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: 1nt  3nt MIGHT HAVE GOT A HEART LEAD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in the good old days Texas Aces were using a similar bid, Goldman's 3@h/3@s after NT described a mild slam interest in @c/@d, but with different shape |pg||
nt|jbgood: not to mention the bigger score for the @d slam bid and made in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match, in about 35 minutes, is Romania 1 vs Greece|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@C|pg||
mb|6S|nt|westjava: I hear that they play 12 boards only, Ant?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, reduced from 14 after a request from both teams as I understand it|pg||
nt|mcphee: meyers might try a low @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the worst is to see ak10 spilit when u lead fm Qj9 etc :)|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty Ant|pg||
nt|mcphee: she can see future exit issues|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about Sementa's possible @D holdings - answer: 4+|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a carbon copy auction except 5/6@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: we seem to be beyong any makeable contract at  this table  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D should make sorry |pg||
nt|april7: 1NT makes, even after @H lead by setting up a second @C trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: more interesting 2@s decision|pg||
nt|haans: nice :)|pg||
nt|ady: ok thx|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@h seems disrespectfull to opps' bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no ... |pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s can get a @H ruff, |pg||
nt|haans: If decl have @SJ he still have it|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... and finaly time for 1 bid by South (probaly Dble)|pg||
nt|haans: yes must show he is alive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: close but you need to ruff 2 cards in the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: bid loss for Croatia|pg||
nt|bernix: i doubt whether they have finished round 2 by then|pg||
nt|haans: presume a 1@H  had not shown good hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and trumps are 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: a heart and a diamond because @D10 does not drop|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Hapson took a good shot in the OR - direct 6 @d even after an original pass by prd|pg||
nt|haans: TD may speed things up a little|pg||
nt|april7: @S finesse now might save atrick , but wil S do it??|pg||

nt|mcphee: Sementa still in the dark where these major suit Q's are|pg||
nt|h_karluk: major suit guesses there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: missing queens, one should decide abt lesser evil|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will gain a discard on the J@C but it is not so helpful|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Geoff shoot the moon|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be the deciding trick :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: Spades first?|pg||
nt|ady: ak@S   low heart to queen?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|haans: :) We´ll meet again :) |pg||
nt|edmunte1: good save|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
nt|danilo1: not only pass ... but forbids partner to bid |pg||
nt|haans: prefer 5@C to 4@H :(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anyway, 10 IMPs to QUANTUM and they are back in the match with 2 boards to go after this|pg||
nt|skaftij:  if Def lead trumps |pg||

nt|westjava: yes, 3@H is transfer to 4@D opps:)|pg||
nt|april7: to late|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|edmunte1: 5@d was lucky|pg||
nt|edmunte1: but again luck goes with the braves|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jacksond: Yes in the long run it is useful to be able to show a minor suited hand and a short major suit|pg||

nt|edmunte1: @CK is just too bad|pg||
nt|haans: reopne have my vote|pg||
nt|haans: 3 boards 30 min they will make it|pg||

nt|haans: When obbs have cards to bid You may not have cards for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another very good result for QUANTUM|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: This is the last board of the set - play continues throughout today and the next three days   fantastic chance to watch the best palyers from both sides of the pond|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll see|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|edmunte1: with @ck in @d agree|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mcphee: this gets them to 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: best to bid aftre opps 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not easy to avoid game|pg||
nt|mcphee: as would even a weak raise I suspect|pg||
nt|mcphee: this one can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken asks what dbl of 2@D is|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I didn't hear the answer - the other finished tables are walking through|pg||
nt|blewah: for blood, i think|pg||
nt|westjava: 5 hcp and over call, South hand!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think it's better to support to 2@H when you have a hand with just one bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: meyers will need to guess well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Sementa-Duboin would like to play there|pg||
nt|jacksond: maybe JILL should have waited to double 2c|pg||
nt|haans: but @HK of value|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Any views?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 2@h bid helped in the other room - no assurance of heart support here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: will make a lot on this lead ... @DQ lead of course works better|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT but not more|pg||
nt|april7: don't lead @H!!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bernix: he wont, east opened 1@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt has only chances in S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: unless +2 Europe lost|pg||
nt|stc: I am informed that 2@h/3@d are art and showing points and shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: modified precision, i bet at least 50 pages|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: W showing 5/4+ in minors with short S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2254 another story|pg||
nt|danilo1: pass by North now also on limit ... has some additions to 8 Hcp |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, there is now, but it may not be primary support|pg||
nt|isp: pass earning a lt of imps here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|westjava: yup, give 2@S and double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|tez: back..i m here now|pg||
nt|haans: Obbs tend to bid with your needed cards|pg||
nt|skaftij:  agree, support with weak hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|edmunte1: but Kx in @c is just a too big negative feature|pg||
nt|edmunte1: if we're going to fight for the part score, at least we should have some chances to make it|pg||
nt|haans: one more board Balkan has done well |pg||
nt|tez: @s's are block|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly in a 5-card major system|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: this looks like a gamble that will not pay off|pg||
nt|oliverc: -2 is too many|pg||
nt|oliverc: but -1 might have been a good result|pg||
nt|oliverc: if 2@S was making|pg||
nt|oliverc: not sure it was, though|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW look to have 6 tricks against 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Fantoni thinking|pg||
nt|reisig: He might have opened 2NT (or 2@c - intending 2NT next)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 tables Hans   do you expect them all to bid game?|pg||
nt|ady: even on a non heart lead  should go down|pg||
nt|mamos: so not dead   ....yet|pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp   not likely any would stop short of game|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree  ady|pg||
nt|mcphee: she has not so far:)|pg||
nt|jacksond: if Saelensmin was indicating the other two suits|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: Zia supposed to know the fact : groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: HH did played Mini-Multi before|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I believe in this comp all Euro pairs are playing same system|pg||
nt|bobholl: now only guess @H :)|pg||
nt|haans: unblocking|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blewah: if rdbl was good hand with no fit, dbl by Levin is penalty, but S with that shape and hcp ran, IMHO|pg||
nt|westjava: agree arya|pg||
nt|tez: if duck he is at home:)|pg||
nt|haans: and blocked :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Possibly, u may still get to spades|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|stc: also informed that Meck ducked the @s allowing 6@h !! to make|pg||
nt|haans: one more clubs and home it gets|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i prefer 2nt with Agge hand over the second double|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: thanks to op   fellow commentataors|pg||
nt|mamos: back in just under 30 minutes|pg||
nt|reisig: Wales ...I thk|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think th rabbit has different eyes from th owl's :)|pg||
