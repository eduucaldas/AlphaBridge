pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|garnetts: card are well palced for NS and that for once was not the best lead as now North will not get a spade ruff |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  Hemant Jalan started the match with an 8 imps carryover due to their win in the round-robin match and extended this lead in the first half|pg||

nt|ian111:  if he thought the D were 3-3 he could have relied on the long D for his 10th trick|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct:  big double fit here for NS but only 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the save in 5@c is likely which might push NS to 5@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|viren169: Asimple 4@H here... tough to reach?!?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: and he played it very fast ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  board 17 flat - but I preferred Spear's line|pg||
nt|mrdct:  gill might splinter in @h if available|pg||
mb|d|nt|ian111:  a C at trick 2|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or introduce a clever psyche with a view to retreating to @c later|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: likely collect 2@H and then South will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|mango joe:  West cud hv made a negative X one wud hv thought|pg||

nt|mrdct:  north might suspect west has psyched now!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ian111:  yes - X seems normal|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4@H is a make|pg||
mb|5C|nt|viren169: 3@D now may get them there...|pg||
nt|figo: that he does almost always|pg||
nt|ian111:  4H very close|pg||
nt|mrdct:  actually - undo all of those comments - i believe EW play transfer over their 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mrdct:  1@h will just be showing 4+ @s|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mrdct:  whilst NS can be held to 10 tricks, that depends of a defence of two black aces at tricks 1 & 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@H is 4 +@S|pg||
mb|5S|nt|viren169: or 4@H as you say!|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D for us mere mortals!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@d MIGHT DO IT AND IT WILL GO OFF |pg||
mb|d|nt|mango joe: not great but @Hs 2-2 and @C finesse on|pg||
nt|ian111:  e/w recovered to bif 4H|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: sorry caps lock  try A@C and three rounds of @D s|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure even I could go down!|pg||
nt|mango joe: a good vul sacrifice if he gets @S right|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mrdct:  this looks to be one or two down - so a lost opportunity for australia|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west has perhaps already shown his hand with his 1@S bid and ought to have left the 5-level decision to compete to east|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hA|nt|ian111:  as so often - no one able to double|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|viren169: 5 @H + 3@S + 2 ruffs = 10 tricks|pg||

pc|dK|nt|viren169: have I missed something?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sandy Duncan is one of the most conservative bidders that I know ... a very solid and sound player|pg||

nt|mrdct:  @s lead best for NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|mango joe: esp in the last round of the round robin|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: I have to admit I'm in the 1N-3N camp.|pg||
nt|garnetts: with AQxxx in a minor it will be 5 tricks a lot of the time and you should bid 3NT in my view because partner will never know that|pg||

nt|garnetts: For once we agree Gad |pg||

nt|mango joe: this should mke unless he plays @S to K|pg||
pc|cK|nt|suketbombi: 6@H is not an odds on contract and will fail here unless declerer plays for a 4/1 @H after discovering 6/2 @DS|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Mahesh can we have the udate on scores?|pg||

nt|mango joe: Hemant or Scotland?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Commonwealth Games Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzat:  Hemant Jalan leads Alpha by 75-0:   Arun Jain leads Magic Eyes( thailand) by 22:   Australia leads Formidables 51-19|pg||
nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: yes  12 x 3 |pg||

nt|mango joe: ok thanks|pg||
nt|ian111:  ah yes - 13/14 removed|pg||
nt|ian111:  looks like 4S -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mrdct:  31 imps in 2 boards looks unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  needs a H guess and C finesse|pg||
nt|ian111:  could try 3NT and hope to avoid a H lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||
nt|paulg:  a slam swing on board 25 has given Hemant Jalan some breathing room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i show two-suiters these days|pg||
nt|mrdct:  pretty much need two double game swings|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: yet to get a push board|pg||
nt|ian111:  not easy to bid the thin but good 5C|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  it would take a horrible defence to let NS make 5@d here - not that they are at all likley to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: arun jain 117- magic eyes 78|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  are the results on the web anywhere?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: see hcl website|pg||
nt|mrdct:  both 5@c and 3NT depend on the @s hook|pg||
mb|5C|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c is much easier than 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Ian|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  hi |pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|paulg:  not an easy lead for East to read, although to beat the contract he has little choice about playing West for an honour|pg||
nt|paulg:  or playing West for 98xx|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mango joe: at least the @H guess was easier|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the HCL website only seems to have hte results up to round 9 of the swiss|pg||
