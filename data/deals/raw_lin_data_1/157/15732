mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Anyone have luck making a first cue-bid with a void in partner's suit?  I haven't.|pg||
nt|iceking: Madala with so weak @C might give up here|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm assuming the auction has been relatively natural so far|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|iceking: Declerar will take one @H ruff in dummy for his 11th trick |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceking: so duck this then 2 round of @C and ruff @H|pg||
nt|othered1: One imp to Lavazza, not a bad price to play for this adventure.  But west doesn't have an easy hand to bid.|pg||
nt|iceking: Versace knows pd has KQ of @H so is thinking how he can beat this |pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: Declerar will probably try low @D from dummy as a little extra chance for def error|pg||
nt|iceking: Madala isnt thinking about this trick |pg||
nt|iceking: probably wondering how he should time everything if @C would break 4-1 |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|othered1: 7@S isn't hateful here and, in fact, scores on the @S guess, with @H otherwise OK|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|iceking: if 2nt promises 4@S they will end in 7 |pg||

mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|iceking: have a feeling 3@C was min 3@D asking 3@H short @C|pg||

mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: so now east should show trump Q if 2nt promises 4card support|pg||

pc|hT|nt|othered1: ty|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|iceking: so ew with stenbergs 2nt swedish convention|pg||
nt|iceking: and will she guess it?|pg||
nt|othered1: This will be a big swing one way or the other|pg||
nt|iceking: no trump lead so she might suspect 3-0 break|pg||
nt|othered1: If you think opponents always lead trumps against grand, answer would be south has all 3 or none, so no real inference there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, but who has 3?|pg||
nt|iceking: but its a blind guess S might have void or Qxx |pg||
nt|iceking: just a pure guess 50 50 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed it is|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|tomi2: Bocchi has no a natural and a strong 1@C opener :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine grand slam in spades; you just need to cash the 'right' honour first|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: That's a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a clue will be that you won't get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you have to figure out why|pg||
nt|tomi2: either leader has 3 spades with the queen or no spade at all? :)=|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a pure guess as I said|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7NT is perhaps better, sometimes you can make it even if you misguess spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: I think they will get to 7@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|Walddk2: or not|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D asks for the @SQ, and 6@S says she has it but no other king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a grand slam we all want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks 4@H already showed her @HK so she doesn't want to bid 6@H there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: If 5@D asks for trump queen which I think it does, what would 5@S be then?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2: this board can cause a swing that you cant repair in lots of other boards by playing well. and this is just "luck" if oth other table plays 7@S and wins / fails...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Sabine tried to show a 6th spade with no queen by jumping to 6@S?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: well most play that 5@S would deny the queen and anything else shows it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|iceking: very unlucky though go down here |pg||
nt|iceking: 4@D maybe from S |pg||

nt|kareno: Ed :)|pg||
nt|iceking: what should east do here 4@S or 4nt and is 4nt natural?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: I think 4N is natural and a good hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not clear they probably not talked about it:)|pg||
nt|othered1: In a vacuum, why let the opponents take you out of a possible natural bid?|pg||

nt|kareno: There are two flaws in the west hand for a weak 2- void and 4 hearts.  That hand can be a useful dummy in three suits.|pg||
nt|iceking: agree was a normal 4@D opening|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak|nt|othered1: concur|pg||

nt|VugraphztF: he wanted 4@d too|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: none vul vs vul 8 card suit 1 seat you just have to preempt|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, likely north's 3@C response showed some values, so south wasn't too pushy with 3N bid.|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|iceking: i dont get this if 2nt is leb Versace has some maximum for that|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|othered1: Here Versace more pessimistic about the worth of his hand than Ferraro was in CR|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|mc|11|nt|kareno: I would treat the north hand as a 'happy' 3@c rather than using Lebensohl.|pg||
nt|VugraphztF: there was a misunderstood in bidding|pg||
nt|VugraphztF: and also in play (she thought she was playing no trump)|pg||
nt|iceking: ugly result 25hcp should have been easy to reach 3nt |pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: we are, but they started 10 mins after us|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: i assume 3@C showed values so south should be moving here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone prefer 2NT rather than double?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 2nt gets your hand across so you aren't going to miss a game if it's there, but double might be a bit safer i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: They are still on board 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the slam decisions on 2 and 3 must wait a little|pg||
nt|tomi2: doubleton queen of clubs onside, this deal will not be misguessed :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: i guess you take the club finesse and then if east turns up with @CQxxx so you can't run them, you just need to bring in 2 spade tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: so you finesse against the nine|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 10 teams taking part, they play a complete round-robin of 16-board matches. No finals|pg||

nt|athene: i guess the same applies for 2@C over 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it's sensible to be able to bid clubs naturally over a short club, i think  - you just use 2@D as michaels or whatever|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|tomi2: non forcing free bids would have allowed south to bid 2@H here and let her partner decide to bid on 3 level|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose there has to be a good hand for negative free bids every so often |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: if you wanted to get cute here you would play transfers (2@D = hearts, 2@H = spades, 2@S = diamonds)|pg||

nt|iceking: 4@H|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|othered1: if 2@D guarantees @H fit, then following with NT would be pretty discriptive|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@d just forcing strong hand says nothing about @H|pg||

nt|othered1: Would anyone have considered 2N over 1@H?   Only a minor underbid, if at all.|pg||
nt|kareno: No, I prefer the cuebid because of the excellent heart support.|pg||
nt|iceking: option might be silly if pd passes that and you make 4@H and go down in 2nt |pg||
nt|kareno: And frankly this hand looks more like suits than nt to me.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|athene: or might she consider passing?|pg||

nt|athene: on the principle that even if it makes it's not a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 380 will still hurt|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||

nt|othered1: if 14-16, wouldn't you go with south's hand?|pg||
nt|iceking: well yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They played 15-17, and I still don't think the South hand is a minimum|pg||
nt|iceking: so probably N just underbid in closed room|pg||
nt|kareno: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think South did|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|iceking: north should never invite though|pg||

pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: There must be a difference between 4333 and 5332 and a decent diamond suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|iceking: look at the bidding here Alfredo knew pd had min no major and bid 3nt in 1.3 sec anyway|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely.  Would not occur to me to pass as south with a 14-16 range|pg||
nt|iceking: so in whos to blame in closed room i would give North alot of the blame |pg||
nt|VugraphztF: yes but after the lead Alfredo said "ok 1 down"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If you know Ferraro, you will also know that he is not too happy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jolly good fellow, with a temper|pg||
nt|athene: south has enough trump control that she can get an entry to north's hand with @SA or @SQ10|pg||
nt|athene: but let's say she wins the first trump - which spade should she lead?|pg||
nt|athene: if she leads low, and it goes to the queen and ace, does she underlead the second time, playing north for the ten?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: she should not lead a singleton if she does not want to score ruffs|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is that a minimum 1NT?|pg||

mb|p|nt|emre kaya: kuzeyin 2@H konturu take out |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The diamond suit makes up for the missing point(s)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: no, all bids of 2nt say "come on partner, bid 3nt"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: I think you must raise when vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if south's @D9 were the @D10 she would have gone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And right enough, 3NT is on|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2: playing 3/5th leads against nt i always lead from a doubleton because I dislike spending my good 3rd spade from 4|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: The Rule of 12 tells Sabine that declarer only has one card higher than the 7|pg||

mc|8|nt|Walddk2: In Sweden they just write  10-12  alongside  leads|pg||
