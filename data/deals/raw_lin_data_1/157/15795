mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|invit+, 4!h, not 4!s|nt|tomi2: they used to play natural against me then but they can have worked on a system, one spec believes they play some kind of strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Aakirkeby is from the smalest distrikt. Bornholm - and Ravenkilde from Vejle in Jutland|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|tomi2: Bocchi has no a natural and a strong 1@C opener :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine grand slam in spades; you just need to cash the 'right' honour first|pg||
nt|peachy: If NS sacrifice in a minor, they might be sweetly surprised to make, just takes correct club guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D on the right viuw in @C - and only a @H-ruff can defeat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|invit+ 4!h, not 4!s|nt|Walddk2: That's a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a clue will be that you won't get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you have to figure out why|pg||
nt|tomi2: either leader has 3 spades with the queen or no spade at all? :)=|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a pure guess as I said|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|peachy: of course, sacrifice in these colors is seldom a good idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Is 1@S enough?   21S likely to be forcing |pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: sorry Ravnkilde from north Jutland|pg||
nt|momad: 6ru kan vinde|pg||
nt|garnetts: Certainly 1@S shows  plus values unless playing equal conversion |pg||
nt|garnetts: However this should make |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: 2@S imo shows values of more then an opening hand + length of @S suit.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|momad: Det ligner en 13'er til Rødovre|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7NT is perhaps better, sometimes you can make it even if you misguess spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: a heart lead would have scared East--would he dare play a club to the K|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: would u all bid only 1 time in N? many would bid 4NT over 4@S = 6+@d and 4 card @c |pg||
nt|peachy: I would not jump|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: W have showed 14-16NT, E have showed GF with 55 in major|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: I think they will get to 7@S|pg||
nt|pelu: outside Hobro|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/Resultat791.html for results from round 10|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ... and http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat791.html for standings|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: This is no 2 and 3. Only 5VP between the two teams|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: or not|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D asks for the @SQ, and 6@S says she has it but no other king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a grand slam we all want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she thinks 4@H already showed her @HK so she doesn't want to bid 6@H there|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: Well you need a foricing bid after a takeout double and it is practical to play jumps as one round forces reserving the cue bid to strong support |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|momad: Well bid by Jensen. He is fast and not afraid of anything|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: If 5@D asks for trump queen which I think it does, what would 5@S be then?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: But there may well be other methods but agreement is as ever required |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a claim  coming |pg||
nt|rnmalik: minimum 9 on the table.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: this board can cause a swing that you cant repair in lots of other boards by playing well. and this is just "luck" if oth other table plays 7@S and wins / fails...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Sabine tried to show a 6th spade with no queen by jumping to 6@S?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: well most play that 5@S would deny the queen and anything else shows it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|pelu: 2-3 0r 4@D is not the problem - would u bid over 4@S?? |pg||
nt|peachy: Then again, if I did jump, which is reasonable, partner then knows to ecxpect a marvelous hand when vul against not-vul|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: but next time pd will have @HA and not @CA :(:(|pg||

nt|pelu: pass and 5@D = one-man-show :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Can be difficult to stop Sabine|pg||
nt|peachy: there is no Forcing Pass in this sort of auction when the 4H was not bid constructively.  |pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|nt|rnmalik: EW can make 4@S but may find difficult to bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: @S-lead to defeat 5@H - and that sh be a notmal lead from East - u cant exp a @D-trick here|pg||
nt|garnetts: very friendly cards for declarer here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: In fact, the current trend (according to some articles from experts lately) is to have Forciong Pass "On" only  *When the caddy knows it is forcing*|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Club !A will beat it right away of course|pg||

nt|athene: play for @dQxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: that would just be one hurdle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he would also have to guess @CJ|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like the 2@D bid - why not 3@C - East will normal have a 5 card @C - and after support he will go after 3NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We shall see soon when the hands are played in the other room|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: we are, but they started 10 mins after us|pg||

mb|2N|mb|d|nt|momad: I guess the close room result is likely to be copied|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: another partial.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|athene: i assume 3@C showed values so south should be moving here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone prefer 2NT rather than double?|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: 2nt gets your hand across so you aren't going to miss a game if it's there, but double might be a bit safer i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They are still on board 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the slam decisions on 2 and 3 must wait a little|pg||
nt|tomi2: doubleton queen of clubs onside, this deal will not be misguessed :)|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open Rivera bid 2@D - and let opp play 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: much prefer 2NT to the initial double or the raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|pelu: @SK and duck a @C (in 1Nt) in 3NT u need @Cs 2-2|pg||
nt|momad: I was wrong|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i guess you take the club finesse and then if east turns up with @CQxxx so you can't run them, you just need to bring in 2 spade tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|momad: THis might be a winner|pg||
nt|oleberg: It will take accurate defence to beat it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: so you finesse against the nine|pg||
nt|momad: S shows 4 spades with 2H|pg||
nt|momad: A big position by N|pg||
nt|oleberg: West has to discourage hearts, but cannot spare the 9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: west obviously expects something different to what he has just seen in dummy |pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oleberg: The way to defeat it would have been to switch, wait for west to get in with the @DA, and then lead the @HJ to scoop dummys 10|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oleberg: But that wouldn't work, if west had discouraged with the 9, as declarers 8 would then be high|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: 5@C a better game - if @Cs 4-2 make with @hJ in S (max 3)|pg||
nt|oleberg: But perhaps he should have done it anyway, playing partner for the @H8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|momad: Martin Schaltz says you should play standard attitude (lav = AFVISNING) when there are two or three small in dummy...|pg||
nt|oleberg: Sounds interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|athene: he can't be all that helpful that the defence will let him build a spade trick, but it doesn't hurt to try|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: i assume he actually cashed the last club there|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S!|an|bal|mb|p|nt|athene: Sabine has said in print that she likes bidding 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C as it can be very hard for opps to sort out major-suit fits and stoppers for notrumps|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the same applies for 2@C over 1@C|pg||
nt|oleberg: How about J107|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3N|an|8-11 hcp, 5!d|mb|p|nt|athene: it's sensible to be able to bid clubs naturally over a short club, i think  - you just use 2@D as michaels or whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|oleberg: Jeg mente du|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tomi2: non forcing free bids would have allowed south to bid 2@H here and let her partner decide to bid on 3 level|pg||

pc|s6|nt|athene: if you wanted to get cute here you would play transfers (2@D = hearts, 2@H = spades, 2@S = diamonds)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|athene: on the principle that even if it makes it's not a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 380 will still hurt|pg||
nt|athene: clearly she didn't expect Bocchi to have a singleton diamond for a t/o double (effectively) of hearts|pg||

mb|d|nt|tomi2: but he also made a "take out" double od 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure she fully expects this to make but decides that anything else might well be worse|pg||
nt|pelu: no entry to dummy so decl has to play @Hs from hand - and make 5@c|pg||
