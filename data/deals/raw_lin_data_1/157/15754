nt|copeyj: 3@C is both minors weak|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: You just said "declarer fingered his beard and muttered darkly when the finesse failed...."?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mug: double perhaps to allow Jason to choose the suit?|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|copeyj: wonder if Justin can bid 4@D here as choice or whether he might x|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Interesting that Jason is willing to bid those limited values. He has the shape. OK. |pg||
nt|mug: 4@D has the same effect|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|mug: you have to bid something with Jason's cards, just a question of double of 3@D (majors)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D sounds like 5-5, no?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|mug: he may lay down @SA now|pg||
nt|mug: to ensure the contract, depends on the range of 3@C|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s4|pc|c8|nt|copeyj: on their card just says less than opening|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mug: alright he is confident the king is onside, so he safety plays against 4-0 onside instead|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|copeyj: and now surely it is marked|pg||
mc|10|nt|mug: so @SK had to be right after the two aces appeared|pg||
nt|brolucius: It looks automatic to pick up the +420 but I still think they did well in the bidding.|pg||

nt|athene: NS had a bit of a disagreement over style in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: South thought that 2@D showed something|pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: Justin will bid 3@H now I am sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: but I am wrong|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|copeyj: thought at these colours he might be comfortable bidding 3|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D at Red does not seem worthwhile. You will probably be outbid. On this occasion he was outbid by his partner. |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: He has to guess spades here to hold it to one down|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H at any stage is quite aggressive |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Yes, when playing four-card majors.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|copeyj: Talking of aggressive, the auction in the other room looks very aggressive|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|copeyj: 3NT with a combined 13 opposite 8 and no fit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mug: yes, aggressive in the manner of a man banging his head against a padded cell|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is basically IMPS scoring (as Tom said) and 2@D is a dubious match-point bid, as I see it.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|s4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|athene: many would grab the setting trick, but south is confident his ace isn't going away|pg||
nt|mug: aside from other hazards, much too likely to backdoor opponents into their 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite so, when you have six diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I must note 'backdoor' down as a useful word to use in the future.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't really have a singleton spade as then north would have bid 2@S with his @SQxx|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1D|an|!S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D is spades i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: the twins play cro defence to big @C|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
mb|1N|an|18-20 balanced usually|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|copeyj: and 1@D is @S in that|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: as Bill says|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mug: so double = hearts, 1@H = two of the same colour, 1@S = two of the same rank, 1NT = two odd suits?|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes i think so|pg||
nt|athene: if NS play strong club and 151-17 notrump then 1@C-1NT is 18-20, hence the try from north|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: quite handy for bumping it up a bit when the colours are right|pg||
nt|copeyj: the few times I have played with Jason we have played it and I have sat there hoping it wouldnt come up :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S overcall rather than 1@D might have caused more trouble, but perhaps he felt he was too good, or too vulnerable, or something|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: West now knows that South has the @D10, so it is risky to play that suit again from his side.|pg||
nt|mug: good shot|pg||
nt|mug: Justin is worried his brother has the singleton ace|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|athene: before declarer can draw trumps and throw dummy's diamond loser on his spade?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|lestergold: perhaps we may be enlightened as to who that partner is not to mention the identities of e/w|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nah. Preparing for Newspaper reporting where the players are always West, East and South|pg||
nt|henryb:  Sandqvist cut in on the regular table|pg||
nt|paulg:  Charlsen was a member of the Norwegian Open team in the Europeans in July|pg||
nt|paulg:  He and his regular partner, Hoftaniska, now play on the De Botton team for some events|pg||
nt|vugraphzty: Surry putting in names and flags, missed play now|pg||
nt|henryb:  sure declarer is making or going down|pg||

mb|1C|nt|brolucius: It played poorly because the honours were not in the long suit (hearts).|pg||
nt|mug: and Jason's @S3 looked low|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|an|T'fer|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting 1@S - is that systemic for them?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: i would have thought it was just a choice between 1@D and 1NT|pg||
nt|mug: I suppose 2@H was a transfer advance, showing a good spade raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|mug: I don't like 1@S at all, with such a good hand|pg||
nt|mug: 2NT by Justin bringing diamonds into the game|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had quite a good hand (except that he held only four spades, which is important).|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT unusual|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you can't bid 3@D because partner will find it hard to go back to 3@C over that|pg||
nt|copeyj: shows longer @C than @D - so most frequently will be this shape|pg||
nt|mug: double of 3@C is quite ballsy by Paul Denning|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: I must note down that word too.|pg||
nt|mug: looks like the Welsh are treating it as a matchpoint event!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|athene: Double is very aggressive with four spades|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: the bigger a fit you have, the less you want to defend at a low level|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though he is playing north for only four spades|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|mug: this will be down two or three, declarer has nowhere to park his losing diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mug: two hearts, ace of trumps, and another diamond or overruff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT did not seem unreasonable at the time, but it will prove expensive.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: I wonder if NS knew what they were doing in the auction or if they just got lucky - normally you don't make a minimum rebid with a 15 count when partner shows a good raise|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I suspect this will keep N-S out of the respectable 4@s contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s coming i fear|pg||
nt|lestergold: if south invites north will accept|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sandqvist not holding back with the 2@s bid ... some might prefer double, but I guess South did not have to bid over the double|pg||
nt|lestergold: south didnt waste his breath inviting Sandqvist always goes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: mo double no trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: on agood day it rolls in but this sint one of those|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well to make it he has to avoidf the loss of 2 truimp tricks i cantc see the endplay|pg||
nt|lestergold: to be fair it is somewhat unlucky and will probably be a push|pg||
nt|henryb:  the negative double might have presented a road map, but he failed to read the map|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention the disposal of @d losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  the negative double provided the map to avoid bidding game|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||

nt|athene: With BAM scoring as well, you aren't quite so carefree about 4@H-2 compared with 3@H-1 in the other room, say.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|mc|7|nt|athene: I trust the names were concealed, David, to protect the guilty parties.|pg||
nt|mug: it doesn't pay to bid three more than you can make at any form of scoring|pg||
