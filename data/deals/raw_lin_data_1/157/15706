nt|viren169: Oh dear... Flat board - I lost again!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||

nt|psridhar: 2h+2d+2c=6 for defense then|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: OK then, declarer must duck if N switches|pg||
nt|Walddk2: let the jack or king hold. Is that good enough?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks PS|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: 2@S to play opposite a weak 2 in spades I presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Which East knows partner does not have|pg||
nt|miketedd: 2@S must be different from the usual wish to play there if that's partner's suit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Miracle layout this|pg||
nt|miketedd: With everything right, 4@H and 4@S are both easy|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|d|nt|miketedd: Now East has a brainstorm?|pg||
nt|miketedd: 'My lead' says South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are not on the same page in the system notes, that's for sure|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: This is truly amazing. 5@S may make but will they stop there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is not convinced|pg||
nt|miketedd: 5@S is off three Aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh sorry|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Bellamy striking for Wales|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|miketedd: It would have been cruel to Wales if they had played 4@H.  It needs the @SKx onside, @DA onside, and @Hs 2-2|pg||
nt|miketedd: Probably not the @Hs 2-2.  But 4@S needs that|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: director called by Goodman,  probably to protect rights about  explanation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7-0 most likely with 1 board to come|pg||
nt|miketedd: It certainly won't be flat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will be happy enough after this goes down|pg||
nt|miketedd: East must have forgotten that they were playing Multi.  Why else would he try for slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Several specs suggesting that West has shown and Acol 2 in clubs when he bid 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: lead out of turn my goodman|pg||

nt|miketedd: The defence failed to take their Aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, maybe it was a triumph after all|pg||
nt|vugraphzau:  procedural penalty  for E-W|pg||

nt|garnetts: This is an interesting auction--North could not find a bid over 2@H --but in my view should have over 3@H |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||

pc|h8|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

pc|s2|nt|vugraphzat: waiting for sandeep to play|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: after 3@H North might try 3NT  for the minors or in view the double implies minors as he might have acted before with spades |pg||

nt|vugraphzau: goodman looked visibly upset  for leading out of turn|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 5@D makes if the defence don't cash their hearts in time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|miketedd: Each defender thought East couldn't have 3 @Ds.  Perhaps the misinformation contributed to that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Then declarer will take the spade finesse and get rid of a heart loser|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 3NT, however, is always there|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|miketedd: 3@Hs, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2NT is much better than 3@D|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: can always reserve the support for later if there is a later |pg||
