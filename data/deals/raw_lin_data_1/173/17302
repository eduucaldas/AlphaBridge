nt|Walddk7: Hello Sveta and David|pg||
nt|ady: slam to start     6NT by North as good as any|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Marius, greetings to the spectators|pg||
nt|ady: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Roland and David|pg||
nt|vugraphzbk: second half starting now:)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: 2@D  strong 2   usually either balanced  above 2NT opening  or 8+ tricks in any suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N should be happy to know partner has invitational values|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT confirmed balanced type  around 23-24|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can understand S's problem - if partner has @h fit, 7 may be possible, if not - just a small slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: words cannot express how I feel about that 2@H bid|pg||
nt|daman: this is like playing at the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: they get about 1.25 imp per board so there is a difference in playing strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|chick: EW sure have the balance of points, but 4@S may still be hard to set|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: it might be described as frisky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: in sweden we have a national handicap|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: and we add this for all four players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: around 33  34 between them  but KQX hearts minimum to consider grand slam    |pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: but you need to have standards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: then we take the difference between the two teams and we get a handicap|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. why not?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: SOunds interesting - probaby more accurate than accumulated master points|pg||
nt|ady: if south can establish hearts as trumps fit  then rkc can establish quality of norths hearts   and find the queen is missing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now N should know - @h Q is missing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|ady: 6NT  better than 6 hearts|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: good auction to get to 5@C in the CR|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: this lead would have meant 12 tricks on top in 6NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|ady: best to cash K@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and for GIB - grand is better :) - bridge software always pick such a @h suit right for 5 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  hello Paul|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: the handicap is base on all pairs tournament a player plays. Not optimal but the onlye way wwe got ;)|pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: if 10 or queen dont appear cross to south and play low heart|pg||
pg||

nt|brobles: This is actually Joaquin Pacareu's first deal of hands of the tournament, right in the final :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: 600 is a huge result|pg||
nt|brobles: The team Caracci won the Round Robin, and had a confortable win in the semifinals over a women team that has played for the Chilean Women team a couple of times|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brobles: Time to start comparing results finally|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: may also get to game here   |pg||
nt|kmb24: another 22 point game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brobles: The Team Rubio has also played the event mostly 4 handed and had a very tough semifinal match against the RIOS team|pg||
nt|tez: undo pls|pg||
nt|kmb24: they're playing the board backwards|pg||
nt|tez: this is no real|pg||
nt|kmb24: paca did in fact open 1@H|pg||
nt|tez: different hand i thk:)|pg||
nt|brobles: I think NS play 2@d as a constructive weak 2 in a M (8-11 points)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: East west playing in 2 hearts, not sure who is who and who has what though :)|pg||
nt|tez: check pls vugraph operator|pg||
nt|kmb24: it's the right hand, the board is just rotated |pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|brobles: Vugraph operator tells me that West has east cards, so they put the board the other way round|pg||
nt|tez: not right hand|pg||
nt|brobles: So Paca is playing 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: north is dealer|pg||
nt|brobles: the auction was not like this, they just put the contract|pg||
nt|tez: he cant pass|pg||
nt|brobles: so Joaquin Pacareu is playing 2@h (as WEST)|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|tez: yes means?|pg||
nt|kmb24: the board is right, the hands are all in the opposite spots|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 1@s pass 1nt 2@h all pass may be|pg||
nt|brobles: so 3@h shows a minimum heart bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: there is in my opinion a big difference between a 3- or 4-card support, so 2@h is enough for me as E on previous board|pg||
nt|chick: or perhaps 3@C showing 3 card support and let pard decide|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cornelia and Friggi|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Everyone :)|pg||
nt|brobles: You can watch this table live through this link: http://www.bridgesantiago.cl/vugcam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT  has a play  on a liekly club lead|pg||
nt|friggi: hello|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzwd: well hello Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hej Staffan @H@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk3: We'll get layer names up soon|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Staffan's pc is a bit slow|pg||
nt|brobles: but that will not stop Juan Pablo :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kmb24: most pairs these days do it the other way, 2d a bad weak 2 and 2M a good one.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: I believe some of the IMPs you see in the score are handicaps|pg||
nt|chick: Not sure how many|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: I´ll check :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Blandat got 29 imps for this evening of 24 boards|pg||
nt|friggi: this will be tight|pg||
nt|barbyh: lots of work|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Hei Espen|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Staffan :)|pg||
nt|espooz: Hi all! :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hei Espen :)|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca has to give his partner a diamond ruff or a diamond trick to hold this to 4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|chick: Trump lead was good, as he has to ruff some hearts|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: try @s10|pg||
nt|ady: at best this is down 1  unless there is great help from defenders|pg||
nt|brobles: will push the board now|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||

pc|c9|nt|ady: if A@D hadbeen right now no entry to play diamond to tje king|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: This is nice play, poor S is helpless to stop the pitches|pg||

nt|daman: my Mother would open the east hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Shouldn't think he will ...|pg||
nt|daman: 2 1/2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even I would open this one|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Another potential slam|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb:  Indeed; too little of that world wide|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think this will be difficult to avoid given South's controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Survived.  Didn't get a 2@d response.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|cuttysark: Wanted a 2@H response to give him a shot|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  just a little too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: bad trump suit will kill this|pg||
nt|chick: hi Ed :)|pg||
nt|chick: although that lead didn't help the defense very much|pg||
nt|henryb:  For what its worth, I would either pass over 1@h (remember when you needed 6 points to respond?) or raise to 2@h|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: I would not pass up the chance to show a 4 card spade suit when I had an A plus something, and backup support for hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  North very unhappy on this lead|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: Or maybe they had to hit clubs sooner?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think she has to hope for 3-2 hearts with the K onside and that she can negotiate a club ruff|pg||
nt|chick: however, I'd stop in 3@H in this auction|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  but slam needs very carefull declarer play|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  bidding 1@s and then 2@h over 1N should show a constructive hand, I think|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if no @d lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: Me, too, but maybe they don't always raise with 3-card support and a dead minimum|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: 10@S coming down was fortunate once spades 4-1|pg||
nt|paulg:  I guess North thought that slam would be no better than a finesse opposite a normal 3@s call|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it might be a lot worse|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  having so much points in minors - definitely|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's controls possibly too good for 3@s, but you cannot bid 3.5@s|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c7|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Hmmmm.  I'll have to remember that play...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He had two trump losers. He lost them. :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  my line on this hand would have been to duck a club, win a @d return in dummy, finesse the @h, lose another club and hope that a diamond ruff was with the long trump|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|nt|chick: Think how much more 1@H 1@S 1N 2@H tells your partner about your distribution than 1@H 2@H does.   Plus I'd rather play in the 4-4 fit when it goes  1@H 1@S 2@S.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: weak or multi|pg||
nt|brobles: Huge result from the Open Room|pg||
nt|kmb24: went something like pass-1@h-1@s-2@c-p-2@H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: most systems have ups and downs|pg||
nt|kmb24: back to normal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kmb24: i might try 1n in third seat on that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: south might balance|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room chose to double 1@d.  i really prefer 1N|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt with singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: ok for me.np:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: prefer 1N with singleton over t/o double with one!|pg||
nt|kmb24: the other room's result is huge.  game on every hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: light opening|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C 2@H should end it|pg||
nt|brobles: I would probably bid 1@h at the table, would be a little scared of 1N red white with a PH partner. 1N looks still reasonable to me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: 2@S from west shows decent hearts|pg||
nt|chick: very light, even by my standards :)|pg||
nt|tez: 20 point game|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kmb24: not sure what's the plan with 2@c|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: balance chancy  as west could be shortin spades   possibly singleton and a good defensive hand|pg||
nt|ady: this looks cedrtainly down 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I see it -1 or -2|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to that:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: found a home|pg||
nt|brobles: I don't know what Smith was planning over 2@d but he should definitly pass now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Very interesting hand to lead from. You sure know one thing - you don´t want to lead :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: unless he had 2@s available to show 4@s and longer minor, nf|pg||
pc|h8|nt|friggi: W signs off with 10 points!?|pg||
nt|chick: He's probably seen his partner's openers :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|friggi: that is the only fair clue to make from this |pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Well, their agreement before was that East may do light openings and bids, while West makes sure he covers up for his partner.. :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kmb24: not much here.  took a heart lead to let this one slip though.|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|12|nt|friggi: but 3NT would have been super here|pg||
pg||
qx|o19|st||md|1SK52HQJ87D53CQJ73,ST87HK52DK7CT6542,SAQJ6H963DT942CK9,S943HAT4DAQJ86CA8|sv|e|nt|ady: this time 20-20|pg||
nt|ady: south may play 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Then you need some pretty rigid rules to avoid playing those nasty Moysean (4-3) fits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'd bid as West|pg||
nt|ady: west may interven showing majors|pg||
nt|henryb:  There, you see, is one of the differences in style. If I responded 1@s I would be likely to end in a 4-3 spade fit instead of a 5-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|chick: what moysean fits?  2@S is always a 4 card suit.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not on my planet|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  Not at my table or Ed's|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 2@C    maybe landy|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|paulg:  think so, given East's 2@s bid|pg||
nt|chick: then we had better not partner, because if my pard raised to 2@S with only 3, I'd be looking for a new partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this looks as though it will play well|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: Spades do not seem to be getting much support from partner on these deals|pg||
nt|daman: this should be an adventure|pg||
nt|othered1: 'ACtually I define suit quality for a 4-card @S response to 1@H "willing to be raised on Hxx,"  in context of the hand. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|chick: then I guess you will play in a lot of Moyseans :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|ady: should be 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: Absolutely, and they're about as good a source of matchpoints and small imp swings as you can find.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|chick: I agree completely, I've won a lot of hands when the opps play in 4-3 fits :)|pg||

nt|kmb24: another great result from robles/caracci coming in making 3N off the first 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|brobles: Goren says that with this quantity of points you can play 3N :)|pg||
nt|brobles: The Open room had a misunderstanding on this hand but stopped safely in 4NT. Smith was denying majors with 3@h but apparently they weren't in the same page|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: Valdes is going to prempt?|pg||
nt|kmb24: here's a nice little trick... open the south hand with multi, and show whichever major partner doesn't like|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: but have to play the bad version of multi for that.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: still got the club away   so  down 2 last hand|pg||
nt|friggi: plain 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kmb24: dbl!|pg||
nt|brobles: so 2@s is 0-7hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kmb24: anyone like double on paca's cards?|pg||
nt|kmb24: 3n looks normal to me|pg||
nt|brobles: 4@d is pretty conservative in my opinion|pg||
nt|kmb24: i agree|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca not liking his trick source in 3N with only 1 stopper, but it has to be a winning bid more often.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kmb24: well, given that your partner would take a trick in spades this hand in 3n, maybe it's a better stopper than it seems|pg||
nt|brobles: 5@d turns out to be an excellent spot, because he prefered to evaluate his hand as suit playing cards|pg||
nt|brobles: now rafa should definitly blast into slam|pg||
nt|brobles: and take an overtrick :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|chick: Sure a lot of bidding with this piece of junk|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brobles: apparently he bid only 5@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|brobles: let's see if EW can cash their first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|kmb24: they squealed|pg||
nt|brobles: Nice try by Joaquin but Rafa decided he was missing too many key cards to get involved|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @hK is a bad honour, so pass on 3@s|pg||
nt|brobles: NS playing 4 card diamonds so I think that a club lead is reasonable. Well done|pg||
nt|kmb24: should lead a club now no problem and the first 5 not hard looking at that dummy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|friggi: good god|pg||
nt|friggi: jacobson has the same illness as Claassen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: overboard again    unfortuantely  diamond honors wasted |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|brobles: East certainly did the only auction to get to 6@d|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I think I liked the 1@H opener on the previous deal better than this 12 count|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you can call this a 12 count with qj-.|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 with west|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, especially if you have a meaningful lead in the match.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it was a lock. Given the 1@s bid, West would never have pitched two spades from an origina holding of QJ10x|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This is more like it|pg||
nt|paulg:  looks dangerous hand for West|pg||
nt|ady: would not play well|pg||

mb|1C|nt|cuttysark: I presume 1NT is wide-ranging|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|santyclz: 6@c (or @ss in matchpoints).|pg||
nt|ady: double from south?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: It makes the auction game-forcing, and hopefully West will not worry about too much wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, W is aware now|pg||
nt|paulg:  on hands like this it is better to play multi 2@d as North may overcall 2@h :)|pg||

nt|friggi: the question remain will it be play in N in the other room?|pg||
nt|brobles: Well done Rafa and Paca|pg||
nt|brobles: this was THE hand where double could get you to 12 imps :)|pg||
nt|brobles: good result for NS in the Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: they will argue in the comparrison about who gets credit for that one, robles-caracci or paca-rafa|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: do you bid 1@s with rubio hand|pg||
nt|brobles: Smith chose not to double 4@s with his singleton @d and West went for the sacrifice|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzwd: West actually put on his glasses after East´s 2@C :)|pg||
nt|chick: hahahahahahhaaaa|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: What about @C opening here then reverse @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: Never for me|pg||
nt|chick: There are still about 75 people in the world who open that hand 1@C, but I'm not one of them :)|pg||

nt|friggi: I kind of like it more and more:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: strictly speaking not a minimum but close to it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: another strange bid by Juan Pablo Valdes. Maybe he was expecting EW to bid up|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tez: i would bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: so maybe 76 in few weeks|pg||

nt|kmb24: too tough to avoid 3n, but they got there from the wrong side it seems|pg||
nt|tez: ne count here|pg||
nt|tez: need|pg||
nt|brobles: maybe declarer tries to sneak a diamond and then play for 7 tricks in the majors|pg||
nt|brobles: it's his best shot really|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room bid a direct 3n over 1S|pg||
nt|brobles: win the club in hand and try a suspicious @dJ :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: seems like a good plan to me|pg||
nt|tez: if duck 8 trick again|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||

nt|brobles: so the first 13 imps to the Rubio team|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: the e/w made 8 tricks defending in CR in spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h ruff before playing @dA and an overtrick...|pg||
nt|kmb24: was hoping to creat some action by passing i'm sure.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kmb24: i think you have to run the T@s to leave the Q as a reentry|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|chick: in that case, West is the one who knew there was slam, so he should NOT splinter ... his partner doesn't need to know about the @D shortness|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2N|nt|paulg:  Did South really pass?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C a make for e/w|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: the 4-0 fit cost 11 imps when they reached 5@C in the other room - did well to make that, I think|pg||
nt|henryb:  5 of either minor makes|pg||
nt|othered1: Good test on gettng to 5@D here|pg||
mb|p!|nt|paulg:  i know it is light but it is classic distribution |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: some like full opening for a take-out double  in case partner has a penalty pass |pg||
nt|ady: 2@C inverted minor raaise|pg||
nt|paulg:  who does a penalty pass of 1@c? :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough problem for West now, perhaps 3@s?|pg||
nt|othered1: But maybe not a tough test|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C doesn't make north's hand look any better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  as we can see, 3@d does not promise considerable extra values|pg||

pc|h4|nt|paulg:  so I'd bid 6@c to show 1-3 and void diamond|pg||
nt|ady: switch to trump or J@D|pg||
nt|othered1: Put this hand into a matchpoints setting and you'll see lots of NS minuses in 3N|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  declarer has several options, actually - short @d K, for instance, before rely on @s finess|pg||

nt|kmb24: I think plaut bids 3nt every time it's his turn|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ady: 4@C can be beaten last hand   so if south had been more active they may have saved some imps|pg||
nt|friggi: they dont :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: not playng forcing nt also|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: no the opening can be very light|pg||

pc|dK|nt|brobles: Rubio will consider a slam try in this hand but my guess is that they will stop in 4. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|kmb24: i think so.. though slam only on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes was planning to bid 1 or 2 spades after the double but I bet he was very prepared for this auction|pg||

nt|ady: 3Nt  a make for e/w|pg||

mb|2D|nt|daman: a @D lead would have caused a problem|pg||
