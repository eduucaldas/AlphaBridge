nt|chilloncan: green on red, i think double should show hearts. you would only be chasing a green game, and meanwhile you don;t want tghem to make a red one|pg||
nt|othered1: makes sense to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|4+!s|nt|othered1: This won't be quiet|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@H = @S|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess par is 6@CX|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3D|nt|kiwibridge: only 2N might have tried 4|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Presumably 3@D is some kind of "unusual/unusual," showing major support|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|othered1: Nice decision by east, who may fear they don't have 5X beaten|pg||

nt|chilloncan: the critical question here is whether EW were in a forcing pass situation. i would not expect unanimity on an expert panel|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|othered1: Depends on a few th ings, including how high 3@D wqas forcing and whether 4@S guaranteed it to be EW's hand.  With limited openings, however, you can argue pass wasn't forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: facing a passed hand, S might have overcalled 4N there instead of 2N. just to serve notice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: 15-17 nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: this shouldn't generate more than in imp one way or the other|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me it would not have been forcing. to create forcing pass i would cuebid at 4 level|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: The lack of a double of 2@C doesn't by itself contraindicate the @C lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with  you -- a bunch of bids below 4@S are available |pg||
nt|chilloncan: if W doesnt lead a club he has to guess a major, so non-club lead odds are already split in ha;f|pg||

mb|p|nt|davestern2: The 16 imps is the carry forward prescribed by tthe finishing order in the Round Robin. As pointed out this is somewhat inequitable as Klinger beat Brown twice in the RR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Hi Daniel and specs:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A interesting hand NS but a spot to become I belive|pg||

nt|ianmcc: odd|pg||

nt|davestern2: shouldnt|pg||
mb|2N!|an|min no major|nt|vugrapha1: Welcome all|pg||
nt|davestern2: Not that they are likely to get there 4@S would make on a good day - such as today|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rodal f: First swing to might come?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Rodal, hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: just been informed that the running score incorner is incorrect|pg||
nt|davestern2: A heart lead would be bad|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but 17 would be even...worse|pg||
nt|davestern2: No major will be a disappointment to North of course|pg||
nt|davestern2: :)|pg||
nt|davestern2: This hand is a good cup of coffee hand \_/?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: E limited and after W the same. Any for hold it open by a bid from N?|pg||

pc|c4|pc|s5|nt|kiwi_joker: E hand was really worth a raise to 2 and a half hearts ..sensibly decided on '3'|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|davestern2: Not often partner overcalls a diamond and you hold KQ109x|pg||
nt|davestern2: the @C9 at trick one made the hand a lot less scary for declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|s6|pc|c3|pg||

nt|davestern2: Ian dont you hat it when they play back your five card suit in NT to establish tricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: indeed|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|rodal f: 1304 retur|pg||
nt|davestern2: Spade now will save an overtrick|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|othered1: Upside down signals can get in the way of unblocking and taking 1/2 an hour to play 9 isn't appropriate|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H was a "sac" over 3@S CR again they are so polite as to not double|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|chilloncan: yes unfortunately it is hard to unblock upside down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|othered1: I think the best rule is to  make that play that has best chance to beat the hand and let partner simply work out you had no alternative|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|othered1: cards are friendly here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in any signaling method whatsoever there will sometimes be conflicts between technique and code. it is not possible to be a strong defender if you take all "signals" at face value. ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there is no substitute for thinking|pg||
pc|sK|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||

nt|davestern2: Good morning to our CR operatot Catherine Ritter|pg||
mb|1C|nt|davestern2: 3NT looked good till you see no entry for diamond finesse|pg||

nt|ianmcc: I like udc but hate burning 9s|pg||
mb|d|nt|chilloncan: hi bill:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|davestern2: This final represents the two pre-post favourites for the finals|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|chilloncan: many would open that N hand in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|4H|nt|davestern2: Mr Richman sitting behind me is not enamored of the 4@C bid|pg||
nt|davestern2: Prefers a diamond raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: X=3@S|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Nice 4@S for EW here, even with two cards (K@S and A@D) offside|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: comment about running score was on advice from fellow operator... so not sure what's going on..|pg||
nt|davestern2: West will raise|pg||
nt|davestern2: We suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Two colored by S and a nice end EW |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: +2 next|pg||
nt|davestern2: Double by Christie described his hand rather well|pg||
nt|ianmcc:  I think 4@s was luckily on so 4@h a steal|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Sold at the mol|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: picked up the pass card momentarily :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: more likely than south raising anyway...|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|davestern2: Oops|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: and*|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On hands like this, it often pays to declare rather than defend.  Defending is so much harder|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: But first trick can't be right if 4@S ans S to lead.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Normal lead at 4@S is @H and if S turn @D? 10.     Can be a IMP in EW here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|davestern2: That undo caught me unaware|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chilloncan: green on white in 3rd seat, N has a hand most would regard as suitable for a 1S opener. one hand proves nothing and resulting as a general habit is pernicious to devloping ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: judgment, but empirical results are not meaningless...and here 1S by N  might very well find E as declarer in 2N or maybe even 3N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: And there you see it.  West probably needed to switch to a spade through|pg||

nt|rodal f: From the opening 1@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that it's easy to reach.  West's minor suit 10s are gold|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E is practially ready to go slamming over 2C...wondering if he shouldnt just bid 3S over 2C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: It was a ask by biddig tempo.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D from me. WHY?|pg||
mb|p|nt|davestern2: Need to rise with @DA when played to avoid a heart being pitched on the @SA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: @Cto 10 @H to J or K and @C to K for next hook in @H?|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|noodle:  if 3@C showed extras that d be my choice with W hand  5431 pattern|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in my view, E has too much to tell to start with 4th suit forcing. 3S splinter would describe almost he whole hand at once o ver 2C|pg||

nt|bjacobs: In fact, the whole auction is excellent, in my view|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Brightling, on hearing 4@S, realised that his interior spots in the minors make for a good slam|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Nice fit in @S for NS + @DK at E|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't any fun to make here?:)|pg||
nt|noodle:  6@H on a hook NS|pg||
nt|noodle:  with 18 5-5 and finding a fit momentum will be high for S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But perhaps a better hope was simply that the short clubs were with the 3-card spades|pg||
nt|davestern2: If opps get to five minor NS will have their work cut out needing to pick up @HQ9|pg||
nt|davestern2: to make 5 Spades|pg||
mb|2N|an|4S GF enq|nt|davestern2: Hmmm how often do you have 100 hounrs to six and partner opens that suit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ianmcc: never - it's in the notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: if 4@H from E, South will be twitchy  :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not too hard to pick up the hearts|pg||

nt|davestern2: Yes Bill as I;ve discovered nothing is very hard as a BBO Commentator|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bjacobs: Well, this one is easy for everyone.  East has the short hearts, so finesse through him.  What could be simpler?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: 4@C spilinter=max one|pg||
nt|noodle:  S learnes he's off 2 key cards  :P|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The right contract here is 3NT, but it's unlikely to be reached.  No harm will be done in 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West has the short hearts ...|pg||
nt|davestern2: Agree and it is likely.........|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I doubt Smolanko will let them play it|pg||
mb|6D|nt|rodal f: So S mean that N at vul 3@C don't have cards? X 100 by 100 times from me.|pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hi there Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the ACBL "printed defence" is a joke - it makes the Multi look like a major weapon that requires pages of defence, when in reality the Multi 2@d is a popgun that requires 2 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3 lines of defence. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: board 22 was fowled getting replayed now|pg||
nt|andyv:  we've gone thru this board a couple of times|pg||
nt|po-s: WBF says everything conveying a message should be alerte "unless it can be reasonably expected to be understood by the opponent" Hmm|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah, that's about it|pg||
nt|davestern2: Thats the real value|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I think you need to keep going with 7@D|pg||
nt|davestern2: 4@S a bit unlucky here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so would be 4@d|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rodal f: Fun to come? |pg||
nt|rodal f: U are for shure correct by the result Daniel, but looked like a -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: there is another thing too....when opps are in mere game and they would have made slam on any lead but club, you for sure dont want to lead a club. and a trump lead is the one that ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: will make them most wistfuyl of all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3D|mb|d|nt|rodal f: How to bid this by best control?|pg||
nt|rodal f: That intervention made it hard for E but easy for W|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nice logic... psyching the opps out....|pg||
nt|davestern2: Send more chips to table 2 please|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@S  is pretty interesting to play ... |pg||
nt|davestern2: Vwery but should fail on a heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Should it?  Might not a safety play be a good idea in spades?  Cash the ace?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it's much harder on a diamond lead though|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: South shouldnt be condemned too harshly .. he didnt know about the "diamond surprise" awaiting him; and the fact pd held K@S|pg||
nt|petergill: More likely, the bidding really might be Pass Pass 1NT P 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, North will lead a heart and 3NT should make comfortably|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last match of the qualifying rounds. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If if it is played by E (mosty unlikely), declarer can counter a club lead by ducking twice..and the major suit kings are ideally placed for him|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: cards are wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: Four teams qualify for tomorrow's semi-finals, then the Grand Final is on Sunday|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a bit work to do also for EW|pg||

nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/2011/spo/cards/Anderson-Smolanko.pdf|pg||

mb|5S|nt|rodal f: I belive Anderson will go for it now. The slam in @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: My point being that Multi 2@d is feared in America due to the length (and existence) of the written defence they provide, which does more harm than good, given that the main aim of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: good bridge is to avoid distraction and focus on being "at the table".|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the more psychological hangnails you can get the, picking, the more chance for distraction:)|pg||
nt|davestern2: Well that discussion was all a waste of time|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I agree...if they simply let multi to be played all the time, players would eventually learn how to deal with it...all conventions take some time for the public to accept|pg||
nt|petergill: PO is right in theory, but in practice virtually nobody (except me, who gets laughed at when he does so) ever alerts the Pass that shows 6 spades. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bailey's lead over Neill for 4th spot is down to 7 VPs now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Hoffman can gain 5 imps on board 22, they will win this set|pg||
nt|po-s: I certainly do, particularly against unknown opponents who may never have heard of Mult...|pg||
nt|davestern2: Bill have you spotted a super safety play for this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5? what was X?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The $64 question, that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Clearly, E/W have had an agreement malfunction|pg||
nt|ianmcc: support?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: I'm told Anderson explained X as "takeout"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Sr. Christie came as a frech wind.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B2 NS fighted to there max 3@S and got a doubble score 6IMP.|pg||
nt|petergill: Neill has 3 boards to gain 7 VPs, with Bailey having one board to go before they (?) qualify. |pg||
nt|petergill: It will be a major surprise if Neill fails to qualify. Neill and Gumby were both in the 2007 Aussie Open Team that came 5th in the world, and Lavings - Krochmailk have had ...|pg||
nt|petergill: excellent results in recent years, so Neill has good players in their team. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Thanks all, thats it for today|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Semi finals tomorrow, in 17 hours time roughly|pg||
nt|super nova: Neill is 20-10 up against Klinger.|pg||
nt|super nova: If he gets a 25 he will miss out by 1 vp.|pg||
nt|petergill: As Jamie just pointed out, Bailey has finished play and has taken 4th place. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone - Brown will surely choose to play Bailey (with 16 imp carry-forward)  with Hoffman facing a tough task against Klinger in tomorrow's semis. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Thanks Peter|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: We're closing now ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Amy for a good job, and thanks to convener David Stern and the ABF|pg||

nt|chilloncan: Klinger torn no doubt. between the spadish orientation of the hand, and the 9cc of hearts which argue for NT. some could use 3H as a choice-ofgames cuebid here (Ed Manfield, Bridge ...|pg||

nt|chilloncan: coffe+ thyme? not my cup of tea...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: several downsides of 2H, not least that if they play the hand declarer can more easily peg you with  a modicum of values and figure out exactly what theyt are|pg||
nt|othered1: depends on your range for an overcall.  My partner can have another A and another @H for the overcall, or even more.|pg||

pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Enterence good enough to make it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, also it ist really clear from hat S hand that NS belong in game facing only an invitation. but one thing is sure -- exactly 8 tricks at NT is not a sensible target. |pg||

nt|bjacobs: well, it IS the seniors|pg||

nt|rodal f: Match? or team?|pg||
nt|nlu: you need @h to split @s to be KJ empty ON, very low probability|pg||
nt|nlu: now he is thinking wich finesse to take - last time on the board|pg||
nt|rodal f: N overbidded a bit liked it, but S had (then) a clear 4@S. If it go down it's Ns foult by bidding to hard. Finito for me:)|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Pass by South = spades - with hearts, South would bid over 3@C|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|kiwi_joker: If clubs broke 2-1, 3NT would be o-so-easy ... but not this time|pg||
nt|petergill: Dutch expert Jan Jansma says that it's better for North to respond 2@H (not 2@S) on a hand like this, so that if East bids 3@C, EW do not find out what NS's major is. Jansma likes ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D P 2@s to be natural and nonforcing with long spades. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm! has the multi done its evil work again here?|pg||

nt|petergill: of bridge, and almost nobody wants it to be alerted. |pg||
nt|andyv:  can't see the harm in that, Peter.  ACBL, when they do allow multi, require printed defenses to it to be given to the opps as well as alerting of all sequences, even when obvious.|pg||
