nt|Walddk7: Hello Sveta and David|pg||
nt|ady: slam to start     6NT by North as good as any|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Marius, greetings to the spectators|pg||
nt|ady: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Roland and David|pg||
nt|vugraphzbk: second half starting now:)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@D  strong 2   usually either balanced  above 2NT opening  or 8+ tricks in any suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N should be happy to know partner has invitational values|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT confirmed balanced type  around 23-24|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can understand S's problem - if partner has @h fit, 7 may be possible, if not - just a small slam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|daman: words cannot express how I feel about that 2@H bid|pg||
nt|daman: this is like playing at the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: they get about 1.25 imp per board so there is a difference in playing strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|chick: EW sure have the balance of points, but 4@S may still be hard to set|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: it might be described as frisky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: in sweden we have a national handicap|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: and we add this for all four players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: around 33  34 between them  but KQX hearts minimum to consider grand slam    |pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: but you need to have standards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: then we take the difference between the two teams and we get a handicap|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. why not?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: SOunds interesting - probaby more accurate than accumulated master points|pg||
nt|ady: if south can establish hearts as trumps fit  then rkc can establish quality of norths hearts   and find the queen is missing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now N should know - @h Q is missing|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|ady: 6NT  better than 6 hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|daman: good auction to get to 5@C in the CR|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: this lead would have meant 12 tricks on top in 6NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|ady: best to cash K@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and for GIB - grand is better :) - bridge software always pick such a @h suit right for 5 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  hello Paul|pg||

nt|daman: my Mother would open the east hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Shouldn't think he will ...|pg||
nt|daman: 2 1/2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even I would open this one|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Another potential slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Indeed; too little of that world wide|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|paulg:  i think this will be difficult to avoid given South's controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|santyclz: Survived.  Didn't get a 2@d response.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Wanted a 2@H response to give him a shot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  just a little too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: bad trump suit will kill this|pg||
nt|chick: hi Ed :)|pg||
nt|chick: although that lead didn't help the defense very much|pg||
nt|henryb:  For what its worth, I would either pass over 1@h (remember when you needed 6 points to respond?) or raise to 2@h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: I would not pass up the chance to show a 4 card spade suit when I had an A plus something, and backup support for hearts|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  North very unhappy on this lead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: Or maybe they had to hit clubs sooner?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  I think she has to hope for 3-2 hearts with the K onside and that she can negotiate a club ruff|pg||
nt|chick: however, I'd stop in 3@H in this auction|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  but slam needs very carefull declarer play|pg||

nt|ady: south may play 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Then you need some pretty rigid rules to avoid playing those nasty Moysean (4-3) fits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'd bid as West|pg||
nt|ady: west may interven showing majors|pg||
nt|henryb:  There, you see, is one of the differences in style. If I responded 1@s I would be likely to end in a 4-3 spade fit instead of a 5-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|chick: what moysean fits?  2@S is always a 4 card suit.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not on my planet|pg||
mb|2D|an|corto pick|nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table.|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  Not at my table or Ed's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@C    maybe landy|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  think so, given East's 2@s bid|pg||
nt|chick: then we had better not partner, because if my pard raised to 2@S with only 3, I'd be looking for a new partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this looks as though it will play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Spades do not seem to be getting much support from partner on these deals|pg||
nt|daman: this should be an adventure|pg||
nt|othered1: 'ACtually I define suit quality for a 4-card @S response to 1@H "willing to be raised on Hxx,"  in context of the hand. |pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|chick: then I guess you will play in a lot of Moyseans :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: should be 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  declarer can't complain about bad lie of the cards, yes|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SQ9653HAD872CQ974,SK872H3DAQJT4CJ85,ST4HJT9754D63C632,SAJHKQ862DK95CAKT|sv|b|nt|cuttysark: It is a better fit, but you have to overbid a bit to find it and then it is hard to stop!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I liked the 1@H opener on the previous deal better than this 12 count|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you can call this a 12 count with qj-.|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 with west|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, especially if you have a meaningful lead in the match.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it was a lock. Given the 1@s bid, West would never have pitched two spades from an origina holding of QJ10x|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This is more like it|pg||
nt|paulg:  looks dangerous hand for West|pg||
nt|ady: would not play well|pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Not a bad responding hand to a strong @c, 12hcp 3 controls...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I presume 1NT is wide-ranging|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 6@c (or @ss in matchpoints).|pg||
nt|ady: double from south?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: It makes the auction game-forcing, and hopefully West will not worry about too much wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, W is aware now|pg||
nt|paulg:  on hands like this it is better to play multi 2@d as North may overcall 2@h :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|paulg:  the only good news is that there is a chance that this auction will be duplicated|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|sfoxa:  agree, the distribution is awful here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 3nt?  Perhaps 3nt*?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: it was not alerted|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think it was probably serious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  @d 9 asking for @s return|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Thanks, Tommy.|pg||
nt|daman: let's hope they don't get to the grand salami|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: looks horrible   3 tricks |pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe EW would have been able to be more competitive if east had raised clubs.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|daman: asking for the @S Q'|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Response denies the king of hearts so all is well|pg||
nt|daman: 5@H was asking partner if he had the @S Queen    |pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: I'm told 3nt was forcing|pg||
nt|daman: right Joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: 5@H asking for @sQ, Rdb = Ace or void|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Only worry would be a bad spade break, so this lead is a pleasant sight|pg||
nt|henryb:  would you bid 2@s or 2@c over 1N? I think the South hand is too good for 2@s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: I agree with that, I would bid 2@C|pg||
pc|s5|mc|10|nt|ady: spade    then heart from south|pg||
pg||
qx|c4|st||md|2SQ9653HAD872CQ974,SK872H3DAQJT4CJ85,ST4HJT9754D63C632,SAJHKQ862DK95CAKT|sv|b|nt|friggi: take 2 rounds of @C|pg||
nt|friggi: no but the small numbers add up over time:)|pg||
nt|chick: EW shouldn't have too much trouble getting to this fine slam|pg||
nt|friggi: the question remain will it be play in N in the other room?|pg||
nt|brobles: Well done Rafa and Paca|pg||
nt|brobles: this was THE hand where double could get you to 12 imps :)|pg||
nt|brobles: good result for NS in the Open Room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kmb24: they will argue in the comparrison about who gets credit for that one, robles-caracci or paca-rafa|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|tez: do you bid 1@s with rubio hand|pg||
nt|brobles: Smith chose not to double 4@s with his singleton @d and West went for the sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwd: West actually put on his glasses after East´s 2@C :)|pg||
nt|chick: hahahahahahhaaaa|pg||
nt|kmb24: i wouldn't dream of passing :)  you?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|friggi: What about @C opening here then reverse @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Never for me|pg||
nt|chick: There are still about 75 people in the world who open that hand 1@C, but I'm not one of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: I think there are more people Chick, most people that play 1@C 17+... :)|pg||
nt|friggi: I kind of like it more and more:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: strictly speaking not a minimum but close to it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brobles: another strange bid by Juan Pablo Valdes. Maybe he was expecting EW to bid up|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: i would bid:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|friggi: so maybe 76 in few weeks|pg||
nt|brobles: I would bid 2@c if 1@s wasn't available :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: when its this close go for it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|friggi: they open very light when not vul|pg||
nt|brobles: nice lead|pg||
nt|tez: briland:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: too tough to avoid 3n, but they got there from the wrong side it seems|pg||
nt|tez: ne count here|pg||
nt|tez: need|pg||
nt|brobles: maybe declarer tries to sneak a diamond and then play for 7 tricks in the majors|pg||
nt|brobles: it's his best shot really|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room bid a direct 3n over 1S|pg||
nt|brobles: win the club in hand and try a suspicious @dJ :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: seems like a good plan to me|pg||
nt|tez: if duck 8 trick again|pg||
nt|brobles: I really don't see another plan, but I'm guessing that Rubio will pop Ace knowing the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|espooz: They dont play 2/1 ?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|brobles: @c7 really helps|pg||
nt|kmb24: 7 was a good card|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|friggi: friendly @S brake it the key here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: well there goes the contract|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: isn´t this maheable?|pg||
nt|kmb24: oops|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: multi in closed room   2@D  from west  2@S   east    showing good hearts   but not good spades    south tht spades good enough to bid at the 3 level   bit missed that could be ...|pg||
nt|ady: wests suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: makeable...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: @c 7 was very good|pg||
nt|kmb24: looked very likely that 4 spades were possible, and given the clubs i think @h finesse was a better shot|pg||
nt|brobles: Yep|pg||
pc|s4|nt|friggi: but not enough|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|brobles: Rubio team picked up 11 imps on board 25 after a terrible club split for NS|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: this happens with a multi sometimes   both sides playing in the same suit|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|pc|d9|nt|kmb24: it's hard to untangle it though|pg||
nt|brobles: so the first 13 imps to the Rubio team|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: the e/w made 8 tricks defending in CR in spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h ruff before playing @dA and an overtrick...|pg||
nt|kmb24: was hoping to creat some action by passing i'm sure.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kmb24: i think you have to run the T@s to leave the Q as a reentry|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kmb24: but if they don't cover maybe you're blocked anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: no choice but to fall back on the heart finesse|pg||

nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  If you hover your mouse over the team score, a pop-up shows the imp scale|pg||
nt|henryb:  (Gib would lead trumps)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade game for e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  a chance for EW to have an easy board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: can't say I like 2@C here - would rpefer 1NT if it is in range|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 1@d to me, but that may be age.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: 1NT = 15-17 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK, I'll go with 1@D :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Remember when we used to worry about rebids?  Called "prepared bidding".|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, 2@C is not forcing, but it appears to have given North quite a problem|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  good stop|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Our 1st Burn's Law violation of the session.|pg||

nt|ady: team mates will be very gratefull for the unexpected plus|pg||
nt|chick: This would have been much better bid using control cuebids instead of ace asking|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|espooz: I dont think V should bid 4@D so long they play 2/1 "game force"|pg||
nt|friggi: I think Blandat will gain some Imps on this one|pg||
nt|kmb24: JD to the K for a H finesse was a winner|pg||
nt|brobles: yeah, for sure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: this board likely to be the third push of the segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kmb24: when they cover then you have to play the T@s and you could take enough tricks...|pg||
nt|tez: i bet @c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|friggi: this could be fun|pg||
nt|kmb24: looks like a normal 3n|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|tez: and they will play 3 nt|pg||
nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes as West in the Open room took a lot of tricks after a spade lead|pg||
nt|kmb24: but you never know|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chick: I agree Espen, splinters are for game hands, slower is better for slam hands|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: 2@h is not enuf for me:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: you never know...|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: for you?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|brobles: you were right, but still a push|pg||
pc|dT|nt|espooz: Exactly|pg||
nt|chick: replying to a couple of private comments .... splinters should be used by the person who knows there is game, but doesn't have a slam force hand.|pg||
nt|brobles: I agree, I try a NT bid, not sure if 1 or 2|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|chick: in that case, West is the one who knew there was slam, so he should NOT splinter ... his partner doesn't need to know about the @D shortness|pg||
nt|friggi: do you like W's dbl?|pg||
nt|kmb24: i kind of like 2n over 1s|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|brobles: something went wrong apparenlty cause he claimed 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|brobles: So 2 more imps for Rubio|pg||
nt|brobles: Rafa assumed that either hearts or clubs were weak in the line and went directly for the spade game|pg||

nt|santyclz: Would have avoided a violation of imp rule 2 as well:  Go + on part-score hands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|henryb:  N-S go down in 5@s only if East shifts to a club rather than a heart|pg||

mb|d|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT makes n/s   but has some good fortune|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good decision of S - to open 1nt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  after 1@h may be problem with second round bid |pg||
nt|paulg:  i open 1NT on these hands, but the Italians rarely do (which is a concern to me!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: east has no entry to play spades  and the hearts lay very kindly   and with stiff K@C  should make 10 tricks at least|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulg:  will be relying on 3-3 hearts and a finesse in a minute|pg||

nt|ady: easy game missed in CR for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: Blandat (Mixed in English) is kicking back, just 2 imps from its handicap|pg||
nt|brobles: Caracci team leading by 17 so far (7 carryover and 10 more in the segment)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kmb24: only 3 of the 15 boards this segment were played in partscore at both tables!|pg||
nt|kmb24: 1n overcall in the other room was a little weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: This event has a very nice trophy at the entrance of the main chilean Bridge Club where you can eventually print your team name if you win :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|espooz: standard 1nt here|pg||
nt|kmb24: especially with double so close to describing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: finally, a makeable contract :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes that is a bid odd to see that:)|pg||
nt|brobles: Slam is agressive but easily makes on this layout|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes, very odd|pg||
nt|kmb24: i think rafa should bid 1nt over 1s|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ralfwil: only 12 cards on E on board 17, so they play 18 now|pg||
nt|brobles: Yeah, partner could have enough values for game on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|kmb24: for sure, not to mention 1s could be a silly contract with 1nt cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|friggi: I dont like the lead|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@H is a far better contract then 3NT|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|friggi: I know|pg||

pc|h5|nt|espooz: S have a normal @S lead|pg||
nt|friggi: but N can signal|pg||
nt|espooz: How ?|pg||
nt|friggi: then S will play @D and more|pg||
nt|espooz: Low heart in trick 2 ?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|espooz: If they use smith that a big card likes the lead. North should throw a low @H |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|friggi: @H Ace is asking for signal, due to the fact that W has already bid @H|pg||
nt|friggi: he could have made 6|pg||
nt|friggi: discards @D on @S 10|pg||
nt|friggi: then take @C twice and ruff|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: So brave|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought double might be 4 major, 5 minor type ... but clearly not|pg||

nt|paulg:  1NT-X making is not a disaster, but overtricks are not good|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|c5|nt|ady: had west taken out the double to hearts  this would have made|pg||
nt|paulg:  doubling a strong 1NT opener is always problematic, which is why many use double as a conventional call|pg||

mb|p|nt|brobles: Seems normal|pg||

nt|ady: played   either way declarer makes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice play David - eliminate @c and @h before playing @s|pg||
nt|chick: EW could end in 3N, and if a heart is led, he won't get to use the diamonds|pg||
nt|friggi: @H is a mandatory lead from N|pg||
nt|tez: q of @c or ace and small|pg||

mb|p|nt|brobles: So it will be 11 more imps for the Rubio team|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: some guys have all the luck|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  5@d will get 6@d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd afraid of missing big play with N hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 5@d opening|pg||
nt|ady: goulash|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I suggested, opening a multi 2@d on  4 was a lot more successful as North did overcall 2@h, so the penalty was missed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East must be worried about missing something too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  I play my defence to 1NT over a gambling 3NT|pg||

nt|ady: switch to trump or J@D|pg||
nt|othered1: Put this hand into a matchpoints setting and you'll see lots of NS minuses in 3N|pg||

nt|paulg:  very nicely played to maximise his chances|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: a @D lead would have caused a problem|pg||

pc|hT|nt|henryb:  A @s shift is necessary to beat 5@c, though not 6|pg||

nt|ady: 2@C?|pg||

pc|s7|nt|daman: I would have raised as East at my first opportunity|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even harder if West had been able to make a weak raie on the previous round|pg||
nt|othered1: good example of use of "creeping" STayman (aka Garbage Stayman)|pg||

nt|tez: if my suit is not very strong and my pd and i have an agreement of not asking 5 cards major to 1 nt i bid 1 nt|pg||

nt|kmb24: e/w aren't a regular partnership, but they might have had time to discuss something like serious  or non serious 3nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  double or 1@s?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: partial     e/w may play in spades|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|paulg:  given what we've seen in other auctions, i guess 2@s is a weak raise|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: many prefer to overcall with a decent 5 card suit   and double later if partner quite|pg||
nt|paulg:  that is my style|pg||
nt|ady: double may place the red aces as the opening lead has revealed AK clubs with north|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is a little aggressive, when the hearts may be over you. 3@d game try probably better|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  if you held four spades and, say, @hAQ then that is not enough to double?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: I don't care for the 2@S bid either|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: with pushy preempts, this is the type of contract you'll get to, not one you'd plan to bid yourself NV (needing to hold majors to 2 losers)|pg||

nt|paulg:  seems to be down two, losing a heart and two diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H bid on hand 14 was a swing   not bid in OR|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w may lose pts here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|brobles: Yes, he took the safety play (and prayed that they were 4-0 offside also)|pg||
