nt|Walddk7: Hello Sveta and David|pg||
nt|ady: slam to start     6NT by North as good as any|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Marius, greetings to the spectators|pg||
nt|ady: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Roland and David|pg||
nt|vugraphzbk: second half starting now:)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|nt|ady: 2@D  strong 2   usually either balanced  above 2NT opening  or 8+ tricks in any suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N should be happy to know partner has invitational values|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT confirmed balanced type  around 23-24|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can understand S's problem - if partner has @h fit, 7 may be possible, if not - just a small slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: words cannot express how I feel about that 2@H bid|pg||
nt|daman: this is like playing at the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: they get about 1.25 imp per board so there is a difference in playing strength|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chick: EW sure have the balance of points, but 4@S may still be hard to set|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: it might be described as frisky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: in sweden we have a national handicap|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: and we add this for all four players|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|ady: around 33  34 between them  but KQX hearts minimum to consider grand slam    |pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: but you need to have standards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: then we take the difference between the two teams and we get a handicap|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. why not?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: SOunds interesting - probaby more accurate than accumulated master points|pg||
nt|ady: if south can establish hearts as trumps fit  then rkc can establish quality of norths hearts   and find the queen is missing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now N should know - @h Q is missing|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|ady: 6NT  better than 6 hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: good auction to get to 5@C in the CR|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: this lead would have meant 12 tricks on top in 6NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|ady: best to cash K@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and for GIB - grand is better :) - bridge software always pick such a @h suit right for 5 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Paul|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: the handicap is base on all pairs tournament a player plays. Not optimal but the onlye way wwe got ;)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: if 10 or queen dont appear cross to south and play low heart|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|chick: hi henry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: nice safety by North|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, an example of safety play to notice |pg||
nt|henryb:  good day all|pg||

nt|brobles: This is actually Joaquin Pacareu's first deal of hands of the tournament, right in the final :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: 600 is a huge result|pg||
nt|brobles: The team Caracci won the Round Robin, and had a confortable win in the semifinals over a women team that has played for the Chilean Women team a couple of times|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brobles: Time to start comparing results finally|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may also get to game here   |pg||
nt|kmb24: another 22 point game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brobles: The Team Rubio has also played the event mostly 4 handed and had a very tough semifinal match against the RIOS team|pg||
nt|tez: undo pls|pg||
nt|kmb24: they're playing the board backwards|pg||
nt|tez: this is no real|pg||
nt|kmb24: paca did in fact open 1@H|pg||
nt|tez: different hand i thk:)|pg||
nt|brobles: I think NS play 2@d as a constructive weak 2 in a M (8-11 points)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass would be a good choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: East west playing in 2 hearts, not sure who is who and who has what though :)|pg||
nt|tez: check pls vugraph operator|pg||
nt|kmb24: it's the right hand, the board is just rotated |pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|brobles: Vugraph operator tells me that West has east cards, so they put the board the other way round|pg||
nt|tez: not right hand|pg||
nt|brobles: So Paca is playing 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: north is dealer|pg||
nt|brobles: the auction was not like this, they just put the contract|pg||
nt|tez: he cant pass|pg||
nt|brobles: so Joaquin Pacareu is playing 2@h (as WEST)|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|tez: yes means?|pg||
nt|kmb24: the board is right, the hands are all in the opposite spots|pg||
nt|henryb:  thinking as North is an overbid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tez: 1@s pass 1nt 2@h all pass may be|pg||
nt|brobles: so 3@h shows a minimum heart bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: there is in my opinion a big difference between a 3- or 4-card support, so 2@h is enough for me as E on previous board|pg||
nt|chick: or perhaps 3@C showing 3 card support and let pard decide|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cornelia and Friggi|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Everyone :)|pg||
nt|brobles: You can watch this table live through this link: http://www.bridgesantiago.cl/vugcam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT  has a play  on a liekly club lead|pg||
nt|friggi: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwd: well hello Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hej Staffan @H@H|pg||
nt|alamiro: un poco peligroso pasar al 2@D con apoyo 5to y 8 ptos|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk3: We'll get layer names up soon|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Staffan's pc is a bit slow|pg||
nt|brobles: but that will not stop Juan Pablo :)|pg||
nt|alamiro: sobretodo si el 2@D muestra hasta 17 ptos|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kmb24: most pairs these days do it the other way, 2d a bad weak 2 and 2M a good one.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzja: I'm sorry |pg||
nt|henryb:  np|pg||
nt|henryb:  at all. you have the toughest job in bridge and you are doing very well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  South is not unhappy with developments|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have thought 120|pg||
nt|henryb:  but it makes no nevermind|pg||
nt|henryb:  he really cannot go down|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|chick: I believe some of the IMPs you see in the score are handicaps|pg||
nt|chick: Not sure how many|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: I´ll check :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Blandat got 29 imps for this evening of 24 boards|pg||
nt|friggi: this will be tight|pg||
nt|barbyh: lots of work|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk5: Hei Espen|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Staffan :)|pg||
nt|espooz: Hi all! :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hei Espen :)|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca has to give his partner a diamond ruff or a diamond trick to hold this to 4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|chick: Trump lead was good, as he has to ruff some hearts|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: try @s10|pg||
nt|ady: at best this is down 1  unless there is great help from defenders|pg||
nt|brobles: will push the board now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: sry @c10|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|ady: south passive   best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only chance for E is @sKx on S, but -1|pg||
pc|hK|mc|10|pg||
qx|o18|st||md|4SAJ3HTDQ653CKJ832,SQT42HAQJ3DAK92CQ,SK875HK62DT8CA765,S96H98754DJ74CT94|sv|n|nt|daman: if East passes    this hand will be passed out|pg||
nt|daman: my Mother would open the east hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Shouldn't think he will ...|pg||
nt|daman: 2 1/2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even I would open this one|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Another potential slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Indeed; too little of that world wide|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think this will be difficult to avoid given South's controls|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Survived.  Didn't get a 2@d response.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Wanted a 2@H response to give him a shot|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  just a little too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: bad trump suit will kill this|pg||
nt|chick: hi Ed :)|pg||
nt|chick: although that lead didn't help the defense very much|pg||
nt|henryb:  For what its worth, I would either pass over 1@h (remember when you needed 6 points to respond?) or raise to 2@h|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: I would not pass up the chance to show a 4 card spade suit when I had an A plus something, and backup support for hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  North very unhappy on this lead|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Or maybe they had to hit clubs sooner?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|henryb:  I think she has to hope for 3-2 hearts with the K onside and that she can negotiate a club ruff|pg||
nt|chick: however, I'd stop in 3@H in this auction|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but slam needs very carefull declarer play|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|c6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  bidding 1@s and then 2@h over 1N should show a constructive hand, I think|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  if no @d lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: Me, too, but maybe they don't always raise with 3-card support and a dead minimum|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: 10@S coming down was fortunate once spades 4-1|pg||
nt|paulg:  I guess North thought that slam would be no better than a finesse opposite a normal 3@s call|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it might be a lot worse|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  having so much points in minors - definitely|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's controls possibly too good for 3@s, but you cannot bid 3.5@s|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmmm.  I'll have to remember that play...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He had two trump losers. He lost them. :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c9|nt|henryb:  my line on this hand would have been to duck a club, win a @d return in dummy, finesse the @h, lose another club and hope that a diamond ruff was with the long trump|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|chick: Think how much more 1@H 1@S 1N 2@H tells your partner about your distribution than 1@H 2@H does.   Plus I'd rather play in the 4-4 fit when it goes  1@H 1@S 2@S.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good 8 that - stopsthe duck into the safe hand|pg||

nt|ralfwil: weak or multi|pg||
nt|brobles: Huge result from the Open Room|pg||
nt|kmb24: went something like pass-1@h-1@s-2@c-p-2@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  or rather should not|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: sorry, my error again|pg||
nt|alamiro: buen resultado para E-W en la otra sala luego del X take out sobre 3@C West decidio rematar 3@h y no 3@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: most systems have ups and downs|pg||
nt|kmb24: back to normal|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kmb24: i might try 1n in third seat on that|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  7 of either minor is pretty good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south might balance|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room chose to double 1@d.  i really prefer 1N|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt with singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: ok for me.np:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: prefer 1N with singleton over t/o double with one!|pg||
nt|kmb24: the other room's result is huge.  game on every hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: light opening|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C 2@H should end it|pg||
nt|brobles: I would probably bid 1@h at the table, would be a little scared of 1N red white with a PH partner. 1N looks still reasonable to me|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: 2@S from west shows decent hearts|pg||
nt|chick: very light, even by my standards :)|pg||
nt|tez: 20 point game|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kmb24: not sure what's the plan with 2@c|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  I think S should bid 4@h, a splinter and not 4D|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: balance chancy  as west could be shortin spades   possibly singleton and a good defensive hand|pg||
nt|ady: this looks cedrtainly down 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I see it -1 or -2|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to that:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: found a home|pg||
nt|brobles: I don't know what Smith was planning over 2@d but he should definitly pass now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Very interesting hand to lead from. You sure know one thing - you don´t want to lead :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: unless he had 2@s available to show 4@s and longer minor, nf|pg||
pc|hA|nt|friggi: W signs off with 10 points!?|pg||
nt|chick: He's probably seen his partner's openers :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|friggi: that is the only fair clue to make from this |pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Well, their agreement before was that East may do light openings and bids, while West makes sure he covers up for his partner.. :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kmb24: not much here.  took a heart lead to let this one slip though.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|friggi: but 3NT would have been super here|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: I like it, I should make that agreement with some of my partners :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: If declarer finess in @c - 3 rounds of @s, setting up a @d trick and one trick in front for the defence for -2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Its only 5 impsdifference between 1390 and 2140|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @d of course|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|brobles: well 2@c certainly worked out very well as 2@h will not have trouble|pg||
pc|d3|mc|7|nt|alamiro: hizo las 7 bazas?|pg||
pg||

nt|ady: south may play 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Then you need some pretty rigid rules to avoid playing those nasty Moysean (4-3) fits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'd bid as West|pg||
nt|ady: west may interven showing majors|pg||
nt|henryb:  There, you see, is one of the differences in style. If I responded 1@s I would be likely to end in a 4-3 spade fit instead of a 5-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|chick: what moysean fits?  2@S is always a 4 card suit.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not on my planet|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Not at my table or Ed's|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: 2@C    maybe landy|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  think so, given East's 2@s bid|pg||
nt|chick: then we had better not partner, because if my pard raised to 2@S with only 3, I'd be looking for a new partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this looks as though it will play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Spades do not seem to be getting much support from partner on these deals|pg||
nt|daman: this should be an adventure|pg||
nt|othered1: 'ACtually I define suit quality for a 4-card @S response to 1@H "willing to be raised on Hxx,"  in context of the hand. |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: then I guess you will play in a lot of Moyseans :)|pg||

nt|kmb24: another great result from robles/caracci coming in making 3N off the first 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|brobles: Goren says that with this quantity of points you can play 3N :)|pg||
nt|brobles: The Open room had a misunderstanding on this hand but stopped safely in 4NT. Smith was denying majors with 3@h but apparently they weren't in the same page|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: Valdes is going to prempt?|pg||
nt|kmb24: here's a nice little trick... open the south hand with multi, and show whichever major partner doesn't like|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes he did|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kmb24: but have to play the bad version of multi for that.|pg||
nt|henryb:  on the other hand, 4 imps is the difference in the match at this point|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: still got the club away   so  down 2 last hand|pg||
nt|friggi: plain 4@H here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rick3son:  l have been told that the score is not accurate|pg||
nt|alamiro: Interesante mano de West, aunque solo se pueden hacer 11 tricks en 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: dbl!|pg||
nt|brobles: so 2@s is 0-7hcp|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb:  Is there another set in this match?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: anyone like double on paca's cards?|pg||
nt|kmb24: 3n looks normal to me|pg||
nt|brobles: 4@d is pretty conservative in my opinion|pg||
nt|kmb24: i agree|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca not liking his trick source in 3N with only 1 stopper, but it has to be a winning bid more often.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kmb24: well, given that your partner would take a trick in spades this hand in 3n, maybe it's a better stopper than it seems|pg||
nt|brobles: 5@d turns out to be an excellent spot, because he prefered to evaluate his hand as suit playing cards|pg||
nt|brobles: now rafa should definitly blast into slam|pg||
nt|brobles: and take an overtrick :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: Me gusta el 2@C de East, es una buena mano y el splinter se comeria mucho espacio prefiero tener primer mas informacion de la mano de mi compañero!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: Sure a lot of bidding with this piece of junk|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|alamiro: probablemente el 2@h disminuyo las expectativas de algo mas para east|pg||
mb|4N|nt|brobles: apparently he bid only 5@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|brobles: let's see if EW can cash their first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|kmb24: they squealed|pg||
nt|brobles: Nice try by Joaquin but Rafa decided he was missing too many key cards to get involved|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @hK is a bad honour, so pass on 3@s|pg||
nt|brobles: NS playing 4 card diamonds so I think that a club lead is reasonable. Well done|pg||
nt|kmb24: should lead a club now no problem and the first 5 not hard looking at that dummy|pg||
mb|5S|nt|friggi: good god|pg||
nt|friggi: jacobson has the same illness as Claassen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: overboard again    unfortuantely  diamond honors wasted |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|brobles: East certainly did the only auction to get to 6@d|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|alamiro: Algunas parejas pudieron haber contestando sobre el 4nt , 5nt, numero par de keycards y 1 fallo|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: change the red suits on E and 4@s is clear|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kmb24: great choice by paca to get them looking...|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I think I liked the 1@H opener on the previous deal better than this 12 count|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you can call this a 12 count with qj-.|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 with west|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, especially if you have a meaningful lead in the match.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it was a lock. Given the 1@s bid, West would never have pitched two spades from an origina holding of QJ10x|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This is more like it|pg||
nt|paulg:  looks dangerous hand for West|pg||
nt|ady: would not play well|pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Not a bad responding hand to a strong @c, 12hcp 3 controls...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I presume 1NT is wide-ranging|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 6@c (or @ss in matchpoints).|pg||
nt|ady: double from south?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: It makes the auction game-forcing, and hopefully West will not worry about too much wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, W is aware now|pg||
nt|paulg:  on hands like this it is better to play multi 2@d as North may overcall 2@h :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|paulg:  the only good news is that there is a chance that this auction will be duplicated|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|daman: asking for the @S Q'|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Response denies the king of hearts so all is well|pg||

nt|vugraphzxe: I'm told 3nt was forcing|pg||
nt|daman: right Joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: 5@H asking for @sQ, Rdb = Ace or void|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: Only worry would be a bad spade break, so this lead is a pleasant sight|pg||
nt|henryb:  would you bid 2@s or 2@c over 1N? I think the South hand is too good for 2@s|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: I agree with that, I would bid 2@C|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|ady: spade    then heart from south|pg||

mb|1C|nt|kmb24: they will argue in the comparrison about who gets credit for that one, robles-caracci or paca-rafa|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: de repente hubiera trabajado un game try posiblemente con 3@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tez: do you bid 1@s with rubio hand|pg||
nt|brobles: Smith chose not to double 4@s with his singleton @d and West went for the sacrifice|pg||

nt|chick: hahahahahahhaaaa|pg||

mb|2H|nt|friggi: What about @C opening here then reverse @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  good night all, and good luck to everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Never for me|pg||
nt|chick: There are still about 75 people in the world who open that hand 1@C, but I'm not one of them :)|pg||

nt|friggi: I kind of like it more and more:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: strictly speaking not a minimum but close to it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: another strange bid by Juan Pablo Valdes. Maybe he was expecting EW to bid up|pg||
nt|alamiro: ahora despues de 3@D entraria el criterio del abridor si k10x lo considera como ayuda|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: i would bid:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|friggi: so maybe 76 in few weeks|pg||

nt|santyclz: Remember when we used to worry about rebids?  Called "prepared bidding".|pg||

nt|friggi: I think Blandat will gain some Imps on this one|pg||
nt|kmb24: JD to the K for a H finesse was a winner|pg||

mb|1C|nt|brobles: this board likely to be the third push of the segment|pg||

nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes as West in the Open room took a lot of tricks after a spade lead|pg||

mb|4S|nt|chick: I agree Espen, splinters are for game hands, slower is better for slam hands|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|espooz: Exactly|pg||
nt|chick: replying to a couple of private comments .... splinters should be used by the person who knows there is game, but doesn't have a slam force hand.|pg||
nt|brobles: I agree, I try a NT bid, not sure if 1 or 2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|chick: in that case, West is the one who knew there was slam, so he should NOT splinter ... his partner doesn't need to know about the @D shortness|pg||
nt|friggi: do you like W's dbl?|pg||
nt|kmb24: i kind of like 2n over 1s|pg||

nt|kmb24: just need AK A to wrap 3n|pg||
nt|alamiro: Particularmente no me gustan los overcalls con 5 cartas a nivel de 2, pero en este caso trabaja bien!|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: can still make if ruffing a heart early and playing a spade  if later finessing a club  and eliminating and playing ace and another diamond     east willhave to unblock or be end ...|pg||
nt|ady: played   either way declarer makes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice play David - eliminate @c and @h before playing @s|pg||
nt|chick: EW could end in 3N, and if a heart is led, he won't get to use the diamonds|pg||
nt|friggi: @H is a mandatory lead from N|pg||
nt|tez: q of @c or ace and small|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: I guess maybe any lead other than  @D  will give him entry problems|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT?|pg||
nt|barbyh: what is 3 cl is their system?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: So it will be 11 more imps for the Rubio team|pg||
nt|brobles: maybe they have trouble in getting to 3n now?|pg||
nt|kmb24: 3d wasn't best|pg||
nt|kmb24: i like 2n|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: !|pg||

nt|tez: i bet he will play to 7|pg||
nt|tez: @c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|friggi: some guys have all the luck|pg||
nt|brobles: I would never bid 3N, but on this hand: nicely done what can I say|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|brobles: I would either try 3@h or even 4@d|pg||
nt|brobles: but not 3N|pg||
nt|kmb24: it's not easy|pg||
nt|kmb24: necer 3n for me either|pg||
nt|alamiro: Este 3nt se esta jugando del lado equivocado! mejor si East lo remataba!|pg||
nt|alamiro: Solo 8 tricks posibles si acierta la Q@C|pg||

nt|ady: 9 card suit|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D?|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club lead to beat 6  not too difficult|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am corrected: about 300 teams entered, and if you lost close in the first round (or maybe it was random) you got to the second round anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|paulg:  5@d will get 6@d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd afraid of missing big play with N hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 5@d opening|pg||
nt|ady: goulash|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I suggested, opening a multi 2@d on  4 was a lot more successful as North did overcall 2@h, so the penalty was missed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East must be worried about missing something too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  I play my defence to 1NT over a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I'd have to bid 5@c (or pass)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  pity, but E has no decision, he has just to guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: (LOTTr I mean.)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|paulg:  in a sense this is lucky that it does not matter who plays 6@d as both East and West lead a club|pg||

nt|kmb24: he likes to bid 3n|pg||

nt|brobles: Board 27 turned out to be very costly for the Rubio team as 9 tricks were available in NT|pg||
nt|brobles: I would go for it|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: round 9 of 9    does this session finish the tournament?|pg||

mb|7S|nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|kmb24: now he'll keep denying a diamond fit unless forced to admit it|pg||

nt|brobles: Joaquin is a three time Southamerican Champion (2008-09-10), Rafael de la Barrera has 1 Southamerican Championship on his CV (2010)|pg||

nt|tez: and @d --3-2|pg||

nt|kmb24: kibs telling me partscre is best, and i certainly would not jump shift, but he'll make his game this way|pg||
nt|kmb24: unless he starts believing the 9 and 8 of @h's are something special....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|espooz: I think E have a easy def to play @S K and more @S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brobles: declarer needs more than 2 heart tricks so he should play the 10 now.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: the 4-0 fit cost 11 imps when they reached 5@C in the other room - did well to make that, I think|pg||

nt|othered1: Good test on gettng to 5@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i know it is light but it is classic distribution |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: some like full opening for a take-out double  in case partner has a penalty pass |pg||
nt|ady: 2@C inverted minor raaise|pg||

nt|paulg:  tough problem for West now, perhaps 3@s?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Even harder if West had been able to make a weak raie on the previous round|pg||
nt|othered1: good example of use of "creeping" STayman (aka Garbage Stayman)|pg||

pc|dT|nt|paulg:  i swap bids around when the suits are touching, but not in this sequence (so 1@c-(1@s)-2@d=hearts, 2@h=diamonds)|pg||

nt|kmb24: light game possible here if they're hungry enough|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brobles: let's see how they manage it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|tez: they can i thk|pg||
nt|brobles: Pacareu will definitly show his clubs after a stayman bid|pg||
nt|kmb24: tough hand paca has.  i would have passed.  you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: Plaut will at least try after this match|pg||
nt|alamiro: 4@h para N-S, ahora 3@h seria adecuado!|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|tez: very good spots|pg||
nt|kmb24: hard choice now by west|pg||
nt|kmb24: rafa serving up 500 just in case plaut wants that instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: maybe 800|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kmb24: such a big fit, but all his cards unknown value|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brobles: Did he really win the 9?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kmb24: paca!|pg||
nt|kmb24: some wires crossed there|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|brobles: Nice auction so far, and after 4@c they certainly both know that they are in clubs|pg||
nt|kmb24: i guess they lead 4th best...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kmb24: i wouldn't have bid 4@c on paca's hand, but looks like they're unstoppable now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kmb24: sry 5th best|pg||
nt|kmb24: and rafa assumed he had 5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brobles: don't know about the club queen though|pg||
nt|brobles: It looks like West should have taken control|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d is natural for me..3@h is showing @c support here|pg||
nt|kmb24: also seems like 4@s is normal, when all you have is aces let your partner do the keycarding...|pg||
nt|kmb24: now he doesn't know anything baout partner's clubs|pg||
nt|brobles: Pacareu must be regretting the key card bid|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kmb24: for sure|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: undo:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: chicken backwood!|pg||
nt|brobles: Right, he should never KC with this plan|pg||
nt|kmb24: not very well thought out, should have found a way home after the power start.  now they even lose imps to 3nt!|pg||
nt|brobles: so Rubio will have a big pick up chance here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kmb24: he hasn't played enough with paca to know 3 is more likely than 5|pg||
nt|brobles: right :) specially at these colors|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|d6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kmb24: 6nt is cold on a triple squeeze of south|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kmb24: he'll have discard problem as soon as the 4th club|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s6|pc|c2|nt|alamiro: debe dar un golpe en blanco en @C para poder descartar luego 1@D|pg||

nt|chick: I admit I would not use G Stayman with that hand.|pg||
nt|chick: it had too many good intermediates to help in NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  double or 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: partial     e/w may play in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  given what we've seen in other auctions, i guess 2@s is a weak raise|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: many prefer to overcall with a decent 5 card suit   and double later if partner quite|pg||
nt|paulg:  that is my style|pg||
nt|ady: double may place the red aces as the opening lead has revealed AK clubs with north|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is a little aggressive, when the hearts may be over you. 3@d game try probably better|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  if you held four spades and, say, @hAQ then that is not enough to double?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: I don't care for the 2@S bid either|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: with pushy preempts, this is the type of contract you'll get to, not one you'd plan to bid yourself NV (needing to hold majors to 2 losers)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  probably not, especially given the vulnerability|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|ady: declarer might have done better to keep the 4th diamond   if not ruffing the opening lead discard a heart|pg||
nt|paulg:  seems to be down two, losing a heart and two diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H bid on hand 14 was a swing   not bid in OR|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w may lose pts here|pg||
nt|paulg:  clearly right to take your time in this contract, but I'm concerned that thinking can only lead to -800|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|paulg:  but, no, he is doing the right thing|pg||

nt|tez: realy..if trumps are 4/0|pg||
nt|tez: you must cash ace before|pg||
nt|brobles: Looks like 3N is home in this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: friendly spade and heart layout|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a filthy but mandatory opening bid|pg||
nt|alamiro: talvez 1nt por n-s sea el contrato final|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brobles: Yes, he took the safety play (and prayed that they were 4-0 offside also)|pg||
nt|kmb24: another case for making light jump shifts.  i'd play this hand in partscore.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|kmb24: 2@c shows the majors, double shows values.  now he's stuck|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tez: multi landy..very popular in this time|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  4@s by S seems excessive: 3@s (or 3@c better) would seem like enough|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|brobles: Plaut not going to bid 2@d after this start so he just forces to game|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|brobles: I would bid 2@d and over 2@h I would try 3@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brobles: Nice bid by Rafa, bulnerable and with good cards|pg||
nt|brobles: vulnerable*|pg||
nt|kmb24: i might just bid 2n on that start   i want to play 3n from my side.|pg||
nt|kmb24: and i want to stop in 2n if pard is broke|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kmb24: 1@h-1@s-2@d-2@h-2nt|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kmb24: interesting choice int eh play here now.  looks like spades are 4-4, so maybe it's right to cash A/K@d and play on clubs if the Q didn't fall.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|brobles: They both took the shot after missing a slam and they will get their prize|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brobles: right, 2N has to be better actually|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
