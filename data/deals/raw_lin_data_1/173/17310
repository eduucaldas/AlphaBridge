mb|1D!|mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: 1@D  2@C   textbook bidding|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: hmm... 2@C probably shows both majors i believe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And South can't support diamonds I guess, as it can be 0 cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well local fashions in conventions|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: most likely he will anyway :)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes 6 card support is good even supporting a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and push EW into 4@S maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's a winner|pg||

nt|pelu: against 4@H: @S lead to king, @DK , @H to A - to discard a @C on @DA - but N could ruff - and that = no @H-loser - making 10 tricks|pg||
