nt|chilloncan: of boards played. it takes additional mental effort to remember complicated agreements, and that can play a role in contributing to the sum of fatiugue a player or pair experiences|pg||

nt|serhat: well he has enough for splinter for me.. what ever their method's is|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in fact, once S shows extras via 3H, i think he can backpedal a bit. with 3 aces he obviously should bid 4D, but over 4H i think 4S is enough in the context he has already created|pg||

nt|ianmcc: why too much - here is 620|pg||

nt|chilloncan: well nobody trally had a double|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the point of fit-showing jumps was they allowed west to double on hands like this|pg||

nt|chilloncan: yes|pg||
nt|athene: since you aren't getting your ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but still - where is declarer putting his losers? |pg||
nt|chilloncan: i thopught the point of FJS was more generally to know when to stop bidding and when to go on.|pg||
nt|athene: true, that as well|pg||
nt|serhat: if partner 3c is something , dbl is very normal. no one will be angry with you|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ianmcc: but we can see @hKJ|pg||
nt|athene: another perhaps more important point is that if you double, partner is more likely to read your club lead as a singleton|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|chilloncan: when they have enough trumps and cross-m,atched shortnesses they can make a LOT of tricks. and they are NV. and it is N who doubled so very possible heart king will leer at you ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or @DA instead of @HKQ @DK|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but a lot depends on what methods they have available|pg||

mb|1C|nt|athene: except that 4@D all pass looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|serhat: if both minors dont break 3-3 then you need an extra trick before it is too late|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unless S can open 3N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: A big pre-empt here would be bad|pg||

nt|athene: well, some play 4@D shows a good spade hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: from the result shown the lead should stay at 2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: then they would open 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in OZ  3@D opening would have 2 less @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: in the other room west let declarer get a heart pitch|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|serhat: dbl?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i prefer 2C with W hand. pd didnt overcall so they are likely to have spade fit and thus can probably outbid you. if od has anything there will be Ds in his hand and that is not ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bullish for game. so bid your long suit|pg||

nt|andy_h: Spec points out that if Team Hans hold on here Nabil will overtake Gosney's record as the youngest ever Australian Open Team Representative at age 19 (Gosney was 21)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drum roll   5 imp spread  but it is really this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, hans can't lose on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought Nabil turned 20 earlier this year|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: more likely another pickup the way they bid|pg||
nt|babs59: Nabil is still 17 isn't he|pg||
nt|babs59: I mean he's 18, turning 19|pg||
nt|babs59: 19 in May|pg||
nt|serhat: I think they will bid the slam now. Congrats to Hans team.. and very well done to 4men Courtney team..|pg||
nt|mwigor: they may bid 7 now|pg||
nt|babs59: it gets confusing because Adam Edgtton is 20 :)|pg||
nt|serhat: if no miracle last hand was a last chance for Courtney|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat favorable  1N=9-12|pg||
nt|serhat: dbled 4s would bring them a victory|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 7 could go down on 8 of D lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unlikely but not impossible|pg||
nt|athene: refuse finesse - what, play for @HQJx?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not enough other tricks|pg||
nt|serhat: 7 is on a finese isnt it?|pg||
nt|mwigor: i dont see what declarer's other chance is?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: clubs 33 and hearts QJx|pg||
nt|mwigor: not enough bill you need to find pitches for 3@d and a @c|pg||
nt|mwigor: ok|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw @C, ruff @C good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dare i ask -- is 1N going to make it TOUGHER to get to ANY slam?|pg||
nt|athene: but that is too thin|pg||
nt|mwigor: surely you just take the finesse|pg||
nt|serhat: for that also spade 2-2 needed.. what a 7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pitch one club on heart then ruff out clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you just close your eyes and say "small please"|pg||
nt|serhat: poor Nabil.. he doesnt know 6s is good enough!:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: much lower percent than finess of course but on 8 of diamonds lead N might assume no D king with E, as it is not as though E is leading thru the NT bidder|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out you are a bit short of entries to north anyway for that|pg||
nt|mwigor: you cant even make playing for QJx of @h and 3-3 clubs not enough entries|pg||
nt|ianmcc: you could shut your eyes and bid 6@s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: i don't know if they play same conventions over the mini-NT as over strong NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|serhat: you can Micheal with spade finese|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot on Ian !!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: gotcha|pg||
nt|serhat: !:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he did! well maybe he shut his eyes and bid 7@S, but missed it and bid 6 instead|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find the right bid with closed eyes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: finessing the @s8 gives you two entries to dummy - i believe you need 3 to do everything|pg||
