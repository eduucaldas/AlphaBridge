nt|imp_jan: bid in the CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzbr: Gert-Jan asks: "no 2@D?"|pg||

nt|imp_jan: so ginnosar-pachtman had the tools to reach the good slam after a strong nt|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: let's see of jan and gert-jan can copy that|pg||

nt|imp_jan: the dbl is good news for south|pg||
nt|imp_jan: how to avoid the grand?|pg||
mb|4S|an|cue, 4!H would be last train|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: btw with a slight diff lay out seven is cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, North could have @SK instead of the queen, which would make the grand slam quite good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a spade pitch on a diamond|pg||

nt|sharkey: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, so we are back for the thrilling end|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting to see whether East will open 1NT or upgrade to 1@h here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi there Carl and welcome|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I think e is way to strong to show 15-17|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he opens 1@h they might reach over 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Israel jr. pulled out the close first half to lead by 5 |pg||
nt|sharkey: 4 in either M probably|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 1@h and then show 18-19 bal seems right I think on that hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: I prefer 1@H with East hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h - 1@s - 2NT - 3@h ( ? ) 4@h ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Now discussing defences|pg||
nt|sybarra: after 3 @H you may hear 4 @D by E |pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi shirley :) yes, after sweden took a great lead Israel came closer and closer and on the last board they got to the lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Unless they probe for slam with a 2 NT rebid....|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just got in on last bd when it had not been decided yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: E might even open 1 nt ?|pg||

nt|lestergold: surely south has opebned 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||

nt|jcomyn: I have been called a lot of things but never natasha|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  going to keep NS out of their 4-4 @s fit|pg||

nt|sybarra: the operator will get them up shortly |pg||
nt|sybarra: i think we are in a mad scramble at the moment to catch up |pg||
nt|lestergold: a borderline 3n  available here for N/S which shouold be bid really|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1st example of youthful exuberance...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empting 2@c bid:)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi bruce |pg||
nt|kemperg: racognized your name|pg||
nt|jcomyn: natalia i mean|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello Arifin, Joe, Dennis and specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well try 3@h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 of @D is very important here|pg||
nt|bobholl: will tehy reach the fairly good 6@C ?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: weak two diamonds or strong I guess|pg||
nt|kemperg: O no dear|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised South bid not try 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: nope 4@s makeable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would have been hard for West to find the @c lead against 3NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt is a fair shot on S hand:)?|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably didnt like his stiff @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should have found a bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi arifin arened you in the OR?|pg||
nt|ahalim: 2@H sone sort of Ekren ?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Ritong lui a soufflé pas juste !|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Ralf, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 10-boards matches, so each of them is important|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at these colours putting a spoke in is not soley confined to juniros|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike and Bruce @H@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: as the cards are in def it looks like a @s slam is aliot better, I dont think its an easy @c-lead from N|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson, in my eyes, easily the best Scottish pair this weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  Mesbur/Fitzgibbon, perhaps the most experienced pair at the event|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, half time scores: Wales 168; England 161; Ireland 161; Scotland; WBU; NI 104|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is it doesn't take up very much space|pg||
nt|sybarra: I beleive the operator is catching up,    |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing what does he leave the x in with i wonder|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a bad slam|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like E will compete to 2@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like 2@d and 2@c to lose in 3@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we see 4 @D bid |pg||
nt|sharkey: @SQ key card either case if non-@C lead|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep|pg||
nt|ritong: i dunno, but 3NT has play|pg||
nt|ritong: ba, je suis un garçon simple  j aurais fait ça, alors je suppose naivement qu ils vont faire pareil|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is aggressive when 3@s can be bid on that junk|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree - 4@S too optimistic here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this bidding system presumably weak no trump will get e/w too high pretty quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aggressive isd hardly the word|pg||
nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it did its work|pg||
nt|m_niemi: hearts length in left so RHO will overruff hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: a comfortable start |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi germ|pg||
nt|ritong: bien que pour nous, il existe la réponse de 2SA|pg||
nt|ritong: qui est gênante|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: qui obliger à jouer |pg||
nt|ritong: oui  pas gai|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C is by far better than "fairly good"!|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anderson and Greenwood one of the most experienced pairs in the event|pg||
nt|paulg:  David Greenwood, known as jtr on BBO, is also a frequent vugraph commentator|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good morning all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Jim|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@C opening in a youth match|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have an exciting week of bridge planned with the jrs. |pg||
nt|lestergold: no @d opening by N?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@d |pg||
nt|lestergold: not available|pg||
nt|lestergold: in which case i'dopen 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: nv|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D I ment|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: not so much mini as micro|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what i wasw asking is if the polish juniors are sons of well known fathers|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant bid it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree|pg||
nt|kemperg: I understood|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, it's the younger son of Krzysztof Jassem on South|pg||
nt|kemperg: only pepsicola is not there|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks the likeliest outcome here|pg||
nt|sommer: upside down count, so @CK is safe|pg||
nt|sommer: there's some work to do for E, but it's makeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to believe a jr didn't open the n hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks:(|pg||
nt|ahalim: if a @H is led|pg||
nt|kemperg: and ducked|pg||
nt|ahalim: of course|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w has to do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: no problem here in 4@H I think|pg||
nt|bg: W can get two red aces but he has to cash them|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all from sunny Dortmund|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|santyclz: So w must play the J to attempt to induce s to win the trick.|pg||
nt|sharkey: West may not be done - all prime values|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hawe45: This might go one off - @D not behaving and the @C Ace off-side|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n for N/S has a  fair chance|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C as w2 in@D or something strong is very popular in the Netherlands, I do not like it|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: and Mike|pg||
nt|tomi2: gives your opps the chance to double 2@C, pass and double 2@D, bid directly or await things and balance later|pg||
nt|tomi2: north now knows his partner can't be too strong for his double, so he won't push to games in doubt. same as if S had overcalled / balanced, north has one useful information|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|sharkey: He was....|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard gave W not encouragment |pg||
nt|yuval10: W has done extremely well here, so tough not to be tempted|pg||
nt|ritong: il va perdre quatre plis|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: obligerait  à jouer   3 @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  how good is 6@s on say a trump lead|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 losers but I am not sure there are 9 winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: list of all participants |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Suppose taht E/W do not play negative double, East has a problem. Would then bid 2 @S|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon|pg||
nt|hawe45: 10th trick now|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought they were hutling towards a slam there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: right tx|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25 pts to start with|pg||
nt|milton_se: on their way, it seems|pg||
nt|bridgek: hi all|pg||
mb|6C|nt|pitiful:  assume opps have not bid|pg||
nt|ady: only 1 top loser in spades   but with spades 4-1  difficulties at the slam level|pg||
nt|sommer: @H shift?|pg||
nt|kemperg: teh best|pg||
nt|sommer: a minor is sensible too, but not best|pg||
nt|sommer: wonder why S didnt continue @C's|pg||
nt|kemperg: No E has 8 pts not 0|pg||
nt|yuval10: W can't even be sure his side has a 8-cards fit|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why not 3@d loosers?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: i wonder what the real auction was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would not want to bid a slam single dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on these cards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi michael|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: Those Israeli' hate mistakes|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ahalim: roland told me closed room :(|pg||
nt|ritong: never mind|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: he will tell you if needed|pg||
nt|ritong: ça se passe bien aussi a sans atout|pg||
nt|bobholl: good bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  @h10 from Walker to show diamond interest|pg||
nt|puncher: Exciting time for Wales - when was the last time they won it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks Alan, of course we know international bridge players are hopeless with bridgemates|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here, so no hope |pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not a great contract even without this lie of the cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Riccardo Rubino|pg||
nt|rich89: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: ciao ricardo |pg||
nt|santyclz: Even at favorable, qjxxx at the 2 level is shall we say sub-optimal.|pg||
nt|the saint: South should have doubled 2D to show extras|pg||
nt|kemperg: but  3N makes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont agree chazps|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, if you hold your thumbs for sweden this might be a scare board|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: Ireland will be looking for a big win here to nail the camrose - Wales and England also hoping for big wins - any of these three could win it|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have never won|pg||
nt|mamos: this will drift off could EW make anything much?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3CX more interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: amazing, wd:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I am a great admirer of Jassem's book|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C asking for 4 and 5 card major - 3@D = no 5 card but 1/2 4 card, 3@S = 4 card @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK Wessel|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  everyone I know would open 1@h on the South cards|pg||
nt|hawe45: Better late than never - hi|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: morning Ricardo|pg||
nt|lestergold: east strong no trump opener they play in 2@h|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: reasonable contract that is not easy to make|pg||
nt|tomi2: he has 6 fast losers her|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl shd try for a slow @H trick|pg||
nt|xenya: actually declarer will do well to get out for -1|pg||
nt|tomi2: will have to work for -1 only|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps the 2@c opening worked this time :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D would have worked as well or maybe better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a vfery impressive bidding sequence|pg||
nt|kemperg: lot of nerve from W|pg||
nt|kemperg: I know|pg||
nt|bobholl: a typical "brink" card not the normal K|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gowdy: a trump lead in these 2 syuited auctions often work best  as here|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but look it has shut them up when they have a chance of a vul game|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think so|pg||
nt|mamos: Yes Sandra Rimstedt must have high hopes of beating this|pg||
nt|davidstern: Mike Bruce and (@H) Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David welcome |pg||
nt|jcomyn: helps tell why israel leading|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 "tricks , sp some work for decl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what about gold old herbert|pg||
nt|kemperg: somewhat oldfashioned|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dagold: 3@c would have been close, perhaps struggling on a forcing game in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of the reasons i do not like weak no trump because it forces you to a 2 level rebid with a 17 COUNT|pg||
nt|lestergold: I SHOULD SAY MQANY REASONS|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock sorry|pg||
nt|mamos: no  messing  :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont mind the lead|pg||
nt|bg: good try by west when your own suits do not look promising try to hit partners suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Partner could equally have held J10xxx instead of 109XXX|pg||
nt|kemperg: with @H breaking yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: up!! |pg||
pc|h3|nt|pitiful:  good duck by Norman?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: doesnt matter what he does does it?|pg||
nt|puncher: Even more exciting then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best is now a @d finess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats the point of playing take-out double when you hasve the perfect hand for penalties|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you dont know 3nt is making - you DO know 3D is going down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|peachy: The point of playing takeout dbl on the 3-level is well made by Mike Lawrence, Larry Cohen, and other bridge authors|pg||
nt|kemperg: right John|pg||
nt|peachy: No doubt leaving in this time would have been better|pg||
nt|kemperg: we wood|pg||

nt|ritong: donc un tres léger gain possible pour les français|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H makes double dummy -- but it's a tall order|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - but here West should have played trumps - after the nice lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite   but some play it here as penalty|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should have x available for takeout / show values|pg||
nt|mamos: not so easy |pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to me but then I am an auld fella|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like both sides has a 8-cards fit , so not competing to 2@s is surely a losing bridge for the long term|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Hans|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: just drop the @HQ and guess clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: And if slightly strange things happen, even Scotland could still do it|pg||

nt|kemperg: no defense left now|pg||
nt|ahalim: I like it here with you guys :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dagold: seems to be  atrick short|pg||
nt|puncher: But can they hold on to their current lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they will be very nervous, but even more so their supporters, NPC and sitting out pair|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  declarer should probably have played the @dJ there|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short would not lead small from the @dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  so he must have the @dK ... often right to play your middle honour of a sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if clubs were 3/2 they would take a further 3 tricks with a ruff|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed|pg||
nt|hawe45: But cross-ruff will appear|pg||
nt|bridgek: I assume 3ha showed shortness|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: S could have doubled 3@H, showing a good hand, but the final contract would have been the same|pg||
nt|jcomyn: isnt she the brazen hussy with her 10 count|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  Scotland can help themselves, and Wales, by keeping Ireland at bay|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|bridgek: so the lead is normal|pg||
nt|bobholl: convenient that 2@S was forcing :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|puncher: yes that's true - it's probaby the worst for the sitting out pair|pg||

nt|lestergold: Hi Mike Raif and specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry late|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Which he should in my opinion|pg||
nt|mamos: is hussy politically correct expression?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what she comes up with here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: politically correct is for wussys|pg||
nt|santyclz: When it works it reinforces the behaviour. |pg||

nt|kemperg: how did he do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: what? just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: movie says made|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Germ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: East' hand is an opener nowadays|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good h contract but at what level|pg||
nt|kemperg: and no rebid problem|pg||
nt|po-s: @C-1H? or do they play transfer responses?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@c - 1@d - 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: as suggest by East' father, who knows their system|pg||
nt|yuval10: and indeed PO, they play transfers over 1@c|pg||
nt|po-s: North will double|pg||
nt|kemperg: and E rdl with 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|po-s: only if they play support D/RD|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl of 1D would mean @Ds|pg||
nt|hawe45: Even I would open 1 @h as South|pg||
nt|lestergold: played too quickly we have seen this so many times in this event|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they are just playing junior style:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: safety play sometimes gives you unexpected dividends|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome David,  I am sure this makes you nervous|pg||
nt|ahalim: W was rather timid|pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: Hi everyone! (again)|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland|pg||

nt|hawe45: Here we have the well-known - one more trich in @H than in @S|pg||
nt|hawe45: West as declarer and you make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Didnt expect a lead from Qx|pg||

mb|d|nt|cameron_1: @d looser in end game I think|pg||

nt|newmoon: hi David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Sid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @S suit worth more trhan one HCP|pg||
nt|puncher: Any weak NTs in the whole event? I'm a fan but others don't seem to be these days...|pg||
nt|paulg:  This is a clash of systems, with Precision Club against 'standard' here and Carrot Club against 'standard' in the other room ... part of the reason for lots of swings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thats junior opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Does NOT excist|pg||
nt|sybarra: does everyone pass the N hand?|pg||
nt|mamos: I prefer 2!@h weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm south reticent again|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 13|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why W didn't persevere with trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: a bit horrid for NS|pg||
nt|mamos: it was   she ducked club  took @dA   and hooked trump:( |pg||
nt|jcomyn: weirder|pg||
nt|kemperg: thy Vincent|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: maybe cause of the lost of connection something went wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why didnt u double partner s says|pg||
nt|jcomyn: everything nicely placed. never happens to me|pg||
nt|mamos: but a nasty little problem just after breakfast|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S can go to 5 level of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|pelu: breakfast? - almost lunch in Europe (12.00)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is West too strong for the same opening as on 11?!|pg||
nt|hawe45: ear/cut 1 @H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: feels like this will be a really close match till last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: the french pair playing weak NT at this Vul|pg||
nt|bridgek: 2 spades= puppet for 2NT|pg||
nt|bridgek: who's getting too high here?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West|pg||

nt|lestergold: but it should not have|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah,  think a lot of folks would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: at this vul |pg||
nt|mamos: South must take some action here  double looks normal enough|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Get 2 @C from partner and I would not like having opened|pg||
nt|mamos: or a protective NT :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: I just saw Scotland bid this to 6@S via Kokish relay |pg||

nt|ady: looks like 3NT  for n/s   no reall problems|pg||
nt|newmoon: me 2|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 3N -- whether E preempts or not|pg||
nt|paulg:  At least you approve the 4-card majors here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sry - I double , naturalle over 1 @C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is a swedish proverb Mike - better late than never:)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 2@s  next|pg||
nt|mamos: in English we finish "better never late"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sporty South - 1400 or so|pg||
nt|hawe45: Could be|pg||
nt|m_niemi: opening w/ S hand?|pg||
nt|mamos: 1Nt I guess coming |pg||
nt|davidstern: With this now being round 14|pg||
nt|tomi2: if E had nod discarded a heart his partnercould have drawn the trumps, he would gain the trick with the high heart, draw the @D and win the last trick with @D7 for -2 and a beer|pg||
nt|kemperg: älso N name ""sounds"" familiar|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 4@h at these colours|pg||
nt|mamos: these are Juniors :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: clear|pg||
nt|sharkey: I believe Sweden have two girls playing - in the other match the Dutch have an (almost) all-girl team so impressive showing of the girls in this tournament|pg||
nt|ritong: d un autre coté, l ouverture de 1@d est nébuleuse|pg||
nt|hawe45: moi aussi - mais 5 @D joue bien|pg||
nt|ritong: ça peut etre bon de lacer la barre tres haut tres vite|pg||
nt|ritong: placer*|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dagold: could make a game facing the right weak notrump type|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a favourite irish expression|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark:  Some oftThe Northern Irish still play weak NT |pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|puncher: yes let's hope this match is as exciting as the last one|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might pass 1NT|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 3@c shows both majors  |pg||
nt|sybarra: N getting excited since he passed?|pg||
nt|mamos: and/or asks for more information from South|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think its exclusive to Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Beter laat dan nooit :)|pg||
nt|mamos: West?????? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: majors i presume|pg||
nt|po-s: a conservative bunch these juniors|pg||
nt|mamos: I see no majors|pg||
nt|gowdy: hard to pass the S hand  as a Jr|pg||
nt|gowdy: or senior|pg||
nt|mamos: are these the hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: did e really open 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, weak 9-11|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats some 2h by W|pg||
nt|sommer: a frisky 3@H now, would be profitable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  juniors used to bid moe than everyone else :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  I like Fisher's pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie 4@h can be made|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no good rebid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree less clear cut than South's hand on the previous deal|pg||
nt|lestergold: if West opems then bidding as many would 4@h probably reached|pg||
nt|sharkey: S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|hawe45: Le score "par" est 5 @H X pour 300|pg||
nt|lebridgeur:  1 @h non critiquable|pg||

nt|ritong: c est vrai|pg||
nt|hawe45: Mais bonne nouvele pour Sud|pg||
mb|3H|nt|puncher: Well I'd have opened 1@C before 1@S - except that it'd be a 1NT for me|pg||
nt|gowdy: but back in|pg||
nt|m_niemi: p-p-2@h-3@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Tight game missed Declarer perhaps able to endplay S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker has been conservative holding three small clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: u have to bid 4@s with N or you are done up0 like a kipper|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like check back |pg||
nt|xenya: nice analysis :)|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly eight tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: am sure the beer was more important|pg||
nt|sommer: 3rd t/o?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: Neth. has all 4 girls, it is the Neth. Girls team |pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears EW do not use support x|pg||
nt|davidb: EW  make many tricks in H  |pg||
nt|ritong: il sait que ça n en restera pas la quasi surement|pg||
nt|ritong: et préfère donner une bonne information plutot que de faire des sauts de cabri a @h|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pauvre Sud - sans soutien á @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well Houston we have landed (maybe) |pg||
nt|mamos: South not excited :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has no more ammo|pg||
nt|bg: this should be a good match  at halfway point France in third Canada8th only four make it to KO|pg||
nt|lestergold: qith  experience they will learn the need for maximum pressure|pg||
nt|mamos: East's 4@d  secured a lead in that suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: the real pressure bid is 5@h by west|pg||
nt|kemperg: I played them, they not afraid of going high|pg||
nt|lestergold: many of us would bid a lot of hearts out of terror of an opposition slam|pg||
nt|mamos: and sometimes bidding too much  pushes the oppo to the contract we want to avoid :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but you have to know when to do it quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact |pg||
nt|lestergold: only a @d lead beats 6|pg||
nt|pelu:  @D lead defeat 6@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: by the way it should be a @d lead if 6 is bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: he''s worried now|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c redoubled was not for free|pg||
mb|d!|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||

nt|mamos: here|pg||
nt|ahalim: juniors Mike remember|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that c annot be right|pg||
nt|m_niemi: just 8 tricks|pg||

nt|gowdy: redicent eh|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4s|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4! only down by sigleton@D|pg||
nt|sommer: he passed.. well, it's ok in red zone|pg||
nt|kemperg: rdl by E would de interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: same ide:)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3@c  montrerait quatre cartes à .@h avec des @c   d autant qu'Est souhaite l'entame @c   ici il peut toujours l'attendre|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 2@D showed a good 2@H raise but >>|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its a risk i agree but its a bigger risk not bidding it|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by N |pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice and low|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, and that is extreamy fun I think. But dont forget N at this table is a world top player. She is definatly top (5?) in the world all female I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - game's on|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe 2@c is puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the phantom of the opera |pg||
nt|mamos: South may be a bit |pg||
nt|lestergold: strikes|pg||
nt|mamos: nervous now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why! @dK behind and @hA|pg||
nt|mamos: Not a classic vil overcall|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I will pass with confidence as S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html  Competitie (left), White House Juniors 2011 for updated results|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think its good enuf with a 6 card suit and a couple of high caRDS|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to bid game now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr west sees 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is   6 (Israel schools) v  7|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|davidstern: minimum|pg||
nt|mamos: as the cards lie  lots of tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: un contre étonnat qq soitle résultat|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: here 2nt is "super accept" and  3 @H is a retransfer|pg||
nt|davidstern: But that said 1 trick on lead both heart and club honours oincide and diamonds ok|pg||
nt|davidstern: usual case when you are in 1 and swap NS when you bid 2NT|pg||
nt|ahalim: cannot see the 9th trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: they are missing spotcards here in clubs and spades to make an extra trick|pg||
nt|xenya: well it could make on a good day|pg||
nt|jcomyn: boy o boy that surely is weak|pg||
nt|kemperg: and passed 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Junior World Champion in Philadelphia last year...|pg||
nt|yuval10: good competitive bid from S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  730 is also too high|pg||
nt|milton_se: seems makeable|pg||
nt|bridgek: nobody! can ginossar make this?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the @sK surprisingly well positioned this will play well for declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: after a long weekend of watching it is good to have swingy boards to finish to keep us all awake|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would like to bid 2@s, but Sime has not shown any values|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s now is probably the bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is very close to a yarborough  (but for that pesky 10) |pg||
nt|hawe45: If they play 12-14 NT - in my opinion the West-hand is too strong|pg||
nt|gowdy: unsure why not stayman  but very hard to find 6 @H|pg||
nt|hawe45: And 6 @H is lucky|pg||
nt|mamos: my head has exploded|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead says misunderstood|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South's @d length may cause declarer to misguess the @h J|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If he plays trumps 4-0, he is a sure winner|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: or x if you want|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u canr pasws|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All you need is to play opener for the @S King...!|pg||
nt|mamos: BNorth needs to find the @sK  --preferably by playing the Ace !|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand of course is unmanageable|pg||
nt|lestergold: for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h can be let thrualthough it should not make on best defence of course|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can see why south is taking time|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H +@S but Bid of N ? pehaps jusy a weeeeeeak 2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only one answer gives problem*s(|pg||
nt|yuval10: Dutch girls are a true surprise , for me at least. They did tremendously well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
nt|puncher: now will do |pg||
nt|po-s: thought I - apparently these guys know each other...|pg||
nt|davidstern: No good switch here|pg||
nt|tomi2: he might be tempted to duck a heart directly. in case they are 4-4 this opens several squeeze chances|pg||
nt|peachy: Not necessarily, there is a style where first seat favorable systemic can open very weak, but of course I do not know their system|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit unlucky cant get partner in|pg||
nt|sharkey: I stated that Netherland had a girls team, Shirley, but I was quickly reminded that a boy had been standing in on an occasion :)|pg||
nt|ritong: 960 on my abacus|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: theplay will be swift|pg||
nt|gowdy: to be sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: but at fave vul south should protect with 2@H you need to contest these 20/20 hands to get the plus|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.  I'm still reeling from the initial pass.|pg||
nt|bg: 2 clubs is invitational check back I believe 2dia would be GF checkback|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, the Israeli jrs have been looking very strong this year |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: kq of @C dropping :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|puncher: yes so should be a comfortable make |pg||
nt|puncher: west endplayed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: fast enough? :)|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they did well in Philly at the worlds (they won jrs)   |pg||
nt|bg: trans national mixed teams won by Daniel Lavee and co|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
nt|pelu: strange play|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, thats why a @H contract is best in S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  short conservative because his opener is minimum and they are non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: should scrape home|pg||
nt|lestergold: once in a blue moon dummy has tghe  earth and ur partner has zilch and a misfit but more often u get done out of a game|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fairly comfortable as you have the @s10|pg||
nt|paulg:  might make an overtrick on this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: declarer got tired of S thinking about ruffing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@H in OR ends in 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @sK, @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2nd in hand should always be sound but by todays standards it was just about an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: teams changed a lot since then, the Israelis have two new pairs|pg||
nt|bg: problem arises when too much weidght put on Queens and Jacks for point count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: France lost Bessis-Volcker|pg||
nt|lestergold: cost 2 tricks in practice|pg||
nt|kemperg: Still down, @S K, @S A, @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unimportant in 1@h|pg||
nt|kemperg: you know that by hart|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 760|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: i often score that in opponent's column|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the failure to protect was simply giving the opps an easy ride for no good reason|pg||
pc|s4|nt|2hplus4: Yes W quite conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: you still use an abacus ? no calculator ?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If they doÂ´nt cover, they doÂ´nt have it...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think it deserved to be hammered|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt get the match points|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that South bid only 1@d because of the vulnerability |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
nt|xenya: none of the key suits break evenly|pg||
nt|tomi2: the black suits break squeeze-friendly but not the hearts of course, if had he tried this|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl chooses the straightforward line of either black suit breaking 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes or QJdoubleton in @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: now W|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S K|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to blame anyone for this. But both N and S were a little passive|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: my guess is he takes the spade hook |pg||
nt|lestergold: maxi looks like this heart the ruff and a trump|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has good values, so 1@h opening is correct |pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: misdeal board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Mikael and Arifin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Ernst, our operator|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi everybody :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Hi|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Roland and Mikael|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
nt|paulg:  cannot cost to put the @d8 in|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|sommer: didnt expect 4:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and the poor @d spot cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this is not an easy game to bid even if you are not disturbed|pg||
nt|bridgek: west must drop KQ of clubs on  a ruff to test south|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: place your bets  will he make ?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: (unfortunately)|pg||
nt|ritong: i have a mobile abacus:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: calculator is so 90's|pg||
nt|bobholl: it comes down to the @H guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good start for E/W, but now...|pg||
nt|milton_se: can even afford to draw trumps now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With S long in @C and @S declarer suspects @H A falling|pg||
nt|bg: ok now S had to continue Dia or lose it|pg||
nt|sommer: .."only" 3@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|puncher: so if you lead a trump you should lead a low one here - declarer could have played the 8@D for the overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: or this same|pg||
nt|mamos: @sK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or maybe 2@d would have been something other than weak|pg||
nt|bridgek: declarer knows west to be 6-4 in spades-diamomds|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  Walker and Short have a tendency to avoid thin games. They are often in the par contract but the trend is to bid these games and challenge the opponents to beat you|pg||
nt|davidstern: question now is how much west trusts the defenders|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||
nt|newmoon: plse stay tuned - we have a problem|pg||
nt|newmoon: will he make it tho?  has to hook @C10 after 2@Hs|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree with Shirley  I dont think so|pg||
nt|mamos: nope|pg||
nt|mamos: -750 or even 950|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for 6 imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: can S bid 2N Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|ahalim: a funny thing happened on  !, N and E had the same hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think this will be an really intresting match between a verry talanted swedish team vs a Israel that has been dominating this tournament so far|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: hoping for 3-3 split|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  Short will be telling Walker to evaluate better and raise with his six count|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure Matheson will say that playing the @dK guarantees the contract, which is the prime objective at the end of a tough weekend|pg||
nt|puncher: absolutely|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is a risk you will be put up to game by opps thos|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: hi again|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Insted of 1@h i would dbl on W hand after pass first time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would be tempted to dbl too|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi mike|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|mikael_w: And Hi Arifin :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Filé|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: and emerge with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry, screwed this one up|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec kows Tim Verbeek is a man|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer playing pairs|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is absolutely clear is that south had two opportunities to enter the auction and availed himself of neither this is not recommended|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be costly for the dutch :(|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|newmoon: rehi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky/unfriendly this |pg||
nt|bg: could be a swing on that board if France finds 3nt instead of 4 dpades|pg||
pc|hT|mc|9|nt|ahalim: Yes, North is a very promising player|pg||

nt|imp_jan: brink-drijver are wellknown for thr ultra agressive bidding |pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Same contract at the 3rd table too, also 140|pg||
nt|imp_jan: whas there a weak jump Roland on the third table?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Muller bid 1@H|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a stretch at unfavourable |pg||
nt|imp_jan: not for bas and sjoert :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they did not go for 800 enough :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well they like wild results, in the end they usually prevail|pg||

nt|paulg:  they will open 1@c in the other room but probably get a similar result|pg||
nt|puncher: it's all so public these days too - with all of us watching over their shoulders - it adds to the pressure of a long weekend|pg||
nt|sybarra: the joy of jrs, "keep the game moving" |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s is not a junior contract omn thiose cards actually not a senior one either|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont  understand WEst's play  :(  panic?|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East may not be expecting an opposition slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: may not be that easy to bid 16 opp ten and lots of wasted values like 8 points not needed its effectively a combined working 19 points|pg||
nt|mamos: South has proved he can count to nine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mss rimstedt will get busy here|pg||
nt|po-s: he doesn´t want opponents tu suffer|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now some fun|pg||

nt|ahalim: S to N : " Not my day to-day: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Vincent is it Tim?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the folly of youth with an 8-count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes it is|pg||
nt|mamos: hehe  i wondered Girls Team|pg||
nt|kemperg: wich team is it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: first part score for a while|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: or 1@D and jump to 2NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to see any result here other than 3n+2|pg||
nt|sommer: he showed a weak hand already, and N showed around 18, so no leb imo|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but they surely play Leb|pg||
nt|sommer: but not here|pg||
nt|ahalim: hi mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wowee a grand in the offing|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Pd might pass 1@h when you have an 8 card @s fit|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: I even think my grandmother would get to 6 @S's|pg||
nt|m_niemi: for me too|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has finally found the bidding box|pg||
nt|gowdy: those don't look like 4 @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly John|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW may have some problems to find @s-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm generally more worried about my opponents than the vugraph audience|pg||
nt|kemperg: will this end in 2@S by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there something wrong with 3 nt?  can you make it?|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could try a small diamond when W had pitched a diamond, risking 3 down, but preserving some chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: the girls team|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H and N will go to 4|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe so|pg||
nt|sommer: in that case, they needed a bad defence:)..or flat board|pg||
nt|mamos: bet they dont|pg||
nt|ahalim: six they will bid for sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i supposxe 6 is where they end up|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Nope:)|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure top-10, but top 3?|pg||
nt|sybarra: vulnerability favors e/w |pg||

nt|ritong: never mind|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Est il utile de préciser que la donne 15 est un énorme swing pour Israël?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: and bridge is about creating problems for theopps|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??????:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: which he joined earlier this week, they havent enough players in the girls team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is getting very confusing|pg||
nt|ahalim: this shd be a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT only game I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: East will probably come with 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s is 8-11 3 @s's|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT not reachable though|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3@c-3@h and then V has a real problem|pg||
nt|sharkey: If East bid 3@C Vulnerable may get to 3 NT - tough now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: somewhat strange 1N by E|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s is an old fashioned Acol Strong Two|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What kind of 2@S is that?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is either natural, gf, or a good heart raise|pg||
nt|puncher: I'm sure some prefer the good old days when you went off for the weekend and your bad bids and plays weren't scrutinised by all|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean J@s not needed combined 18|pg||
nt|gowdy: x or 2nt ?|pg||
nt|gowdy: and avoiding you own|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East X = take out to @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so had to pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h now or 4@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet n/s flop into 4 @S somehow |pg||
nt|bg: nice pass by S tempting to preempt with 3 spades but pard will never know what is going on when suits or that bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like goulash dealer having fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hmm I surely disagree with pass on first hand with a 74|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D promises 5 coards if balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: it didn't look like clubs were breaking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: With 14 opposite 8 it seems unlikely to even be sniffed at.  Bidding 6 looks promising though.|pg||
nt|yuval10: and a good score for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: well interesting hand here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and 3@h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: *14|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and se does not play kokish|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and the singleton @H not so easy to pinpoint |pg||
nt|lestergold: a most unusual double fit here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and many of us do not speak dutch that well |pg||
nt|sybarra: I only know some of the swear words |pg||
nt|davidstern: Battle of the black suits here|pg||

nt|xenya: holding 4 hearts i mean|pg||

nt|m_niemi: now 4@s easy to East|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H wd not be my bid here|pg||

nt|xenya: i would certainly rebid diamonds|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is fine sacrifice|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @H, 3 nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: back to real time|pg||
nt|sybarra: East is the only female at the table  btw|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is one way to get to 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W might be not SO experienced - thatÂ´s all|pg||
nt|mamos: another stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west was thinking E had @sq due to @s2|pg||
nt|po-s: and sometimes, if a spade lead had beaten 3NT, claiming causes more pain|pg||
nt|bg: this transfer may bring a super acceptance of 3 spades in which case S will bid 4|pg||
nt|tomi2: he already showed 5 but better upgradng akqxx to 6 than 432 to 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: now they are in real trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south did not alert the 2NT|pg||

nt|paulg:  i think 2@d shows a minimum|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is the upside that you see all the bad bids and plays of everyone else|pg||
nt|lestergold: is 4@h necessary?|pg||
nt|rich89: mmm :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead coing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *coming?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h is enuf south has defensive values not min no reason to fear opposition game|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass was lot of pressure on E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@h i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: if East has @SQ  no rush to play Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: I imagine 4@c shows fit and good Clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d wont be what south wants to hear|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@S looks like 5 spades and three diamond tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Vincent|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought so|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec confirmed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this guy is incorrigible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|jcomyn: our clover has 4 leaves - ah i see this is \ REFERENCE TO SHAMROCK|pg||
nt|kemperg: these 12pts I would not open|pg||
nt|hawe45: You mean 5 @C / or_|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a heart lead doesnt beat it|pg||
nt|sybarra: but no way that E knows pard has 7 clubs etc |pg||
nt|bobholl: immidiately to the limit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Certainly prevented EW finding @C fit|pg||
nt|puncher: this is true and somewhat comforting for all of us watching them now! |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he was impressed with his ht suit......|pg||
nt|bg: sry daydreaming too early in the am|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: very nice 4@C bid by Sabourin, should get EW to 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly the W hand improved with the club bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: W probably worried about his @dkxx, a nd the 2 baby @S |pg||
nt|mamos: 2@s  enough to buy the hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Three clubs losing 2 spades and two diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK wit the slam|pg||
nt|mikael_w: we have to remember this is juniors :) That means if there is a chanse for game the take it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and optimism reigns :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nothing wrong with that tho. verry often it makes becuse of the agressive bidding as well|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure if this is a stolen pot or not|pg||
nt|xenya: it is|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  good bid by the Irish, 9 tricks even on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north is worth another move surely|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lousy|pg||
nt|xenya: N won't pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: north must think his pd is 2452 but he stops the black suits well. maybe he passes this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: awww both wrong|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@S seems to save 4 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Tofte alerting both passes, Raulund didn't|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would a H not be led lads|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H prevent that:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the abbott always leads a H with this holding|pg||
nt|mamos: im interested by South's pass over 3@d  i know he hasnt a good hand but does have good Spades  4@S seems more  "obvious"?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes throw a heart on the @dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s ruff is entry to the @dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suspect West is thinking rather than South|pg||
nt|hawe45: Strange double of 2 @H / if you ask me!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Its basically up tom west to drive the auction now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is worried about the heart position|pg||
nt|xenya: no-trump partial for EW|pg||
nt|hawe45: Mais c´est "gentile"...|pg||
nt|ritong: la fameuse double manche|pg||
pc|h2|nt|puncher: with hearts breaking badly looks like one off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Match 2 in 1 hour and 10 minutes will feature Netherlands Juniors and Venezuela|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead seems to beat 3 NT - might be too late now|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes some sort of fit-bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: aggressive X by W|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi George|pg||
nt|kemperg: no bet|pg||
nt|mamos: coffee  I think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 1 @d est  une réponse texas sur l ouverture d'un @c    une convention de plus en plus fréquente|pg||
pc|h4|nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically u bid 3@h which will almost certainly stop west from bidding if north has shape with little defence and say 4 or 5 hearts he can complete the barrage to 4!gh if necessary|pg||
nt|the saint: What would West's initial double have been? Many play it as that hand or a really big one|pg||
nt|m_niemi: and down he goes|pg||
nt|gowdy: back to par 100|pg||
nt|mamos: this is not an auction of beauty|pg||
nt|jcomyn: love to know how he thinks p will ever get in|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes definitely so brb|pg||
nt|pelu: S could still have a 4 card @S - so 3@S by N would also be a normal bid - but balanced and extra values - so 3NT very OK|pg||
nt|kemperg: +1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even with a @H lead aren't 6 1 0 6 available?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nows gs try|pg||
nt|mamos: Im about to owe John a drink|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - but I also think the Israeli placed 1. due to sound bridge as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: this Israel team won in Philly Olympiad also|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ainsi joue t on de la main de l'ouvreur|pg||
nt|hawe45: Mais quand meme avec pas mal de perdantes|pg||
nt|bobholl: "only" guess trumps not difficult anymore:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|paulg:  Would Sime have doubled 3NT holding the @sQ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: 5 @D X = 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 1 hour and 10 minutes is Israel Schools vs USA|pg||
nt|andreasw:  If pd has @h cuebid it is defently worth a shot!|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, on le voit mal faire ce contrat|pg||
nt|bridgek: trump guess is over|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pitiful:  fooled us all|pg||
nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit mousy not vul|pg||
nt|bg: double not good for the Canadians|pg||
nt|xenya: if only a natural 4N was availble here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean by S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south also alerted 4@c, but did not alert 4@d. North alerted 4@d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: YOWSIE|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would have bid 2@s as a fit jump over 1@h but I guess West did not have that option|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has presumably set up a game force amd now perhaps cann confirm thhe club support east having shown a fairly minimum hand can afford to cue 41h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: les cartes  sont bien mal placées pour NS|pg||
nt|ritong: l affaire va se négocier au nombre de levées de chute, probablement|pg||
nt|hawe45: Seule espoir: Valet de @C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: a heart lead beats 3NT --but no chance of finding it |pg||
nt|lestergold: ye norfth has done well knows that partner does not know about his stiff heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly no play for 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an unreasonable contract in the abstract|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer doesnt know he has nine tricks   so easily|pg||
nt|hawe45: When I double like North here, pd cashes the @H Ace / and give away the slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: North might even get another chance to lead ace and another heart |pg||
nt|lestergold: its called you have a PARTNER|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why has south given up with this monster|pg||
nt|davidstern: So it looks like EW have sold out cheaply|pg||
nt|tomi2: North now clearly overbids his hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@S is rkcb in hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: the auction has gone out of hand|pg||
nt|sommer: -500|pg||
nt|santyclz: Surprised us all.|pg||
nt|mamos: im told 4@s does have a meaning   This team have been fantastic in this tournament|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 on a @H, not on @D|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me |pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising that South didnt up the Heart pre-empt   maybe he's old beyond his years|pg||
nt|po-s: If South had supported perhaps they might have found the scrifice|pg||
nt|mamos: most people I know over 60  would have put 4@H  on the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what 2D mean|pg||
nt|mamos: once you get past a certain age youve gone for 1100 so many times you stop caring|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus for the results|pg||
nt|po-s: most likely 2D was multi|pg||
nt|mamos: something that includes balanced 19 counts I'd guess|pg||
nt|po-s: if only strong East would have done something other than passing over 2H|pg||
nt|the saint: North should have been able to read a singleton|pg||
nt|gowdy: the @C 2 was a mistake  |pg||
nt|kemperg: we''\l see|pg||
nt|santyclz: That looks right to me, have to delay the @d ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: if you have the @d7...|pg||
nt|mamos: North paid the penalty on Board 1 in the OR for not leading partner's suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT from South might had a play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: he could have signed of in 4@H leaving his partner with a chance to bid on|pg||
nt|mamos: East is enjoying it   but North amd South are on different pages of the manual|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps in different manuals|pg||
nt|sommer: and EW had 650 safely = 4 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has made it very clear as to his values now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes usual to play it shows A or K but North likes other leads less|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s and east should know what is needed|pg||
nt|hawe45: With this speed, I= am happy, that they are not bidding on to 7...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Is he really thinkin?|pg||
nt|lestergold: who is in the tank here? is south thinking of bidding?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suspect West is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, W thinking here.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but 4@s does seem obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has shown club support 4@s is surely automatic?|pg||
nt|hawe45: They play low/speed cue/bids|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: No one else objects to the 4@h bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|tomi2: no - they are not. they just misjudge their hand - but i think both know each meaning of each bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will find out automaticlly|pg||
nt|mamos: that the clubs are blocked and the Diamond Ace onside|pg||
nt|mamos: he will but he needs to think|pg||
nt|pelu: Netherland have great tradition and a lot of great results in women team - it looks like a new generation will follow that rute|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will have cashed 9 tricks by that time so can safely lead a @d up|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im wrong he will have cashed 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i will be surprised if discards are not such that it will be safe to try a @d|pg||
nt|pelu: id he takes his 9 tricks and play @D from dummy he will have 10 @CQ block the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: however east has to find 3 discards on @hs|pg||
nt|mamos: eventually I think he will play @hQ  and then will relax|pg||
nt|pelu: Laura Dekkers in West (23) has only played bridge for 4-5 yeard - I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: In the CR declarer played the AK of @s on board one, before trying the @h finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S on board 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: either its not a coffe hand after all or its a coffe and cakes hand |pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|newmoon: Open Room started with the last 2 boards.  They have comparfisons... we don't|pg||
nt|kemperg: E afraid of 5@S' in W|pg||

nt|hawe45:  SPADE NOW|pg||

nt|mamos: defence in control now|pg||
nt|ahalim: or some pages are missing :)|pg||
nt|daman: S should be ablke to make this on a simple endplay|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now he gets squeezed blind|pg||
nt|daman: able*|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a very mature sequience for two junioras so far.......|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone play that 4NT from East here shows a good 4@c bid?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S likely to be duplicated next door for push|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C better for NS|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|puncher: good try by south to get partner in to lead the spade through - just not to be on this hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  YES|pg||
nt|lestergold: North seems confident that south cannot get a club loser away on @ds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: nice contract to stop in here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry misclick|pg||
nt|yuval10: especially with @d lead|pg||
nt|po-s: Opening is OK but to jump to 4S with nine losers is a bit hmm optimistic|pg||
nt|po-s: no|pg||
nt|ritong: enfin, a 1 SA ça n est pas perdu d avance|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   Competitie (left), then White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h I mean.|pg||
nt|ahalim: rhis will be bloody|pg||
nt|mamos: what was 2NT Tom?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|newmoon: more control in @C than in 2@H, yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  West might have considered 3@c|pg||
nt|hawe45: TRUMP BACK|pg||
nt|tomi2: a general gametry, forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: E ha d9 pts more than promised, but W knew that by inference|pg||
nt|mamos: can't dellay it when they lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  problem now is staying out of 7@c|pg||
nt|hawe45: ut sounds interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this looks like the right contrakt that will be 11 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: sure, but you can't bid that at a safe level|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: mais c est noraml de jouer 2 @h  1@c  1@h 1 sa 2@h|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needed to set up Diamond trick to keep it to ten  +1  now|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the bidding,  and holding 4 @H's   X doesnt see right |pg||
nt|yuval10: as advertise - 13 imps for Israel|pg||
nt|yuval10: Sweden pushed to slam in board 13|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: c est juste|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: peut  etre Sud aurait il pu ici dire1 @h sur 1@d  quitte à jouer à 7 atouts éventuellemnt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rich89: 2@h is 8 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Roland |pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT  should have been a warning ?:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3rd @D and then @H @H, S has to becarefull ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h iallows for the grand slam possibility if west is even better thab he has promised so far|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy lead for South in view of X of 2@h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: watching talented but inexperienced players reminds how much experience counts for at bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: that confidence could have been misplaced|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can anyone see anything EW could have done better|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think its quite an impressive sequence for two youngsters|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes / good bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  I think its a very boring sequence from two juniors:p|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|kemperg: Reese|pg||
nt|xenya: oh maybe you can|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: very nicely done |pg||
nt|tomi2: fron N's point of view 3nt showed a decent hand with 2452 distr.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit pointless|pg||
nt|kemperg: when I remember it well, read those in the 60's|pg||
nt|sommer: he would ruff in hand and run @SJ|pg||
nt|sommer: ..as he will soon|pg||
nt|kemperg: he should, would?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes and not even RD|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and 12  now|pg||
nt|ritong: cette réponse en texas permet de moduler un peu, oui  si on admet que les bonnes mains avec 4 cartes a @h disent 2@h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: that was not what i meant by accurate defence|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally EW are just a bit short of 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: im told North is a she i do not know why names are not given as Miss or mrs. or Mz so we know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: giving your age away now|pg||
nt|mamos: French team have started well  -- do we have link to scores  the one I had yesterday seems broken|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: no frills on this one from Norman|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzag: lost the play :(|pg||

nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: oc:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: but nine tricks are available not that I can count |pg||

nt|garnetts: I think we are going off line again |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|mamos: crash|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: EW needed to engineer a spade ruff to beat it by several tricks, probably 3 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with this bidding. a void when partner asks for aces...|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, just asking kindly :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's why I was agreeing with 7 on a @h lead but not on a @D.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  exacly!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: and now.....the end is near....with apols to Sinatra|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why keep the two little spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 7 of spades is an entry?|pg||
nt|kemperg: it is|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 7 in Easts hand could play a role if he tries to endplay him in @S|pg||
nt|kemperg: but no use now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not completly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: at an early stage|pg||
nt|paulg:  back-seat driving, i agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats the simple way of grabbing the @d trick|pg||

nt|mikael_w: well, if the swedes just keep bidding as hard on the next board to in the OR they will get some of that IMP:s back|pg||
nt|xenya: then, if W passes, N might bid 2@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45: La vi est dure|pg||
nt|hawe45: vie|pg||
nt|ritong: certes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|copeyj: last hand was a red save hand I think - 5@D was only one down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@d is not textbook|pg||
nt|copeyj: I reckon Bell will overcall with the west hand next door, but we will see|pg||
nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
nt|paulg:  something to be said for 2@c by Sime|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps 1NT?|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N for me I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even 1@s, but I'd like a better suit|pg||
nt|puncher: i certainly don't like pass but then I don't have many green cards in my box :)|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N at least has the advantage of getting the values across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and you do have somewhere to run|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it´s better to show the void on S - and N will not be happy!|pg||
nt|mamos: someone has turned the distributiononometer up|pg||
nt|ahalim: is this a goulash tournament ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: after the first match with those hungarians...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pass!!|pg||
nt|gowdy: good !|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyone for 6 of a minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: what a deal here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wow some fun here in bidding very suitable for polish|pg||
nt|mamos: six is interesting on Diamond lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very very interesting where they stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have surely ruiffed a spade high in case they were 4/2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an obvious defence perhaps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should be exciting|pg||
nt|bg: could be X not meant as penalty but then EW  not on same wavelength|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it was pretty popular in Holland, Brink Drijver were playing it, but now they stopped playing it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to rework the system notes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but at the end he was down if they were 4-2|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: il va y avoir beaucoup d enchères avant que Sud n'ait la parole avec ses 23 points|pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was not suggesting i follow the rules|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it was not meant as a critisism|pg||
nt|copeyj: I know :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 5@h now|pg||
nt|copeyj: I find 3@D quite scary, but I am applying for my bus pass in 12 months time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you would be more at home in senior bridge simon|pg||
nt|cameron_1: bezerk might be a better word|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ... you might want to call it that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: thats not timid  what was 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html  Competitie (left), White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: don't know that|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: the dutch dealing prog has been set to "wild"|pg||
nt|the saint: I've seen worse 3@C bids 1st NV|pg||
nt|gowdy: just asking :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I thought they bid aggressively in non vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: well west alerted it, east didnt, so think your right Bruce|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E could be playing a 4/3 in hts |pg||
nt|bg: E should bid 3 clubs good heart fit and W has a spade shortage|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thisd hand should keep w quiet|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good judgement / if they play 15/17|pg||
nt|ritong: il aimerait bien que ça lui arrive a 1SA, pour passer tranquille et compter les levées de chute|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @S pour jouer est bon|pg||
nt|ritong: mais non|pg||
nt|bridgek: 5haX= par , not really worth the save|pg||
mb|4S|nt|2hplus4: Cards lie well for slam here|pg||
nt|hawe45: So now we know for sure, that E/W play 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S are higher ranking (and scoring )|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
nt|puncher: seems a shame not to be able to bid those clubs!|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Sime reads my blog, so he knows my preference|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it is East thinking here|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree that 1@S would be fine with better pips|pg||
nt|kemperg: well done E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s very restrained for a junior|pg||
nt|gowdy: and now we know that North likes to bid !  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my club money game 3@c wouold be considered a routine conservative action|pg||
nt|davidstern: Fit showing jump in competition|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D a @S raise |pg||
nt|tomi2: both german pairs have no 2@D weak opener in their system|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dodgy aul h fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have blocked one of the majors somehow|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it will be dangerus getting to hi in the bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 NT = 22-24|pg||
nt|pelu: prob N just tranfer to @H and play 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play canape, so they often often a 4-card major rather than a longer minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when it is clubs, since they don't like that suit|pg||
nt|mamos: dont like 1@S   |pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|ahalim: we would all pin the @H 10 seeing all 4 hands :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 6 to be exact|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we will all be in the ibdding is my guess|pg||
nt|lebridgeur:  avec des vulnérabilités différentes  Estdirait 4 @d  mais ici il a un gadget |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
nt|puncher: no difficulties for declarer here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has great hand and this vul. pard should have a good suit at least |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s very questionable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: EW play different NT ranges in different positions|pg||
nt|hawe45: Rathar weak North for the 2 @C-bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: this one was 14-17|pg||
nt|the saint: Will work now, becuase should be able to lead a club vs 3N|pg||
nt|bg: oops now France on different meanings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dont know if 4NT was meant as asking aces or that is was quanti|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Robert asking partner if he is right|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at the hand,  can S be asking aces?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont really understand the 1@S bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now a cue by E and off we go |pg||
nt|davidstern: No defence and good play hand why bid so low|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 7 surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S  7@S|pg||
nt|pelu: or can she show 6 card @h and invit for slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought E would come in also|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N is peace of cake in E|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: admirez le passe de Sud!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
nt|jcomyn: the poor d suit aszgtsain|pg||
nt|sybarra: now Bruce, how to pick up the club suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like they are on the same wavelength, but my French isnt fantastic :(|pg||
nt|bg: easy Shirley just play K-A  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you bid 3 or 4 sp?|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree David bid once and high|pg||
nt|davidstern: Depending on mood and partner - indifferent to either|pg||
nt|davidstern: Probably 4@S but ..... on another day 3@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: NEVER ON ANY PLANET would I bid 1@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: white v white, so always a crap shoot |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree, no way you get me to bid 1 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: good point|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H has small chances|pg||
nt|jcomyn: How often bravery and skill not rewarded in bridge|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising  North didn't bid on first round  maybe no way to show @c  after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mamos: very aggressive from East|pg||
nt|davidstern: West's made it a little hard on partner|pg||
nt|tomi2: I don't agree to that double, it should show spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: testing thei system|pg||
nt|mamos: quieter waters|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes poor spot cards and poor shape|pg||
nt|mikael_w: maybe 4@h now from S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: i do the bids in twos because of mouse click noises|pg||
nt|kemperg: but make's|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s oj if they are very conservative vul about their 3@s bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants  go to the next button on the bottom to see the Witte House (White House) |pg||
nt|rich89: @H now? |pg||
nt|lestergold: ht switch absolutgeluy mandatory here|pg||
nt|mamos: let off the hook there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will NS find the crossruff?|pg||
nt|mamos: South claimed 9 a couple of hands ago  will  ten test him ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: As always: Lead a TRUMP!|pg||
nt|hawe45: But here @D works better...|pg||
nt|gowdy: may start a high D for a look |pg||
nt|hawe45: East wants 300 instead of 100|pg||
nt|the saint: Smolen 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what south wanted to hear!|pg||
nt|gowdy: xx @C perhaps 4 @H|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play transfers in this situation, 2@C would have shown @D'S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but no matter|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|paulg:  thanks Alan|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may get doubled|pg||
nt|hawe45:  500 now - or?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice start fo decl.|pg||
nt|kemperg: prefer 2N opening on E|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmm another interesting contract|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@C from South|pg||
nt|kemperg: USA in 4@H at 12|pg||
nt|po-s: impossible to find a diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my son does not believe in no trump downgrades only upgrades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  he has been reading Klinger|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, good|pg||
nt|hawe45: Mais pas la contre!|pg||
nt|ritong: un petit coup de bâton pour la route, quand même|pg||
nt|hawe45: Bridge practique = 3 SA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: EW lead 3/5 but attitude in partners suit it seems|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg:  you think these seniors could all the clicks then?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hear the clicks|pg||
nt|lestergold: if pard does not have high spade honour u cant beat it|pg||
nt|the saint: Well South might hate his club shortage and try for a major fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: my granny would do that  but do the experts do the same?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that solves the s situation|pg||
nt|peachy: East's bidding has pinpointed spade singleton so 3NT started to look bad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK?|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe @CA and @Hshift is enough|pg||
nt|kemperg: good lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..no, then S can play dummy reversal|pg||
nt|sommer: it's makeable then|pg||
nt|mikael_w: its not often, but this is a hand where its better to be dec with the week hand|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and maybe it was posible after the Dbl ? If S say pass?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: surely 4nt by w|pg||
nt|tomi2: should north have opened 3@D maybe? nonvuln but 2nd seat|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what the heck is 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has read everything Julian|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  most bridge players are like airline passengers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  love to upgrade but hate to downgrade|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: beautiful faciltiy, a refurbished tennis club with still active tennis courts |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry missed that|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: and right next to the olympic stadium :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer knows hes probably doomed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dummy trying to read my face, difficult to keep it in shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes probably does, why else does anyone lead into the @H holding|pg||
nt|mamos: and now tooooo high|pg||
nt|sybarra: whack! |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Friendly match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jaime Lee|pg||
nt|davidstern: 800 versus 920|pg||
nt|davidstern: 940 if you are inspired in clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: EW did well in the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: )|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord where are they going|pg||
nt|kemperg: $@H last train?|pg||
nt|ritong: ça pourrait mal tourner|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my no dbl? |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mamos: when opponents bid too much we need to double to teach them a friendly lesson :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: think better to finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: Losing 2 hearts 2 diamonds and club -4|pg||
nt|ahalim: there is your cake :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: even in W|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: but thinks for himself|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @d position is favourable for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem with downgrade 18 Milton's you may miss a game when partner has the good intermediates but only 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45: Switch to the @D 10 / East might duck it!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  I would blame partner for not inviting and hide @h J:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer needs only 3 @d for the contract|pg||
nt|hawe45: 730 á bientot|pg||
pc|d5|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
nt|xenya: E has figured out that @Ss must be 4-4 on the auction -- a nice piece of inference|pg||
nt|jcomyn: EXRERAWHACK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: EXTRA|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still ducking is an option!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  No matter Ron will for sure make|pg||
nt|po-s: so how should he play the suit?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cash 4@h and then run the @d7?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Difference de 1.130 en ce cas|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: cela va mal tourner pour NS|pg||
nt|ritong: je dois dire qUE 3sa? 9A ME VIENDRAIT PAS|pg||
nt|ritong: OUPS|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard to know if they can have a weak two in 4th, or an immediate two in 4th seat|pg||
nt|xenya: not worse that 4-4 i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: claim|pg||
nt|mikael_w: feals like a @c-lead would have make this contract really scare|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 10 minor cxards|pg||
nt|tomi2: now north has no single trick and cant expect his partner to have Ax of @D and to find the lead... something went wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: for another huge score|pg||
nt|mamos: just  couple of trumps to lose|pg||
nt|peachy: 4D was the last making contract but 5D is just unlucky while 4H has  a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: christmas has arrived early|pg||
nt|sommer: more @D? ..or ruff @S|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that pass = 2 card @h|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, But if you lie about 2 or 3 @h does it really matter ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: again not an easy hand to handle|pg||
nt|mamos: going to need that entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: nice defense by East|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed |pg||
nt|pelu: best: take @SA and strat red cross-ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: finalemnt 23+ 15/17 = pas grand chose en face|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: wel;l; he has decided to play pard for a club guard rather than play the 4/3 fit i wouold have gopne for the 4/3 fit on the grounds that even if north has a club card it might not ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: be sufficient|pg||
nt|kemperg: S denied @D controle|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like @d lead is setting the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4@h was last train |pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Tim|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|puncher: The Scottish EW were in a disciplined 3@S on board 1 hence the 6 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: OK East making his opponents suffer|pg||
nt|tomi2: e will corrently fight for an overtrick here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why so long to play|pg||
nt|kemperg: AH|pg||
nt|kemperg: eastern egg|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it is EASTER arrivinbg early|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N with stiff A or K not bad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and get away with it|pg||
mc|10|nt|jameslee 2: hi all |pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if the tap would have been more effective,  (If E had bid 2 C, maybe k of @C lead)|pg||

nt|sybarra: when my left opp bids nt over pard's suit,  not sure worth leading  |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant rho|pg||
nt|garnetts: lightish opening bid ( and I would open this one) and a light dbl will likely get EW to 3NT |pg||
nt|dagold: would be amazed if it isn't 3N making to be honest|pg||
nt|xenya: -5?  |pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all, and take a pat on the back for being patient :)|pg||
nt|idc: I expect it will take a while to get the scores up to date (if it can be done)|pg||
nt|idc: but at least we will (fingers crossed) get to see some bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and deservedly  |pg||
nt|rich89: could be -2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wonder what coach of n/s says????|pg||
nt|mamos: and presumably the defence to 4@S could have won five or six tricks with that cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@s might be unlucky here too|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can they bid the slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes noticed thast|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 13 to Finns bd 21|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4/3 fits when you have the high cards in the trump suit and good side suits etc is very often highly playable|pg||
nt|xenya: S was going to get squeezed anyway|pg||
nt|ahalim: and now a quiet board|pg||
nt|xenya: a heated discussion is under way no doubt|pg||
nt|tomi2: the german pair will have to refocus on the remaining boards, still 6 to go. they know they are far behind now|pg||
nt|mamos: slightly odd auction in OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: might be duplicated here|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play forcing NT and the 2@C response from N will be multi-meaning... but maybe south will pass 1@S with no king and ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: helmich-hop play some sort of Gazilli, so 2@c was forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2: their 1@S opening is limited to 18hcp, so a game is far away|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hard to stay out of game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w has a monster thisd time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least he will think so|pg||
nt|daman: EW are huffing and puffing after the last 2 hands|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best start for NL-girls|pg||
nt|sommer: very difficult to make this one, because of the @C sits|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but after 1@C opening and opps carding, he might have solved it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 0nly lols make those ones|pg||
nt|yuval10: reasonable line to go for the @c ruff, very nice by W not to lead the singelton when she know that partner doesn't have the Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: definitely not right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you lead low to the 9 or 10 and ace, what do you do next?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross to the king, you are in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I have a fealing 4@h even make is a good result on this board anyway|pg||
nt|davidb: no greek gifts...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: surement  un bicolore majeur 3 @d|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Interesting boards this morning|pg||
nt|bridgek: 6d will they get pushed there?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|2hplus4: ???|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@S seems a likely spot|pg||
nt|mamos: This table is going to be in time trouble|pg||
nt|mikael_w: anyone knnows if sweden bid the game on board 14 in OR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: no, just 4 -- quite likely|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This time E has 3 tens to make up for lack of points and balanced hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  a hand for south to keep quiet|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of the great defense we have seen (esp. in the Vandy) was when the pards followed each others lead in defense|pg||
nt|mamos: slam chance at least|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding comps expect you to find them on hands like this|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board n 5 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with a few sacre bleus and things|pg||
nt|peachy: NS are the older of the Israel teams, currently in first place|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 4@h is fouhnd it could make inpractice here|pg||
nt|mamos: i have trouble following one table|pg||
nt|santyclz: Send Roland the bill for the 42" monitor.|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT in North... / but how to bid it|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H by W|pg||
nt|davidb: yes they did|pg||
nt|kemperg: this was peacecake, next piece of cake|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @S = 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: and is back|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks the best spot|pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet he goes slamming|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and another s slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@H = @S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dagold: danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@c is a nice bid, although here 5@c might have caused major problems|pg||
nt|xenya: that score will not be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d presumably a limit raise|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate scores having been entered correctly, AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: East is not timid|pg||
nt|hawe45: I open the North hand with 1 in my longest suit|pg||
nt|gowdy: now this is hard luck for NS  on a good day 6@D is cold  but not this day|pg||
nt|m_niemi: South bids now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@d x'd,, so even if they'd x'd 2@d it would have been a loss.|pg||
nt|tomi2: Ellerbeck might see his problematic rebid after 2@C gazilli|pg||
nt|mamos: quick auction :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, 3@D by N?|pg||
nt|kemperg: NS can make 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i go with the original suggestion the 7@d is unlikely to be covered wjatever the north holding and if it is you still have the option of playibng A and @d to K to allow for Qs with ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: North|pg||
nt|po-s: agree, duck one when South showed the ten which he would do  also with four|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be 6 imps back|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Thanks Carl. that will prob give sweden 6 imp back|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks surely that N will compete to the 3 level|pg||
nt|hawe45: C´est difficile - contre sur 3 @D = les @D|pg||
mb|d|nt|puncher: Looks like 4@H is an ok spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  as East can never get in, 3NT looks a better spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit I hate 2N openings with this shape and quality|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: flat hand open 1nt 4/3/3/3|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer did well to make eight in OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think it was misdefended there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makes anyyway|pg||
nt|mamos: this isnt much like bridge |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with his attitude this is inevitable|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Again game making|pg||
nt|puncher: that's true|pg||
nt|paulg:  but 4@h is the normal contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be lucky that you don't really have the entries for the double heart finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  West's raise shows invitational values or better|pg||
nt|hawe45: 800 must do this time|pg||
nt|hawe45: Is 5 @D a winner - I´m not so sure|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: raise to 3nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: did W bid 2 @D?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Why Mike|pg||
nt|kemperg: try to look at the Portugal open at the same time, does't work well(|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it looks like 4@s has a chanse for e/w but will not be easy to find|pg||
nt|sharkey: Have to admit the Norwegians are partial to the Swedes - even though we dont like to admit it...:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for S now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|paulg:  West might take the push with a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|idc: The score from the other room was initially 6@c making, but has been changed to 6NT going -1|pg||
nt|idc: If so, Sime did very well to lead @hA, since it makes on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how in heavens name can w pass|pg||
nt|mamos: no bidding and hand dont match|pg||
nt|gowdy: as well he should|pg||
nt|bg: S hoping Dia Q wrong|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lead 4th best by E|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand has 4 @C +2@H+1@S +1@D= 8 |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: with KQJ with west very unlikely to have the @SA so think he should finesse the clubs last board for a safety play|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: needs a 9 trick somewhere |pg||
nt|sybarra: and if so what is it|pg||
nt|mamos: is this Strong Club do we know?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Is that forcing???|pg||
nt|mamos: what do we think of 2@H :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not much|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s was trf to 1NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H =@H|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@s  montre 5+ @s et 4+@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: North contemplating his good hand:  "is there more than 4@S here?"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1s-2s-3s surely|pg||
nt|hawe45: I have seen weaker 2 @H than this|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @C is not my taste|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess 2@c is some kind of strong accept in @h? then S might be glad now|pg||
nt|ritong: la, le partenaire avait quelques @c et ils etaient bien mis|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Espen has done well to only bid 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 1@H as S, then pass any rebid by N|pg||
nt|mamos: would you use Stayman here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NO! only 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: a club limit raise I am told |pg||
nt|mamos: presumably balanced 10ish :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: will he find @C9|pg||
nt|pelu: u were right - IN OR S (Padon) show his hand as a stroing @S-opening - and they were in 4@S -1!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: and nice double from Noramn since 5@S would be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This is odd.|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy double for West|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A gift for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: I oftgen opt to open a Hearty with these hands knowing that if its passed out we are rarely missing a game|pg||
nt|kemperg: then 1 or 2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead the @D 10, pls|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think it is a very strong club.....dont know|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: its artificial yes didnt find a convention card jet|pg||
nt|lestergold: after second double north is very cautious holding some values and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: THE Israeli Juniors  have a fantastic record in the tournament so far averaging 22 points|pg||
nt|jcomyn: presumably 1nt shows spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: think so|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sorry, East doubled|pg||
nt|xenya: they won't get too far at this pace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: this is a peaceful one|pg||
nt|mamos: ah   a sort of inverted :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so were 2@H and 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: but for the ruff,  5 @c would be ok |pg||
nt|daman: I would never have passed the N hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nasytherr|pg||
nt|kemperg: must be good if the Israelis do|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: confirmed 5@s|pg||
nt|xenya: S might double again now?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  did South believe that the double was takeout, by a passed vulnerable hand, rather than just diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why would S bid 3@S? Vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  or was he just competing in diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 800 or 1100 depending on where they fight it out|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like 800, more if they bid 5@d|pg||
nt|idc: undo operator - i expect this is by E-W?|pg||
nt|paulg:  As 1@s is limited, no thoughts from West of a slam despite the perfect heart holding|pg||
nt|paulg:  we can see there is not much to this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Adam in a trance|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashing to 6?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Must discard @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arno Lindermann|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everybody|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ja - herzlich willkommen|pg||
nt|arno11: danke:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a sane contract at last|pg||
nt|lestergold: opps ahve to find a club or trump lead to beat 4 which is after all a fair contract vulnerable|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  i agree Germ|pg||
nt|santyclz: A fine "midnight swiss" preemptive jump overcall.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@C Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: string of relay bids i assume|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Gazilli cofirmed by spec|pg||
nt|kemperg: last train again|pg||
nt|po-s: or he thinks partner has hearts...|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i suggested pn bopard 12 7 imps to sweden who opened 1H with that 11 count reached 41h and made it |pg||
nt|yuval10: so instead of +6 they got -6|pg||
nt|davidb: great def vs 4H  in board 14  by NS in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: and N might pass? |pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S gagnent - les @C sont bloquées|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ah - non deux @C et switch atout|pg||
pc|c9|nt|puncher: no lead that great for west - diam doesn't cost|pg||
nt|paulg:  quite a few options for declarer to consider, more with the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is pass for me|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a better hand than he thought I believe|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT by E makes also here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C "good raise"|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, Sweden went down in the game on board 14|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this  might be 3 down, and if S Dbl 2 down, At least thats my guess|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: think N name is Fruscoloni|pg||
nt|lestergold: also leaves more space when there is a misfit as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dunno, Italian names ain't my strongest point|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a @D to the Ace - and you pay 1430|pg||
nt|mamos: a MAKING Slam is about guessing DiaMONDS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me very optimistic with 4@d|pg||
nt|po-s: did 4s show a minimum?|pg||
nt|mamos: this is mean|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an excellent slasm and no asttempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|mamos: i heart was lead which definitely helped :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Israelis gained their swing by the excellent bidding to 6@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: scary, @CK on side but he doesnt know|pg||
nt|xenya: too tricky for me, all that -- i would have just bid 2@H as S at my second turn|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dagold: and 800 available here|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Adam Mesbur is considering bad trump break, eliminations and entries to dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: HI Arno|pg||
nt|mamos: oh thats very ill disciplined|pg||
nt|davidstern: Making me ill anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: so do you lead your singleton or you ace |pg||
nt|kemperg: S knows that N can bid very lightly|pg||
nt|mamos: i m ight care to take issue with "fine"|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: my ps always lead from Kx after I do that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then you're not getting into the spirit of the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Confusing it with bridge or something like that.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont agree with just the one trick but maybe they dont mind four-figure penalties|pg||
nt|kemperg: @CQ may win the trick|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer adopted what I thought was the right line in 6@S on our earlier board - Diamond ruff cash top Club cross to hand and played Club|pg||
nt|kemperg: he did|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jameslee 2: Q@S = first choice 50% finnesse |pg||
nt|sybarra: *your |pg||
nt|sybarra: if only hts behaved!|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, shaky but easily making|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no 6s inevitable|pg||
nt|yuval10: assuming you play natural system, do you think North's hand worth a 1@h opening and 2@s rebid ( over a supposed 1NT ) , or is it 1@s and then 4@h for you?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Je pense que Nord aurait pu déclarer 3@s  pour montrer ses 6 cartes |pg||
pc|d2|nt|dagold: best defence|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C an excellent contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well we all know clubs vanished as a suit many years ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably need to start clubs to try to find close to 9|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but choing to rong player as the lead makes him all the rest @H |pg||
nt|bg: not easy has to duck next heart and play W for a doubleton dia honor|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: squeezzed on 3 suits lets see how he discards |pg||
nt|kemperg: do you have @HK?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, That is also a common thing. When one hand is extreamy strong and the other one is week you way to often get the strong hands suit as trumph. But this time is was a NT hand ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: (the strong one) so then they should have found the right trumph I think|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s montrait des @hs|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mamos: AND OF COURSE ABOUT wEST GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO GUESS WRONG|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@h makes now:)|pg||
nt|ritong: je suppose|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  he may lead a diamond up at trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: where is this going?|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer needs to plan for ten tricks, give up club and two hearts and hope spade finesse is working|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec told me 2@S forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: Club of course disappears|pg||
nt|peachy: if hearts were splitting|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is going to have difficult |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sommer: ..I think!|pg||
nt|sommer: @CQ would be a great falsecard form E!:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and she did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kinda torteous|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @C  K or the other 2?|pg||
nt|kemperg: He thinks his hand too strong for 2@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cameron_1: he must have run it|pg||
nt|paulg:  or not.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@S I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: overboard it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a good contract even if spade behave club also have to bhave for this to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N cant make either a scards lie|pg||
nt|mamos: oops sorry  shhh|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|newmoon: maybe -4 a'la'gib|pg||
nt|xenya: that might have got us too high -- but now it's EW who seem to be overboard|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you south will come under pressure on the run of tghe clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 2@D, 6@C and @S in NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agreed, but it probably wouldn't have been 45 years ago.|pg||
nt|lestergold: may have devlaued the K@s altho i think this is poor policy against preemptd at fave vul when opps rarely have a decent suit|pg||
nt|kemperg: now we'l see:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  After 1@s i would bid 3@h on rimsteds hand |pg||
mc|12|nt|sommer: nooo|pg||
nt|po-s: would South rebid hearts with a singleton?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: oui |pg||
nt|ritong: et effectivement, 3SA sans arret @c avec 6@s, c est curieux|pg||
nt|ritong: il a peut etre un probleme de digestion avec les finales 30 et 90|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: d autant que partenaire pourrait avoir 2 @s  mais là le flanc a dérapé pour une fois|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Lhuissier was explaining that 3@c was singelton @s with 5@d-4@c or possibly bad 6@d-(3)4@c|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ceci explique cela|pg||
nt|ritong: tres sophistiqué|pg||
nt|hawe45: Il n´exsiste pas une couleur @S chez Nord - ou Est doit prendre cette levée...|pg||

nt|paulg:  you have a sinking feeling with contracts like this .. taken three failing finesses and you know that there was a winning line somewhere|pg||
nt|puncher: likely to be flat though|pg||

nt|puncher: ahh|pg||

nt|lestergold: its an excellent 6@c|pg||
nt|bg: also E can count 15 points in N hand may hot have dia Q|pg||
nt|po-s: these last trains may cuse a problem if you actually have a control instead of a rain|pg||
nt|po-s: train|pg||
nt|ritong: the guy doubled, does not need a degree to place him with @s Hxxx|pg||
nt|ritong: ce garçon est un roc|pg||
nt|chmitty: sage :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: with splitted @d honours and @h4-1, they can defeat 5@h|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 5 vanished|pg||
nt|ritong: il a manoeuvré très adroitement sur les deux coups chers|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Rosen also bid 3@d but tried 3N over 3@h, probably figuring he had suggested doubt|pg||
nt|xenya: and another quiet board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  You would just go with the Director's ruling?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: NS may overreach here with cards lying badly|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is takeout without spades, a method popular in Europe|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why have a director. Just assume the opponents are not cheating and accept what happens|pg||
nt|paulg:  this was a case of misinformation where a splinter was not alerted but said to be natural|pg||
nt|paulg:  unsurprisingly this caused the opponents not to appreciate their fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the lead you can afford a loser in every suit, so some may play the @hA first|pg||
nt|puncher: things could get interesting now|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c from Walker?|pg||
nt|puncher: yes at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: even withe 4/1 club break it looks pretty good|pg||
nt|sybarra: a makeable 3 nt,  not sure all will get there |pg||
nt|bg: EW playing 2 of a major reasonable hand and 2 Dia opening to show weak two in a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: and yes they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|kemperg: cricket?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think I am right Yuval, this Israel team won the jrs competitiion  at the Olympiad in Philly|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: le fils de son talentueux père|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dagold: Espen would be able to bid if he was in the balancing seat here|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H=@S no doubt|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when eight tricks is the limit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thayare juniors Mike - what you suggest comes with age and experience|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: don't know what happened; somehow i opened the wrong deal. Sorry about tha|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Nice stop:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  As cards lie:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: By opening strange with 1 NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes they did|pg||
nt|sharkey: They have picked up 23 IMPs on the first 3 boards this half|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're the reigning world champions|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: we didnt cash our tricks Er? |pg||
nt|hawe45: Nu er jeg der|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW has gone down some slams today|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will see if they bid another|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep - a rout|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, I dont use it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slam needs 2 out of 3 finesses, so only 50% ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@S or 2@C now ?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: was 1@s a muddy the waters bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this will get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now might go overboard|pg||
nt|mamos: 2Nt presumanbly  now|pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer like we play them|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to reach tho|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, swede as I am I offcurse hold my thumbs hard for sweden, But I must say Israel has played extreamly solid the hole way and also in this match|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N =@S?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Dire 3@d ça n'est pas pour dire 4@s ensuite normalement ...|pg||
nt|ritong: ça me semble excessivement discipliné, dans le contexte|pg||
nt|chmitty: Bon Jean-Paul, c'est scoré maintenant|pg||
nt|ritong: il sont menés a la mi temps et on deux coups de trafalgar|pg||
nt|ritong: ont*|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: je m'y attendais  :(|pg||
nt|ritong: c est sûrement @dVxx qui lui a déplu|pg||
nt|ritong: il y a bien entendu quatre pedantes de tête|pg||
nt|ritong: perdantes:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pedant... - interessant|pg||
nt|chmitty: je ne pense pas qu'Est ait dit son dernier mot|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: une donne favorable pour NS   car 4 @d gagnent sauf sur entame atout|pg||
nt|ritong: alors la, je sais de quoi je parle:)|pg||
nt|ritong: en matière de pédantisme, je ne crains personne|pg||
nt|hawe45: Meme avec entame atout|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: exact le @c s 'enva|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not that 1N rates to make on this layout |pg||
nt|paulg:  this could be a gain as I think 4@h is more Carroll's style|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|rich89: is 1@s nat?|pg||
nt|rich89: y..|pg||
nt|kemperg: X was @S I think, good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45: går i lobby nu|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why would W bid 2@C, would bid 2@H for transfer and then 3@H or 4@D.|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamond lead may give 9th  immediately|pg||
nt|mamos: or Spade for that matter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Ill stop after this one|pg||
nt|arno11: W cld make 3 NT on a @D lead but......|pg||
nt|the saint: Can just ruff two hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|the saint: 3N is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this one is a sound slam 8 card fit combined 32 points control rich hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:(|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe   |pg||
nt|peachy: To answer kibitzers, http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: np|pg||
nt|sommer: the primary reason for the finesse - as I see it - is that @CQ could be very worng from Q9, IF S has 5c @C!|pg||
nt|kemperg: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Ernst, But can you in any way get the result in when they have played it so the IMP:s will be right ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so thay are definatly worth winning if the win|pg||
nt|ahalim: !NT shows @S's I think|pg||
nt|hawe45: Une carte noire en tout cas|pg||
nt|ritong: non, ce que je veux dire, c est que dans ce contexte, nord dit 4@s direct et compte les blessés éventuels a la fin de la donne|pg||
nt|bridgek: 2C may help them|pg||
nt|bobholl: is he worth 3@D now ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cameron_1: pretty chunky 2N overcall not sure with two tens it was right|pg||
nt|dagold: dangerous in the middle of a live auction, mainly because partner will expect more|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S likely shows exactly 3 cards |pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass by s shows ...|pg||
nt|xenya: safe contract :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like playing bridge with or against Philadelphia lawyers|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hans is speaking to Roland I am sure,  not mind all |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 'brilliant dummy'|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards spitting at N/S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E hoping the club suit comes in |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: East shaking his head|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  West does not have an easy lead |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Nor the next time he gets in|pg||
nt|paulg:  and may feel the pressure throughout the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  might lead small club|pg||
nt|paulg:  although North's actions suggest the minors|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But @H lead is obvious I think|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Partner could easily have the ten|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he is thinking then Anderson now knows where everything is|pg||
nt|sybarra: was he smiling when he said that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Israel had a very difficult start |pg||
nt|sybarra: they lost first match big|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: well em|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 1N raptor on N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south was worth 4@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: leads also to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: becoming dizzy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wrongly directed with the ace of the 4th suit.  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: anything home and hosed|pg||
nt|yuval10: not that big...17:13 to the schools team|pg||
nt|ahalim: 1@S is the forcing NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Not a conclusion you really can draw against Short or Walker|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is going down two, a good save against 4@s or 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: we try to make Erwin laugh as commentators |pg||
nt|arno11: W shld probaby act over 1@S  e.g. with 1NT|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if East opens, nothing will stop W|pg||
nt|mamos: and North has no reason to go on|pg||
nt|mamos: except the enthuisiasm of youth and confidence in partner's declarer play|pg||
nt|sybarra: and why not? |pg||
nt|mamos: both NS have nice hands 14 points but good tricks and shape |pg||
nt|yuval10: then went on a tear of 20's|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Should be an easy make|pg||
nt|dagold: Either ruff two hearts in dummy or set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: depending on the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has enuf to make anotyher move|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have not been beaten up yet |pg||
nt|bg: I would have bid 3nt with S hand after two hearts too close to only bid 2nt North might easily have passed 2nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 45 minutes: USA vs Israel Juniors|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it looks like 6 @s will depend on !3-2 and a @d finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: afraid of 4-1/5-0|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u its easy for teh defence to help declarer on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match in about 45 minutes is USA v Denmark|pg||
nt|lestergold: jx @d becomes big when pasrtner has reversed and rebid @ds |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not many pauirs even at open level would find 6@d|pg||
nt|kemperg: girls in OR have 1 disaster after the other|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps after anugly 1N opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes doubling 3@h into game was not a very good shot|pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@D has a chance|pg||
nt|bridgek: well done|pg||
nt|milton_se: nicely undertaken|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: the lead is easy but what next?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another high heart declarer will surely duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence have to be extremely careful not to open @ds for example|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes the defence shd be passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u a @d at trick 2 works|pg||
nt|the saint: West is unlimited. You have a maximum pass so partner can't go overboard. Bid 3C to show support and develop the auction|pg||
nt|mamos: Germany need something alittle more exciting if they are going to get back some imps|pg||
nt|andreasw:  50% is more then enough for juniors:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that will not work. Sp lets see if they stop in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|yuval10: took 1st place somewhere towards the end of the first day and never looked back|pg||
nt|bobholl: very well !! :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding, fast board|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: Ortega, keeps leading spade honors |pg||
nt|gowdy: now the 3 @S tricks are blocked|pg||
nt|sybarra: then ou get a club lead and all is well |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 8 ever 9 never here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well that takes care of that|pg||
nt|lestergold: board 4 holding 4 to the J|pg||
nt|kemperg: and giving away a spade trick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: ruff hearts|pg||
nt|arno11: what wld X show for you guys after 1@D-X-1@S ?|pg||
nt|xenya: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|yuval10: estimated score now is 12:9 Sweden, as 2@d gone for 500|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Why is the 1nt so wierd:)?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a lot of strong no-trump plyaers open 1NT on any 5332 shape|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@c is an improvising bid from W it seem|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = multi - 2@H pass/correct, 2NT strong, 3@H tranfer, |pg||
nt|yuval10: normal to bid 4@d to show strength and fit @s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Thanks Ernst, When will they play board 1 then? At the end or as soon as they get the board ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: double dummy you can make all 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: le danger serait une défense fantôme à 5 @d  mais c est peu probable|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course, playing 4-card majors makes it more difficult for East|pg||
nt|mamos: no  chnce for this contract with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a friendly lay out|pg||
nt|lestergold: stes up 2@d tricvks to go with 2 @hs and a @s|pg||
nt|peachy: Th French team also has wnjoyed sucess in past tournaments|pg||
nt|hawe45: You must add @C Queen third|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: at the end|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: poor play by declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: if that what happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: but undone|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats inexperience|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was the rush hearts were likely to be continued|pg||
nt|mamos: yes @hK looks wrong at Trick 1    or 2    and defence just has enough tricks to defeat now|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 3NT was ever making realistically  |pg||
nt|lestergold: it tkaes careful defence to beat thjis if declarer ducks two rounds of hearts i|pg||
nt|ahalim: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: more to the point defence have 6 tricks to come now altogether|pg||
nt|mamos: ive always thought thee should be a new card in the bidding box  "Undo"   could I try that one again ::)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp tjat West has shown his 20HCP and good @S-support, so he can stop in 4@S - but he has the @D-cue, so..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|puncher: yes 4@C was enough to not allow them to untangle their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c might be taken as weak|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: bd 2 paid off for the dutch kids |pg||
nt|sybarra: aka jrs|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes, my point was they had a shakey start (for them)|pg||
nt|davidb: NS  migth bid 3NT in OR in this board !  or at least 3D|pg||
nt|yuval10: this board should also be a good one for Israel|pg||
nt|yuval10: as 3@d is laydown|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has shown a hand worth a game try on an uncontested auction of 1@s 2@s which would ne an acceptNCE WITH SOUTH'SHAND|pg||
nt|the saint: 2H sets up a game force|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  but I'm surprised that West passed when he has a normal 4@h call|pg||
nt|puncher: Other room are currrently playing 5@C doubled so a few imps to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson pretty sure that the ace of clubs is onside given the spade return|pg||
nt|the saint: So 3C can't be passed|pg||
nt|the saint: Many also use a lebensohl type relay in this position to cater for the weak hands|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2nt forces 3C  so 3 C is strong|pg||
nt|peachy: in U25|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: looks like 1 down, maybe 2 -- but it won't make|pg||
nt|sybarra: where would he rather be 6 @C?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: probably a push if S opens 1N in the other room as well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you try to ruff down the @cQ arent you giving up on the finesse?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not open 1NT when holding AQ10xx in a major but I play a weak NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes / I see|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of imps in the lead now|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong red !q in East|pg||
nt|ahalim: but in practice you may go down in 6 on a @C lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: you WILL go down, no possible way to figure the @d's out|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Arifin? You got me? How are you going to make that ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: but perhaps the 4@c bid will make N lead something else|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play  aow on the lead and let W be high on @sQ... Probably making|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  being told that 13 points is a strong opening bid :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: best by E|pg||
nt|pelu: same bidding over 2NT in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: well so does 6@S -- on this layout|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: Must be discussed for every pair|pg||
nt|m_niemi: West passes some times forcing bids, so East didn't want to risk anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: but would bid 3@c with a minimum and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|gowdy: "Ingberman" in north america|pg||
nt|lestergold: lower range of 3@c is suely no9t strong|pg||
nt|the saint: Hence why Ingberman/Blackout is played to allow a direct 3C to show values|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless partnership agrees that 2n only shows a minimum|pg||
nt|mikael_w: A and K@d I think is best now|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he leads a @H from  S |pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, same thing. @h to K and @h back to A and @dA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gowdy: for me penalty  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: have to dash folks but p[lenty of you cu later|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the  @d auction was ridiculous|pg||
nt|kemperg: hook, hook, hook, claim|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dagold: technically he should cash the diamond Ace here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play low....|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suppose West opens 1@h and East responds 1@s, what does West rebid?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|puncher: WBU still 30 or so ahead of England, and Wales now in the 25 zone against N Ireland|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the hand was bid rather well considering how light n/s open|pg||
nt|ritong: clean living:)|pg||
nt|xenya: no problems in 6 -- 4 is different|pg||
nt|ahalim: my grandma wd have bid 6 and finesse everything in sight|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: however this auction points to the ned for a look at theirbidding methods|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ingberman is over reverses but some have extended it to 2-level jump shifts by opener as well.|pg||
nt|the saint: It is definitely worth playing it in these positions too|pg||
nt|sybarra: well see......thats why you bid it |pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks John!|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks John|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cash @H first|pg||
nt|sybarra: Neth girls lead France 38/17|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2: EW will be happy to see flat hands after those huge swings in the beginning, they know they dont need more imps because the VP scale stops at 25 vp for 37 imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: trying never costs :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|newmoon: he heard u|pg||
nt|jcomyn: love this story = Paddy the Irishman, Paddy the englishmasn and paddy the scotsman attended a lecture on extremes. Paddy the englishman asked what the opposite of sadness was - ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: elation, he said. Paddy the scotsman asked the opposite of joy was - sadness he said. Paddy the Irishman asjed the oppoite of Woe - said Giddyup|pg||
nt|kemperg: as was the 3@D on 5|pg||
nt|mikael_w: it diddnt matter if they cashed the @h first|pg||
nt|yuval10: so he must play @d now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andreasw:  I would almost Allways open 1nt on W hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: maybe S dont know who has the last @d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mikael_w: ohhhh :(|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: u cant balance angels on pinheads good trumps and a  couple of cards must be enuf|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c2|pc|h9|nt|puncher: So Wales can't do much more, but England might perk up - just a case of whether they can do enough or not|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
nt|pelu: best to play @C now to get some count|pg||
nt|yuval10: South took a view that declarer doesn't have 4 @h's|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I think the slam is a little less then 50%. But I also remember when I was a junior. And this slam would be bid even if you could see all the cards before bidding :)|pg||
nt|pelu: give East @DQ and not @Hq - and we all would say: missed lay down slam :):)|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR West took the @D-finess in trick 2??|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: He looks like Rodin's thinker now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think its a big chanse/risk this slam will be bid in all 4 tables, but lets se|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|nt|santyclz: It can't be a winning strategy in the long run to allow your opps to play 1 level contracts unless you know they (and you) have no fit.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a stiff i meant to stay|pg||
nt|mamos: The bridge table can be a lonely place when things go badly and get worse and worse and worse|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yuval10: i wonder if 2@c was invitational or GF, doesn't look so likely that South will accept an invitation so quickly with his hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|the saint: A chance for Belgium to get a few back|pg||
nt|jcomyn: claim|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suppose so but 1@h followed by 2@d sounds like an unbalanced hand|pg||

nt|paulg:  unfortunately the crash meant that our operator could not catch up with the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  not Alan's fault of course, but unfortunate on an interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Operation misfit :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well only 8 tricks at that point but defence is under a lot of pressure omn the run of spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but what shall W return when only minors left?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compliments to the players, they are playing at a fast pace:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good result for Austria(Österreich)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Another bad minor-break here|pg||
nt|santyclz: You also need to discuss what a jump shift forces to, game? 4 of a minor?  Both are used.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finns made 4@h in OR bd 23|pg||
nt|gowdy: on the muli hand  NS had a good auction to 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: nine tricks are easy now so North was obviously   correct :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: we all have that experience|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 78@d auction when south rebid 3@d after the 1H response north had AKxx of spades which she should have showb rather than raise to 4@ds with a low doubleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Tofte telling Lee he almost finessed in @c as Lee ducked so quickly|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and here|pg||
nt|po-s: doesn´t everybody nowadays play 2C as puppet to 2D?|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a nice slam hand|pg||
nt|davidb: playin J &10 shows 2  J 10X  -J& x|pg||
nt|ahalim: playing for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: was that a safe line?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: un  4@s  qui me semble bateau|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Nederste linje med bl. a. grønne firkanter, ses kun halvt. Kan jeg rykke noget|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am happy it is only practice :) rooting for the dutch|pg||
mb|1D|an|normally 5+!D|nt|paulg:  Fight between North and East here|pg||
nt|paulg:  NS may bid 4@s if Matheson supports in competition|pg||
nt|lestergold: what do u do with 8 spades vul but only one high card and not in spaxdes?|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   this is where I have results |pg||
nt|tomi2: other table already finished, that is not so seldom with Hop-Helmich playing :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner wopuld then  have rebid 3N whioch would have ended the auction|pg||
nt|santyclz: Echo.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 10 points and 4 @d East might raise 2@d to 3@d|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: il ne va rien se passer sur celle ci|pg||
mb|1S|nt|2hplus4: E would like to look for @H fit and play in 3@C Can he achieve that?|pg||
nt|gowdy: will west be quite here|pg||
nt|gowdy: I think not|pg||
nt|mamos: NS can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is W thinking he should get in?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west is a she and yes she is thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty :)  didnt know a "she"|pg||
nt|bg: with S I like a 4 dia splinter firstly you have the single dia but you should also promise not ot have two club losers thus on this hand N could move with confidance but now has a ...|pg||
nt|bg: problem with his club holding|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 13|pg||
nt|jcomyn: alright be like that - anyway i think it is funny|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H = 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: If NT here, and a @H lead... is the timing out now?|pg||
nt|paulg:  upgrade from Walker, nice intermediates|pg||
nt|puncher: an unlikely 6@D here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be fun |pg||
nt|lestergold: i would open 3@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have jammed them up a bid  now a free ride really |pg||
nt|mamos: i prefer to bid my Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: 21-19 points   for this one looks less exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry guys, I'm almost faling asleep with the speed at this table|pg||
nt|mamos: did North really pass??? surely 1NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Took the middle road between 3@h and 4@c and went directly to 4@h.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East acts: flush in @d|pg||
nt|bg: W double another ambiguous bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @C in tempo ...pls|pg||
nt|davidstern: Everyone happy with 4@S bid?|pg||
nt|bg: not I|pg||
nt|davidstern: Im not a fan - too big a chance of hearts, more in spades and other things|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am so sure of the splinter with that ht holding,  but can understand it |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: the 4@S bid was alerted on both sides maybe not the common 4@S?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Im not interested in slam but with boss suit.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i pass as N|pg||
nt|sommer: a gerber 3@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: close|pg||
nt|sommer: ..they play it standard|pg||
nt|po-s: they´ll learn...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord another one but hardly bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Obviously not|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think most cannot do that these days, playing 2@c.... 3@c as game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think most british players i know would if pard say bids 3n u can play 4@s with confidence|pg||
nt|sybarra: or use:  http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   Competitie (left), then White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 4@s  that much  -- it depends on what you agree about splinters|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid 4@C if he has a chance|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: my agreements with splinters are may be unique, but I dont have xxx (or jxxxxx) in an outside suit |pg||
nt|davidstern: If 5@S asks south to bid six with club control I would have perhaps tried that|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyone understand the double of 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: "cards" ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 5 @C if you want  |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Even if you hold your thumbs for Israel you must feel better that Fisher makes the finess. In the long run he will make alot of IMP:s doing that|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably some imps back to Israel here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: or correction. He will lose alot less IMP:s doing that|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s = in the OR is a very good score|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction in the OR is a little surprising after WEst overcalled|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the alerts should be moved - 1@C and 1@H are alerted|pg||
nt|pelu: pass and 1NT naturel|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|mamos: surprising that East let NS play 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Rodin is back again|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: bold but sensible double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, in that case n-s weren't robbed.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3@c shows a fit so Short might be tempted to bid on|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was thinking more of getting to the better game|pg||
nt|paulg:  which is probably 5@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime will just bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East will be on the spot ... and the one thinking now|pg||
nt|mamos: looks a very ordinary 3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Problem is, that when you bid with this West-hand - partner will bring you too high|pg||
nt|arno11: 6 in a minor possible here but difficult to make....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w are not too flush here in a high level club contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Pass alerted by east, not by west|pg||
nt|pelu: S was on the france junior gold-team in 2009 (Brasov) - and 2 x spangenberg on NL-girls in 2007 - Silver - so we have real topclass here!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho i would nevber have jumped to 3@d with such an awful suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think both of them take some blame for that auction|pg||
nt|sommer: many Danes play Gerber up-side -down|pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer(Walsh?)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Have to be careful not to get overboard on this one.|pg||
nt|kemperg: p and I use it for weak hands, with inv+ we use transters|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i don't think everyone would've accept the invitation with South's hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1H = @s ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, my guess is 6@c even if 6 NT will do as well|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C slams some times hard to find...|pg||
nt|sybarra: N thinking about this  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  but West's pass is deafening|pg||
nt|sybarra: ehaa....every hand an adventure!|pg||
nt|mamos: West had better not think she has defence|pg||
nt|bg: The doudle is cards vut as happened in last match partner thought otherwise and allowed -590 vs makinf game themselves|pg||
nt|bg: double|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Israel NPC reaches for more heart medicine?|pg||
nt|peachy: this looks like transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Excellent grand slam in a balck suit here as long as they promise not to lead diamonds :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd prefer to double with the North hand rather than introduce that club suit, although it would complicate things later on|pg||
nt|paulg:  South a little fixed now and may just raise to 4@c|pg||
nt|puncher: hand for the bad 2N for south - to show a minimum opener with 6 diams|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think 3@h is likely with nothing in hearts when his partner has failed to double|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might miss 4 @H though Mike?|pg||
nt|mamos: op????|pg||
nt|mamos: undoo??|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh thats better|pg||
nt|m_niemi: his shape is good suit texture not so good|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4 th suit forcing 2@D |pg||
nt|jcomyn: very odd|pg||
nt|kemperg: think it is|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass as North|pg||
nt|peachy: It is a current trend, to use transfer bids in a lot of sequences|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N was the better choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know 1NT here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dekkers and Robert very surprised the tray came back without further bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: must be 4/5+|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 1NT hearts and diamonds yes|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like 5 IMPs for Israel|pg||
nt|mamos: so this should be a gain for Israel|pg||
nt|milton_se: no surprise, Brink couldn-t resist|pg||
nt|bridgek: dbl of 2C would be penalty on spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: South checking cards re the club bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: internet problems at hotel folks, sorry for breaks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3@s it might not have been very easy for e/wto reach this meakeable game|pg||
nt|mamos: NORTH 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!|pg||
nt|mamos: too late he dropped dead :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may have dropped dead on this hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: mee too|pg||
nt|kemperg: mee too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still might work out well|pg||
nt|lestergold: my principle is simple a jump rebid always guarantees a suit with no more than one loser except in very exceptional circumstances when u are really fixed for any altgernative|pg||
nt|mamos: Im told 4-6 H+D|pg||
nt|sommer: Bergen:)|pg||
nt|sommer: sryyyyyyyyyyyy Roland for the G word:(..mistypo|pg||
nt|kemperg: many Dutch play 2N nv|pg||
nt|kemperg: inv+|pg||
nt|yuval10: though kibitzers suggest that NS' style of play is to invite with very "heavy" hands|pg||
nt|chmitty: 11 levées probables|pg||
nt|milton_se: but why bid again in the N seat with a passed pard?|pg||
nt|bobholl: w regretiing his X i guess but it worked well :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Brink shaking his head...|pg||
mb|d!|nt|vugraphzzc: rewiring tomorrow morning so should be back to normal|pg||
nt|dagold: unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: 9 tricks only, it seems on a @H lead, else 11|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like a bidding missunderstanding |pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 3N showed or was thought to show 4/4 M or something?|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway another 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|mamos: or Imight misss a nice safe Spade part-score|pg||
nt|mamos: noooo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: try for a 5/3 fit |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if he pushes to 3nt or not |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4s a good xcontract|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H was minimum, 4 enough|pg||
nt|santyclz: That solved that problem, I was worried about a 4@c cue bid.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 losers, better not|pg||
nt|andreasw:  He Might...:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Transfer?|pg||
nt|bridgek: Looking for an excuse to bis again, |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: East will be relieved that west has four small hearts |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C puppet?|pg||
nt|newmoon: even so, 3N T a sign-off|pg||
nt|dagold: have seen 3N played as 4/4 majors|pg||
nt|dagold: in that structure 3@h= spades or no major|pg||
nt|newmoon: if 3@D = 1 or both 4xmajor, 4@D would ask for 4M|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT could be 3=3-4-3 hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 5 more imps to England on 21 for 620 to NI and 800 to England|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not sure of the wisdom of that|pg||
nt|paulg:  if the clubs were breaking then it would need accurate defence to beat 3NT, but when they are 3-1 Walker does not have the tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing our operator lost the play with the crash of the connection, always difficult in these circumstances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What causes all these crashes?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Poor phone connection?|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can imagine that everyone except Short taking their time on this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be the wifi in the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problems this weekend have all been in the closed room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that should be a consideration in future when considering venues|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect the signal strength is not great in that area of the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Part of the problem is the devolved nature of the adminstrators|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bridge Great Britain relies on the home unions|pg||
nt|paulg:  The home union typically asks a district to run the event|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but surely an audience of over 1000 should be considered|pg||
nt|paulg:  and each district ends up running an event every seven or eight years, so never has the experience|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not write it down and pass on the experience gained?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Because there is no-one co-ordinating it all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So all bridge in Britain is as badly run as the SBU?|pg||
nt|paulg:  he does not need two diamond finesses, but has the entries for them anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: matheson says should be stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if I bid spades, I would then bid hts|pg||
nt|sybarra: if bidding the same |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i do not like this 1N opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|kemperg: soory 6 in N|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 more to Israel on 3, when EW slightly overbid to 3N in the other room (1@S by S -2 here) |pg||
nt|bridgek: bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|arno11: good idea to stay in 3N...|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite  but my juniors when I was captain bid  but if you don;t think you can buy the hand don;t give free information|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - double-dummy 6 NT is rather dold|pg||
nt|hawe45: cold|pg||
nt|davidstern: Stripe tailed double|pg||
nt|mamos: 1280  is an "interesting score"|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it was XX |pg||
nt|davidstern: Just so you know 120+120+120+120+50+50+200+200|pg||
nt|davidstern: +300 for game =1280|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4@S was something like 0+15 HCP with 5card spade and no interest in slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: why dbl in S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what s woiuld have bid if e passes|pg||
nt|mamos: I think 2@D by North might have been wiser :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: If it would've promised 6@d's, north would've bid 2@d I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: trf to 4@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4NT quant.|pg||
nt|yuval10: and South should accept|pg||
nt|yuval10: as he showed 20-21|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so now a quant with 5 or 6 @c ?|pg||
nt|davidb: can  we have explanations ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT is 20-21|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT trf|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps S shud cue instead of 4@C|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4NT quantitive|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@c will be to play|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think N has bid the hand well|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: just claims 11 |pg||
nt|xenya: a contract to my taste|pg||
nt|hawe45: Best lead according to the bidding|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice try here|pg||
nt|kemperg: French captain confirms 4-6|pg||
nt|pelu: so prob 9+ red cards with longer @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: wow the israelis are human after all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They play canapÃ© - but not both of them|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: variation of standards with overcalls e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  might bid 6@c now|pg||
nt|mamos: EW more likely to make game in Spades than Hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have two suits with all ur points in them as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i hope this gets whacked and defended properly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes he did |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 quick tricks need a 9 th |pg||
nt|sybarra: vul,  probably tempting |pg||
nt|jcomyn: spose he thought n had something for 1nt|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: French girls captain|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Laura asking about French weak 2 openings|pg||
nt|mamos: either pass is some forget or a little unwise opposita partner who passed originally|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I'll ask the players after the board|pg||
nt|ritong: voyons ça|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzag: not 100% about the bidding, just took over|pg||
nt|the saint: West doesn't have a big enough club fit to justify 4C|pg||
nt|lestergold: at equal vul this is ridiculous|pg||
nt|m_niemi: W should have 4 card support|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H+1@S+@C+1@D=8|pg||
nt|bg: anthing but a club will make it hard to find 9th trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C in bad position for the Q@C |pg||
nt|xenya: interesting double of 3N in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ouchhhh|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Looks like -1:(|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahalim: asking for a @D lead  ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: And so did S|pg||
nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Does this auction call for the lead of the highest card in your hand?  Lindsay doesn't think so.|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@d is probably keycard blackwood (kickback)|pg||
nt|kemperg: I have a younger partner, so I use them a lot|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR also in 7@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: price of lack of discipline|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, it really starts to look tough for sweden now when board 16 was no income|pg||
nt|ritong: j avoue ne pas visualiser l affaire directement|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: pas encore vu la 11 ème levée|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  with 4NT showing 2 keycards and no @cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i must admit that I thought this was the stronger form of weak raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East had already told his cards, so why bid 5@c|pg||
nt|santyclz: or HHx with Hx in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kemperg: No @D cue, always end in4|pg||
nt|santyclz: One would assume - and might make 5 anyway;.|pg||
nt|chmitty: voyons si le flanc peut casser le squeeze @h@c|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pitiful:  9 or 10 tricks looks likely here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: sime gave adam stronger version|pg||
nt|tomi2: he was on lead himself|pg||
nt|mamos: a little surprised tht North has sold out to 3@h|pg||
nt|davidb: nice bidding . 12 tricks |pg||
pc|s2|nt|puncher: seems I've missed some excitement!|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S Q saves the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: K telling her partner something?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and dats dat|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has to make this one |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dagold: this is ok on careful play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: That is the problem with 3@C |pg||
nt|puncher: the dodgy connections are infectious|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short knows that it is on the club finesse, but his club intermediates are good.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the cards are very friendly and every chance of a gain|pg||
nt|paulg:  but eleven tricks nevertheless|pg||
nt|lestergold: to m ake a voluntury call holding no more than 3 to the K and a stiff in pard's other suit is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|the saint: Ducked?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should duck the @S JIng|pg||
pc|c3|nt|puncher: this will be a fortunate make for scotland but we've all been in worse :)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has eight tricks here now   can he find a ninth?|pg||
nt|po-s: North did have a heavy hand|pg||
nt|mamos: thats seven tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  King|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C now is best|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jameslee 2: rule of 7 he duck 1 @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: help from opps|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: no down 1 in toptricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: I think South might have just bid 5@C over 3@C since it would be a picture raise|pg||
nt|garnetts: Since the clubs break maybe lose 2 imps to 4@S making five |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps not everyone, but we certainly have|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may not have been the greatest duck in history|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho it has grosvenor elements about it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Aflac...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N want's to retain trump control|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N expects p not to have trumps anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so that way ducking wouldn't cost anything|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bad breaks in the majors are gong to make the play tricky|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, are you that sure 1 NT will make ?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 35 minutes: Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @s8 and W will make|pg||
nt|ahalim: can make now|pg||
nt|lestergold: east hassnt promised 6 @cs|pg||
nt|bg: EW not on same wavelength |pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as spec notes - have you discussed with partner whether the pass of 4@Sxx by Eats suggests he wants to defend or nothing to say|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: not now|pg||
nt|sommer: 2NT GF mainly in DK|pg||
nt|mikael_w: just giva a @s away and 12 tricks are 100%|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kemperg: o yes still 1down|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive reviewed board 1 which i was late for and there was a 10 imp swing there when the dutvh giels here went off in 3n the french declarer made the correct technical play of cashing ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: the AK @s in case !q dropped and then fell back on the heart finesse which worked|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: a mon avis le déclarant va le casser lui même|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: maybe only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now trumps and this will go down a lot|pg||
nt|the saint: To be fair, one nation's juniors who I would certainly not expect to be reticent in the auction are the Finns!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most of the reticence has come from s.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he goes or a 50% position |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, NOW it sure will|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes :)|pg||
nt|ritong: voila qui est fait:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: seems like 2 club tricks and 2 diamonds from now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oops|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 (or even 12?) available here -- but EW could hardly achieve that  |pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: frankly, i don't see what he was trying to achieve with that lead -- remember that E had shown at least 4 spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: the dutgch girl here simply chose the losing spade finesse which happened to be wrong so that was not luck but incorrect card paly|pg||
nt|lestergold: so to be fair that swing was caused in this room in effect|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if he takes the A@d no matter|pg||
nt|kemperg: try a sqeeze|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually 5 clubhs a heasrt 2 @s and a @d is enuf|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pitiful:  3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ireland 161; Eng 160; Scot 153; WBU 152; NI 103|pg||
nt|lestergold: open 3@s and arent e/w pretty stuiffed up|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right - here we also comment to play @S first|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Maybe can win on an endplay?|pg||
nt|yuval10: she sry|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzag: sorry, missaw the first @d, south took the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: position is now correct, but north on lead with @dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: makes then|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no endplay, Grönkvist shrugged and conceded down 1.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|m_niemi: -6!|pg||
nt|davidb: 12 tricks  100 %|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|newmoon: interesting would been a @C back after ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so, in a sense, they did quite well|pg||
nt|mamos: that was odd|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: then only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe my prediction of 9 was a little double dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it is always easier when you see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|newmoon: and another @D|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: he can exit with a high club and if that is ducked passively|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Perhaps he was thinking that west had needed a @S stop and was hoping for 4441 @s distribution.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes sorry i had been late|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|puncher: Short feeling happier now|pg||
nt|the saint: Only -3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: a real horror for the German team -- the'd better wipe it out of their minds as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|tomi2: in amsterdam the comming rounds start very fast, you get the chance to make it better very soon. 6 matches a day...|pg||
nt|mamos: next :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but after a small @d from S its not clear how to play. And I have seen worse thing happend then 1 NT going down on this board even after @dA on @dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Three of the four were in the Israeli gold medal team at the World Championships in Philadelphia last October. Only Dror Padon (playing in the other room) was not. For France, only ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lhuissier and Robert were in the silver medal team then|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hawe45: Nice squeeze againt East now|pg||
nt|kemperg: W bought it|pg||
nt|lestergold: im syre peter u would not have missed a textbook precaution like that!|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: such hands aRE VERY INSTRUCTIVE FOR THE LESS EXPERT SPECTATORS|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorrycaps lock|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I confirmed with S about the 1NT overcall: it indeed showed 4@h/6+@d's|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzag: would have been interesting if north exited with @sT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: dont see why youd play K if you wanted to ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 25 also 2@H reopen by N and pass by S|pg||

nt|vugraphzzc: working hard to get all tables up and running|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry you had to deal with all that|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently the 2@H opening shows a weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: put it another way god didnt deal me 8 in the master suit to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - so far South´s risky bid has been a help for opps|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam in the offing? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid game?|pg||
nt|tomi2: north can open this hand 2@C if he feels he needs to do somethingk|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is 10-14 with 6+@C and no 4 card major in their system|pg||
nt|kemperg: seen that, but I believe more bidding space with inv+|pg||
nt|ahalim: 6NT by N safest and best contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@c is their balance opening|pg||
nt|ritong: double looks clearcut|pg||
nt|chmitty: à dexu jeux c'est un excellent chelem|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Undo?  (Ihope)|pg||
nt|paulg:  they bid the slam because Walker showed a huge club raise in the context of passing over 2@h|pg||
nt|puncher: But unfortunately looks like 4@H made on board 5 in the other room - it was a spade lead and then a club switch|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Short expected a bit more?|pg||
nt|bg: E should jump to 4 hearts right away not likely to miss anything since pard passed|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a big 7/5 @H/@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west cant believe it and is thinking|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not 1 trick in parner to make 4@H |pg||
nt|bg: what is 3 dia obviously E is trying to show something but what|pg||
nt|bg: best with E type of hand just to haul off and bid what you think you might make|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure dbl|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LetÂ´s see how West plays the @H-suit here, beginning with the !Q will cost a trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pitiful:  i would say it would be a good effort to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as Roland says:  "What do you call an 8 card suit?"   (Trumps!)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S transfer I assume |pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - West bid 2 @S...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not depends on agreements,  I play 2 nt as honor 3rd or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: *and now|pg||
nt|mamos: often shows a Club honour  depends  on agreements|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems bizarre to bid on flat 10s and not bid on all that stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: now what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems she will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h? 2@d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but if she dos will it showe some support for s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i vote for D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead 2 x @S|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@H shows @S one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must go folks dinner time here leaving you in very many capable hands thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: explained as Majors by east|pg||
nt|davidstern: I only have nightmares about my own bridge. A good friend told me once thta I should only worry about my bridge if I worry about partner's I dont have enough faith to play with ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: him/her|pg||
nt|sybarra: my dutch friends will explain slaap lekker|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not the right time for the Moysean @h slam.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no sry W can pitch @d :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if you play 9 you can get down even with @d A onside|pg||
nt|ritong: now it will be tougher|pg||
nt|ritong: si birman dit 3@c ou si ils ont un gadget, ça pourrait s envisager|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: le roi est placé mais le partage des atouts oblige à perdre une levée   cependant 6@c gagne sans douleur le problème st de les enchérir|pg||
nt|chmitty: et je pense que ça gagne assez facilement même sur entame @d|pg||
nt|bridgek: Brink is probably supermax in their style|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rich89: xx??|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well i must admit that this mixed hungarian partenrship is making goulash of the italian pair|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h is 2-3 @h's|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel bids 3NT on board 17 that went through because there was no @h lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C shows good @H raise|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pour gagner, je recommands l´impasse á @D - et pas á @S...|pg||
nt|ritong: je ne crois pas qu  un garçon prudent comme lui prenne le risque de déclarer un 3 SA ridicule avec 6@c sur table possible|pg||
nt|ritong: genre l ouvreur a xx(x)(x) a @d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: lets try it one more time|pg||
nt|garnetts: why not |pg||
nt|puncher: but he can't have much more for passing over 2@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe XX is honor x,  (kx, qx or some such?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Don't make me laugh out loud, the players won't appreciate that :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs set as trumps already |pg||
nt|sybarra: cue bids coming up |pg||
nt|mamos: East wont like his soft cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 3 @H p 3 @S |pg||
nt|hawe45: But he will like @D K-Q|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: so south does not have to check for a heart fit but ccan either invite to game or simply bod 3nt and try to make|pg||
nt|kemperg: using 2@C with 3card, 2N gives 4crd|pg||
nt|sommer: Bergen makes that not necessary, you see|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my money on 6c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we think 2NT is constructive?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@c would have been 'pass or correct'?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4 @h is gone make for e/v becuse the lucky KQ@s onside. But will not be easy to come to 4 @h I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: so they looks very much on their way to a 3rd final in 4 years|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can always point to pc and say "silly commentators"  telling jokes|pg||
nt|lestergold: the e/w pair would if they knew why u were laughing|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this redouble meant to mean?|pg||
nt|ahalim: they may get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is not alerting, south is alerting bother 2@D and 2@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Always lead TRUMP|pg||
nt|davidstern: Newswires announcing death of Elizabeth Taylor|pg||
nt|mamos: 2NT invite now?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohhh never mind, Probebly it will always make one way or another|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: le partenaire pourrai à la limite avoir 3 @d médiocre et roi valet de @c cinquièmes|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|newmoon: yay   well passed|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm surprised Matheson did not bid 3@s (or even 4@s)|pg||
nt|mamos: ah perhaps 2@D was transfer?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is one transferring and the other not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I believe N was bidding naturally|pg||
nt|mamos: in thart case  North will jump to 4@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: c u|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: maximum hand in N what to bid?|pg||
nt|bg: 4 hearts makes as long as E is patient uhtil he gets to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4NT sounds like a good option?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true x@S+x@S entry in dummy or @H finesse by opps played :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H=|pg||
nt|mamos: Spade lead will curtail his efforts to mae many more than seven tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: this was one good example of why transfer bids work; if n was on lead, a d would be much easier for the def|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pitiful:  for my money north might have bid 3@s then bid 4@h next but maybe they would not be on firm ground|pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@h is much better by south|pg||
nt|idc: last time we saw a hand, Scotland gained 14 for bidding a different slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  5th club, @d10, @sQ?|pg||
nt|puncher: board 5 played the other way up which made things easier for declarer|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bidding seems sensible despite both being maximum|pg||
nt|mamos: East is "fearless"|pg||
nt|kemperg: I know, but we use 3@C/@D different|pg||
nt|yuval10: many possibilities now for E - Pass, 3NT, 4@h|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, but spending this much time in this posision only shows they are really good, They done want to leave anything to the chanses or luck|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if he founds pass I will be extreamly impressed|pg||
nt|mikael_w: even if its wrong on this board when @sKQ is onside|pg||
nt|ritong: a happy make at first sight|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C well placed|pg||
nt|xenya: and at second sight too, Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: @s jack is singleton for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant do much wrong|pg||
nt|ritong: eas has no reason to try a fancy lead with @s Jx when he has not the @d Ace in their raised suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: hate 3@D and the second double |pg||
nt|xenya: 4N --quantitative -- looks reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right sided.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the redouble is honor and one  |pg||
nt|lestergold: means i like the sound of my own voice|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the @S suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told I am correct as to the redble |pg||
nt|sybarra: by someone who should know, like the coach  |pg||
nt|lestergold: is it not somewhat ambiguous in such an auction might allow pard to think that yhou actually had ur overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: North must have seen her partner's bidding before|pg||
nt|mamos: or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is now waving her hand over 2@D and 2@H a bit and smiling |pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is clearly con fusion here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, this may explain the 3@h bid.  Perhaps the 4 level shows a big hand as they play.|pg||
nt|the saint: The strong option in the multi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks mike.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Tim there you are |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4Nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we might make too many |pg||
nt|mamos: i think we always were making too many  for 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w is even more fearless|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@S?|pg||
nt|sommer: if you play sayc, you can use jump in opposite MA to show 10-12 with 3cards..with 2/1, 1NT followed by 3@S..or?|pg||
nt|kemperg: good suit, inv. not forcing|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|puncher: Possibly so if they don't play bad 2N|pg||
nt|sybarra: good sac????? |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was right south did think pard had his overcall|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeah|pg||
nt|lestergold: good sac against the 4@h they were never bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: acyually 4@h is off in any case|pg||
nt|bg: by fooling around with the 3 dia bid E has given N an option to bail out in 4nt which will only be beaten by a non heart lead|pg||
nt|daman: It will be hard to beat this contract|pg||
nt|peachy: I should say so too :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: don't forget the bidding space won|pg||
nt|daman: 8 toppers with a myraid of ways for 9|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N +3 on 4|pg||
nt|mamos: interesting that on this board the Swedish bid 1NT at both tables|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Here the swedes takes control over the bidding and play 1 NT on both tables|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR plays very agressive opening|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H here's probably against the odds view pd's pass open. |pg||
nt|ritong: et avec tout le jeu qu il a, ça n est pas excessivement dangereux de développer, donnant des infos gratuites aux adversaires|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 sa sans soute et la tâche d'Ouest est difficile|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: doute|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: on Bd 21 - not a great slam at all but as the cards lay it was more successful|pg||
nt|puncher: my dodgy connection is proving a little tiresome|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we wrong sided clubs :(|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C cue comfirming @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: alright now 3h|pg||
nt|xenya: well things do happen (board 5)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|puncher: With a bad 2N available they could have shown a 5/5 shape in the minors - 2N would be artificial showing 5/5 in minors or 6 diams - both minimum openers|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Walker now|pg||
nt|puncher: Open room in 4@S on the previous 6@C board so a gain for Scotland - looks like this is not to be a flat match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short encouraged in clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: yes this is not easy|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt?  do "we" play  that?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why did s not crack 3D|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
nt|sharkey: But Vul bonus looms...|pg||
nt|sybarra: even 3 nt is pushy |pg||
nt|sybarra: and you are right Carl |pg||
nt|sharkey: At MPs I think a Pass stands out|pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is a different game |pg||
nt|ritong: with @s Jx, he would simply lead a @d no matter what he holds|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: it takes a spade lead to beat the slam |pg||
nt|garnetts: well it could be worth someone might have doubled this--strong case for east to |pg||
nt|garnetts: worse not worth :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: to beat 4@h spade spade cah K@d and play third spade|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think, that 3 NT from East was a bad bid - why not just 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D by E?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - or 4 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like 3 nt either |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: ii think anyh partner would have done same|pg||
nt|mamos: too be fair the pre-empt warns of the bad breaks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@H lead ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@D|pg||
nt|pelu: in bord 7 France in 3@C X - has to guess @HQ to make - W didnt - and down 1|pg||
nt|mamos: so some work for declarer|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, If I rememebr right they play 9-12 NT or something ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think NON-vuln E would have pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - according stats games with 37% chance shud be bid Vul due to game bonus 500|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and it might be that close that vuln shod decide this ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: amazing comeback in the other SF - France overtake NET, leading 40:38 now|pg||
nt|yuval10: all Israeli kibitz who starts asking regarding the final - it's in about 50 minutes, according to schedule, i believe|pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see 10 tricks for the taking...:) - not easy at the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely worried about the @D coming back if he ducks|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer is rightfully affraid of a @d switch if Q@c is with N|pg||
nt|yuval10: and remember this 1@c can be 2 as well|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS have 15 HCP between them so odds @CQ with N|pg||
nt|davidb: depends what 9 lead can be|pg||
nt|sharkey: May try cash 5@H after winning with in dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: bon ba tant pis|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: oui un peu inhumain|pg||
nt|ritong: c eut été gracieux|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gowdy: well a heart they could life with  but ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is leading!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sry other side leads ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is shaking his head, east says wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: its sort of in the rules :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3 SpaDES 3 diamonds 2 Clubs and an extra red trick|pg||
nt|sommer: ..SW on the same side of the screen...S didnt think about a panther double:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South needs to cash @h now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|mamos: well Herats looks lik eten tricks now  but wasnt cold so perhaps this will turn out ok|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good bid 0 are they playing minor key-card|pg||
nt|hawe45: 13 levées a SA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT???? |pg||
nt|mamos: I think 3Nt was  just a bit timid |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh whew|pg||
nt|sybarra: Erwin, you trying to give us heart attacks?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@c = puppet Stay|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sabage layout...|pg||
nt|pelu: if u only sse EW-cards looks easy, but @Ss 4-1 great problem|pg||
nt|mamos: very easy to go off|pg||
nt|sybarra: guts!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: ho9wever im nor convinced they would have found best defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: should this be whacked?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@s = 4@h|pg||
nt|ahalim: NS had a chance to go plus, but not anymore|pg||
nt|santyclz: Judging from the length of the huddle, I would assume not.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 4@d is -4 too:)|pg||
nt|sommer: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: strange 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky again for DK, that USA went the same 3 down in 3NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, see board 8 & 12|pg||
nt|sharkey: He's too good :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  Sime can lead the @sK, hoping for 3-3 spades, and forcing West to duck|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ire 161, Eng 161, Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 103|pg||
nt|paulg:  but he is banking everything on hearts, which will be less successful|pg||
nt|mamos: and sometimes eight :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|puncher: yes with the club entries might have been better to go for spades|pg||
nt|mamos: it certainly wasnt intended as a Spade cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: we landed....how ever we got there   (dont ask) |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I got all the alerts from W|pg||
nt|mamos: ok   we arrived|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: doubles are always t/o John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: evcen when p doubles 1nt?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E will be crushed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jameslee 2: ohh no did not see 5@C |pg||
nt|bg: France now has 9 imp lead as a result of the mix up on the double on board 3|pg||
nt|kemperg: if that is cue S has a problem, @H Q not sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5d now|pg||
nt|pelu: and also close to make in OR: @cK, @S to A and now @HQ ducked and @H again - but decl did'nt take the finess|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Not many cards are at the right place in the def for dec on this board|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needs to be patient here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess its itching in w:s fingers now wanting to turn @h. Lets see if he can hold himself ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: the question is if he can be sure of how many @h's his partner has|pg||
nt|pelu: @S again will work fint for defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he know it's 2, then playing @h might be the best thing as he only needs 9X  from partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Fisher up to now has taken all the playing time|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so far the def has been perfect I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c duck by East was very elegant|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: But he had all the problems|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: nothing else to do |pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Chiu very surprised seeing @dK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  i think he failed to appreciate the defensive problems that he *might* cause by leading the @sK|pg||
nt|peachy: W does best to return pds suit|pg||
nt|ahalim: I hope thay kanow what they are doing|pg||
nt|kemperg: on the internet site from BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: and defensis time :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: do much for your goulash Mike....|pg||
nt|ahalim: *know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they do indeed|pg||
nt|ahalim: well bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: now he'll roll to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: looks like declarer will lose 6 tricks for 1 down -- still NS have an easy no-trump partial|pg||
nt|mamos: doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: im trying to think whether sungkle dummy it is technically correct to play a small spade from hand to the 6 as u c a afford 2 spade losers so long as u maintain control of the hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d weill hardly be led|pg||
nt|kemperg: than 1 up|pg||
nt|yuval10: now E will duck the @d|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oppps, the was misstake nr 1 I think|pg||
nt|mikael_w: really nice def if e took this and returned @h3|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welllllllllll|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a make now|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt pard open 1 @D???|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well i see that @h got away in open room i csn imagine how cash rtwo spade and a @d tov ace end of defence|pg||
nt|pelu: still ok for defense|pg||
nt|chmitty: décidémment les 4441 sont un cauchemar|pg||
pc|c9|nt|idc: Am told that North led a @d in other room, making declarer's task easier - this may go down here|pg||
nt|idc: That slam on Bd 21 - 6@c is better than I first thought, a very good contract in fact|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: I bet he knew they were 3-3 --no double lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i prefer hearts to herats|pg||
nt|santyclz: Meanwhile the open room has caught up to us.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and then @d to A and @h2. But remember its alot easyer for us looking at all cards :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Easy game...:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C misunderstood?|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: good play rewards good bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: If he'd delayed the @C N may have been squeezed in @D & @S...|pg||
nt|sharkey: For 11 tricks..|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: Houston we have landed is what the astronauts say |pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt work...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: well they seemed to know what they were doing,  just scared the rest of us|pg||
nt|hawe45: East will regret, that he skipped a @C|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact 4 rounds of spades does it too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and see you nest match!|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many swings here despite the swingy nature of the boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: almost falls out of his chair now|pg||
mc|10|nt|paulg:  but he is still going to make this I think, West will have to concede a heart or spade|pg||
nt|puncher: Carroll opened 3@H after all so board 22 looks to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  with spades 3-3 I think you need to get a heart ruff to beat 4@s on this hand|pg||
nt|ritong: gling|pg||
pg||

nt|Walddk2: Walddk5 is there|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@D a mixed raise, i suppose..|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is mixed about this raise?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Table 3 board 9:  N  3@S-1|pg||
nt|imp_jan: invitational and preempt at the same time|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|imp_jan: puts pressure on south|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The score on the board is inaccurate obviously, because we only have one comparison there|pg||

nt|imp_jan: paulissen bids on zero count dangerous!|pg||

pc|h5|mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Tom Townsend suggested that the Israel team should be renamed. ISRUK or some such, but that did not happen|pg||

nt|newmoon: interesting misfit here|pg||
nt|newmoon: u open 1@H, David?|pg||
nt|xenya: so the gadget has worked nicely|pg||
nt|xenya: it seems EW were not quite sure about the combined strength of their hands|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So 1 down after all that|pg||
nt|puncher: hi all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and hello Ian|pg||
nt|idc: G'day Sam & Roland|pg||
nt|puncher: but that was quick!|pg||
nt|sybarra: but nicely done |pg||
nt|mamos: ok  well I say "Well done"  I hate you lot to watch some of my bidding :)  Good contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 and 10 still to come|pg||
nt|mamos: two more boards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 herats agsain|pg||
nt|tomi2: vuln 2nd seat this is very much "bottom of range"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nice spade situation makes game easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they reach game|pg||
nt|lestergold: would a world class wizard have made this contract that is the question|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR h opened 2@H, leader expects 41|pg||
nt|sommer: nice possible 3NT again NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, I dont use the movie|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mm could be trouble for someone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 15 the Israeli NS bid to 4@h and went one down|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Israel is getting closer every board now|pg||
nt|sybarra: David sending telepathy messages |pg||
nt|yuval10: N can leave KQ @s and AK@d |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think sweden had 19 IMP after 3 boards 19/1 then. So after that start Israel has been untucheble|pg||
nt|xenya: was skating on thin ice|pg||
nt|bobholl: this can only loose for the dutch|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: interesting hand since 4@S seems better than 3NT--but no way to bid it I think|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|puncher: good effort|pg||
nt|xenya: i see, thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2@d multi|pg||
nt|ady: club guess |pg||
nt|dagold: or one of these constructive 2@h|pg||
nt|dagold: is fine|pg||
nt|dagold: as Espen has done|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib said:  "or one of these constructive 2@h"|pg||
nt|sybarra: we seem to be at the "speed table" |pg||
nt|ralfwil: two more boards!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Things are getting a little out of hand for Belgium.|pg||
nt|tomi2: they might be missing 5 tricks but how often are opps not able to catch them in time|pg||
nt|ahalim: slam time now|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 -- 6 ?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|april7: EW might reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 1@s....|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike you get the last 2 hands,  I have to catch a train |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all,  and have fun |pg||
nt|kemperg: north|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another easy contract - getting there might not be as easy|pg||
nt|ritong: fisher might consider playing in NTs|pg||
nt|ritong: after all, Kx is not rocksolid|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes 6N looks safer|pg||
nt|ritong: first step is checking for keys i guess|pg||
mb|1N!|an|5+!C-4!h/!s|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was first hand in the open room |pg||
nt|sybarra: all speculation was wildness|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland I think you were commenting there |pg||
nt|mamos: A poor result for US from OR   East put too much confidence in his cards and partner's overcall|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S?..|pg||
nt|sommer: no|pg||
nt|kemperg: too weak for me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play here for 6@h|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not with a trump lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  can throw a @d on the 3rd @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable 1@H ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: aha polish i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: looking for an adverse save |pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white saves not often best|pg||
nt|garnetts: loses a couple of imps|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if I like the 2NT bid or not |pg||
nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard for us to believe that Walker-Short could play too quickly for the operator :)|pg||
nt|rich89: x better than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had the italians been doing this to the hyngarians i could have said made spaghetti of them but today no pasta for lunch i'm afraid|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Vincent!!! great job|pg||
nt|sommer: 2 @Sducks and a flat board|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d = @h, 1NT = 18-19 bal. |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|dagold: with short majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must have been declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: depends what they had for lunch|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is limited to 16 points|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D a ht raise of some sort|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a good raise   |pg||
nt|mamos: better be a good raise|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although they rate to pick some up on 27.|pg||
nt|bg: E opened 2 spades in other room led to a lebensohl auction to stop in 3 dia|pg||
nt|peachy: makeable, anyway:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I was thinking of 4s|pg||
nt|mamos: It's easy to be wise :)  but for us oldies watching it does seem at time that mistakes are made by rushing play - technically most of these players are excellent  -- better than me ...|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure but need to be a little more patient with the cards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  on any lead?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1 @d ruff and 1@s ruff appear to be enough|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK with trump lead also|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed you do not want to be in it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Israel have played well - on the other hand Sweden had opportunities on several boards|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't show his max now :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: nice toy|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: anyway, one can sympathise with S's decision to bid 3N, considering the state of the match|pg||
nt|ritong: 6@d one key @d void|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe they prefer one ACE @d void|pg||
mb|p!|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I must say,  the lady (east) at the table is NOT bashful |pg||
nt|bg: W pass good decision  in other room W bid 2 clubs and that led E to double 4 spades whichmakes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4h|pg||
nt|kemperg: or 3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Let's hope that's not reverse Drury.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
nt|kemperg: isthat forcing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dangerous approach|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bull at a gate stuff|pg||
nt|peachy: South's suit is good enough for trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: trump Q ask?|pg||
nt|ritong: surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: ?@SQ|pg||
nt|xenya: is he going to stop in 5?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
nt|idc: Result from other room just in - 3NT -1 by East|pg||
nt|paulg:  A much easier hand for Matheson to bid when his partner has already passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: can u arrange an intro in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not be a success I am afraid |pg||
nt|kemperg: some points for Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N led the @sA, no director called'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden v Norway next, in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|gowdy: hard to miss 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: also hard to make :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@h   may be some mini splinter or some Bergen like raise|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree don't like 2@c  at this vul|pg||
nt|bg: if pard made a two level overcall I would double 4 spades also|pg||
nt|mamos: "1-under mixed raise" Im authoritatively told|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree  -- it was East's confidence in his partner's overcall that was misplaced :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bejaypers|pg||
nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Sorry, backwards)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d FG XT-NT and now probably 3 @h's|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, this looks like a flat board, If they just bid 3 NT now its time to get some coffey for me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Boards 14 & 17 cud have been IMPs to Sweden|pg||
nt|davidb: N can make 3NT on H lead|pg||
nt|davidb: S  will bid sure|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: again straigth to the max but will brink pass ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
nt|puncher: 2@S seems a little conservative but north is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it that way,  (not sure the world does)  but that means 2 @H is 13 cards and 3 hts |pg||
nt|sybarra: saved by N |pg||
nt|mamos: saved by North|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can hold 2 @S in 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3nt in this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: will most likely also be one off|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finn S bid 3NT, N removed|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wouldn't want to be there but you might conceivably get a @sq lead.|pg||
nt|the saint: With the @S 9 wrong that just delays the inevitable...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT has a chance, this has none|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1NT 15-17 here?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh oh|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happened the c suit - sorry forgot it doesnt exist any more|pg||
nt|yuval10: *2 @h showing 3@h's, that is|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think S shud have bid 2 NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: S knows his side has most of the points, so i don't think he can stay passive with 2@h. What should he bid is awkward|pg||
nt|ritong: very possible  if not he would bid direct 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: what would you do if partner wasn't a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should just use copy/paste |pg||
nt|mamos: Hearts or herats  didnt make much of a showing there|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 3 x @S and a @D will endplay South|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was French E,  I guess SEF went out the window for the french jrs |pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think there weas much chance of missing game on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fighting for part scores is one of the most fataql bridge diseases|pg||
nt|sommer: me2..despite, he may be able to trans and show 5-4 min with singleton @S.. still stopping in 4mi!..?cant trans and invite below|pg||
nt|sommer: ..last part out|pg||
nt|santyclz: Let's hope it's not normal Drury.|pg||
nt|kemperg: whats reverse Drury?|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is not so easy against a @d lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Return to the base suit is the weak hand rather than 2@d being the weak hand.|pg||
nt|mamos: North does have a hand with little to reccommend it|pg||
nt|kemperg: thats normal for me|pg||
nt|davidb: not sure... partner showed 18-19 !|pg||
nt|chmitty: quand les adversaires interviennent sur 1SA par des conventions multi-significations, il est important d'avoir discuté de l'attitude de notre camp|pg||
nt|chmitty: est-ce qu'on garde Texas ? est-ce que ça devient naturel ? etc ...|pg||
nt|chmitty: le + simple, quand aucune couleur n'est connue, c'est d'oublier l'intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: 3N looking like a normal spot but the poor @D break kills it|pg||
nt|paulg:  @hA and club switch will keep it to nine tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically about 50% contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be careful now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: so cannot criticise|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done |pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk7: Sam is a debutant commentator. I wonder if she knows that co-commentators expect to get a drink from newbies :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Alok Daga|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Alok|pg||
nt|puncher: hi there|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm not a fan of MUD leads but they can be difficult for declarer to read too|pg||
nt|alok_daga: btw what was 3nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW playing Blue Club, so 2@s only promised five|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double or the t51d bid Shirley?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: havent seen any alert but im not sure|pg||
nt|mamos: 14-16 im told|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 14+5-card suiit = 15|pg||
nt|kemperg: you cant do without|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not so hot on a d lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as in no hope?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but s will hardly pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: Technically in Drury a 2@d bid shows a sub-minimum, reverse Drury is perhaps more common than "normal" these days.|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes but will W lead a @D from AJ10x ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|henryb:  I doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jack is technically correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought you meant what West would lead back after a diamond to the ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  i'd invite showing a heart stop and four spades if partner was in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Ire 161; Eng 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needs care|pg||
nt|lestergold: now defence have to cash their tricks in teh right order|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be clear which is not the same as easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks again to Johan Gronkvist in the kibitz for explaining NS' system|pg||
nt|mamos: yes cant see any excitement here|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can....if declarer doesn't play @c's right away to knock out E's entry, but i agree he's likely to do so|pg||
nt|yuval10: this lead won't faze declarer at all|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|kemperg: but still the @H problem, so 6N just as good|pg||
nt|ahalim: they have reached the best contract|pg||
nt|ritong: schwartz considered that KJ10 is worth Q|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: you very seldom get a good score if opps.play at 1 level|pg||
nt|dagold: some Kibs do not like the side 4cM|pg||
nt|sybarra: dear me,  e/w....where did our jrs go?|pg||
nt|mamos: East has a good hand West has some tricks   come on lads   bid B% &*( game|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 1/2 hour is not super fast for 10 boards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N should make but not laydown|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??? did not expect that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not often the israel team gets it wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: next round we have a big match: Dutch Juniors vs. Sweden, 3 and 4 in the standings|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know what 2@c wa?s|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|newmoon: my shpellingg iss garbage these dayss|pg||
nt|idc: Bad Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: man up as we say!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I cannot conceive of a passed hand where 3N is the right contract with the South hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: me neither|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i third that|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@S X was par|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the club slam attempted in the other room was less than thin|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Difficult for eitrher to come in|pg||
nt|paulg:  Only going to happen if East opens|pg||
nt|puncher: other way round surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am cheap, just diet coke|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yep, I'd be with the field on this one.  Going down as usual.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, they are so far behind that they cant lose a lot anymore but win some vp if those games are somehow working|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North showed his hand with Drury first|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT maybe but not 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahalim: that means a @D from W and a @H back|pg||
nt|arno11: action over for now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks promising  until trick 3 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: then the nature of his hand, balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: also, he has some extras|pg||
pc|h6|nt|newmoon: still, -2 not too bad|pg||
nt|dagold: here for example the handwill not play so well facing many hands with 4-card spade support|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me start some thank yous  in the mean time |pg||
nt|lestergold: westknows that only hope is to play partner for A@d and Q@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3nt would have some fun :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or actually this trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: with @D not breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 12|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5-0 distribution not nice feeeling when you push a close game |pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@C is good with this layout, but not reasonable|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E is to blame here|pg||
nt|idc: same lead as other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also inferences that East did not have four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator  Erwin Huzen. Super job!   (as always) |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like you've forgotten my performance last year|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators Mike and Hans for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|kemperg: not in Kleinman points|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So we must assign the blame to South|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally, I would pass 3@h with North|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H would have been interesting:(|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed 3@H looks like a sign-off|pg||
nt|henryb:  so when they lose 13, 3 of the imps go to North, the other 10 are rub of the green|pg||
nt|santyclz: You're blaming the Irish?|pg||
nt|kemperg: spoken by a golfer|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is a bad contract that happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I blame society|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well said roland|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dagold: probably need 5 spades opposite|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me start some thank yous as we have one more hand in this set |pg||
nt|kemperg: same for  N|pg||
nt|yuval10: she again, sorry :)  |pg||
nt|ritong: courageux, le 10 de @d|pg||
nt|ritong: j aurais pris l autre 10 rouge|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: pas de 6 @c non plus en salle ouverte le sablier s'égrêne dangereusement|pg||
nt|ritong: le contrat est tres probablement sur table, donc l idée est de limiter les surlevées|pg||
nt|ritong: et le dix de @d risque fort de faire grand gin|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: oh he doesnt kn ow |pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing not even 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: low scoring match so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: only in 2 |pg||
nt|sharkey: I think 2 NT wud cover all - however N wud interpret|pg||
nt|kemperg: Huh|pg||
pc|c9|nt|2hplus4: Needed to lead @CK to beat this.|pg||
nt|puncher: unlucky but a flat board|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought "rub of the green" was a billiards term|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cledver54|pg||
nt|peachy: singleton is unlikely, he would have led it on the go|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still making s thiunk|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcomyn: yes although boards look swingy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would imagine more competition from juniors|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S was OK i think, but not 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: long gone Erwin|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||
nt|paulg:  South can suggest doubleton heart because his partner knows he cannot have doubleton|pg||
nt|puncher: does N have to avoid playing a club now to stop declarer shortening his trumps?|pg||
nt|paulg:  it cannot cost to lead diamond here|pg||
nt|arno11: flat board|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|the saint: I guess you would try to get a spade trick and then try for a partial elmination in clubs hoping for Kx and a failure to unblock - doesn't work here|pg||
nt|lestergold: now 8 easy tricks the 9th can come from the club suit with the layout as it is but not an obvious source |pg||
nt|sharkey: Difficult view N cud have 2@C only|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  1@d was not alerted but showed 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should have seen the danger of a heart loser disappearing up the swanee|pg||
nt|po-s: bad techniqu in trumps - if all four in West|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he really do that?|pg||
nt|hawe45: 11 levées|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  from the carding he knew Walker had @cQ7 or @cQ75|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think someone put too much paprika in Miss Wagner's goulash|pg||
nt|pelu: decl cant be sure - only 8 tricks - need to remove the right A from Easts hand - here ut will work fine|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: My guess is that it's from cricket, like many other terms|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone tell me why a 5-4 club fit is ignored in this room|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|nt|xenya: not on this layout though|pg||
nt|bg: mis defense on board 5 cost Canada another bunch of imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: squeeze as @SQ doesnt drop|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: first to a big thanks to   our terrific operator  Erwin Huzen. Super job!  |pg||
nt|daman: cold    luckily|pg||
nt|ritong: in case|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: guessed    potential swing|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson finding a nice safe line for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|puncher: do you have the system to invite, show a heart stop and 4 spades? I can show a heart stop and 4 spades but only game forcing not inviting|pg||
nt|sybarra: she had the warnings with X etc |pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Erwin Mike, Shirley,and specs|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators Mike, Germ  and Riccardo for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx my excellent fellow commentators and helpful specs see u again soon for some more white house high jinks|pg||
nt|kemperg: I''m done fore today, hae to play tennis and bridge myself|pg||
nt|lestergold: and not to forget operator who has kept us informed of interesting things|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to the sponsors:  the City of Amsterdam, Herman Drenkelford, Max Abram and Peter Sisselaar and the organizer Kees Tammens.  All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2: he played for a @C ruff but he should know that his partner likes to lead from three small...|pg||
nt|mamos: well done for bidding this -- (I think)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: maybe ducking Trick 1 better |pg||
nt|lestergold: when u play for these kind of against the odd ruffs they never happen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can aslo come from an endplay ity will come in the wash one way or abother|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing @S was better|pg||
nt|sommer: W has clearly shown, where @DA is:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
nt|idc: I like that @sQ play - on the bidding declarer cannot have 3 spades, since they never supported the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Unconfirmed, but current live ranking: Eng 163; Ireland 160; Wales 160; Scotland 154; WBU 149; NI 112|pg||
nt|puncher: too double dummy to get that right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pitiful:  well q@h lead sort of helped the guess|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: *first seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thanks to our specs.  We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.   @H@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: No leads to 5 losers|pg||
nt|kemperg: no definitly golf|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: true or an inspired club lead and a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Although the pitch is rarely green nowadays|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly not in india anyway|pg||
nt|santyclz: Apparently it is both billiards and golf:  http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/rub-of-the-green.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: and the billiard blue|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|idc: not that it will make much of a difference either way on this hand|pg||

nt|lestergold: that was one way|pg||
nt|bobholl: 21D claim|pg||

nt|xenya: now 2@S if weak ( and what else could it be?) looks almost perfect|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember we are the "speed" table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They actually do lead the 8 from that holding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus  for results and standings|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I dont like that convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator Tim Verbeek. Super job!  |pg||
nt|kemperg: but in both rooms|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks Vincent, Raija, John, George|pg||
nt|kemperg: and kibs|pg||
nt|sommer: NS will for sure go to 4@S..soon, but then?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fitbid|pg||
nt|sommer: yep|pg||
nt|sommer: inv+:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good win for USA |pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting hands but israel slightly off day|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This could well be Israel's first loss in the tournament|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4@h by N?|pg||
nt|ritong: now how do they show @s fit balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming north bids game|pg||
nt|ritong: but with 19 i guess he will|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pour battre 5 @C - il faut le faire en express|pg||
mb|d|nt|puncher: most invitational bids are just transfers anyway at teams :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empts own @s-suit this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks magiv only needs the ace of @D on side|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Hans tu n'entames pas un petit @h contre 5@c ?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|newmoon: South never passes, playing Junior bridge|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps a major suit struggle this time?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think EW will bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then if he ism playing pard for that why lead a trump as theen pard cant have the A@d and the @ds can providfe discards for heart losers|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be the same problem if they lead 3rd and he plays the 7...|pg||
nt|po-s: cute hand - both sides make 3NT if on lead|pg||
nt|mamos: now less likely to play hopeless NT contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: thx :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators James and Bruce for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|bg: schools could pick up here in 4 harts with correct guess in dai /clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: And thanks to organizers of this annual Junior Tournament, excellent chance for young players to gain some experience and meet other young players from around the world|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to stop in 3@H:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  One of my mentors suggests that South should take 15 of the 14 imps blame for bidding 2@d instead of 2@h. I think that is severe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, they have lost 13-17 also|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: israel already lost to their schools team in the first match|pg||
nt|mamos: I think they are likely to get 24 back on this board Roland :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: a real psych|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't even need that when @s's are 3-3 and @c 2-2....|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes so I see |pg||
nt|hawe45: Sud joue|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  Sime decides the anaemic distribution is not worth searching for a thin game|pg||
nt|paulg:  rightly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: when i see that @d holding in dummy i think we need to get busy Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: not play a passive trump back|pg||
nt|santyclz: S passed a 10-12 nt.  As I said, most of the reticence...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done by open to miss slam but it is uinlucky lets see what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: last board here - OR still habe 2½board to play - so Fishers lang time didnt mater|pg||
nt|yuval10: South has a big hand now, AK@c singel @s and he knows P is probably void @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: pass is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt looks like minors, others might use it as a xfer to 3@c (lebensohl-ish).|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The response makes the xfer more likely.|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully E didn't intend it as the minors|pg||
nt|paulg:  the England team won the Premier League on a split tie after an appeal, you could see them repeating that today!|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: blue coming up..|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: or not|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass instead of 1N?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: encore plus facile (!!)  roi de @h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  II would call WestÂ´s 1 @S a minimum, vulnerable|pg||
nt|bobholl: can drijver guess his P has this maegre card ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|idc: WIth South holding a 15 count, passed out in other room looks a bit unlikely|pg||
nt|idc: we will check|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C  looks a bit ambitious and has no hope with the bad break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone think E should pass instead of 1D|pg||
nt|arno11: wow|pg||
nt|kemperg: some imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board nice chatting with you John, thanks Natalia and succes playing|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maintenant la manche|pg||
nt|ritong: sud connait donc un arret @s tres ténu|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: hi Mike|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is an IMP event|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's 4@D is "pick-a-major" - he can't underwrite game, but any kind of fit will produce a reasonable play|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're probably joining somewhere in the middle of this tournement|pg||
nt|xenya: he did not|pg||
nt|puncher: sticky cards perhaps|pg||
nt|puncher: not the most exciting of boards at this stage of the weekend... |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to all of  the sponsors:   All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty Tim last board ty specs , Shirley,Bruce |pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either 12-14 bal, natural but not 10-15 onesuited (as the 2@C opener) or any 18+ hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knew it|pg||
nt|sommer: ...woooo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are in deep  .... trouble now|pg||
nt|mamos: although West is having a go|pg||
nt|yuval10: i might bid 5@h  with his hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is being bid beautifully |pg||
nt|yuval10: 4NT is a good hand and 5@c is of course pass/correct|pg||
nt|ritong: that way|pg||
nt|ritong: fine|pg||
nt|ritong: allows to stay in it|pg||
nt|ritong: après 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: et beaucoup de jeu chez son partenaire|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @s en Sud|pg||
nt|hawe45: Une seule raison pour l´entame du R de @H = les @D placées|pg||
nt|bridgek: pff, luckily no dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Major suits are for children, Jim|pg||
nt|mamos: looking at that dummy and @dJ87   not so easy to play back @d  |pg||
nt|lestergold: well im toldf that 8 9s the standard lead in poland from K87 |pg||
nt|gowdy: and I thought they may find slam !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: have been a plenty of voids today|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@H and then 3@H forces to game|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, th to Wessel, Mike 2x, Peter, see you next round|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: still a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how juniors can create swings on almost every deal when we arf used to three hands in four being as flat as pancakes normally|pg||
nt|mamos: North likes bidding Clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks a little ambitious|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is a do or die attempt|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: When tabling the dummy, Laura says: 'I think 10 or 7 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  that was the first 5. the other 10 for passing 3N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that was a near one roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure why Padon decided against defending at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He also knows about the psyche|pg||
nt|kemperg: has N a choice?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How few tricks does he get in 2@C on a trump lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe 4|pg||
nt|henryb:  certainly has four, possibly five|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is worse|pg||
nt|mamos: North is cofused I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: confused|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hw|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C OK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: heavens EW not even bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this is not the cind of boards you like to see when you are trailing in the match. offcurse Israel done know they are trailing now |pg||
nt|sharkey: Righthanded the contract to boot|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt minors |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: et puis de mauvais @s !!|pg||
nt|ritong: c est une excellente raison, a mon humble avis|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ce que fait Sud ici, j´appelle un bureau d´information. 5 @C - et fini|pg||
nt|ritong: il sait qu il y a zéro levées de @s pour son camp|pg||
pc|sA|nt|puncher: a lot more flat boards in this half of the last match - I guess Wales must be quite relieved by the lack of potential swingy hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks germ me too|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks kibs, nice comments from polish peaple|pg||
nt|kemperg: W expects more from the fit|pg||
nt|sommer: ..like men!!..now beat it!!!|pg||
nt|mamos: 12 board set?|pg||
nt|yuval10: we still have 11 and 12|pg||
nt|ritong: there are several ways to proceed in these situations|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N is not mine|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 2@S denied AK or Q of @S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  Carroll/Hanlon play 14-16 1NT, so they will be in 1NT too|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen miracles before in this match |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  you are special We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.  |pg||
nt|kemperg: N worried about the sigleton in S:)|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry wrong way - WE are to play 2 boards more|pg||
nt|sybarra: good going guys!|pg||
nt|yuval10: good hand, not specifically minors, could've very well be a slam invitation in @s|pg||
nt|xenya: neatly done -- just a bit too high perhaps|pg||
nt|ritong: i have affection for 3NT balanced fit because it allows to play that contract quietly with no complications|pg||
pc|s9|nt|newmoon: even 4@S was ok here, as it happens|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@H I meant|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 1@d   |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then very difficult to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: thanks everyone  and Erwin   great work!  see you Tomorrow|pg||
nt|tomi2: letting south pick the best game, 3nt or 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe a German imp now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: people|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes indeed very helpful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kept the pot boiling nicely|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead but the ;ads will get a second cracj of the whip and hard to see them getting itg wrong4|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|newmoon: playing check-back, 3@D would deny 4@H AND 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks if "we" can find them |pg||
nt|mamos: agressive double again|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N with long clubs|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is trick 8, where is the 9th ?|pg||
nt|ritong: voyons ça|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: je  comprends mal 4 @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: and us on the straight and narrow|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to finesse S for @HQ now...........isnt it?|pg||
nt|sommer: imo, E is too weak for 4@D, but depends on agreements|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me 2N forcing, and S will pass|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: oh no I see 450 in the other room|pg||
nt|kemperg: The Israelian pairs are high up in the butler|pg||
nt|henryb:  already had problem with void.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this is a nice 12-7 HP slam|pg||
nt|yuval10: still only 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|sybarra: "guys" was euphimism.... maybe should say "kids"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: N is a young lady |pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  test hearts, claim|pg||
nt|puncher: It's certainly going to be close - quite exciting and some swingy boards to keep us all awake in the last match of the weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as the top three are playing the bottom three ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club lead and d switch - AARRGGH|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why did e not double - what did he know we dont|pg||
nt|ritong: chicken:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: il voulait faire une enchère forte et laisser la place pour un cue-bid à 4@h en Sud ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ouest n´a pas vu les encheres|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: exploit   trop délicat   pour Ouest   qui dans l'état du match ne cherche pas à faire des folies|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  BBO|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Well 4@H had good chances and 3@S makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: friendly lay out   (no IF) |pg||
nt|ritong: trying a zia|pg||
nt|ritong: exactement|pg||
pc|d5|nt|newmoon: then show 3@S before 4@H, in their way|pg||
nt|sybarra: q and I think she was home |pg||
nt|sybarra: no?|pg||
nt|kemperg: !Q better, but home?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D pitches |pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt say no hope mike|pg||
nt|mamos: but Im not convinced by 3@C after opening bid and response|pg||
nt|kemperg: 41@D beats it I think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Is this @c system build on getting the contract on the right hand:)?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: got  10 now    probably thats all|pg||
nt|xenya: particularly if they freely preempt with hands like S's|pg||
nt|mamos: well its a two-way shot in Diamonds I guess you have to work out which opponent has King|pg||
nt|mamos: and I agree double might put him off|pg||
nt|tomi2: 25-2 VP for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|yuval10: first swing for Sweden this set, but looks like it's a little too late|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  when none of the bottom three want to get beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if i got the typing wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades 3/3 helps a big bunch|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed maybe overtrick|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are obviously playing a system where 3@D is not forcing to game.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nayther|pg||
nt|peachy: webpage http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/|pg||
nt|kemperg: Israel well on top of the bill|pg||
nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT was easier to play here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Erwin and all commentators|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i find it hard to believe that fantunes would have let thru that contract for example|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, thanks to our operator Vincent, Mike and John, see you again in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: righto tx|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks Vincent|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: even vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: perhaps there's some excitment still to come... |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but can you fix the oesers?|pg||
nt|mamos: nope   I t will be flat of course :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: just kicked me out.   Was it something I said?|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 76@C might have helped|pg||
nt|mamos: or nine :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the frence West made 4@s on the hand with @Ss 4-1 - but here N had shown a red hand - but still long way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: now couldnt see the need to cash quickly perhaps wasnot that easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: bye all|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering what !6 7 meant    maybe Smith?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the heart lead was a poor shot on the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: count?|pg||
nt|lestergold: almost guaranteed to give bioth a tricka nd a tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: can't ask them anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: everyone is gone|pg||
nt|mamos: ty  all|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: i'm closing down now, tot straks|pg||
nt|lestergold: so gilrs sved another disaster here|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: cash some winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hop is saying "what is going on??"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx all cheers - or go neirigh on bothar leat|pg||
nt|mamos: this really is a quick board :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But nut for sure a winner|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: he wanted to bid game quickly and avoid intervention, he figured out slam against a passed hand Partner will be tough |pg||
pc|c8|nt|kemperg: losers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back in 15 minutes with Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer must guess @ds to make this|pg||
nt|bg: not any more|pg||
nt|mamos: no problem for this declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: folks sorry have to leave,  I am crunched re the work requirements (shame when it interfers with bridge) |pg||
pc|h9|nt|newmoon: will be a quick claim after 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos: and now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: needed a balcony finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: Impressive players|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when you have 12-14, you do not know which is the right hand|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: his name is Gerband right?|pg||
nt|mamos: defence have found his winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: its Gerbrand |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, Gerbrand it is :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry misspelled it at first|pg||
nt|mamos: great stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: really enjoyed|pg||
nt|mamos: out to teacxh beginners tonight|pg||
nt|mamos: I know I know|pg||

nt|kemperg: TY all |pg||
nt|kemperg: w Forgot the @C A|pg||
nt|po-s: trumps 31 saves declarer|pg||
nt|kemperg: cost the down|pg||
nt|andreasw:  So it is not:)?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think the idea is to find 4-4 and 5-3 fits easily|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: now 11  refused club finesse|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|sommer: duck:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..does it matter?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: thx all and bye for now hope to c some of u later|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all and see you next match|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd still be scratching my head   and thinking how much I hated two-way guesses|pg||
nt|mamos: well done so I think a deserved pick up for Israel on that board the souble didnt make much difference it was bidding  and making game that gained the imps|pg||
nt|mamos: thaNK YOU ALL|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to our great op|pg||
nt|mamos: thank to Dutch organisers and to BBO for bringing us this great JUnior tourny     see you all in a little while|pg||
nt|mamos: Netherlands Juniors v Germanty|pg||
nt|mamos: ten minutes or so from now according to schedule|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if 1@h shows exactly three hearts, responder know the position|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but somepairs play 1@h is 2 or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 1@H did not promise 3@H, 2@H did. 1@H could also be some hands with 2, I think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  If not i must be build on getting contract on the "strong" hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: the surprising Dutch girls in routing France, 32:2 at the moment|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: releaf for N seeing @H Q|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: then suggests a controlled psyche to me|pg||
nt|mamos: well  credit to West here  --  I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He did double 1NT. After that he is not obliged to double every bid by opps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|m_niemi: wd|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: did Hop just smile with that ?|pg||
nt|ritong: first you can find Ak onside, which would be pleasant, second it might lure opponents|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|paulg:  sound defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: back very shortly with next match |pg||

nt|paulg:  Matheson/Sime open 1NT a 5-card major less often than some pairs|pg||
nt|ritong: he will surely make some jumps in @ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: rather modest by him :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  4@c, showing the black suits would be best from Short, if they played that|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@S exclusion?|pg||
nt|ritong: his problem remains @d control, though|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h would be opportune, then|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: mais la messe est dite depuis un certain temps    Les Israeliens confirment leur victoire de Philadelphie  avec talent|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Since I would be bid 2@S on much worse than that--with a semi-solid suit I like 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|bridgek: compare this 3sp with the one on board 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: west has an automatic pass |pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|paulg:  as they can show an upper range hand using Gazzilli|pg||

nt|paulg:  i'd be in 5@c doing down one|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I prefer to bid a 6 card major than than show 2 suits initially|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure not, but WBU want to win to help their  1 team and Scotland want to win to finish in the top half|pg||
nt|paulg:  so they are not 'dead' matches|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Now (unofficial) Eng 162; Wales 162; Ireland; 160; Scotland 154; WBU 150; NI 110    what a finish!|pg||
nt|pelu: the dutchgirls has played very well thehole way - a strong team with Laura Dekkers from the dutch women team (Silver in Ostende)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: there is a chance of reaching 6@S|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ady: this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought it would be a boring 4@S by EW but now i'm not so sure|pg||
nt|xenya: 14 imps|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 6 major 5 minor and I don't use Michaels|pg||
nt|puncher: Gazzilli certainly seems to be the toy of the moment|pg||

nt|hawe45:  @S-lead would have defeated this game|pg||
nt|bridgek: it's not gonna make any way|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yuval10: how many @d's does 1@d promise?  if it's 3 then how can they know about the "double fit"?|pg||
nt|april7: and all aces, there is even a possibility for 7, but not making|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Ooh-er|pg||
nt|xenya: missing an ace|pg||
nt|paulg:  would you bid 4@c over 3@h?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they've done well as the club lead looks right|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes The opponents seem limited. As it happens so is partner |pg||
pc|sK|nt|newmoon: @C10 lead here probably better...|pg||
nt|xenya: they gained 14 imps i meant|pg||
nt|paulg:  chances for making 11 tricks if the defence do not cash their diamond tricks|pg||
nt|puncher: but at this stage the overtricks won't help either of these teams very much|pg||
nt|paulg:  @s10 next|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: surely 6@c now|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice def. by N in the OR to play @d after he's in with the A@h|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|newmoon: but the C5 is higher than the 4 on the 4th round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: on rute for 6@C - making - need @CJ to drop - @Cs 2-2 or @hs 3-3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Indeed it was, and he did in a split second|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: France has won the other SF, 64:50|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quitew but guess so too|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|newmoon: contemplating whether to get to dummy and run the @HJ, playing East for 10x|pg||
nt|puncher: Murdoch just made 4@S on board 9 so the swings continue... |pg||
nt|paulg:  John Carroll led a diamond against the contract, rather than the safer heart|pg||
nt|yuval10: great comeback for them, and they'll face Israel in a re-match of the thrilling final from Phili in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|bridgek: he cannot esteblish di|pg||
nt|bridgek: establish|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: maybe N should have taken a sve here -- with his singleton diamond |pg||
nt|puncher: all gratefully received - we're still in with a shout after all... |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|april7: not to be understood, the pass by E with this hand|pg||
nt|davidb: D-H  easy squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or QJ doubleton with N (then no guess), or singleton honour with South, then a guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No entry for @D now|pg||

nt|milton_se: no way|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes. It even looks like 7@c would make as the cards are|pg||

nt|pelu: ?? how - u have to give up a @H and ruff the 4. @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no 13th trick, which is rather irrelevant when he is in 6|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Yuval, you are right. only 11 tricks. I was only watching the @d-@h squeze mon S|pg||

nt|Walddk4: At least it felt like 5 minutes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: remember all that after board 12 this table still has to play board 1. Board 1 was missduplicated from start|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep,the swedes think, but not half as long|pg||
nt|mamos: was there a delay at the start ?|pg||

nt|mikael_w: a small delay but not that long from start. ok Ernest, have they disgussed this at the table and Fisher admit ?|pg||

nt|ritong: entre parenthèses, c était la première grande compétition que BBO retransmettait, on a pas été déçus|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ritong: just between the four of us|pg||
nt|bridgek: So he needed a extra ha-stopper + running diamonds for 3nt|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  however declarer still has two diamond losers, spade and a club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  needed to lead a high heart to pin the 7 i think|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 9 tricks though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Ka ching.|pg||
nt|xenya: so a close match before the final segment|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg:  as long as the defence does not broach diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker can establish a discard from each hand, but this does not help him|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|s3|nt|april7: safety play by finessing|pg||
nt|newmoon: Declarer hopes that THEY will break @Ds for him|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 rather -- i didn't notice the @H10|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  even if West switches to a diamond, Walker might fly with the king of diamonds because he was given a chance that he was not due|pg||
nt|ritong: yup|pg||
nt|ritong: good for the show|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|puncher: England's lurking good board has apparently been counter-acted by a lurking bad board, so Wales are unlikely to be caught|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: leaving the hearts late|pg||
nt|ahalim: germ , you Dutch are very lucky, so many sponsors|pg||
nt|milton_se: and the expected 200|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikael_w: yes, now its even a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: now N will get endplayed for only 1 off|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  this board has potential for Ireland|pg||
nt|yuval10: good try by W to put declarer in a guess, but she took the right view|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am not sure we can show board 1 Ernest?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Now they still have to play the new number one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We don't get to see board 1|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont exp that we will see the cards onthe new board 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: see you all soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S+1 in the other room|pg||
nt|mikael_w: see you next half|pg||
nt|Walddk4: by NS|pg||
nt|mamos: good stuff|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We can't give you the layout, sorry|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to our op  Ernst hard job  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The original board 1 was fouled|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I dont think thats the cards. I think they look like the board that was missduplicated|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North and East had the exact same 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: bidding pass-1c-1s-dbl-2s-p-p-d-p-3h-p-p-p. So 3 hearts by east|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So a swibng it will be no matter what|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden has 140 in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: in 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 3@H by Sweden here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: No, by Israel|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, sorry|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3@h looks like you almost can safe right ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h will make for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: And just made|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so a push on last board ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: See you after the break|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't be a push|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7 IMPs to Israel then|pg||
nt|mikael_w: only 10 min break righgt ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 140+140|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel leads by 5 in intermission|pg||
nt|yuval10: 227:22|pg||
nt|yuval10: 27:22 even|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hmmm, not easy to know on the last board. The cards was wrong and we done really know WHAT was wrong?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: we'll probably have 3 more rounds of 4 boards each|pg||

nt|xenya: still 11 -- sorry|pg||
nt|2hplus4: S very conservative whatever N showed|pg||
nt|puncher: is it my connection again or Dave?|pg||
nt|paulg:  careful defence after a passive opening lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  we saw that was worth a swing for Scotland earlier|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ireland may get it back there|pg||
nt|wendle: AS IT STANDS Wales 170; Ire 161; Eng 161 Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 102|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@S X 2@S and than ??|pg||
mb|1S|nt|newmoon: or in 3rd seat, that rule falls away|pg||
mb|d|nt|delberto:  yeah he would never have played KC|pg||
nt|santyclz: That hand could have taken 10 min to play with a trump lead,|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If you need the code, please let me know|pg||
nt|puncher: Yes but I'm going to predict flat-ness even though prediction when commentating is somewhat foolish|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be their polish 1nt ?|pg||
mb|2S!|an|weak|mb|d!|nt|vugraphzzc: They didn't have 10 mins to spare|pg||
nt|paulg:  South showed 19-20 balanced and North passed the 5-card stayman response|pg||
nt|dburn: reasonable facing 19-20, I guess|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This auction is odd too|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Redouble = hearts|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wendle: open room of match 5c will remain open to announce official result (also on www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk)|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: unfortunately the rooms are not linked it seems, so we don't have the comparisons|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h is a transfer showing 4+ spades|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@H looked like a normal contract in the other room - but a bit tricky to make|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Pretty common nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|newmoon: @SA - then @S2 (for a club)... but gets ruffed|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s guarantees 4-card support and a minimum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: TD standing at the table with his arms crossed and tapping his foot?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Ew missed fit again Should they have come in?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Although NS not far from making 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Both would have considered it, given it is a known 8-card spade fit|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Would it really be too much to remind the next organisers of the Camrose to remember to check wifi connectivity at the proposed venue?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Given the time situation I guess we are lost again|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  possible to overstretch here .. i don't think you can make 6@h on a diamond lead or club lead with the 3-0 heart break|pg||
nt|bridgek: 4ha is a good save vs 3sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Sime's double is support, 3 hearts|pg||
nt|paulg:  9 tricks here on the club finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  not point in ducking the heart when you are taking the club finesse into the East hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  matheson will take a safe line for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: escpecially 3@S X :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|bridgek: he can make it if he finesses in clubs, unlikely though|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzzc: Not quite, but 25 mins to play 5 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Spears' sorry|pg||
nt|idc: Rehi all - I hadn't noticed the table reappearing|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome back to Ian Crorie|pg||
nt|puncher: wrong-sided it here - has chances by east|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the hearts could be 6-2 and blocked|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: He will be before the end, then.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|nt|bobholl: not a bad 4@H after @S lead but won't make|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bridgek: then again he'll learn north is 6-4 in the majors and with clubs 5-1 i don't think he can make it any way|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: declarer could take a different view in the trump suit -- but 4@S is always safe as the cards lie|pg||
pc|h5|nt|newmoon: easy game this eh?    well played|pg||
nt|xenya: well this onewill be quick enough|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: Will he make the overtrick?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bridgek: will he play for the club-J with the lenght|pg||
nt|bridgek: I think he should make it actually|pg||
nt|bobholl: you look so foolish if N has Jx in @C :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|newmoon: In OR, South opened 2@D, but West also overcalled 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess he 'll do it|pg||
nt|bridgek: Roald Ramer the dutch trainer hammers on this kind of plays|pg||
nt|milton_se: it´s certainly technically correct|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if N had played the @H k ??|pg||
nt|milton_se: then down|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Sjoert: tja tja...|pg||
nt|milton_se: could have played @HQ earlier, but a bit hard to foresee|pg||
nt|bridgek: I've heard Huub Bertens complain about him going down beacause he played for a Q with  the length. He blamed Roald for this|pg||
nt|bobholl: huubke is a very good guesser :) |pg||
nt|bridgek: certainly after he has gone down|pg||
nt|bobholl: brink is contemplating this very long :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: who wouldn't :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but to prevent roalds comments he'll finesse @C i guess|pg||
nt|bridgek: Actually i think Huub is a very fine technical player and his guesses are more technique than intuition|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is that the well-known pause: ALIBI - when it goes wrong, you can tell partner: I thought about it|pg||
nt|milton_se: lol |pg||
nt|bridgek: Yes!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Bas leaves the table: i can't take it anymore :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Sjoert: then i'll take a bit more time... |pg||
nt|bobholl: these decisions can drive you crazy :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  i'm guessing a heart would be led at this table|pg||
nt|paulg:  so just making game will minimise the loss for Scotland|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|april7: if EWplay DONT, then 2@D is a good bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be spades and another suit |pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@d a good spot here|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   playable|pg||
nt|newmoon: interesting hand this... 4@H, 4@S or 5minor all possibilities|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Anyone for a bid with Murdoch's cards or too light for you?|pg||
nt|puncher: not everyone would overcall 1@H here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson have taken a very forward approach this weekend, it has been noticeable|pg||
nt|puncher: north will show a constructive 4card raise?|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@c is strong of cource|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: 3H Adam thinking|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  so i don't think constructive raises are part of the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  should get @d right after the overcall|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@S = weakish, 3@C will be a good raise in @S|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course, Walker and Short have to start bidding at some point|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Walker will double this|pg||
nt|puncher: the 2N is a little joke by west?|pg||
nt|puncher: dbl by south for take out here|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the opponents passed over 2NT, you think West wishing he'd just bid 4@h immediately now?|pg||
nt|wendle: As it stands (unofficial) Wales 162; England 160; Ireland 158; Scotland; 156; WBU 152; NI 110|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: South knows that the hand belongs to them.  And is pleased with the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Oh sorry, thought S opened|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks Alan|pg||
nt|puncher: yes sry I forgot about the strong club|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yuval10: North took a view to ignore the @h's|pg||
nt|idc: The Scottish lead is 46 IMPs at the moment, which converts to 22-8 in Victory Points|pg||
nt|bridgek: He gave him too much respect then.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And he saif nothing about NOT playing the @H Q from hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: North; why didn't you play @HQ in trick 2.. :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than a small @H would make it impossible to finesse @C J |pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: It's worth taking an extra minute or 2 in slams and x'd contracts.  He went from +1 to -(2 I think) by not taking that moment.|pg||
nt|paulg:  awkward on a heart lead|pg||
nt|puncher: a bit awkward but this can make|pg||
nt|paulg:  a small club at trick 2 will probably do the trick?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  hard to believe that Short passed|pg||
nt|puncher: given that slam was bid in the other room, passing doesn't actually cost that much|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|newmoon: Very pleased|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: all those interruptions are really annoying :)|pg||
nt|puncher: And they meet Ireland in the final match|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd rather double on the first round, but passing worked out well when he could double on the second round|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: Norman is a bit overstocked in spaded    but still 3NT  seems a little pessimistic |pg||
nt|xenya: easy 12 tricks on a @H lead -- that's what must have happened in OR|pg||
nt|puncher: especially when he knows that Walker's bidding is generally sound|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  Scotland have saved in 7@s on board 28 after Ireland rightsided 7@d|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|h7|pg||
nt|santyclz: One even I could make.|pg||
nt|xenya: me too|pg||
nt|idc: On this lead we may see an overtrick or two|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  Sound is the worst that Walker's bidding gets in my experience, this is not a balancing situation|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: no half-measures for North!|pg||
nt|yuval10: with such a bad suit and all the points elsewhere|pg||
nt|puncher: so, not quite flat-ness then ...|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bridgek: stay of the hearts and he might go down two|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Time play, ask if @Cs break and claim 7.|pg||
nt|puncher: so after these two boards, Ireland will sneak into the lead...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|newmoon: looks like 140, and another 3 IMPs to England   (140-50)|pg||
nt|puncher: England and Wales seem to be having a close match|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2D!|an|1 major|mb|3C!|an|!D at least invitational|mb|3H!|mb|d|mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Interesting start - 2@D "Multi" type, 3@C transfer, 3@H P/C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: the practice match is meant as part of the selection for the dutch open team heading for the bermuda bowl in vedlhoven|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have a 3rd invisible table where Bakhshi-Townsend are playing against Muller-de Wijs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Walddk5 the lone spectator there|pg||
pc|sA|nt|imp_jan: the final 3 pairs which will represent the Netherlands then will be picked somewhere in July by npc Eric Laurant and coach Anton Maas|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: the name of 2@D convention is Woolsey kib informs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well in the civilised world we call it Multi Landy :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|imp_jan: kidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: different name in different lands I assume|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in the western hemisphere they tend to call it Woolsey indeed, and overhere it is called ML|pg||
nt|marcvanb: The format of the match is with an 'anchor table'.|pg||
nt|marcvanb: The result of the open room is compared twice with both closed rooms.|pg||
nt|sharkey: how's the scoring Marc?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So this is the anchor table in this match|pg||
nt|marcvanb: For selection purposes there's a butler, but the players might want to know the teams result too.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you go down in a slam for instance, you may loser 26 IMPs (2 x 13)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: S suspects @H may be 4-....|pg||

nt|mdgraham: dull 4@h EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: I nearly claimed it for him once AD not led|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, Wales with a good lead at the half but England have fought back|pg||
nt|paulg:  played the other way up he could endplay the defence into opening the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: also hand 12 maybe another swing against  England   down in 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H|pg||
nt|puncher: but I don't think that was what happened|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S profitable save (just)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|paulg:  defence could see it happening, so tried to break it|pg||
nt|puncher: but even the ruff and discard only gives the 9th trick doesn't it?|pg||
mb|3H!|an|4!H|mb|3S|nt|ady: a great slam for n/s  here   they will do well to stop out|pg||
nt|newmoon: in OR NORTH played it in 2S - where 1@H - 1NT (showed a @S-suit)|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough call for Walker here|pg||
nt|bridgek: if you guess the trumps, two hearts club ruff and then three diamonds|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: makes 11 with the fortunate diamond position|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  5@c looks best spot|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they will need to lead a @s|pg||
nt|xenya: not a bad 5@C here -- but EW in OR gailed to reach it after the same start|pg||
nt|paulg:  strong sequence from Short but Walker has no aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: *failed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
nt|santyclz: I saw this board in another room, e-w bid to the 5 level and paid the price.|pg||
nt|paulg:  so no danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|puncher: and should be a rare flat board for this match |pg||
nt|bobholl: nice brink card but no difference|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pitiful:  tough for david here|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  a very good contract    fails here|pg||
nt|paulg:  testing lead with the bad spade break, but luckily East has three hearts and the ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N however looks hopeless on any lead -- providing NS defend correctly afterwards|pg||
nt|pfbr: on a @d lead there are 9 tricks arent' there?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes, sorry|pg||
nt|pfbr: luckily david didn't :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so a great lead by N -- only to lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|idc: I'd guess that 2NT must be conventional there, not an uncommon treatment|pg||
nt|puncher: a missed opportunity for the Scots on board 13 as they talked oppos out of the making 3N by doubling them so they removed to a non-making 5D which slipped through|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|puncher: yes and 3@H is minimum with 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Double for the lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: or win the same amount|pg||
nt|puncher: looks like this will be a couple off and given that NS could make 2S, not much in it|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: which is only fair|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Lindsay thinks it may go down if partner leads a heart|pg||
nt|idc: It's right in that a heart is an attractive lead for defence, wrong in that there are 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|puncher: i have to say it's one of my favourite toys - helpful for finding best game or staying out of a poor one|pg||
pc|d6|nt|puncher: North will be miffed that this one can't go off|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, some of us build our whole game on reaching poor games|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|puncher: They seem to have got a little high in the other room|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|pitiful:  this was an unlucky hand for England|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|newmoon: Camrose website:  http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzzc: They wouldn't have on that defence|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  Hanlon opened a 14-16 1NT with his 13 count|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|puncher: it's true that these days most poor games are bid! and many roll in...|pg||
mc|10|nt|idc: The play will be over soon now|pg||
nt|puncher: but it did have some play|pg||
nt|paulg:  Carroll did not even invite, just bid game of course|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, all 3 pairs, some time ago|pg||

nt|imp_jan: but that is something ele of course|pg||
nt|imp_jan: else|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 x Herbst and Ginossar-Pachtman the other two pairs|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: West debating x or 5@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Herbst brothers are unavailable this weekend|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so west has to decide to bid 5@d or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were supposed to be replaced by David and Alon Birman, but David has been taken ill|pg||
nt|vugraphzbr: Jan thinks it's cold so he went to grab his coat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hence the Bakhshi-Townsend combination|pg||

nt|paulg:  We are on the last board of the event. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Alan, for an excellent job.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentator Samantha Punch for her peceptive comments. |pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: this is the last board of this set, we are restarting at 13.15 that's in 50 min from now|pg||

nt|santyclz: Got a trump lead and s shifted to the @d on winning the @c ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: That seems normal|pg||
nt|puncher: Last board so thanks to all for your patience with the dodgy connections|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Many thanks to Melanie Thomas, our excellent operator. Tough conditions|pg||
nt|idc: 4 IMPs but that just takes Scotland to 52 IMPs, still 23-7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and to our commentators, Sam and Ian|pg||
nt|puncher: NS were in silly 6@S instead of a making 6N or 6C (which can go off on a spade ruff)|pg||
nt|paulg:  inally, our appreciation to Sandra Claridge (Bridge Great Britain) together with Alan Jones and the Welsh Bridge Union for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|bridgek: dbl in the open room seems a bit lucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ady: yes    5 unlcuky    spade lead   clubs 3-0   and east doubleton diamond   so in fact Ireland did well to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: good job, thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Hi Anto, it's Laura but I can't talk because I'm BBO op|pg||
nt|puncher: A very thin 4S here but unlikely to get to it|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: That room also got to 3@s on this in a multi mixup.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|idc: East was hoping for an entirely different sort of auction when he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Something from partner, 3@c from him I expect, showing weak hand with long suit|pg||
nt|idc: If dbl is takeout, he'll bid 4@c and then West will have the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Double is a bit dangerous as you must expect to get 4@C from partner now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: now waht does North do?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@C now ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange that a 56 @D fit may be not comes to ligth :)|pg||
nt|po-s: of course it will|pg||
nt|bridgek: I don't think they have discussed this situation, so drijver is probably worried that everything he bids shows 5spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  strange choice by East in both rooms|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, E supported diamonds at his first turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Once bitten ...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I thought choice was 1Nt or X|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree, but that did make things easier for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H looks just about right here|pg||
nt|paulg:  walker did well to bid 1@s, otherwise they may never have got into the auction|pg||
nt|puncher: Game good enough here for a final swing to Scotland |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: goes for it :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H now? or 3@S? or something else?|pg||
nt|xenya: not 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If you bid again (I think you should), I prefer 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  3n a real shot from david|pg||
nt|ady: thin 3NT    will not make|pg||
nt|pitiful:  upgraded his pips |pg||
nt|pitiful:  might now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what is @s 8 lead from|pg||
nt|ady: yes    if he gets this right|pg||
nt|ady: would be a lucky swing |pg||
nt|pitiful:  this will be a big board in the march|pg||
nt|pitiful:  match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: No, it's a bit lily-livered|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1 or 4, I agree.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Will he take the push now?|pg||
nt|po-s: don´t they practise every Friday?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgek: oeps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  Last hand of this set, we'll be back in 18 minutes for the exciting finale of this year's Camrose|pg||
nt|puncher: any point doubling here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Bas; maybe sorry|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: might go down 2 trying heart finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: Hope you all enjoyed this set!   :)     Thanks to BBO for making this VUgraph available to us.  Even poor souls in South Africa can attend now!|pg||
nt|puncher: I guess it's just too hard to get to this one|pg||
pc|c9|nt|idc: Scotland can afford to lose 5 IMPs and still stay at 23-7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is overstating the hand in my opinion|pg||
nt|paulg:  suggests a safe lead, as long as partner does not have the ace|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|idc: North will surely have some of this|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pitiful:  might make if no @c switch|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pitiful:  well done norman|pg||
nt|puncher: kind of inviting the double here|pg||
nt|paulg:  not my style|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h was control showing, presumably 2 |pg||
pc|cA|nt|idc: and this for his second course :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: that was quick -- it seems 3N could be made by squeezing N|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: 1730 restart|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East bid hearts, so a little surprising to have no loser in the suit and four winners!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|puncher: i guess that's no longer 23-7...|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: I think NS have just turned a top into a bottom |pg||
nt|mdgraham: can now manage a club ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|nt|bridgek: not the best set of Brink-Drijver|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|paulg:  I am told the party has already started for Wales|pg||
nt|puncher: And thanks to you Paul - time for a beer?|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I guess they are going to win|pg||
nt|paulg:  glass of red Zinfandel I think|pg||
nt|puncher: Not a great 6N here - 6@C better apart from the ruff... but still a nice end for Scotland|pg||
nt|puncher: well done to Wales - beers all round|pg||
nt|paulg:  bye everyone|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: They can afford 11 and only drop to 22-8, but could be worse perhaps|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|puncher: a good come back from Ireland in this set given Scotland's handy start|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: this will put england further ahead    but they have 2 potential bad results not yet scored|pg||
nt|xenya: well stopped -- actually if E had 4 diamods he probably should bid 5|pg||
