mb|3N|nt|kiwi_joker: South shouldnt be condemned too harshly .. he didnt know about the "diamond surprise" awaiting him; and the fact pd held K@S|pg||
nt|petergill: More likely, the bidding really might be Pass Pass 1NT P 3NT|pg||

nt|petergill: This is the last match of the qualifying rounds. |pg||

nt|bjacobs: Fortune favours the brave, etc etc|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 8 LTC with miniscule offense to defense ratio|pg||

nt|bjacobs: So he settles back into the good ol' trump lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can't say it too strongly - these trump leads without purpose are pure rubbish|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: OK.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwi_joker: sadly, though - must like the previous bd, North's clubs are bad news|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: much like|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Only a @C lead to hold them 110 so =|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|petergill: Some top experts disagree with me. I do not believe that every little thing should be alerted - I simply think that after any Pass by a Multi 2@D opener that shows the suit should ...|pg||
nt|petergill: be alerted. Otherwise, those with no familiarity with Multi 2@d (e.g George) are disadvantaged. |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Sr specs. Can't exsplain why the bid went as it did.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: BUT making the match tighter for shure.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|petergill: I would be happy to play bridge with no other Alerts at all as long as this Pass by a Multi 2@D opener is alerted. In my opinion, it is the single most important Alert in the game ...|pg||
nt|petergill: of bridge, and almost nobody wants it to be alerted. |pg||
nt|andyv:  can't see the harm in that, Peter.  ACBL, when they do allow multi, require printed defenses to it to be given to the opps as well as alerting of all sequences, even when obvious.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: A spec likes the trump lead to "stop ruffs"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it sounds like N/S have a 4-4 fit ... how are you going to stop ruffs with one measly trump lead?|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugrapha1: tx all... back in 30min|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cheers|pg||
