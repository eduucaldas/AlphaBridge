mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Style. I use 3@H as single and @S support|pg||

nt|davestern2: Hi all from the venue|pg||
nt|davestern2: Looks like a 4@S 5!/5@D battle here|pg||

mb|1H|nt|davestern2: The 16 imps is the carry forward prescribed by tthe finishing order in the Round Robin. As pointed out this is somewhat inequitable as Klinger beat Brown twice in the RR|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|vugrapha1: just been informed that the running score incorner is incorrect|pg||
nt|davestern2: A heart lead would be bad|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but 17 would be even...worse|pg||

nt|hoffers: Both pairs play standard.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|davestern2: Not often partner overcalls a diamond and you hold KQ109x|pg||

nt|hoffers: Lilley Nagy's version is classical|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: dilemme - set up a club and weaken dummy|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: many would open that N hand in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|davestern2: Mr Richman sitting behind me is not enamored of the 4@C bid|pg||
nt|davestern2: Prefers a diamond raise|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: X=3@S|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Nice 4@S for EW here, even with two cards (K@S and A@D) offside|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: comment about running score was on advice from fellow operator... so not sure what's going on..|pg||
nt|davestern2: West will raise|pg||
nt|davestern2: We suspect|pg||
nt|hoffers: Having a stop (especially over 1@c) is going out of fashion|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Two colored by S and a nice end EW |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: +2 next|pg||
nt|davestern2: Double by Christie described his hand rather well|pg||
nt|ianmcc:  I think 4@s was luckily on so 4@h a steal|pg||

pc|c9|nt|davestern2: Oops|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: and*|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On hands like this, it often pays to declare rather than defend.  Defending is so much harder|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|rodal f: But first trick can't be right if 4@S ans S to lead.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Normal lead at 4@S is @H and if S turn @D? 10.     Can be a IMP in EW here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|chilloncan: green on white in 3rd seat, N has a hand most would regard as suitable for a 1S opener. one hand proves nothing and resulting as a general habit is pernicious to devloping ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: judgment, but empirical results are not meaningless...and here 1S by N  might very well find E as declarer in 2N or maybe even 3N|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: And there you see it.  West probably needed to switch to a spade through|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: It was a ask by biddig tempo.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D from me. WHY?|pg||
nt|hoffers: At last a hand of interest. KH have done well to bid game. Now Ron needs to get clubs right|pg||

nt|bjacobs: But perhaps a better hope was simply that the short clubs were with the 3-card spades|pg||
nt|davestern2: If opps get to five minor NS will have their work cut out needing to pick up @HQ9|pg||
nt|davestern2: to make 5 Spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard, but not impossible, to visualize|pg||
mb|2D|nt|davestern2: Hmmm how often do you have 100 hounrs to six and partner opens that suit|pg||
nt|hoffers: South bidding 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: never - it's in the notes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwi_joker: if 4@H from E, South will be twitchy  :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not too hard to pick up the hearts|pg||
nt|davestern2: Well if they steal my bid (2NT) I'll steal theirs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Invers minor=10+ I belive|pg||

nt|davestern2: Yes Bill as I;ve discovered nothing is very hard as a BBO Commentator|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, this one is easy for everyone.  East has the short hearts, so finesse through him.  What could be simpler?|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: S safing in|pg||
nt|hoffers: At risk of playing in 33 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 4@C spilinter=max one|pg||
nt|noodle:  S learnes he's off 2 key cards  :P|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The right contract here is 3NT, but it's unlikely to be reached.  No harm will be done in 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West has the short hearts ...|pg||
nt|davestern2: Agree and it is likely.........|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I doubt Smolanko will let them play it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: So S mean that N at vul 3@C don't have cards? X 100 by 100 times from me.|pg||
nt|davestern2: Agree they will bid 6@D a lot of pressure on Christie|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good insurance|pg||
nt|davestern2: Cheap insurance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 9 or 10 tricks. If @S lead 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: But ain't easy from AKXX|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|chilloncan: 6H is not a hopeless spot, a priori spade lead is likely thn just need 32 hearts|pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hi there Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the ACBL "printed defence" is a joke - it makes the Multi look like a major weapon that requires pages of defence, when in reality the Multi 2@d is a popgun that requires 2 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3 lines of defence. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: board 22 was fowled getting replayed now|pg||
nt|andyv:  we've gone thru this board a couple of times|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah, that's about it|pg||
nt|davestern2: Thats the real value|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I think you need to keep going with 7@D|pg||
nt|davestern2: 4@S a bit unlucky here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so would be 4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Fun to come? |pg||
nt|rodal f: U are for shure correct by the result Daniel, but looked like a -1|pg||
mb|p!|nt|chilloncan: there is another thing too....when opps are in mere game and they would have made slam on any lead but club, you for sure dont want to lead a club. and a trump lead is the one that ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: will make them most wistfuyl of all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: How to bid this by best control?|pg||
nt|rodal f: That intervention made it hard for E but easy for W|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nice logic... psyching the opps out....|pg||
nt|davestern2: Send more chips to table 2 please|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@S  is pretty interesting to play ... |pg||
nt|davestern2: Vwery but should fail on a heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Should it?  Might not a safety play be a good idea in spades?  Cash the ace?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it's much harder on a diamond lead though|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kiwi_joker: South shouldnt be condemned too harshly .. he didnt know about the "diamond surprise" awaiting him; and the fact pd held K@S|pg||
nt|petergill: More likely, the bidding really might be Pass Pass 1NT P 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, North will lead a heart and 3NT should make comfortably|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last match of the qualifying rounds. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If if it is played by E (mosty unlikely), declarer can counter a club lead by ducking twice..and the major suit kings are ideally placed for him|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: cards are wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: Four teams qualify for tomorrow's semi-finals, then the Grand Final is on Sunday|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a bit work to do also for EW|pg||
nt|petergill: 6 teams in the field - 2 are about to get knocked out|pg||
nt|petergill: Team Bailey is running 4th and one of the favoured teams - Neill - is 5th|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: the scores are at: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=spo|pg||
nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/2011/spo/cards/Anderson-Smolanko.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: After 3 boards of this last qualifying match, Neill leads 14-11 imps ref http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=spo&E=0&T=S&R=10&U=5|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I belive Anderson will go for it now. The slam in @H|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: My point being that Multi 2@d is feared in America due to the length (and existence) of the written defence they provide, which does more harm than good, given that the main aim of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: good bridge is to avoid distraction and focus on being "at the table".|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the more psychological hangnails you can get the, picking, the more chance for distraction:)|pg||
nt|davestern2: Well that discussion was all a waste of time|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  I agree...if they simply let multi to be played all the time, players would eventually learn how to deal with it...all conventions take some time for the public to accept|pg||
nt|petergill: PO is right in theory, but in practice virtually nobody (except me, who gets laughed at when he does so) ever alerts the Pass that shows 6 spades. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bailey's lead over Neill for 4th spot is down to 7 VPs now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Hoffman can gain 5 imps on board 22, they will win this set|pg||
nt|po-s: I certainly do, particularly against unknown opponents who may never have heard of Mult...|pg||
nt|davestern2: Bill have you spotted a super safety play for this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5? what was X?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The $64 question, that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Clearly, E/W have had an agreement malfunction|pg||
nt|ianmcc: support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I'm told Anderson explained X as "takeout"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sr. Christie came as a frech wind.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B2 NS fighted to there max 3@S and got a doubble score 6IMP.|pg||
nt|petergill: Neill has 3 boards to gain 7 VPs, with Bailey having one board to go before they (?) qualify. |pg||
nt|petergill: It will be a major surprise if Neill fails to qualify. Neill and Gumby were both in the 2007 Aussie Open Team that came 5th in the world, and Lavings - Krochmailk have had ...|pg||
nt|petergill: excellent results in recent years, so Neill has good players in their team. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Thanks all, thats it for today|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Semi finals tomorrow, in 17 hours time roughly|pg||
nt|super nova: Neill is 20-10 up against Klinger.|pg||
nt|super nova: If he gets a 25 he will miss out by 1 vp.|pg||
nt|petergill: As Jamie just pointed out, Bailey has finished play and has taken 4th place. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone - Brown will surely choose to play Bailey (with 16 imp carry-forward)  with Hoffman facing a tough task against Klinger in tomorrow's semis. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Thanks Peter|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: We're closing now ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Amy for a good job, and thanks to convener David Stern and the ABF|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: By the interrupt from NS it was hopless for EW to find the 6@H. Only one quest left. S ask to N after 6@DX|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: No amount of safety playing helps this one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nasty hand, but this should come home with the help of a 3-3 break in a black suit|pg||
nt|hoffers: KH use a 54321 count for NTs, so sometimes they will open 1NT outside the 15-17 range|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|davestern2: Ah sorry Ian I see support for diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: This contract will not be blessed by success, but it's hard to criticize the auction |pg||
nt|chilloncan: Klinger torn no doubt. between the spadish orientation of the hand, and the 9cc of hearts which argue for NT. some could use 3H as a choice-ofgames cuebid here (Ed Manfield, Bridge ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: World circa 1981)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's very tricky though - if he ducks a club, for example, and a diamond comes through, he has to decide whether to finesse before he knows that clubs are 3-3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: -5 is 1100 so still ok over 6@H 1430|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: wd by Chan|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I guess after drawing trumps, he will play on spades|pg||
nt|hoffers: His pips in spades ensure a second trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah - it's completely safe.  He can claim in fact at this point (not that he will)|pg||

pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: For what it's worth (not much), I think Anderson's interpretation is a good one.  3415 shape and a decent hand needs the double|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: B18 gave 2IMP at 110 over -1(50) at 1NT. |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is, some could bid 3H as S to say "pick a game, i am not sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A nice thought ... and it's hard to see it meaning anything else|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|c7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: B19 gave as presumed 1IMP at the 3NT+2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: Whereas with the actual hand, Smolanko can pass, and hope for a re-opening double from partner|pg||

nt|chilloncan: well, also it ist really clear from hat S hand that NS belong in game facing only an invitation. but one thing is sure -- exactly 8 tricks at NT is not a sensible target. |pg||

nt|bjacobs: well, it IS the seniors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think we can assume this was natural bidding|pg||

nt|davestern2: Now Bill you will be here soonish I suspect|pg||

nt|bjacobs: But it's a bit like the earlier hand ... what's the point of playing 2NT?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: most aggressive bid so far here is X|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They are behind screens ... but Ron knows the auction has exploded, because Haughie couldn't bid a non-forcing 4@C then make a grand slam try over 5@C|pg||
mb|6D|nt|rodal f: Not this time:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fortune favours the brave, etc etc|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 8 LTC with miniscule offense to defense ratio|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he's going to have to guess the club suit to make this|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Wrong I was again:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: oh I see - 3 clubs and @hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh this is fun to watch|pg||
nt|hoffers: 1100 will be a good result for NS|pg||
nt|hoffers: 800 in 6NTs|pg||
nt|po-s: spades is best|pg||
nt|hoffers: but hard to stop there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think Klinger is trying to get back to a semblance of a "fit".  If South has club shortage, then maybe he has a little length in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Meanwhile, perhaps Bill Haughie has woken up to the problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In which case he should pass 6@DX|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: So West has 4 hearts, East probably has 5 spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2452?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or 2443?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|rodal f: 2@C Daniel?|pg||
nt|petergill: This board: NS can make 4@S as the cards lie, but it is a fairly lucky make - should they have bid?|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugrapha1: Cannot read the writing, possibly just a checkback-puppet kind of bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, 5@D might be tricky to defeat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: the curious thing is that up to now N has bid pretty conservatively....now he comes out of the closet to make a takeout double on a totally defensive hand....|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: maybe our operator can fill in with the faces|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: It's a bit sad that the silly 2@D=majors opening has worked so well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|po-s: no doubt broader in some directions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You've just gotta discuss it before going into the match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They probably did.  But you've also gotta remember it|pg||
nt|hoffers: May get out for 500 on this lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ianmcc: is there some play for 5@d?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and the raise to 3N is also...well, surprising|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder if South would have been better off trying to exit after @CJ won, in order to learn more about the distribution|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: Eg exit with a heart|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: OK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Well, suppose the defence starts with a spade, and a switch to @HK|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My approach is to make natural overcalls of suits where RHO has only shown at least 4 of them|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: Declarer ducks that, say, and the defence exit ... now East is ripe for a squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suspect the defence need to play a club early, and that might not be easy to do|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|c4|nt|hoffers: Ron has defences aimed at catching out opponents. On this hand the memory lapse has caught them out|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

nt|petergill: South might double 4@C on the theory that partner usually has only one or two clubs, and -50 -50 = -100 might cost only 3 imps if you're wrong to bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|chilloncan: i can live with X also, if consistent with general style. my points were : 1) seeming conflict between this action and previous dossier for N    2) having doubled, N  has no extras|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The swing could certainly go either way on that deal|pg||
nt|hoffers: A pitty since they had gained 25imps before that board|pg||
nt|po-s: Was South really alerted to the meaning of 2@C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: Did Larrys Law work?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps West claimed only 9 tricks, not 10, on Bd 24, given that he had 4 losers. |pg||
nt|hoffers: 9 playing tricks, but Lilley just wanted to open 2@c again!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: why not?  System cards are distributed prior to the event as well ... there was plenty of preparation available|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: 2@C= a color      2@D=majors      2@H and @S= Color + minor      2NT=minor       THAT is cappaletti|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On 1), you probably don't have enough data.  Haughie is a pretty "normal"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sort of bridge player.  On 2), I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: very likely right about (1), have only these two sets to go on|pg||
nt|hoffers: Just a memory lapse|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: needs to pick the @S position to make this|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bjacobs: Yes, that swing was a bit of a gift from the Brown team|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: On Bd 22 , 3NT actually made 10 tricks for 630 to EW, so the score is 41-13. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: all comes down to how declarer plays the diamonds, i guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: if*|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yet another trump lead proving useless|pg||
nt|hoffers: This is optimistic by Lilley (8PTs the way I count)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The hands fit well, but not well enough|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Lilley can't want a slam opposite a passed hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: he can, apparently|pg||
nt|po-s: wanting is easy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: East should switch to clubs for a very good reason ...|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But of course, against 3@H, who cares|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: East has to duck when a diamond is led, as the only chance for the defence is 2 diamond tricks - one @D trick is not enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still ain't down Peter. Ice for @D is the point.|pg||
nt|petergill: so @DQ was not best play|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will pick the @d's now|pg||

nt|hoffers: For those who read Ron's column in SMH a few weeks ago, this is an example: continue playing (ie for Q doubleton onside)|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@D P 2@s to be natural and nonforcing with long spades. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm! has the multi done its evil work again here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  playing 3-2s requires special skill and temperment|pg||
