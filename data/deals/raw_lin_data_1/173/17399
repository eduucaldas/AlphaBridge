mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jtr: 4@h with a guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Gotta guess to bid it first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jtr: Playing weak jumps this should be constructive and North is supermax|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Ciara has never been known to refuse and invitation|pg||
nt|jtr: Either at the Bridge table or the bar|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|henryb:  Hello David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Henry|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: Could guess the @d too of course|pg||
nt|eggy: There is no ruch to play spades and by then East may have shown up wityh quite a bit I think|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|jtr: East seems in a rush to play them|pg||
mc|11|nt|henryb:  partner probably signalled for one|pg||
nt|eggy: Well Ciara may well get them right now as well :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: 10 TRICKS MADE|pg||
nt|jtr: Strong NT next door too so will also be played by South  East has a fairly normal @s lead|pg||
nt|eggy: not 11 surely?|pg||
pg||

nt|jtr: I expect East was waiting for her @dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If not, Steve will help out|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: (I hope)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am extremely busy|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  South seems to be specializing in seven-card majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|henryb:  good pass by N, but in my book S is a little lacking in suit quality and winners to open 4@s red|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland has seen worse 6s|pg||
nt|jtr: Frequently seen them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too ften for comfort|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too fast sorry|pg||
nt|eggy: particularly 2nd seat Henry|pg||
nt|eggy: but I don't think that Ciara is a purist|pg||
nt|jtr: Trouble is, what is the alternative to 4?|pg||
nt|henryb:  that too|pg||
mc|11|nt|henryb:  Pass?? 3@s at red?, 1@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S is my call|pg||
nt|henryb:  How did South make 5?|pg||
pg||

nt|jtr: yes, but are they preferable to 4?  I know i would prefer the @s10|pg||
nt|jtr: Are the tables linked Roland?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jtr: Upgrade|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Yes, the tables are linked|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|eggy: It looks mor obvious to play West for the diamond Ace and a strip squeeze|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jtr: But West is in trouble anyway|pg||
nt|eggy: but that is still and option I think, if you read West's shape, just the throw in is spades now|pg||
nt|jtr: If South reads it|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|eggy: That was hardly a riduclous line wither|pg||
nt|eggy: either|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems harmless to cash the @cs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We believe boards 1 and 2 are scored incorrectly, but the changes are minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I think that may be a result that you can put down to BBO nerves|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: I am sure the operators have been instructed how to correct|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||

nt|007 joosth: wlc all I must say  the crowd is overwhel;ming here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe N will open 3C?|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure we'll get the names in the seats as soon as the operator is able|pg||
nt|007 joosth: vuln  a bit weak  but passing is loosing  often|pg||
nt|chick: 3C is easy,  the real question is what will East do :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E will double I think  to strong 4 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: not a cice hand for EW 4S will probably the contract, but you loose 3 spade tricks. Maybe he can prevent loosing a heart?  I dont think so, but N will never be on lead........|pg||
