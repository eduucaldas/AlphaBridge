nt|chilloncan: in spades. but if S had a real whopper and 4 hearts he would probably double 2S.....predictable that 3H will beget 4H and N is so weak that doesnt rate to fetch fetcing most likely ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S hand -- a meidum good hand with only 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chilloncan: my typing is as execrable as always|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a leviathan of a 1N opener|pg||

nt|othered1: Even if you play 15-18 1N openings, 4.5 quick tricks (from h olding all those aces) is very strong if 15's also can be opened.  But it's their style, not mine|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|othered1: 6@D, not necessarily easy to  find, is a rather good spot.  But a 2N opening may turn it into a transfer then quantitative auction.  1@D opening should give them a better shot at ...|pg||
nt|othered1: it.|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: if that redouble just shows power, it may head the auction in the wrong direction.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chilloncan: IMO 2N would be an uncouth opening on this S hand facing an unpassed partner. 2N is the  1 sam-killer, and here it would be a VUL slam it might obviate|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: XX alreted by N only as support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: It does look like north thinks it shows better support|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That's a weak auction.  Wonder why north didn't try 4@D over 3N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: Over the last few days, I've seen a bunch of redoubles to make things warm and cuddly, get auctions off track|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugrapha2: "sorry partner senior moment"|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i agree, but maybe N had (or thought he had) some reason to believe that 4 KCs opposite was unlikely|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Last board for the match, thanks all|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR got it at the mol?|pg||
nt|petergill: If North alerts South's Pass of 3@C, George Smolanko asks and is told that the Pass shows six spades. That is what alerting is meant to be all about. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A two color this also? Daniel|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Last board at the segment. TKX Daniel. Well done. TKX specs u have been nice by also inputs. TKX also to my co commentator nlu. See u |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Actually we have board 17 to come|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT immensely better contract than the 'blah' 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Can't see the writing, it may be 8-11|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for the Brown team, blah wins this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OK.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwi_joker: sadly, though - must like the previous bd, North's clubs are bad news|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: much like|pg||

pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Only a @C lead to hold them 110 so =|pg||

pc|cK|nt|petergill: Some top experts disagree with me. I do not believe that every little thing should be alerted - I simply think that after any Pass by a Multi 2@D opener that shows the suit should ...|pg||
nt|petergill: be alerted. Otherwise, those with no familiarity with Multi 2@d (e.g George) are disadvantaged. |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Sr specs. Can't exsplain why the bid went as it did.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rodal f: BUT making the match tighter for shure.|pg||

nt|petergill: I would be happy to play bridge with no other Alerts at all as long as this Pass by a Multi 2@D opener is alerted. In my opinion, it is the single most important Alert in the game ...|pg||
nt|petergill: of bridge, and almost nobody wants it to be alerted. |pg||
nt|andyv:  can't see the harm in that, Peter.  ACBL, when they do allow multi, require printed defenses to it to be given to the opps as well as alerting of all sequences, even when obvious.|pg||
