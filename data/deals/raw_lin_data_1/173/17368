mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: I agree with them|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cicus: me too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I prefer to show at least 9 of my cards rather than just 6 by rebidding 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I know that some rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|cicus: the only problem with that is that they may find N with exactly an invitational hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|cicus: with which he might rebid 2NT or 3@S|pg||
nt|cicus: too bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is quicky a couple down if they want all their tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HA, club switch|pg||
nt|psridhar: In the auction 1@h-1@s-2@d...the 4th suit is space consuming 3@C and with that South hand u know it is damaging when pd is passed hand|pg||
nt|cicus: N should have passed 3@H I think, based on his PH status|pg||
nt|cicus: and he might have bid 3@D instead of 3@C|pg||
nt|psridhar: best was for N to raise 2@d to 3@d as the other tbl|pg||
nt|cicus: PH=passed hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|psridhar: passing 3@H might entail the risk tht Opener was only looking for the right game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Zack can also insert the jack and get a ruff later. However, he does not know that declarer has no spade|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so this is the 'simple' way|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|hJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|psridhar: So Israel draws first blood here|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 Imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At table 3 the sccore is 110 NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So NL lose 2 x 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|cicus: opener will bid his full hand after a passed hand 3@C I think, perhaps bidding 4@C with a choice of games hand|pg||

nt|sharkey: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, so we are back for the thrilling end|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting to see whether East will open 1NT or upgrade to 1@h here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi there Carl and welcome|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I think e is way to strong to show 15-17|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he opens 1@h they might reach over 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Israel jr. pulled out the close first half to lead by 5 |pg||
nt|sharkey: 4 in either M probably|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 1@h and then show 18-19 bal seems right I think on that hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: I prefer 1@H with East hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h - 1@s - 2NT - 3@h ( ? ) 4@h ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Now discussing defences|pg||
nt|sybarra: after 3 @H you may hear 4 @D by E |pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi shirley :) yes, after sweden took a great lead Israel came closer and closer and on the last board they got to the lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Unless they probe for slam with a 2 NT rebid....|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just got in on last bd when it had not been decided yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: E might even open 1 nt ?|pg||

nt|lestergold: surely south has opebned 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: nope, south has passed and it's Fisher who opened the auction.|pg||

nt|jcomyn: I have been called a lot of things but never natasha|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like it - in the UK we call 2@d showing both majors a Norweigan 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  going to keep NS out of their 4-4 @s fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: south maY FIND IT HARD TO TRY 3@S THEN|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: misdeal, North and East same hand|pg||
nt|milton_se: excellent 6@C at once|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: We are on catch up here it seems |pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: begorrah theres a nt for you|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in nv. 2NT = minors weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: light double from south   with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd guess sime/matheson|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and herm hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all from rainy Wash. DC |pg||
nt|lestergold: Germ hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: names would ne nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: the operator will get them up shortly |pg||
nt|sybarra: i think we are in a mad scramble at the moment to catch up |pg||
nt|lestergold: a borderline 3n  available here for N/S which shouold be bid really|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1st example of youthful exuberance...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empting 2@c bid:)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi bruce |pg||
nt|kemperg: racognized your name|pg||
nt|jcomyn: natalia i mean|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello Arifin, Joe, Dennis and specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well try 3@h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 of @D is very important here|pg||
nt|bobholl: will tehy reach the fairly good 6@C ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: semi-forcing 1NT: often played as in opener being free to pass with 5332 minimum  |pg||
nt|rhelle: vaak is 4@d nu alleen een slam poging, niets anders|pg||
nt|bridgek: het belooft wel 2 van de drie, maar.....|pg||
nt|bridgek: zit het snitje goed of niet|pg||
nt|rhelle: toch moeilijk om er niet eentje bij te doen, met 20 en 4 azen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: slam op snit (H)  of dubbele snit (S)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: weak two diamonds or strong I guess|pg||
nt|kemperg: O no dear|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised South bid not try 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: nope 4@s makeable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would have been hard for West to find the @c lead against 3NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt is a fair shot on S hand:)?|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably didnt like his stiff @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should have found a bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi arifin arened you in the OR?|pg||
nt|ahalim: 2@H sone sort of Ekren ?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Ritong lui a soufflé pas juste !|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Ralf, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 10-boards matches, so each of them is important|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at these colours putting a spoke in is not soley confined to juniros|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike and Bruce @H@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: as the cards are in def it looks like a @s slam is aliot better, I dont think its an easy @c-lead from N|pg||
nt|bridgek: that 2di bid may actually help them reach 4sp|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roel and specs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson, in my eyes, easily the best Scottish pair this weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  Mesbur/Fitzgibbon, perhaps the most experienced pair at the event|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, half time scores: Wales 168; England 161; Ireland 161; Scotland; WBU; NI 104|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is it doesn't take up very much space|pg||
nt|sybarra: I beleive the operator is catching up,    |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing what does he leave the x in with i wonder|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a bad slam|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like E will compete to 2@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like 2@d and 2@c to lose in 3@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we see 4 @D bid |pg||
nt|sharkey: @SQ key card either case if non-@C lead|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep|pg||
nt|ritong: i dunno, but 3NT has play|pg||
nt|ritong: ba, je suis un garçon simple  j aurais fait ça, alors je suppose naivement qu ils vont faire pareil|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is aggressive when 3@s can be bid on that junk|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree - 4@S too optimistic here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this bidding system presumably weak no trump will get e/w too high pretty quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aggressive isd hardly the word|pg||
nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it did its work|pg||
nt|m_niemi: hearts length in left so RHO will overruff hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: a comfortable start |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi germ|pg||
nt|ritong: bien que pour nous, il existe la réponse de 2SA|pg||
nt|ritong: qui est gênante|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: qui obliger à jouer |pg||
nt|ritong: oui  pas gai|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C is by far better than "fairly good"!|pg||
nt|bobholl: dit is het nadeel van ongedisiplineerde preempts je komt in 6 als het minder is :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: alleen ha snit|pg||
nt|rhelle: zonder @d start is het een prima slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H seems to be the destination|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S can move|pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anderson and Greenwood one of the most experienced pairs in the event|pg||
nt|paulg:  David Greenwood, known as jtr on BBO, is also a frequent vugraph commentator|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good morning all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Jim|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@C opening in a youth match|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have an exciting week of bridge planned with the jrs. |pg||
nt|lestergold: no @d opening by N?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@d |pg||
nt|lestergold: not available|pg||
nt|lestergold: in which case i'dopen 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: nv|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D I ment|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: not so much mini as micro|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what i wasw asking is if the polish juniors are sons of well known fathers|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant bid it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree|pg||
nt|kemperg: I understood|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, it's the younger son of Krzysztof Jassem on South|pg||
nt|kemperg: only pepsicola is not there|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks the likeliest outcome here|pg||
nt|sommer: upside down count, so @CK is safe|pg||
nt|sommer: there's some work to do for E, but it's makeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to believe a jr didn't open the n hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks:(|pg||
nt|ahalim: if a @H is led|pg||
nt|kemperg: and ducked|pg||
nt|ahalim: of course|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w has to do that|pg||
nt|bobholl: n with his 2Q's difficult|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 5K ontkent een controle in zijkleur neem ik aan, dus je weet dat het op snit is|pg||
nt|bridgek: geen entry's voor twee sch snits|pg||
nt|bobholl: de professor vindt dat wel :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: zelfs jij zou die start vinden schat|pg||
nt|bobholl: senioren doen wel eens wat goed :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: lol|pg||
nt|bridgek: goede hand voor Tarzan|pg||
nt|007 joosth: zeg Hans, Bob is niet Tarzan |pg||
nt|007 joosth: nu moet h snit goed zitten en 1 vande schoppens|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: no problem here in 4@H I think|pg||
nt|bg: W can get two red aces but he has to cash them|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all from sunny Dortmund|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|santyclz: So w must play the J to attempt to induce s to win the trick.|pg||
nt|sharkey: West may not be done - all prime values|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45: This might go one off - @D not behaving and the @C Ace off-side|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n for N/S has a  fair chance|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C as w2 in@D or something strong is very popular in the Netherlands, I do not like it|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: and Mike|pg||
nt|tomi2: gives your opps the chance to double 2@C, pass and double 2@D, bid directly or await things and balance later|pg||
nt|tomi2: north now knows his partner can't be too strong for his double, so he won't push to games in doubt. same as if S had overcalled / balanced, north has one useful information|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|sharkey: He was....|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard gave W not encouragment |pg||
nt|yuval10: W has done extremely well here, so tough not to be tempted|pg||
nt|ritong: il va perdre quatre plis|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: obligerait  à jouer   3 @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@D DID DAMPEN THE AUCTION|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 1@s response probably put a damper to any further action|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/7024/clubcompetitie_2.html  for results and butler-ranking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Geoffrey|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pitiful:  how good is 6@s on say a trump lead|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 losers but I am not sure there are 9 winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: list of all participants |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Suppose taht E/W do not play negative double, East has a problem. Would then bid 2 @S|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon|pg||
nt|hawe45: 10th trick now|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought they were hutling towards a slam there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: right tx|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25 pts to start with|pg||
nt|milton_se: on their way, it seems|pg||
nt|bridgek: hi all|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pitiful:  assume opps have not bid|pg||
nt|ady: only 1 top loser in spades   but with spades 4-1  difficulties at the slam level|pg||
nt|sommer: @H shift?|pg||
nt|kemperg: teh best|pg||
nt|sommer: a minor is sensible too, but not best|pg||
nt|sommer: wonder why S didnt continue @C's|pg||
nt|kemperg: No E has 8 pts not 0|pg||
nt|yuval10: W can't even be sure his side has a 8-cards fit|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why not 3@d loosers?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i wonder what the real auction was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would not want to bid a slam single dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on these cards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi michael|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: Those Israeli' hate mistakes|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ahalim: roland told me closed room :(|pg||
nt|ritong: never mind|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: he will tell you if needed|pg||
nt|ritong: ça se passe bien aussi a sans atout|pg||
nt|bobholl: good bidding |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think south although minimum might/should have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: HI BOSS|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  @h10 from Walker to show diamond interest|pg||
nt|puncher: Exciting time for Wales - when was the last time they won it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks Alan, of course we know international bridge players are hopeless with bridgemates|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here, so no hope |pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not a great contract even without this lie of the cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Riccardo Rubino|pg||
nt|rich89: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: ciao ricardo |pg||
nt|santyclz: Even at favorable, qjxxx at the 2 level is shall we say sub-optimal.|pg||
nt|the saint: South should have doubled 2D to show extras|pg||
nt|kemperg: but  3N makes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont agree chazps|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, if you hold your thumbs for sweden this might be a scare board|pg||
pc|d5|nt|puncher: Ireland will be looking for a big win here to nail the camrose - Wales and England also hoping for big wins - any of these three could win it|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have never won|pg||
nt|mamos: this will drift off could EW make anything much?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3CX more interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: amazing, wd:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I am a great admirer of Jassem's book|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C asking for 4 and 5 card major - 3@D = no 5 card but 1/2 4 card, 3@S = 4 card @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK Wessel|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  everyone I know would open 1@h on the South cards|pg||
nt|hawe45: Better late than never - hi|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kemperg: morning Ricardo|pg||
nt|lestergold: east strong no trump opener they play in 2@h|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: reasonable contract that is not easy to make|pg||
nt|tomi2: he has 6 fast losers her|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl shd try for a slow @H trick|pg||
nt|xenya: actually declarer will do well to get out for -1|pg||
nt|tomi2: will have to work for -1 only|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps the 2@c opening worked this time :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D would have worked as well or maybe better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a vfery impressive bidding sequence|pg||
nt|kemperg: lot of nerve from W|pg||
nt|kemperg: I know|pg||
nt|bobholl: a typical "brink" card not the normal K|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gowdy: a trump lead in these 2 syuited auctions often work best  as here|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but look it has shut them up when they have a chance of a vul game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think so|pg||
nt|mamos: Yes Sandra Rimstedt must have high hopes of beating this|pg||
nt|davidstern: Mike Bruce and (@H) Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David welcome |pg||
nt|jcomyn: helps tell why israel leading|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 "tricks , sp some work for decl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what about gold old herbert|pg||
nt|kemperg: somewhat oldfashioned|pg||
nt|bobholl: good decision ( 1imp) from jan (jansma)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sch H sorry|pg||
nt|bridgek: noord is aan het denken of hij deze preempt aan partner kan uitleggen|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: 3@c would have been close, perhaps struggling on a forcing game in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of the reasons i do not like weak no trump because it forces you to a 2 level rebid with a 17 COUNT|pg||
nt|lestergold: I SHOULD SAY MQANY REASONS|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock sorry|pg||
nt|mamos: no  messing  :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont mind the lead|pg||
nt|bg: good try by west when your own suits do not look promising try to hit partners suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Partner could equally have held J10xxx instead of 109XXX|pg||
nt|kemperg: with @H breaking yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: up!! |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  good duck by Norman?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: doesnt matter what he does does it?|pg||
nt|puncher: Even more exciting then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best is now a @d finess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats the point of playing take-out double when you hasve the perfect hand for penalties|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you dont know 3nt is making - you DO know 3D is going down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|peachy: The point of playing takeout dbl on the 3-level is well made by Mike Lawrence, Larry Cohen, and other bridge authors|pg||
nt|kemperg: right John|pg||
nt|peachy: No doubt leaving in this time would have been better|pg||
nt|kemperg: we wood|pg||
nt|kemperg: would|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andreasw:  Hey Hans:)|pg||
nt|ritong: donc un tres léger gain possible pour les français|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h not all that great a contract...could easily be down 2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: 4@H makes double dummy -- but it's a tall order|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - but here West should have played trumps - after the nice lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite   but some play it here as penalty|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should have x available for takeout / show values|pg||
nt|mamos: not so easy |pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to me but then I am an auld fella|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like both sides has a 8-cards fit , so not competing to 2@s is surely a losing bridge for the long term|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Hans|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: just drop the @HQ and guess clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: And if slightly strange things happen, even Scotland could still do it|pg||
nt|sommer: now 9|pg||
nt|kemperg: no defense left now|pg||
nt|ahalim: I like it here with you guys :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dagold: seems to be  atrick short|pg||
nt|puncher: But can they hold on to their current lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they will be very nervous, but even more so their supporters, NPC and sitting out pair|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  declarer should probably have played the @dJ there|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short would not lead small from the @dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  so he must have the @dK ... often right to play your middle honour of a sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if clubs were 3/2 they would take a further 3 tricks with a ruff|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed|pg||
nt|hawe45: But cross-ruff will appear|pg||
nt|bridgek: I assume 3ha showed shortness|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: S could have doubled 3@H, showing a good hand, but the final contract would have been the same|pg||
nt|jcomyn: isnt she the brazen hussy with her 10 count|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  Scotland can help themselves, and Wales, by keeping Ireland at bay|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|bridgek: so the lead is normal|pg||
nt|bobholl: convenient that 2@S was forcing :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|puncher: yes that's true - it's probaby the worst for the sitting out pair|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, halftime scores: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ireland 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I am "on" the other fashon of BBO, have no coq...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: claim time|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but if you open these hands you should see it through|pg||
pc|c9|nt|the saint: I'm a little surprised, South isn't normally that reticent from what I recall|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  don t worry|pg||
nt|bobholl: simon kan toch wel een @H missen|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  sry private|pg||
nt|kemperg: for E it could be 7, but thats enough|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|davidb: hello  from telaviv|pg||
nt|xenya: first blood to France it seems|pg||
nt|ritong: i think so|pg||
nt|bridgek: zelf denk ik dat HVBxxx(x) een hele slechte hand is voor een preempt. de tegenpartij zal het zelden fout doen|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry I was here ready  they started without me  :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  and my own preference with the S hand is to rebid 2@h over 1@s...if there is any marginal game, it will be in the @h suit, not in @ds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: can see 11|pg||
nt|mamos: may end up having to guess which  major to finesse in|pg||
nt|pelu: @S or @H finess|pg||
nt|mamos: that Heart discard suggest North has length in Hearts  so maybe declarer will get that right|pg||
nt|pelu: ecen chance, so @sAK ( the Q could drop) and @H-finess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good morning Mike Peter specs and all|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: wouldnt it help to bid s along the way|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  12|pg||
nt|puncher: Yes would nice for Scotland to hold onto, and even increase, their lead - though others might not agree :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised N did not try for ruff |pg||
pc|s3|nt|rich89: mistake of failla|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice try from decl.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello Mike|pg||
nt|m_niemi: making if guesses spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: gm Mike|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  N-S are playing 5-card majors, strong 1NT, like many in this event|pg||
nt|paulg:  E-W are playing Blue Club, probably the only ones to do that|pg||
nt|rich89: by*|pg||
nt|lestergold: this defence was not impressive|pg||
nt|lestergold: as illustrated by this crash of honours|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  meanwhile Sime struggles along in 2@h|pg||
nt|pelu: a fantastick proformanse by the Nederland Girls: 18 matches and average over 19 VP! (they are 2.place after Israelæ)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mamos: good afdternoon|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: reticence is not a word we expect to use very often here|pg||

nt|ady: yes   12|pg||
pc|h7|mc|9|nt|xenya: one down, and it looks like 3@H was destined to go down as well |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If you think 4@H is a strange contract, how do you like 5@H then?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because that's what they are in at the 3rd table|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Which he should in my opinion|pg||
nt|mamos: is hussy politically correct expression?|pg||

nt|vugraphzag: politically correct is for wussys|pg||

nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good h contract but at what level|pg||
nt|kemperg: and no rebid problem|pg||
nt|po-s: @C-1H? or do they play transfer responses?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@c - 1@d - 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: as suggest by East' father, who knows their system|pg||
nt|yuval10: and indeed PO, they play transfers over 1@c|pg||
nt|po-s: North will double|pg||
nt|kemperg: and E rdl with 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|po-s: only if they play support D/RD|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl of 1D would mean @Ds|pg||
nt|hawe45: Even I would open 1 @h as South|pg||
nt|lestergold: played too quickly we have seen this so many times in this event|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they are just playing junior style:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: safety play sometimes gives you unexpected dividends|pg||

nt|davidstern: With this now being round 14|pg||

nt|lestergold: if West opems then bidding as many would 4@h probably reached|pg||
nt|sharkey: S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|hawe45: Le score "par" est 5 @H X pour 300|pg||
nt|lebridgeur:  1 @h non critiquable|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: les @c du partenaire ne sont pas une bonne nouvelle|pg||
nt|ritong: c est vrai|pg||
nt|hawe45: Mais bonne nouvele pour Sud|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: Well I'd have opened 1@C before 1@S - except that it'd be a 1NT for me|pg||
nt|gowdy: but back in|pg||
nt|m_niemi: p-p-2@h-3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant pass this out now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be somke sort of ekrons|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will he wopnt he|pg||
nt|ritong: l enchère de 2@c montre un joueur aguerri|pg||
nt|bridgek: maakstart|pg||
nt|bobholl: goed zo hans :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south seems to agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should E raise?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he has 3 useful cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: but it is only an nv game|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a mood thing -does east feel lucky?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm sure would have preferred to have heard 4@c or 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think E has an easy pass|pg||
mb|4H|nt|2hplus4: Tight game missed Declarer perhaps able to endplay S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker has been conservative holding three small clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: u have to bid 4@s with N or you are done up0 like a kipper|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like check back |pg||
nt|xenya: nice analysis :)|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly eight tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: am sure the beer was more important|pg||
nt|sommer: 3rd t/o?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: Neth. has all 4 girls, it is the Neth. Girls team |pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears EW do not use support x|pg||
nt|davidb: EW  make many tricks in H  |pg||
nt|ritong: il sait que ça n en restera pas la quasi surement|pg||
nt|ritong: et préfère donner une bonne information plutot que de faire des sauts de cabri a @h|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pauvre Sud - sans soutien á @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but now?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I certainly would balance now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well Houston we have landed (maybe) |pg||
nt|mamos: South not excited :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has no more ammo|pg||
nt|bg: this should be a good match  at halfway point France in third Canada8th only four make it to KO|pg||
nt|lestergold: qith  experience they will learn the need for maximum pressure|pg||
nt|mamos: East's 4@d  secured a lead in that suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: the real pressure bid is 5@h by west|pg||
nt|kemperg: I played them, they not afraid of going high|pg||
nt|lestergold: many of us would bid a lot of hearts out of terror of an opposition slam|pg||
nt|mamos: and sometimes bidding too much  pushes the oppo to the contract we want to avoid :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but you have to know when to do it quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact |pg||
nt|lestergold: only a @d lead beats 6|pg||
nt|pelu:  @D lead defeat 6@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: by the way it should be a @d lead if 6 is bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: he''s worried now|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c redoubled was not for free|pg||
nt|bobholl: also red ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm imaginative|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least I have pards that would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|rich89: italy lost a simple 4 @s :(|pg||
nt|mamos: no underbidding her|pg||
nt|mamos: here|pg||
nt|ahalim: juniors Mike remember|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that c annot be right|pg||
nt|m_niemi: just 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 20-20 hand, shouldn't be bid too high.|pg||
nt|gowdy: redicent eh|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4s|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4! only down by sigleton@D|pg||
nt|sommer: he passed.. well, it's ok in red zone|pg||
nt|kemperg: rdl by E would de interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: same ide:)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3@c  montrerait quatre cartes à .@h avec des @c   d autant qu'Est souhaite l'entame @c   ici il peut toujours l'attendre|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 2@D showed a good 2@H raise but >>|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 10 red cards I would|pg||
nt|henryb:  Although I think a case could be made for North to bid 2@d over 1N|pg||
nt|bobholl: same red condition :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lead assisting if nothing else|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its a risk i agree but its a bigger risk not bidding it|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by N |pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice and low|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, and that is extreamy fun I think. But dont forget N at this table is a world top player. She is definatly top (5?) in the world all female I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - game's on|pg||
nt|bridgek: normaal natuurlijk, maar toch|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, it is a powerful looking suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the spade force will scupper this|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 4@D alerted by east|pg||
pc|sA|nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe 2@c is puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the phantom of the opera |pg||
nt|mamos: South may be a bit |pg||
nt|lestergold: strikes|pg||
nt|mamos: nervous now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why! @dK behind and @hA|pg||
nt|mamos: Not a classic vil overcall|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I will pass with confidence as S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html  Competitie (left), White House Juniors 2011 for updated results|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think its good enuf with a 6 card suit and a couple of high caRDS|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to bid game now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr west sees 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is   6 (Israel schools) v  7|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|davidstern: minimum|pg||
nt|mamos: as the cards lie  lots of tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: un contre étonnat qq soitle résultat|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gowdy: here 2nt is "super accept" and  3 @H is a retransfer|pg||
nt|davidstern: But that said 1 trick on lead both heart and club honours oincide and diamonds ok|pg||
nt|davidstern: usual case when you are in 1 and swap NS when you bid 2NT|pg||
nt|ahalim: cannot see the 9th trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: they are missing spotcards here in clubs and spades to make an extra trick|pg||
nt|xenya: well it could make on a good day|pg||
nt|jcomyn: boy o boy that surely is weak|pg||
nt|kemperg: and passed 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Junior World Champion in Philadelphia last year...|pg||
nt|yuval10: good competitive bid from S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  730 is also too high|pg||
nt|milton_se: seems makeable|pg||
nt|bridgek: nobody! can ginossar make this?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the @sK surprisingly well positioned this will play well for declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: after a long weekend of watching it is good to have swingy boards to finish to keep us all awake|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would like to bid 2@s, but Sime has not shown any values|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s now is probably the bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is very close to a yarborough  (but for that pesky 10) |pg||
nt|hawe45: If they play 12-14 NT - in my opinion the West-hand is too strong|pg||
nt|gowdy: unsure why not stayman  but very hard to find 6 @H|pg||
nt|hawe45: And 6 @H is lucky|pg||
nt|mamos: my head has exploded|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead says misunderstood|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South's @d length may cause declarer to misguess the @h J|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If he plays trumps 4-0, he is a sure winner|pg||
nt|007 joosth: HBx is nogal veel in een zijkleur    vroeger was het nog verboden|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: or x if you want|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u canr pasws|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All you need is to play opener for the @S King...!|pg||
nt|mamos: BNorth needs to find the @sK  --preferably by playing the Ace !|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand of course is unmanageable|pg||
nt|lestergold: for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h can be let thrualthough it should not make on best defence of course|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can see why south is taking time|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H +@S but Bid of N ? pehaps jusy a weeeeeeak 2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only one answer gives problem*s(|pg||
nt|yuval10: Dutch girls are a true surprise , for me at least. They did tremendously well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
nt|puncher: now will do |pg||
nt|po-s: thought I - apparently these guys know each other...|pg||
nt|davidstern: No good switch here|pg||
nt|tomi2: he might be tempted to duck a heart directly. in case they are 4-4 this opens several squeeze chances|pg||
nt|peachy: Not necessarily, there is a style where first seat favorable systemic can open very weak, but of course I do not know their system|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit unlucky cant get partner in|pg||
nt|sharkey: I stated that Netherland had a girls team, Shirley, but I was quickly reminded that a boy had been standing in on an occasion :)|pg||
nt|ritong: 960 on my abacus|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: theplay will be swift|pg||
nt|gowdy: to be sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: but at fave vul south should protect with 2@H you need to contest these 20/20 hands to get the plus|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.  I'm still reeling from the initial pass.|pg||
nt|bg: 2 clubs is invitational check back I believe 2dia would be GF checkback|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, the Israeli jrs have been looking very strong this year |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: kq of @C dropping :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: bij deze kwetsbaarheid mag er heel veel :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|puncher: yes so should be a comfortable make |pg||
nt|puncher: west endplayed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: fast enough? :)|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they did well in Philly at the worlds (they won jrs)   |pg||
nt|bg: trans national mixed teams won by Daniel Lavee and co|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they don't ruff @C they can't ?!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @dJ and let N decide|pg||
nt|henryb:  Why does Paulissen not draw trump. Now he is down|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
nt|pelu: strange play|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, thats why a @H contract is best in S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  short conservative because his opener is minimum and they are non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: should scrape home|pg||
nt|lestergold: once in a blue moon dummy has tghe  earth and ur partner has zilch and a misfit but more often u get done out of a game|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder what the alert was |pg||
nt|roswolf: SOS?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe dbl by W would have shown NT hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like that, Geoffrey:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes with a big balanced hand west would normally double|pg||
pc|c8|nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fairly comfortable as you have the @s10|pg||
nt|paulg:  might make an overtrick on this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: declarer got tired of S thinking about ruffing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@H in OR ends in 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @sK, @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2nd in hand should always be sound but by todays standards it was just about an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: teams changed a lot since then, the Israelis have two new pairs|pg||
nt|bg: problem arises when too much weidght put on Queens and Jacks for point count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: France lost Bessis-Volcker|pg||
nt|lestergold: cost 2 tricks in practice|pg||
nt|kemperg: Still down, @S K, @S A, @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unimportant in 1@h|pg||
nt|kemperg: you know that by hart|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 760|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: i often score that in opponent's column|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the failure to protect was simply giving the opps an easy ride for no good reason|pg||
nt|bobholl: cross ruff :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes W quite conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: you still use an abacus ? no calculator ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite our comments, this contract looks like it's destined for only down 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If they doÂ´nt cover, they doÂ´nt have it...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think it deserved to be hammered|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt get the match points|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that South bid only 1@d because of the vulnerability |pg||
pc|h6|nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
nt|xenya: none of the key suits break evenly|pg||
nt|tomi2: the black suits break squeeze-friendly but not the hearts of course, if had he tried this|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl chooses the straightforward line of either black suit breaking 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes or QJdoubleton in @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: now W|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S K|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to blame anyone for this. But both N and S were a little passive|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not @c9?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Das can Ich Dier nicht sagen|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: my guess is he takes the spade hook |pg||
nt|lestergold: maxi looks like this heart the ruff and a trump|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has good values, so 1@h opening is correct |pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: misdeal board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Mikael and Arifin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Ernst, our operator|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi everybody :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Hi|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Roland and Mikael|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
nt|paulg:  cannot cost to put the @d8 in|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|sommer: didnt expect 4:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and the poor @d spot cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this is not an easy game to bid even if you are not disturbed|pg||
nt|bridgek: west must drop KQ of clubs on  a ruff to test south|pg||
nt|bridgek: mijn maat opende  2M met AKJxxx,xx,t9xxxx en x,AKVxxx,Txxxx,B en Bx, Atxxxxx,Kx, VB kwestie van stijl?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: place your bets  will he make ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: (unfortunately)|pg||
nt|ritong: i have a mobile abacus:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: calculator is so 90's|pg||
nt|bobholl: it comes down to the @H guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good start for E/W, but now...|pg||
nt|milton_se: can even afford to draw trumps now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With S long in @C and @S declarer suspects @H A falling|pg||
nt|bg: ok now S had to continue Dia or lose it|pg||
nt|sommer: .."only" 3@H|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|puncher: so if you lead a trump you should lead a low one here - declarer could have played the 8@D for the overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: or this same|pg||
nt|mamos: @sK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or maybe 2@d would have been something other than weak|pg||
nt|bridgek: declarer knows west to be 6-4 in spades-diamomds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: die 2e lijkt me niet erg best|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  Walker and Short have a tendency to avoid thin games. They are often in the par contract but the trend is to bid these games and challenge the opponents to beat you|pg||
nt|davidstern: question now is how much west trusts the defenders|pg||
pc|d9|nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||
nt|newmoon: plse stay tuned - we have a problem|pg||
nt|newmoon: will he make it tho?  has to hook @C10 after 2@Hs|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree with Shirley  I dont think so|pg||
nt|mamos: nope|pg||
nt|mamos: -750 or even 950|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for 6 imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: can S bid 2N Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|ahalim: a funny thing happened on  !, N and E had the same hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think this will be an really intresting match between a verry talanted swedish team vs a Israel that has been dominating this tournament so far|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: hoping for 3-3 split|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short will be telling Walker to evaluate better and raise with his six count|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure Matheson will say that playing the @dK guarantees the contract, which is the prime objective at the end of a tough weekend|pg||
nt|puncher: absolutely|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is a risk you will be put up to game by opps thos|pg||
nt|henryb:  although it does not matter|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: hi again|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Insted of 1@h i would dbl on W hand after pass first time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would be tempted to dbl too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: hi mike|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|mikael_w: And Hi Arifin :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Filé|pg||

pc|hK|nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
pc|d7|nt|m_niemi: declarer playing pairs|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is absolutely clear is that south had two opportunities to enter the auction and availed himself of neither this is not recommended|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be costly for the dutch :(|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|newmoon: rehi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky/unfriendly this |pg||
nt|bg: could be a swing on that board if France finds 3nt instead of 4 dpades|pg||
nt|andyv:  again, maybe not|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dJ|nt|ahalim: Yes, North is a very promising player|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: the 8@s is starting to look like a big card|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|c7|nt|ritong: bingo bongo|pg||

nt|puncher: it's all so public these days too - with all of us watching over their shoulders - it adds to the pressure of a long weekend|pg||
nt|sybarra: the joy of jrs, "keep the game moving" |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s is not a junior contract omn thiose cards actually not a senior one either|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont  understand WEst's play  :(  panic?|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East may not be expecting an opposition slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: may not be that easy to bid 16 opp ten and lots of wasted values like 8 points not needed its effectively a combined working 19 points|pg||
nt|mamos: South has proved he can count to nine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mss rimstedt will get busy here|pg||
nt|po-s: he doesn´t want opponents tu suffer|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now some fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south has a weak 2 for me even tho he has 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahalim: S to N : " Not my day to-day: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Vincent is it Tim?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the folly of youth with an 8-count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes it is|pg||
nt|mamos: hehe  i wondered Girls Team|pg||
nt|kemperg: wich team is it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: first part score for a while|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: or 1@D and jump to 2NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to see any result here other than 3n+2|pg||
nt|sommer: he showed a weak hand already, and N showed around 18, so no leb imo|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but they surely play Leb|pg||
nt|sommer: but not here|pg||
nt|ahalim: hi mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wowee a grand in the offing|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Pd might pass 1@h when you have an 8 card @s fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is East going to pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting board here too|pg||
nt|bridgek: dit zijn de 3sa-en waar ik van hou|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I even think my grandmother would get to 6 @S's|pg||
nt|m_niemi: for me too|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has finally found the bidding box|pg||
nt|gowdy: those don't look like 4 @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly John|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW may have some problems to find @s-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm generally more worried about my opponents than the vugraph audience|pg||
nt|kemperg: will this end in 2@S by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there something wrong with 3 nt?  can you make it?|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could try a small diamond when W had pitched a diamond, risking 3 down, but preserving some chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: the girls team|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H and N will go to 4|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe so|pg||
nt|sommer: in that case, they needed a bad defence:)..or flat board|pg||
nt|mamos: bet they dont|pg||
nt|ahalim: six they will bid for sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i supposxe 6 is where they end up|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Nope:)|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure top-10, but top 3?|pg||
nt|sybarra: vulnerability favors e/w |pg||
nt|xenya: did i really type that?|pg||
nt|ritong: never mind|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Est il utile de préciser que la donne 15 est un énorme swing pour Israël?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: and bridge is about creating problems for theopps|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??????:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: which he joined earlier this week, they havent enough players in the girls team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is getting very confusing|pg||
nt|ahalim: this shd be a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT only game I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: East will probably come with 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s is 8-11 3 @s's|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT not reachable though|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3@c-3@h and then V has a real problem|pg||
nt|sharkey: If East bid 3@C Vulnerable may get to 3 NT - tough now|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: somewhat strange 1N by E|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s is an old fashioned Acol Strong Two|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What kind of 2@S is that?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is either natural, gf, or a good heart raise|pg||
nt|puncher: I'm sure some prefer the good old days when you went off for the weekend and your bad bids and plays weren't scrutinised by all|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean J@s not needed combined 18|pg||
nt|gowdy: x or 2nt ?|pg||
nt|gowdy: and avoiding you own|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East X = take out to @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so had to pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h now or 4@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet n/s flop into 4 @S somehow |pg||
nt|bg: nice pass by S tempting to preempt with 3 spades but pard will never know what is going on when suits or that bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like goulash dealer having fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hmm I surely disagree with pass on first hand with a 74|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D promises 5 coards if balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: it didn't look like clubs were breaking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: With 14 opposite 8 it seems unlikely to even be sniffed at.  Bidding 6 looks promising though.|pg||
nt|yuval10: and a good score for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: well interesting hand here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and 3@h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: *14|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tempter for n/s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: and se does not play kokish|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and the singleton @H not so easy to pinpoint |pg||
nt|lestergold: a most unusual double fit here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and many of us do not speak dutch that well |pg||
nt|sybarra: I only know some of the swear words |pg||
nt|davidstern: Battle of the black suits here|pg||
nt|mamos: how do you make a grand anyway?  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with a bgit of luck|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK we are in business again|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dunno what happened, but we're back|pg||
nt|ritong: along the mobile abacus, there is a mobile translator|pg||
nt|ritong: non|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Might go off though Shirley :)  |pg||
nt|copeyj: good morning all|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|pitiful:  north might bid 4@d now|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will no doubt end in a number od hearts|pg||
nt|pitiful:  morning captain|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|xenya: E will overcall now?|pg||
nt|xenya: holding 4 hearts i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pass is a clever option with the West hand|pg||
nt|hawe45: Louse suits both|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now 4@s easy to East|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H wd not be my bid here|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H?|pg||
nt|tomi2: think he can rebid his 5 card @D here simply|pg||
nt|ahalim: agree Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: i would certainly rebid diamonds|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is fine sacrifice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Might reach 6@c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems opretty infrangible|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oppps|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H, 3 nt?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how high can you go |pg||
nt|007 joosth: in verkeerde hand nu|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: back to real time|pg||
nt|sybarra: East is the only female at the table  btw|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is one way to get to 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W might be not SO experienced - thatÂ´s all|pg||
nt|mamos: another stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west was thinking E had @sq due to @s2|pg||
nt|po-s: and sometimes, if a spade lead had beaten 3NT, claiming causes more pain|pg||
nt|bg: this transfer may bring a super acceptance of 3 spades in which case S will bid 4|pg||
nt|tomi2: he already showed 5 but better upgradng akqxx to 6 than 432 to 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: now they are in real trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south did not alert the 2NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: not for an Irishman John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought I was the only one who played ona a ladies team|pg||
nt|kemperg: !2S = @C?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w hasnt passed yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by E?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no 3s|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl neg|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no point|pg||
nt|mamos: ah thats the Irish way  rub a three leaf clover|pg||
nt|kemperg: not with @D start|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I was told 1@h show atleast 4 @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - if pd were to bid after 3@C|pg||
nt|xenya: handy|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: i have two brain hemispheres:)$|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maat een kleine ruitensytart is voor Zia|pg||
nt|007 joosth: overnemen met aas en r na, maar gedoken en het gevaar is geweken|pg||
nt|bridgek: 2/3sa bieden is daarom vaak mis, soms weten ze niet waar ze mee uit moeten komen, maar als ze een 5krt hebben.....|pg||
nt|bridgek: ru duiken is beter|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maar niet als de leider een 3krt heeft|pg||
nt|bobholl: misschien wel maar als hij @D 9 erbij heeft :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: maar met 5krt kl is een 4krt ru bij de leider waarschijnlijker|pg||
nt|bobholl: dat zegt niet alles over de 9 |pg||
nt|bridgek: maar hij zal de klaveren wel de goede kant op doen nu|pg||
nt|007 joosth: en  hoe zit het met de downkansen?  ik denk dat het met r 9 erbij  of een 6krt vrijwel down is als je aas legt.  an ald N 4krt heeft met 9 vrijwel niet down kan|pg||
nt|bridgek: echter deze jongens hebben tot nu toe geen indruk gemaakt op mij|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down quite a few on accurate defence|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Doesn't look like an Acol 2 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards available at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2@d shows a minimum|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is the upside that you see all the bad bids and plays of everyone else|pg||
nt|lestergold: is 4@h necessary?|pg||
nt|rich89: mmm :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead coing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *coming?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h is enuf south has defensive values not min no reason to fear opposition game|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass was lot of pressure on E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@h i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: if East has @SQ  no rush to play Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: I imagine 4@c shows fit and good Clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d wont be what south wants to hear|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@S looks like 5 spades and three diamond tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Vincent|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought so|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec confirmed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this guy is incorrigible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|jcomyn: our clover has 4 leaves - ah i see this is \ REFERENCE TO SHAMROCK|pg||
nt|kemperg: these 12pts I would not open|pg||
nt|hawe45: You mean 5 @C / or_|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a heart lead doesnt beat it|pg||
nt|sybarra: but no way that E knows pard has 7 clubs etc |pg||
nt|bobholl: immidiately to the limit :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, 3N just depends on @c hook|pg||
nt|andyv:  in S raises, N will bid 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup seems normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Certainly prevented EW finding @C fit|pg||
nt|puncher: this is true and somewhat comforting for all of us watching them now! |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he was impressed with his ht suit......|pg||
nt|bg: sry daydreaming too early in the am|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: very nice 4@C bid by Sabourin, should get EW to 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly the W hand improved with the club bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: W probably worried about his @dkxx, a nd the 2 baby @S |pg||
nt|mamos: 2@s  enough to buy the hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Three clubs losing 2 spades and two diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK wit the slam|pg||
nt|mikael_w: we have to remember this is juniors :) That means if there is a chanse for game the take it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and optimism reigns :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nothing wrong with that tho. verry often it makes becuse of the agressive bidding as well|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure if this is a stolen pot or not|pg||
nt|xenya: it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  good bid by the Irish, 9 tricks even on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north is worth another move surely|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lousy|pg||
nt|xenya: N won't pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: north must think his pd is 2452 but he stops the black suits well. maybe he passes this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: awww both wrong|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@S seems to save 4 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Tofte alerting both passes, Raulund didn't|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would a H not be led lads|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H prevent that:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the abbott always leads a H with this holding|pg||
nt|mamos: im interested by South's pass over 3@d  i know he hasnt a good hand but does have good Spades  4@S seems more  "obvious"?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes throw a heart on the @dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s ruff is entry to the @dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suspect West is thinking rather than South|pg||
nt|hawe45: Strange double of 2 @H / if you ask me!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Its basically up tom west to drive the auction now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is worried about the heart position|pg||
nt|xenya: no-trump partial for EW|pg||
nt|hawe45: Mais c´est "gentile"...|pg||
nt|ritong: la fameuse double manche|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has been a little conservative here|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has taken a great view|pg||
nt|andyv:  15hcp 2 suiters notoriously hard to bid|pg||
pc|c9|nt|puncher: with hearts breaking badly looks like one off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Match 2 in 1 hour and 10 minutes will feature Netherlands Juniors and Venezuela|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead seems to beat 3 NT - might be too late now|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes some sort of fit-bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: aggressive X by W|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi George|pg||
nt|kemperg: no bet|pg||
nt|mamos: coffee  I think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 1 @d est  une réponse texas sur l ouverture d'un @c    une convention de plus en plus fréquente|pg||
nt|andyv:  going plus should be a good result|pg||
pc|c3|nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically u bid 3@h which will almost certainly stop west from bidding if north has shape with little defence and say 4 or 5 hearts he can complete the barrage to 4!gh if necessary|pg||
nt|the saint: What would West's initial double have been? Many play it as that hand or a really big one|pg||
nt|m_niemi: and down he goes|pg||
nt|gowdy: back to par 100|pg||
nt|mamos: this is not an auction of beauty|pg||
nt|jcomyn: love to know how he thinks p will ever get in|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes definitely so brb|pg||
nt|pelu: S could still have a 4 card @S - so 3@S by N would also be a normal bid - but balanced and extra values - so 3NT very OK|pg||
nt|kemperg: +1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even with a @H lead aren't 6 1 0 6 available?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nows gs try|pg||
nt|mamos: Im about to owe John a drink|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - but I also think the Israeli placed 1. due to sound bridge as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: this Israel team won in Philly Olympiad also|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ainsi joue t on de la main de l'ouvreur|pg||
nt|hawe45: Mais quand meme avec pas mal de perdantes|pg||
nt|bobholl: "only" guess trumps not difficult anymore:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  Would Sime have doubled 3NT holding the @sQ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: 5 @D X = 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 1 hour and 10 minutes is Israel Schools vs USA|pg||
nt|andreasw:  If pd has @h cuebid it is defently worth a shot!|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, on le voit mal faire ce contrat|pg||
nt|bridgek: trump guess is over|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@cX is two down, so this is par|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pitiful:  fooled us all|pg||
nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit mousy not vul|pg||
nt|bg: double not good for the Canadians|pg||
nt|xenya: if only a natural 4N was availble here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean by S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south also alerted 4@c, but did not alert 4@d. North alerted 4@d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: YOWSIE|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would have bid 2@s as a fit jump over 1@h but I guess West did not have that option|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has presumably set up a game force amd now perhaps cann confirm thhe club support east having shown a fairly minimum hand can afford to cue 41h|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: les cartes  sont bien mal placées pour NS|pg||
nt|ritong: l affaire va se négocier au nombre de levées de chute, probablement|pg||
nt|hawe45: Seule espoir: Valet de @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: goede 9 maar dat heeft nu geen ivloed|pg||
nt|andyv:  I have to admit that I would have raised with the S hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: a heart lead beats 3NT --but no chance of finding it |pg||
nt|lestergold: ye norfth has done well knows that partner does not know about his stiff heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly no play for 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an unreasonable contract in the abstract|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer doesnt know he has nine tricks   so easily|pg||
nt|hawe45: When I double like North here, pd cashes the @H Ace / and give away the slam|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: North might even get another chance to lead ace and another heart |pg||
nt|lestergold: its called you have a PARTNER|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why has south given up with this monster|pg||
nt|davidstern: So it looks like EW have sold out cheaply|pg||
nt|tomi2: North now clearly overbids his hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@S is rkcb in hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: the auction has gone out of hand|pg||
nt|sommer: -500|pg||
nt|santyclz: Surprised us all.|pg||
nt|mamos: im told 4@s does have a meaning   This team have been fantastic in this tournament|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 on a @H, not on @D|pg||
nt|po-s: what about six spades?|pg||
nt|po-s: or 7 clubs doubled rather|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: For me |pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising that South didnt up the Heart pre-empt   maybe he's old beyond his years|pg||
nt|po-s: If South had supported perhaps they might have found the scrifice|pg||
nt|mamos: most people I know over 60  would have put 4@H  on the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what 2D mean|pg||
nt|mamos: once you get past a certain age youve gone for 1100 so many times you stop caring|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus for the results|pg||
nt|po-s: most likely 2D was multi|pg||
nt|mamos: something that includes balanced 19 counts I'd guess|pg||
nt|po-s: if only strong East would have done something other than passing over 2H|pg||
nt|the saint: North should have been able to read a singleton|pg||
nt|gowdy: the @C 2 was a mistake  |pg||
nt|kemperg: we''\l see|pg||
nt|santyclz: That looks right to me, have to delay the @d ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: if you have the @d7...|pg||
nt|mamos: North paid the penalty on Board 1 in the OR for not leading partner's suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT from South might had a play|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could have signed of in 4@H leaving his partner with a chance to bid on|pg||
nt|mamos: East is enjoying it   but North amd South are on different pages of the manual|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps in different manuals|pg||
nt|sommer: and EW had 650 safely = 4 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has made it very clear as to his values now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes usual to play it shows A or K but North likes other leads less|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s and east should know what is needed|pg||
nt|hawe45: With this speed, I= am happy, that they are not bidding on to 7...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Is he really thinkin?|pg||
nt|lestergold: who is in the tank here? is south thinking of bidding?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suspect West is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, W thinking here.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but 4@s does seem obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has shown club support 4@s is surely automatic?|pg||
nt|hawe45: They play low/speed cue/bids|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, that has the probem of being off two cashing aces, PO|pg||
nt|007 joosth: helaas kunnen wij niet claimen|pg||
nt|bridgek: idd|pg||
pc|c5|nt|santyclz: No one else objects to the 4@h bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|tomi2: no - they are not. they just misjudge their hand - but i think both know each meaning of each bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will find out automaticlly|pg||
nt|mamos: that the clubs are blocked and the Diamond Ace onside|pg||
nt|mamos: he will but he needs to think|pg||
nt|pelu: Netherland have great tradition and a lot of great results in women team - it looks like a new generation will follow that rute|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will have cashed 9 tricks by that time so can safely lead a @d up|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im wrong he will have cashed 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i will be surprised if discards are not such that it will be safe to try a @d|pg||
nt|pelu: id he takes his 9 tricks and play @D from dummy he will have 10 @CQ block the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: however east has to find 3 discards on @hs|pg||
nt|mamos: eventually I think he will play @hQ  and then will relax|pg||
nt|pelu: Laura Dekkers in West (23) has only played bridge for 4-5 yeard - I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: In the CR declarer played the AK of @s on board one, before trying the @h finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S on board 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: either its not a coffe hand after all or its a coffe and cakes hand |pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: smoke if you got them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: zelfs als je weet dat de hartens rond zitten  en als je een klaverslag kan stelen  zie ik geen overslag|pg||

nt|bobholl: zonder|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: maar dat Tarzan is dit nou zo goed?|pg||
nt|rhelle: jazeker :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: N debkt missch na over een R-K  of H-K dwang  mochten de hartens scheef zitten|pg||
nt|bobholl: vooral in slam handen :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: denkt|pg||
nt|bridgek: heb je een systeem overzicht?|pg||
nt|rhelle: natuurlijk|pg||
nt|bobholl: rob wel :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|newmoon: Open Room started with the last 2 boards.  They have comparfisons... we don't|pg||
nt|kemperg: E afraid of 5@S' in W|pg||

nt|sybarra: for those of you that asked |pg||
nt|hawe45:  SPADE NOW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but I was sleeping...|pg||
nt|mamos: defence in control now|pg||
nt|ahalim: or some pages are missing :)|pg||
nt|daman: S should be ablke to make this on a simple endplay|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now he gets squeezed blind|pg||
nt|daman: able*|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a very mature sequience for two junioras so far.......|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone play that 4NT from East here shows a good 4@c bid?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S likely to be duplicated next door for push|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C better for NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|puncher: good try by south to get partner in to lead the spade through - just not to be on this hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  YES|pg||
nt|lestergold: North seems confident that south cannot get a club loser away on @ds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nothing more than two aces are missing|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dagold: nice contract to stop in here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry misclick|pg||
nt|yuval10: especially with @d lead|pg||
nt|po-s: Opening is OK but to jump to 4S with nine losers is a bit hmm optimistic|pg||
nt|po-s: no|pg||
nt|ritong: enfin, a 1 SA ça n est pas perdu d avance|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   Competitie (left), then White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h I mean.|pg||
nt|ahalim: rhis will be bloody|pg||
nt|mamos: what was 2NT Tom?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|newmoon: more control in @C than in 2@H, yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  West might have considered 3@c|pg||
nt|hawe45: TRUMP BACK|pg||
nt|tomi2: a general gametry, forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: E ha d9 pts more than promised, but W knew that by inference|pg||
nt|mamos: can't dellay it when they lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  problem now is staying out of 7@c|pg||
nt|hawe45: ut sounds interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this looks like the right contrakt that will be 11 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: sure, but you can't bid that at a safe level|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: mais c est noraml de jouer 2 @h  1@c  1@h 1 sa 2@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: defence needed to set up Diamond trick to keep it to ten  +1  now|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the bidding,  and holding 4 @H's   X doesnt see right |pg||
nt|yuval10: as advertise - 13 imps for Israel|pg||
nt|yuval10: Sweden pushed to slam in board 13|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: c est juste|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: peut  etre Sud aurait il pu ici dire1 @h sur 1@d  quitte à jouer à 7 atouts éventuellemnt|pg||
nt|rhelle: ik speel het nu zo'n 10 jaar, en zweer erbij|pg||
nt|007 joosth: kwestie van een goede trekzalf kopen|pg||
nt|rhelle: ben zelf een matige kaarter, maar ons slam bieden is op wereld niveau|pg||
nt|bridgek: tegen ons boden ze tot 5sch en dat had 23% kans, het zat natuurlijk, maar ik was niet onder de indruk|pg||
nt|bobholl: moet je huub (bertens) eens vragen hoe hij denkt over het slam bieden van bauke en simon !!!! zegt hij dan|pg||
nt|007 joosth: veilig slagje weggeven ter voorvereiding van een dwang is niet mogelijk|pg||
nt|rhelle: lol|pg||
nt|bridgek: Je moet het systeem spelen waar je je lekker bij voelt natuurlijk. En dat is altijd het beste systeem|pg||
nt|rhelle: ik wil wel een een lange biedwedstrijd tussen Simon en Bauke, en hem en wie dan ook zien :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: huub vindt ze ook heel goed hoor |pg||
nt|rhelle: of mijzelf en Steve Green vs Huub & Berry|pg||
nt|bobholl: dat winnen jullie geheid !!!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rich89: 2@h is 8 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Roland |pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT  should have been a warning ?:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3rd @D and then @H @H, S has to becarefull ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h iallows for the grand slam possibility if west is even better thab he has promised so far|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy lead for South in view of X of 2@h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: watching talented but inexperienced players reminds how much experience counts for at bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: that confidence could have been misplaced|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can anyone see anything EW could have done better|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think its quite an impressive sequence for two youngsters|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes / good bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  I think its a very boring sequence from two juniors:p|pg||
nt|po-s: who cares?...five then|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bg: X cannot be right with super fit in clubs and no spade winners|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Vul v Not with 3 spades?|pg||

nt|kemperg: inference, word I know from the books of Terence Rees|pg||

nt|xenya: oh maybe you can|pg||
nt|bridgek: maar ze hadden ook -84 op een dagje topcircuit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: very nicely done |pg||
nt|tomi2: fron N's point of view 3nt showed a decent hand with 2452 distr.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit pointless|pg||
nt|kemperg: when I remember it well, read those in the 60's|pg||
nt|sommer: he would ruff in hand and run @SJ|pg||
nt|sommer: ..as he will soon|pg||
nt|kemperg: he should, would?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes and not even RD|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and 12  now|pg||
nt|ritong: cette réponse en texas permet de moduler un peu, oui  si on admet que les bonnes mains avec 4 cartes a @h disent 2@h|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: that was not what i meant by accurate defence|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally EW are just a bit short of 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: im told North is a she i do not know why names are not given as Miss or mrs. or Mz so we know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: giving your age away now|pg||
nt|mamos: French team have started well  -- do we have link to scores  the one I had yesterday seems broken|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: did|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are cashing out mow |pg||
nt|sybarra: *ow|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now  (third time a charm)|pg||
nt|xenya: we will see|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, perhaps after pass on 1@D if ops help|pg||
nt|mdgraham: being off two aces never stopped some people bidding a slam |pg||
pc|h8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: no frills on this one from Norman|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzag: lost the play :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has burned boats for a clever manouvre in @ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: before entries were destroyeed a small @d from hand...|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: oc:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: but nine tricks are available not that I can count |pg||
nt|sybarra: we in a claim?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think we are going off line again |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|mamos: crash|pg||
nt|po-s: hi. they had already taken the club so I assumed there weren´t any in dummy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: EW needed to engineer a spade ruff to beat it by several tricks, probably 3 |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with this bidding. a void when partner asks for aces...|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, just asking kindly :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's why I was agreeing with 7 on a @h lead but not on a @D.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  exacly!|pg||
nt|rhelle: ach, weet je, we hebben allemaal wel eens dagen dat alles mis gaat|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: and now.....the end is near....with apols to Sinatra|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why keep the two little spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 7 of spades is an entry?|pg||
nt|kemperg: it is|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 7 in Easts hand could play a role if he tries to endplay him in @S|pg||
nt|kemperg: but no use now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not completly|pg||
nt|007 joosth: het doel van deze blokkerende speelwijze ontgaat me|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: at an early stage|pg||
nt|paulg:  back-seat driving, i agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats the simple way of grabbing the @d trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|mamos: a bit unlucky  bravely bid|pg||
nt|ritong: et 1@h trois cartes ou quatre avec un vilain jeu|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010YouthPhiladelphia/Ortiz%20Patino/Norway/bogen-johansen.pdf  for EW CC   and a nice pic of the lads :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: we try more proverbs next time|pg||
nt|kemperg: % was very good, layout not|pg||
nt|po-s: it might not make any difference, but I would prefer a 2H bid by North|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim|pg||
mc|11|nt|xenya: the spade switch by W looks odd -- and so does declarer's decision to finesse -- surely E was marked with the 10|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT goes a lot down on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is also the contract at table 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|cicus: E might refrain from a @S lead fearing it would be declarer's 9th|pg||
nt|cicus: still, a spade leade also sets this|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: wd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For the maximum|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: W may duck this|pg||
nt|psridhar: Both Zack and Barel are in fine nick....gl to Bermuda Bowl competitors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There must be a reason why partner did not lead a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tenace, no?|pg||
nt|cicus: is that the A or the K?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Plus this 3N is not about 1h tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the king high he would surely have led one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so either he is A or AJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT down 2 at table 3|pg||
nt|cicus: should be AJ for the 3rd hand opening to make sense|pg||

nt|sybarra: we do need to find you a commentator spell checker :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I'll do that for ya|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we all felt that was not an automatic slam to reach many experienced pairs would mess this hand up|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think a 5@H in tempo .... |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dont think D was meant als penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had a spec suggest:  X = interest in bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: some kind off want to bid 5@H, but let partner think with you|pg||
nt|sybarra: but must say I have never seen that|pg||
nt|mamos: East perhaps too timid with good clubs and a bit of a Heart fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: would have been a nice play if they stoped in 4@H :)|pg||
nt|xenya: well played, yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: went to school at 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: only +1??|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yea, I asked the players.. after the @d finesse things went rather quickly|pg||
nt|sommer: DK lost only 1 imp in b1. That seems ok|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not sure about the play at the end|pg||
nt|davidb: E  may bid 5cl  looks cheap..|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, if the swedes just keep bidding as hard on the next board to in the OR they will get some of that IMP:s back|pg||
nt|xenya: then, if W passes, N might bid 2@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45: La vi est dure|pg||

nt|ritong: certes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was a grand slam bid in the 1971 Bermuda Bowl which was off all four aces  |pg||
nt|007 joosth: maar het kon echt niet down|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: last hand was a red save hand I think - 5@D was only one down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@d is not textbook|pg||
nt|copeyj: I reckon Bell will overcall with the west hand next door, but we will see|pg||
nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
nt|paulg:  something to be said for 2@c by Sime|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps 1NT?|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N for me I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even 1@s, but I'd like a better suit|pg||
nt|puncher: i certainly don't like pass but then I don't have many green cards in my box :)|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N at least has the advantage of getting the values across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and you do have somewhere to run|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it´s better to show the void on S - and N will not be happy!|pg||
nt|mamos: someone has turned the distributiononometer up|pg||
nt|ahalim: is this a goulash tournament ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: after the first match with those hungarians...|pg||

nt|gowdy: good !|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyone for 6 of a minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: what a deal here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wow some fun here in bidding very suitable for polish|pg||
nt|mamos: six is interesting on Diamond lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very very interesting where they stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have surely ruiffed a spade high in case they were 4/2|pg||
mb|1C|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an obvious defence perhaps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should be exciting|pg||
nt|bg: could be X not meant as penalty but then EW  not on same wavelength|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it was pretty popular in Holland, Brink Drijver were playing it, but now they stopped playing it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to rework the system notes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but at the end he was down if they were 4-2|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: il va y avoir beaucoup d enchères avant que Sud n'ait la parole avec ses 23 points|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5 imps to israel on bd 1 when 4@H went -2 in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was not suggesting i follow the rules|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it was not meant as a critisism|pg||
nt|copeyj: I know :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 5@h now|pg||
nt|copeyj: I find 3@D quite scary, but I am applying for my bus pass in 12 months time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you would be more at home in senior bridge simon|pg||
nt|cameron_1: bezerk might be a better word|pg||

nt|the saint: I've seen worse 3@C bids 1st NV|pg||
nt|gowdy: just asking :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I thought they bid aggressively in non vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: well west alerted it, east didnt, so think your right Bruce|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E could be playing a 4/3 in hts |pg||
nt|bg: E should bid 3 clubs good heart fit and W has a spade shortage|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thisd hand should keep w quiet|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good judgement / if they play 15/17|pg||
nt|ritong: il aimerait bien que ça lui arrive a 1SA, pour passer tranquille et compter les levées de chute|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @S pour jouer est bon|pg||
nt|ritong: mais non|pg||
nt|bridgek: 5haX= par , not really worth the save|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the hand with the ace of trumps and a side ace must have been quite surprised when his partner doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to the Netherlands on board 1 as 4@h failed by 2 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, Isreal:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|2hplus4: Cards lie well for slam here|pg||

nt|bobholl: 3e hands 2@S ?|pg||

nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
nt|puncher: seems a shame not to be able to bid those clubs!|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Sime reads my blog, so he knows my preference|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it is East thinking here|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree that 1@S would be fine with better pips|pg||
nt|kemperg: well done E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s very restrained for a junior|pg||
nt|gowdy: and now we know that North likes to bid !  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my club money game 3@c wouold be considered a routine conservative action|pg||
nt|davidstern: Fit showing jump in competition|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D a @S raise |pg||
nt|tomi2: both german pairs have no 2@D weak opener in their system|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dodgy aul h fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have blocked one of the majors somehow|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it will be dangerus getting to hi in the bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 NT = 22-24|pg||
nt|pelu: prob N just tranfer to @H and play 4@h|pg||
nt|bridgek: de reden van de blokkerende speelwijze was dat hij nooit over oost ging snijden en hem evt ging ingooien|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand interesting... again a decision as to how to raise @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play canape, so they often often a 4-card major rather than a longer minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when it is clubs, since they don't like that suit|pg||
nt|mamos: dont like 1@S   |pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|ahalim: we would all pin the @H 10 seeing all 4 hands :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 6 to be exact|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we will all be in the ibdding is my guess|pg||
nt|lebridgeur:  avec des vulnérabilités différentes  Estdirait 4 @d  mais ici il a un gadget |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes also 3nt by north is an interesting shot|pg||
nt|roswolf: but north takes the low road again|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, will S dbl or bid 4@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
nt|puncher: no difficulties for declarer here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has great hand and this vul. pard should have a good suit at least |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s very questionable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: EW play different NT ranges in different positions|pg||
nt|hawe45: Rathar weak North for the 2 @C-bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: this one was 14-17|pg||
nt|the saint: Will work now, becuase should be able to lead a club vs 3N|pg||
nt|bg: oops now France on different meanings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dont know if 4NT was meant as asking aces or that is was quanti|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Robert asking partner if he is right|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at the hand,  can S be asking aces?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont really understand the 1@S bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now a cue by E and off we go |pg||
nt|davidstern: No defence and good play hand why bid so low|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 7 surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S  7@S|pg||
nt|pelu: or can she show 6 card @h and invit for slam?|pg||

nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
nt|jcomyn: the poor d suit aszgtsain|pg||
nt|sybarra: now Bruce, how to pick up the club suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like they are on the same wavelength, but my French isnt fantastic :(|pg||
nt|bg: easy Shirley just play K-A  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you bid 3 or 4 sp?|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree David bid once and high|pg||
nt|davidstern: Depending on mood and partner - indifferent to either|pg||
nt|davidstern: Probably 4@S but ..... on another day 3@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: NEVER ON ANY PLANET would I bid 1@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: white v white, so always a crap shoot |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree, no way you get me to bid 1 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: good point|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H has small chances|pg||
nt|jcomyn: How often bravery and skill not rewarded in bridge|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising  North didn't bid on first round  maybe no way to show @c  after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mamos: very aggressive from East|pg||
nt|davidstern: West's made it a little hard on partner|pg||
nt|tomi2: I don't agree to that double, it should show spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: testing thei system|pg||
nt|mamos: quieter waters|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes poor spot cards and poor shape|pg||
nt|mikael_w: maybe 4@h now from S|pg||
nt|bobholl: helping himself down :) may be |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: i do the bids in twos because of mouse click noises|pg||
nt|kemperg: but make's|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s oj if they are very conservative vul about their 3@s bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants  go to the next button on the bottom to see the Witte House (White House) |pg||
nt|rich89: @H now? |pg||
nt|lestergold: ht switch absolutgeluy mandatory here|pg||
nt|mamos: let off the hook there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will NS find the crossruff?|pg||
nt|mamos: South claimed 9 a couple of hands ago  will  ten test him ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: As always: Lead a TRUMP!|pg||
nt|hawe45: But here @D works better...|pg||
nt|gowdy: may start a high D for a look |pg||
nt|hawe45: East wants 300 instead of 100|pg||
nt|the saint: Smolen 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what south wanted to hear!|pg||
nt|gowdy: xx @C perhaps 4 @H|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play transfers in this situation, 2@C would have shown @D'S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but no matter|pg||
nt|bobholl: only K of @C surely beats it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did North expect South to have more?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  thanks Alan|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may get doubled|pg||
nt|hawe45:  500 now - or?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice start fo decl.|pg||
nt|kemperg: prefer 2N opening on E|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmm another interesting contract|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@C from South|pg||
nt|kemperg: USA in 4@H at 12|pg||
nt|po-s: impossible to find a diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my son does not believe in no trump downgrades only upgrades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  he has been reading Klinger|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, good|pg||
nt|hawe45: Mais pas la contre!|pg||
nt|ritong: un petit coup de bâton pour la route, quand même|pg||
nt|hawe45: Bridge practique = 3 SA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: EW lead 3/5 but attitude in partners suit it seems|pg||
nt|bobholl: in paren is dit veel interessanter nu geen snit denk ik|pg||
nt|roswolf: another game try - bid game and try to make it:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a bad choice...just doesn't work on this hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg:  you think these seniors could all the clicks then?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hear the clicks|pg||
nt|lestergold: if pard does not have high spade honour u cant beat it|pg||
nt|the saint: Well South might hate his club shortage and try for a major fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: my granny would do that  but do the experts do the same?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that solves the s situation|pg||
nt|peachy: East's bidding has pinpointed spade singleton so 3NT started to look bad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK?|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe @CA and @Hshift is enough|pg||
nt|kemperg: good lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..no, then S can play dummy reversal|pg||
nt|sommer: it's makeable then|pg||
nt|mikael_w: its not often, but this is a hand where its better to be dec with the week hand|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and maybe it was posible after the Dbl ? If S say pass?|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @h swith, this should go down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  switch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: surely 4nt by w|pg||
nt|tomi2: should north have opened 3@D maybe? nonvuln but 2nd seat|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what the heck is 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has read everything Julian|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  most bridge players are like airline passengers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  love to upgrade but hate to downgrade|pg||
nt|henryb:  Declarer needs lots of entries for club plays|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 3rd best leads|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: beautiful faciltiy, a refurbished tennis club with still active tennis courts |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry missed that|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: and right next to the olympic stadium :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer knows hes probably doomed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dummy trying to read my face, difficult to keep it in shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes probably does, why else does anyone lead into the @H holding|pg||
nt|mamos: and now tooooo high|pg||
nt|sybarra: whack! |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Friendly match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jaime Lee|pg||
nt|davidstern: 800 versus 920|pg||
nt|davidstern: 940 if you are inspired in clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: EW did well in the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: )|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord where are they going|pg||
nt|kemperg: $@H last train?|pg||
nt|ritong: ça pourrait mal tourner|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my no dbl? |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mamos: when opponents bid too much we need to double to teach them a friendly lesson :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: think better to finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: Losing 2 hearts 2 diamonds and club -4|pg||
nt|ahalim: there is your cake :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: even in W|pg||
nt|roswolf: experience has taught me to use the rapier rather than the bludgeon in these auctions|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, it does look like S skewered himself here|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm painful:0|pg||
nt|andyv:  with N holding the 9@h, it looks like down only 1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: but thinks for himself|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @d position is favourable for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem with downgrade 18 Milton's you may miss a game when partner has the good intermediates but only 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45: Switch to the @D 10 / East might duck it!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  I would blame partner for not inviting and hide @h J:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer needs only 3 @d for the contract|pg||
nt|hawe45: 730 á bientot|pg||
pc|h4|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
nt|xenya: E has figured out that @Ss must be 4-4 on the auction -- a nice piece of inference|pg||
nt|jcomyn: EXRERAWHACK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: EXTRA|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still ducking is an option!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  No matter Ron will for sure make|pg||
nt|po-s: so how should he play the suit?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cash 4@h and then run the @d7?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Difference de 1.130 en ce cas|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: cela va mal tourner pour NS|pg||
nt|ritong: je dois dire qUE 3sa? 9A ME VIENDRAIT PAS|pg||
nt|ritong: OUPS|pg||
nt|bobholl: now a @C also beats it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard to know if they can have a weak two in 4th, or an immediate two in 4th seat|pg||
nt|xenya: not worse that 4-4 i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: claim|pg||
nt|mikael_w: feals like a @c-lead would have make this contract really scare|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 10 minor cxards|pg||
nt|tomi2: now north has no single trick and cant expect his partner to have Ax of @D and to find the lead... something went wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: for another huge score|pg||
nt|mamos: just  couple of trumps to lose|pg||
nt|peachy: 4D was the last making contract but 5D is just unlucky while 4H has  a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: christmas has arrived early|pg||
nt|sommer: more @D? ..or ruff @S|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that pass = 2 card @h|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, But if you lie about 2 or 3 @h does it really matter ?|pg||
nt|bridgek: Iha is het beter om met stomme weak two 1 te openen in de derde hand en 2sch te bewaren voor competitive hande|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: again not an easy hand to handle|pg||
nt|mamos: going to need that entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: nice defense by East|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed |pg||
nt|pelu: best: take @SA and strat red cross-ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: finalemnt 23+ 15/17 = pas grand chose en face|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: wel;l; he has decided to play pard for a club guard rather than play the 4/3 fit i wouold have gopne for the 4/3 fit on the grounds that even if north has a club card it might not ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: be sufficient|pg||
nt|kemperg: S denied @D controle|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like @d lead is setting the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4@h was last train |pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Tim|pg||
pc|h8|nt|puncher: The Scottish EW were in a disciplined 3@S on board 1 hence the 6 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: OK East making his opponents suffer|pg||
nt|tomi2: e will corrently fight for an overtrick here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why so long to play|pg||
nt|kemperg: AH|pg||
nt|kemperg: eastern egg|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it is EASTER arrivinbg early|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N with stiff A or K not bad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and get away with it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now declarer has no play. defense has a second club by force|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3 rounds of @s will also defeat|pg||
nt|po-s: that club 8 might cost|pg||
nt|bobholl: will :) cost |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi all |pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if the tap would have been more effective,  (If E had bid 2 C, maybe k of @C lead)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: the spade 8 confirming that hwe can ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: N didnt get it |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what on earth is this?|pg||
nt|mamos: nasty decision |pg||
nt|gowdy: Erwin did south thank N for the dummy ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ah that way, yes he did|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: well done|pg||
nt|bg: W has shown a long heart suit could have 3 clubs but not likely|pg||
nt|mamos: Id like to claim quickly so they have plenty of time to discuss where they went wrong :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@D rebid on board 3 led to 6@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: well  Tadaaaa |pg||
nt|mamos: and we are left to wonder what would have happened after 1@c 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 1@d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: concede a h and claim|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as you said 1s 7s wqithout all this mucking about|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: que fallait il faire ?  se taire à jamais ?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a really wild board all sorts of ways to get a really horrid result|pg||
nt|gowdy: was he nice looking at that pile of dung|pg||
nt|gowdy: change might to should|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, and then I dont think 4@h makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: they would have been tapping the high card ht hand|pg||
nt|ritong: pourquoi pas|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzag: cant see his face|pg||
nt|tomi2: they will talk in bavarian, so we won't undestand this :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec told me 7 is 1 down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe can u see the line|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: i have some difficulty counting the undertricks here |pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, a severe blow |pg||
nt|paulg:  discards mean that declarer can lead towards @hJ safely|pg||
nt|the saint: I guess with that strong diamond suit, the 1N opener was too much of a distortion for me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no he wont|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dagold: good play by Norman although Espens carding showed a doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: thinks he has a natural heart trick but how can he hope to wenjoy that when he can see the establisheable diamonds sitting in dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: they are not fantunes yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is simply an appaling error|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with best defence 4@h dbl is -1100|pg||
nt|mikael_w: You have a minimum hand and will not exept any slam-invite anyway|pg||
nt|bobholl: dank u|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: -3 as a spectator suggests? |pg||
nt|lestergold: it has to be the A and there has to be no card to knock out as well for 3N toc be viable|pg||
nt|ahalim: there is the overtrick|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: le stoicisme peut etre une grande qualité parfois|pg||
nt|hawe45: Cela depends - 3 @D est?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: politique de jouer riche :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: but landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|dagold: no 9 on the second round|pg||
nt|kemperg: down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: apropos my comment, I played in three reasonable slams the other evening each one requiring one finesse. All 3 went down|pg||
nt|mamos: small spade a little tester|pg||
nt|kemperg: we see 6 on @D lead in OR|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Well cant afford N to get in so yes:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Just play the @D normal after that / 9 tricks sure / and no entry in North|pg||
nt|bobholl: paulissen looking at his @C 6 ??|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: must admit I would not have led a spade |pg||
nt|paulg:  both have prime cards and the breaks are very friendly|pg||
nt|daman: the young players make good use of the red cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H K is needed|pg||
pc|dT|nt|newmoon: now the @C gets ruffed|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen and Norman know this is  a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats all folks|pg||
nt|sommer: noo|pg||
nt|sommer: ..depends...|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HHH|pg||
nt|sommer: had to ruff with @HQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes. A below par slam anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dummy reversal|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhpas better to cash king first|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and you know N will bid 4@h if she is not comfort for slam anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c3?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: with both minor aces on N E must play a @s - and he did|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or even better take @DKQ and more @D|pg||
nt|ritong: si les types crient " tu vas dans le mur", je les crois|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: or 4?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an insult to partner|pg||
nt|the saint: Make the King of diamonds the club king and it has merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome James|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true|pg||
nt|bobholl: jan calculating E 's points|pg||
nt|po-s: no way now unless Jansma overruffs and Paulissen has forgotten abt the club 8|pg||
nt|bobholl: gert - jan is very secure in those things|pg||
pc|c9|nt|paulg:  declarer will take the heart finesse in an attempt to make the contract, not with any hope|pg||
nt|paulg:  and probably go two down|pg||
nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||
nt|lestergold: well having chosen the distortion  the bidding has warned him of a likely big hoole in the club department|pg||
nt|bg: Hi James|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|the saint: Yes|pg||
mc|10|nt|dagold: so a likely swing to England|pg||
nt|paulg:  although he can count Sime's hand now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why did w not sdign off in 4d or bid 2d the first time|pg||
nt|kemperg: inOR|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|psridhar: X of 2@C = 4 card @H likely and bidding 2@H =5 bagger|pg||

nt|sybarra: when my left opp bids nt over pard's suit,  not sure worth leading  |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant rho|pg||
nt|garnetts: lightish opening bid ( and I would open this one) and a light dbl will likely get EW to 3NT |pg||
nt|dagold: would be amazed if it isn't 3N making to be honest|pg||
nt|xenya: -5?  |pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all, and take a pat on the back for being patient :)|pg||
nt|idc: I expect it will take a while to get the scores up to date (if it can be done)|pg||
nt|idc: but at least we will (fingers crossed) get to see some bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and deservedly  |pg||
nt|rich89: could be -2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wonder what coach of n/s says????|pg||
nt|mamos: and presumably the defence to 4@S could have won five or six tricks with that cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@s might be unlucky here too|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can they bid the slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes noticed thast|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 13 to Finns bd 21|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4/3 fits when you have the high cards in the trump suit and good side suits etc is very often highly playable|pg||
nt|xenya: S was going to get squeezed anyway|pg||
nt|ahalim: and now a quiet board|pg||
nt|xenya: a heated discussion is under way no doubt|pg||
nt|tomi2: the german pair will have to refocus on the remaining boards, still 6 to go. they know they are far behind now|pg||
nt|mamos: slightly odd auction in OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: might be duplicated here|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play forcing NT and the 2@C response from N will be multi-meaning... but maybe south will pass 1@S with no king and ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: helmich-hop play some sort of Gazilli, so 2@c was forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2: their 1@S opening is limited to 18hcp, so a game is far away|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hard to stay out of game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w has a monster thisd time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least he will think so|pg||
nt|daman: EW are huffing and puffing after the last 2 hands|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best start for NL-girls|pg||
nt|sommer: very difficult to make this one, because of the @C sits|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but after 1@C opening and opps carding, he might have solved it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 0nly lols make those ones|pg||
nt|yuval10: reasonable line to go for the @c ruff, very nice by W not to lead the singelton when she know that partner doesn't have the Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: definitely not right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you lead low to the 9 or 10 and ace, what do you do next?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross to the king, you are in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I have a fealing 4@h even make is a good result on this board anyway|pg||
nt|davidb: no greek gifts...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: surement  un bicolore majeur 3 @d|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Interesting boards this morning|pg||
nt|bridgek: 6d will they get pushed there?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: tja dat was toch niet erg handig van N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: een speeltje voor de N hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: spade lead indeed 0 or 2 above|pg||
mb|1C|nt|2hplus4: ???|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@S seems a likely spot|pg||
nt|mamos: This table is going to be in time trouble|pg||
nt|mikael_w: anyone knnows if sweden bid the game on board 14 in OR|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: no, just 4 -- quite likely|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This time E has 3 tens to make up for lack of points and balanced hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  a hand for south to keep quiet|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of the great defense we have seen (esp. in the Vandy) was when the pards followed each others lead in defense|pg||
nt|mamos: slam chance at least|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding comps expect you to find them on hands like this|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board n 5 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with a few sacre bleus and things|pg||
nt|peachy: NS are the older of the Israel teams, currently in first place|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 4@h is fouhnd it could make inpractice here|pg||
nt|mamos: i have trouble following one table|pg||
nt|santyclz: Send Roland the bill for the 42" monitor.|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT in North... / but how to bid it|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H by W|pg||
nt|davidb: yes they did|pg||
nt|kemperg: this was peacecake, next piece of cake|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @S = 800|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: and is back|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks the best spot|pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet he goes slamming|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and another s slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@H = @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dagold: danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@c is a nice bid, although here 5@c might have caused major problems|pg||
nt|xenya: that score will not be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d presumably a limit raise|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate scores having been entered correctly, AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: East is not timid|pg||
nt|hawe45: I open the North hand with 1 in my longest suit|pg||
nt|gowdy: now this is hard luck for NS  on a good day 6@D is cold  but not this day|pg||
nt|m_niemi: South bids now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@d x'd,, so even if they'd x'd 2@d it would have been a loss.|pg||
nt|tomi2: Ellerbeck might see his problematic rebid after 2@C gazilli|pg||
nt|mamos: quick auction :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, 3@D by N?|pg||
nt|kemperg: NS can make 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i go with the original suggestion the 7@d is unlikely to be covered wjatever the north holding and if it is you still have the option of playibng A and @d to K to allow for Qs with ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: North|pg||
nt|po-s: agree, duck one when South showed the ten which he would do  also with four|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be 6 imps back|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Thanks Carl. that will prob give sweden 6 imp back|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks surely that N will compete to the 3 level|pg||
nt|hawe45: C´est difficile - contre sur 3 @D = les @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW have a decent play for 4@h :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: also a way to miss 4ha|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|puncher: Looks like 4@H is an ok spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  as East can never get in, 3NT looks a better spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit I hate 2N openings with this shape and quality|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: flat hand open 1nt 4/3/3/3|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer did well to make eight in OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think it was misdefended there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makes anyyway|pg||
nt|mamos: this isnt much like bridge |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with his attitude this is inevitable|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Again game making|pg||
nt|puncher: that's true|pg||
nt|paulg:  but 4@h is the normal contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be lucky that you don't really have the entries for the double heart finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  West's raise shows invitational values or better|pg||
nt|hawe45: 800 must do this time|pg||
nt|hawe45: Is 5 @D a winner - I´m not so sure|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: raise to 3nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: did W bid 2 @D?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Why Mike|pg||
nt|kemperg: try to look at the Portugal open at the same time, does't work well(|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it looks like 4@s has a chanse for e/w but will not be easy to find|pg||
nt|sharkey: Have to admit the Norwegians are partial to the Swedes - even though we dont like to admit it...:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for S now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H als 55 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  West might take the push with a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|idc: The score from the other room was initially 6@c making, but has been changed to 6NT going -1|pg||
nt|idc: If so, Sime did very well to lead @hA, since it makes on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how in heavens name can w pass|pg||
nt|mamos: no bidding and hand dont match|pg||
nt|gowdy: as well he should|pg||
nt|bg: S hoping Dia Q wrong|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lead 4th best by E|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand has 4 @C +2@H+1@S +1@D= 8 |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: with KQJ with west very unlikely to have the @SA so think he should finesse the clubs last board for a safety play|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: needs a 9 trick somewhere |pg||
nt|sybarra: and if so what is it|pg||
nt|mamos: is this Strong Club do we know?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Is that forcing???|pg||
nt|mamos: what do we think of 2@H :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not much|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s was trf to 1NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H =@H|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@s  montre 5+ @s et 4+@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd2 the dutch bid to 4@SX -1for a 9 imp loss|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|newmoon: North contemplating his good hand:  "is there more than 4@S here?"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1s-2s-3s surely|pg||
nt|hawe45: I have seen weaker 2 @H than this|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @C is not my taste|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess 2@c is some kind of strong accept in @h? then S might be glad now|pg||
nt|ritong: la, le partenaire avait quelques @c et ils etaient bien mis|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 4S is interessant maar wel erg hoog:  hartens of ruitens proberen vrij te krijgen|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Espen has done well to only bid 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 1@H as S, then pass any rebid by N|pg||
nt|mamos: would you use Stayman here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NO! only 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: a club limit raise I am told |pg||
nt|mamos: presumably balanced 10ish :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: will he find @C9|pg||
nt|pelu: u were right - IN OR S (Padon) show his hand as a stroing @S-opening - and they were in 4@S -1!|pg||
nt|bridgek: rdbl!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is feisty|pg||
nt|andyv:  W planning to bid 2@h over pd's 2@d call?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dagold: and nice double from Noramn since 5@S would be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This is odd.|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy double for West|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A gift for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: I oftgen opt to open a Hearty with these hands knowing that if its passed out we are rarely missing a game|pg||
nt|kemperg: then 1 or 2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead the @D 10, pls|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think it is a very strong club.....dont know|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: its artificial yes didnt find a convention card jet|pg||
nt|lestergold: after second double north is very cautious holding some values and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: THE Israeli Juniors  have a fantastic record in the tournament so far averaging 22 points|pg||
nt|jcomyn: presumably 1nt shows spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: think so|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sorry, East doubled|pg||
nt|xenya: they won't get too far at this pace|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like it|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: this is a peaceful one|pg||
nt|mamos: ah   a sort of inverted :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so were 2@H and 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: but for the ruff,  5 @c would be ok |pg||
nt|daman: I would never have passed the N hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nasytherr|pg||
nt|kemperg: must be good if the Israelis do|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: confirmed 5@s|pg||
nt|xenya: S might double again now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the @H suit will be lost|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  agian E takes an unorthodox position|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  did South believe that the double was takeout, by a passed vulnerable hand, rather than just diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why would S bid 3@S? Vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  or was he just competing in diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 800 or 1100 depending on where they fight it out|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like 800, more if they bid 5@d|pg||
nt|idc: undo operator - i expect this is by E-W?|pg||
nt|paulg:  As 1@s is limited, no thoughts from West of a slam despite the perfect heart holding|pg||
nt|paulg:  we can see there is not much to this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Adam in a trance|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashing to 6?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Must discard @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arno Lindermann|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everybody|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ja - herzlich willkommen|pg||
nt|arno11: danke:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a sane contract at last|pg||
nt|lestergold: opps ahve to find a club or trump lead to beat 4 which is after all a fair contract vulnerable|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  i agree Germ|pg||
nt|santyclz: A fine "midnight swiss" preemptive jump overcall.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@C Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: string of relay bids i assume|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Gazilli cofirmed by spec|pg||
nt|kemperg: last train again|pg||
nt|po-s: or he thinks partner has hearts...|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i suggested pn bopard 12 7 imps to sweden who opened 1H with that 11 count reached 41h and made it |pg||
nt|yuval10: so instead of +6 they got -6|pg||
nt|davidb: great def vs 4H  in board 14  by NS in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: and N might pass? |pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S gagnent - les @C sont bloquées|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ah - non deux @C et switch atout|pg||
nt|bobholl: kwets nog 3@S ?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3H bedoel je|pg||
nt|bobholl: of 3@H |pg||
nt|007 joosth: na het doublet zal N zeker op de ruitens spelen  als het een sch contract wordt|pg||
nt|007 joosth: W heeft nu ongetwijfeld hartens|pg||
nt|bridgek: 3kl erg dubieus, sch breken ru aas goed|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c by S merely seems to give another chance to EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: no lead that great for west - diam doesn't cost|pg||
nt|paulg:  quite a few options for declarer to consider, more with the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is pass for me|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a better hand than he thought I believe|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT by E makes also here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C "good raise"|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, Sweden went down in the game on board 14|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this  might be 3 down, and if S Dbl 2 down, At least thats my guess|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3H toch wel ling als je al weet dat die scheef zitten|pg||
nt|bobholl: maar het wint wel :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: link|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: think N name is Fruscoloni|pg||
nt|lestergold: also leaves more space when there is a misfit as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dunno, Italian names ain't my strongest point|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a @D to the Ace - and you pay 1430|pg||
nt|mamos: a MAKING Slam is about guessing DiaMONDS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me very optimistic with 4@d|pg||
nt|po-s: did 4s show a minimum?|pg||
nt|mamos: this is mean|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an excellent slasm and no asttempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|mamos: i heart was lead which definitely helped :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Israelis gained their swing by the excellent bidding to 6@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: scary, @CK on side but he doesnt know|pg||
nt|xenya: too tricky for me, all that -- i would have just bid 2@H as S at my second turn|pg||
nt|roswolf: even if west bids 3@H will east suapect he has 5 of them?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dagold: and 800 available here|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Adam Mesbur is considering bad trump break, eliminations and entries to dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: HI Arno|pg||
nt|mamos: oh thats very ill disciplined|pg||
nt|davidstern: Making me ill anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: so do you lead your singleton or you ace |pg||
nt|kemperg: S knows that N can bid very lightly|pg||
nt|mamos: i m ight care to take issue with "fine"|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: my ps always lead from Kx after I do that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then you're not getting into the spirit of the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Confusing it with bridge or something like that.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont agree with just the one trick but maybe they dont mind four-figure penalties|pg||
nt|kemperg: @CQ may win the trick|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer adopted what I thought was the right line in 6@S on our earlier board - Diamond ruff cash top Club cross to hand and played Club|pg||
nt|kemperg: he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were not on the same wavelength here i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, I think Verhees did himself in by not bidding 2@h (instead of his reopening dbl)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jameslee 2: Q@S = first choice 50% finnesse |pg||
nt|sybarra: *your |pg||
nt|sybarra: if only hts behaved!|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, shaky but easily making|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no 6s inevitable|pg||
nt|yuval10: assuming you play natural system, do you think North's hand worth a 1@h opening and 2@s rebid ( over a supposed 1NT ) , or is it 1@s and then 4@h for you?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Je pense que Nord aurait pu déclarer 3@s  pour montrer ses 6 cartes |pg||
pc|sA|nt|dagold: best defence|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C an excellent contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well we all know clubs vanished as a suit many years ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably need to start clubs to try to find close to 9|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but choing to rong player as the lead makes him all the rest @H |pg||
nt|bg: not easy has to duck next heart and play W for a doubleton dia honor|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: squeezzed on 3 suits lets see how he discards |pg||
nt|kemperg: do you have @HK?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, That is also a common thing. When one hand is extreamy strong and the other one is week you way to often get the strong hands suit as trumph. But this time is was a NT hand ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: (the strong one) so then they should have found the right trumph I think|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s montrait des @hs|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mamos: AND OF COURSE ABOUT wEST GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO GUESS WRONG|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@h makes now:)|pg||
nt|ritong: je suppose|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  he may lead a diamond up at trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: where is this going?|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer needs to plan for ten tricks, give up club and two hearts and hope spade finesse is working|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec told me 2@S forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: Club of course disappears|pg||
nt|peachy: if hearts were splitting|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is going to have difficult |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sommer: ..I think!|pg||
nt|sommer: @CQ would be a great falsecard form E!:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and she did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kinda torteous|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @C  K or the other 2?|pg||
nt|kemperg: He thinks his hand too strong for 2@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cameron_1: he must have run it|pg||
nt|paulg:  or not.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@S I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: overboard it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a good contract even if spade behave club also have to bhave for this to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N cant make either a scards lie|pg||
nt|mamos: oops sorry  shhh|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3K gemaakt als de hartens tijdig vrij zijn|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|newmoon: maybe -4 a'la'gib|pg||
nt|xenya: that might have got us too high -- but now it's EW who seem to be overboard|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you south will come under pressure on the run of tghe clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 2@D, 6@C and @S in NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agreed, but it probably wouldn't have been 45 years ago.|pg||
nt|lestergold: may have devlaued the K@s altho i think this is poor policy against preemptd at fave vul when opps rarely have a decent suit|pg||
nt|kemperg: now we'l see:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  After 1@s i would bid 3@h on rimsteds hand |pg||
pc|d8|nt|sommer: nooo|pg||
nt|po-s: would South rebid hearts with a singleton?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: oui |pg||
nt|ritong: et effectivement, 3SA sans arret @c avec 6@s, c est curieux|pg||
nt|ritong: il a peut etre un probleme de digestion avec les finales 30 et 90|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: d autant que partenaire pourrait avoir 2 @s  mais là le flanc a dérapé pour une fois|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Lhuissier was explaining that 3@c was singelton @s with 5@d-4@c or possibly bad 6@d-(3)4@c|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ceci explique cela|pg||
nt|ritong: tres sophistiqué|pg||
nt|hawe45: Il n´exsiste pas une couleur @S chez Nord - ou Est doit prendre cette levée...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: preuve de travail|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: et rassurant pour l estomac de nicolas|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: very disciplened pass though|pg||
nt|pelu: Laura Dekkers was on the Netherland silver-team in Ostend (women team)!!!!|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|sommer: realy?|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont think so, but 4@H was  last train, no cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: guess we are not linked up with the open room anymore...|pg||
nt|ritong: notre ami pierre schmidt nous rejoint|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hello :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dat gaat dus mis nu|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: soth needs to make a non commital lead on this auction eg @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it is by far the most important suit in so many systems|pg||
nt|gowdy: even my mother bids 1@S there and she would bid 1 nt with N|pg||
nt|yuval10: as David was saying, in board 15 Sweden went to 5@c ( although not as sacrifice )|pg||
nt|ritong: salut man|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Bonjour Pierre|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, sorry 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards liem this can  make on that line but declarfer may go forthespades|pg||
nt|lestergold: good lead at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing on hearts needs that pesky T to drop which it does|pg||
nt|kemperg: On @S he is low on entry''s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 29 c0mbined on a fairly nisfitting han d is not great for a 6n contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 of 2 down maakt weinig uit dus zal toch wel snijden|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dagold: Norman and Espen have been rewarded with 4 imps for their nice stop in 3@c on 19|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer in control here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|bg: W should switch to spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: very|pg||
nt|sommer: hm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: opp an overcall it needs to be constructive and with a scrappy 8 count you wouldnt want to be|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dagold: Rosen/Jones got in the way in the other room|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jameslee 2: upps thats the end for defence contract home :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4 more imps and Israel|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 104|pg||
nt|kemperg: Denied als @D cue I think, so after 6@C N knew it all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h is cautious with 7.5 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: zei ik  iets ?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: could play A and J of spades and if ducked rely on heart finesse for 12 tricks of course taht wont work here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in fact also a little bit nervous to be in 5@h too|pg||
nt|lestergold: most of us would have bid 4@h nad lived or died by the sword as it were|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: and Laura and her team recently were promoted to the highest league in Dutch bridge|pg||
nt|chmitty: Un début de partie "inquiétant" ... c'est comme ça qu'on dit pour les français ?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer playing carefully|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone suggest why it is so difficult to find a 5-4 club fit|pg||
nt|mamos: to be  fair West had excellent majors and p poor Clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: E maybe a little good for 1NT|pg||

pc|c2|nt|paulg:  and now he knows it was a boring hand|pg||
nt|puncher: board 18 a 5 imp gain to scotland when Irish stretched to a non-making 3N|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the only hope is that the Ace @h is under North's chair|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Mike |pg||
nt|bg: N might have played spade 10 on ace  has to be a suit preference|pg||

nt|xenya: well played for an overtrick|pg||
nt|paulg:  I like to make the opponents work for +800, but defence was very simple here |pg||
nt|paulg:  you have a sinking feeling with contracts like this .. taken three failing finesses and you know that there was a winning line somewhere|pg||
nt|puncher: likely to be flat though|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might be surprised it is a push |pg||
nt|lestergold: well that was silly altho neither worked|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a junior push|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ghehehe :P|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing a heart ws surely hopeless at that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Remembers me of last year, going one of in a 6NT with 12 tricks from top, winning 3 imps against 6S-3|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly Spade position|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I can barely see the table anymore, so maybe I'll have to take a break|pg||
nt|mamos: Some pairs play 3@d to show short @d  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what would 1NT-2C-3C be?|pg||
nt|mamos: yep well done  well in control  for an undeserved -1imp for NS here|pg||
nt|mamos: 20/20 coming up|pg||
nt|mamos: Junior Bridge is frustrating a mixture of brilliance and the absurd -  one thing that is frustrating if you try to encourage and develop young players is that they sometimes just ...|pg||
nt|mamos: dont stop to think  often things are done at breakneck speed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is turning into a pakistan v west indies|pg||
nt|peachy: inexperience and perhaps being flustered facing world champion Israeli team|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this table has been playing slower than typical juniors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Unlucky sklam here|pg||
nt|hawe45: slam|pg||
nt|mikael_w: wow, THAT was a togh spade-finess, to get an extra overtrick and at the same time risk the contrakt|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi and welcome Yuval :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: They received a new deal no 1, but i don't think we can show it|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel has won this tournement twice in the last 3 years ( winning 3rd last year ), they want to go back to the finals this year as well|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: sur le movie on évite de scorer les finales 30 et 90  plus qu'inquiétantes|pg||
nt|bridgek: 3nt for NS, difficult to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: and 13 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  There was an appeal from the Wales-Scotland match yesterday afternoon. The decision has gone in Wales' favour and has resulted in another VP for them, the final result now being 20-10 VPs to Wales.|pg||
nt|puncher: surprising pass from John |pg||
nt|paulg:  EW do play 2NT as weak with both minors ... perhaps they need better suits at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|puncher: ahh|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@h from South?|pg||
nt|sybarra: N very unlike to have singleton diamond |pg||
nt|arno11: He already showed his skills in bd 13 with a fine declarer play|pg||
nt|bg: spade 8 could be anything but best for pard to simply read it as top of nothing|pg||
nt|bg: besides he has an easy heart return|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes bruce pity true |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: agree with you Bruce|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d on here|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is in 2@Dx on 3|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am shocked, I tell you shocked!. I did not think there was anyone else who passed the East hand these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you can't blame anyone for passing |pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: although I'm beginning to learn that it's dangerous to make such predictions |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 55 minutes is Netherlands Juniors vs Germany|pg||

nt|ritong: non|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Appeals are an unappealing part of the game. Why can't players just get on with the game|pg||
nt|puncher: 3@H enough second in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an excellent 6@c|pg||
nt|bg: also E can count 15 points in N hand may hot have dia Q|pg||

nt|ritong: ce garçon est un roc|pg||
nt|chmitty: sage :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: I blame East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, some of us still have standards|pg||
nt|po-s: In Europe we play solid bridge|pg||
nt|007 joosth: leuk spel in NZ voor T Walsh    makkelijk om de sch fit te ontdekken dan|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: with splitted @d honours and @h4-1, they can defeat 5@h|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 5 vanished|pg||
nt|ritong: il a manoeuvré très adroitement sur les deux coups chers|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dagold: Rosen also bid 3@d but tried 3N over 3@h, probably figuring he had suggested doubt|pg||
nt|xenya: and another quiet board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  You would just go with the Director's ruling?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: NS may overreach here with cards lying badly|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is takeout without spades, a method popular in Europe|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why have a director. Just assume the opponents are not cheating and accept what happens|pg||
nt|paulg:  this was a case of misinformation where a splinter was not alerted but said to be natural|pg||
nt|paulg:  unsurprisingly this caused the opponents not to appreciate their fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the lead you can afford a loser in every suit, so some may play the @hA first|pg||
nt|puncher: things could get interesting now|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c from Walker?|pg||
nt|puncher: yes at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: even withe 4/1 club break it looks pretty good|pg||
nt|sybarra: a makeable 3 nt,  not sure all will get there |pg||
nt|bg: EW playing 2 of a major reasonable hand and 2 Dia opening to show weak two in a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: and yes they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|kemperg: cricket?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think I am right Yuval, this Israel team won the jrs competitiion  at the Olympiad in Philly|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: le fils de son talentueux père|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|bridgek: And look where those standards bring you|pg||
nt|andyv:  9 imps to Isreal on board 2 as S bid 4@s and got dbld.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|dagold: Espen would be able to bid if he was in the balancing seat here|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H=@S no doubt|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when eight tricks is the limit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thayare juniors Mike - what you suggest comes with age and experience|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: don't know what happened; somehow i opened the wrong deal. Sorry about tha|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Nice stop:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  As cards lie:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: By opening strange with 1 NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes they did|pg||
nt|sharkey: They have picked up 23 IMPs on the first 3 boards this half|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're the reigning world champions|pg||
nt|bridgek: 3/4 ru ew-2sch ns|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: we didnt cash our tricks Er? |pg||
nt|hawe45: Nu er jeg der|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW has gone down some slams today|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will see if they bid another|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep - a rout|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, I dont use it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slam needs 2 out of 3 finesses, so only 50% ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@S or 2@C now ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: was 1@s a muddy the waters bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this will get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now might go overboard|pg||
nt|mamos: 2Nt presumanbly  now|pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer like we play them|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to reach tho|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, swede as I am I offcurse hold my thumbs hard for sweden, But I must say Israel has played extreamly solid the hole way and also in this match|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N =@S?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Dire 3@d ça n'est pas pour dire 4@s ensuite normalement ...|pg||
nt|ritong: ça me semble excessivement discipliné, dans le contexte|pg||
nt|chmitty: Bon Jean-Paul, c'est scoré maintenant|pg||
nt|ritong: il sont menés a la mi temps et on deux coups de trafalgar|pg||
nt|ritong: ont*|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: je m'y attendais  :(|pg||
nt|ritong: c est sûrement @dVxx qui lui a déplu|pg||
nt|ritong: il y a bien entendu quatre pedantes de tête|pg||
nt|ritong: perdantes:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pedant... - interessant|pg||
nt|chmitty: je ne pense pas qu'Est ait dit son dernier mot|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: une donne favorable pour NS   car 4 @d gagnent sauf sur entame atout|pg||
nt|ritong: alors la, je sais de quoi je parle:)|pg||
nt|ritong: en matière de pédantisme, je ne crains personne|pg||
nt|hawe45: Meme avec entame atout|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: exact le @c s 'enva|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks to be the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not that 1N rates to make on this layout |pg||
nt|paulg:  this could be a gain as I think 4@h is more Carroll's style|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|rich89: is 1@s nat?|pg||
nt|rich89: y..|pg||
nt|kemperg: X was @S I think, good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45: går i lobby nu|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why would W bid 2@C, would bid 2@H for transfer and then 3@H or 4@D.|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamond lead may give 9th  immediately|pg||
nt|mamos: or Spade for that matter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Ill stop after this one|pg||
nt|arno11: W cld make 3 NT on a @D lead but......|pg||
nt|the saint: Can just ruff two hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|the saint: 3N is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this one is a sound slam 8 card fit combined 32 points control rich hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:(|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe   |pg||
nt|peachy: To answer kibitzers, http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: np|pg||
nt|sommer: the primary reason for the finesse - as I see it - is that @CQ could be very worng from Q9, IF S has 5c @C!|pg||
nt|kemperg: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Ernst, But can you in any way get the result in when they have played it so the IMP:s will be right ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so thay are definatly worth winning if the win|pg||
nt|ahalim: !NT shows @S's I think|pg||
nt|hawe45: Une carte noire en tout cas|pg||
nt|ritong: non, ce que je veux dire, c est que dans ce contexte, nord dit 4@s direct et compte les blessés éventuels a la fin de la donne|pg||
nt|bridgek: 2C may help them|pg||
nt|bobholl: is he worth 3@D now ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  really? you should see some of the things the Poles and the Italians, not to mention the Norwegians and the English open|pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: pretty chunky 2N overcall not sure with two tens it was right|pg||
nt|dagold: dangerous in the middle of a live auction, mainly because partner will expect more|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S likely shows exactly 3 cards |pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass by s shows ...|pg||
nt|xenya: safe contract :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like playing bridge with or against Philadelphia lawyers|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hans is speaking to Roland I am sure,  not mind all |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 'brilliant dummy'|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards spitting at N/S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E hoping the club suit comes in |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: East shaking his head|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2S lijkt me 1 down|pg||
nt|bridgek: idd|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1sa ook|pg||
nt|bridgek: dit is twee down|pg||
nt|bridgek: minstens|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  West does not have an easy lead |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Nor the next time he gets in|pg||
nt|paulg:  and may feel the pressure throughout the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  might lead small club|pg||
nt|paulg:  although North's actions suggest the minors|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But @H lead is obvious I think|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Partner could easily have the ten|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he is thinking then Anderson now knows where everything is|pg||
nt|sybarra: was he smiling when he said that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Israel had a very difficult start |pg||
nt|sybarra: they lost first match big|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to get to|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well em|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 1N raptor on N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south was worth 4@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: leads also to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: becoming dizzy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wrongly directed with the ace of the 4th suit.  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: anything home and hosed|pg||
nt|yuval10: not that big...17:13 to the schools team|pg||
nt|ahalim: 1@S is the forcing NT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|2hplus4: Not a conclusion you really can draw against Short or Walker|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is going down two, a good save against 4@s or 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: we try to make Erwin laugh as commentators |pg||
nt|arno11: W shld probaby act over 1@S  e.g. with 1NT|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if East opens, nothing will stop W|pg||
nt|mamos: and North has no reason to go on|pg||
nt|mamos: except the enthuisiasm of youth and confidence in partner's declarer play|pg||
nt|sybarra: and why not? |pg||
nt|mamos: both NS have nice hands 14 points but good tricks and shape |pg||
nt|yuval10: then went on a tear of 20's|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|roswolf: it is noticeable n/s are taking consistent conservative actions - they are 17 imps up which shows there is a lot of merit in this style|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dagold: Should be an easy make|pg||
nt|dagold: Either ruff two hearts in dummy or set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: depending on the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has enuf to make anotyher move|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have not been beaten up yet |pg||
nt|bg: I would have bid 3nt with S hand after two hearts too close to only bid 2nt North might easily have passed 2nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 45 minutes: USA vs Israel Juniors|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it looks like 6 @s will depend on !3-2 and a @d finess|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kemperg: afraid of 4-1/5-0|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u its easy for teh defence to help declarer on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match in about 45 minutes is USA v Denmark|pg||
nt|lestergold: jx @d becomes big when pasrtner has reversed and rebid @ds |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not many pauirs even at open level would find 6@d|pg||
nt|kemperg: girls in OR have 1 disaster after the other|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps after anugly 1N opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes doubling 3@h into game was not a very good shot|pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@D has a chance|pg||
nt|bridgek: well done|pg||
nt|milton_se: nicely undertaken|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I watched some Swedes yesterday afternoon my time ...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: the lead is easy but what next?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another high heart declarer will surely duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence have to be extremely careful not to open @ds for example|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes the defence shd be passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u a @d at trick 2 works|pg||
nt|the saint: West is unlimited. You have a maximum pass so partner can't go overboard. Bid 3C to show support and develop the auction|pg||
nt|mamos: Germany need something alittle more exciting if they are going to get back some imps|pg||
nt|andreasw:  50% is more then enough for juniors:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that will not work. Sp lets see if they stop in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|yuval10: took 1st place somewhere towards the end of the first day and never looked back|pg||
nt|bobholl: very well !! :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding, fast board|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: Ortega, keeps leading spade honors |pg||
nt|gowdy: now the 3 @S tricks are blocked|pg||
nt|sybarra: then ou get a club lead and all is well |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 8 ever 9 never here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well that takes care of that|pg||
nt|lestergold: board 4 holding 4 to the J|pg||
nt|kemperg: and giving away a spade trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dagold: ruff hearts|pg||
nt|arno11: what wld X show for you guys after 1@D-X-1@S ?|pg||
nt|xenya: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|yuval10: estimated score now is 12:9 Sweden, as 2@d gone for 500|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Why is the 1nt so wierd:)?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a lot of strong no-trump plyaers open 1NT on any 5332 shape|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@c is an improvising bid from W it seem|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = multi - 2@H pass/correct, 2NT strong, 3@H tranfer, |pg||
nt|yuval10: normal to bid 4@d to show strength and fit @s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Thanks Ernst, When will they play board 1 then? At the end or as soon as they get the board ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: double dummy you can make all 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: le danger serait une défense fantôme à 5 @d  mais c est peu probable|pg||
nt|bridgek: In Holland most would open also|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course, playing 4-card majors makes it more difficult for East|pg||
nt|mamos: no  chnce for this contract with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a friendly lay out|pg||
nt|lestergold: stes up 2@d tricvks to go with 2 @hs and a @s|pg||
nt|peachy: Th French team also has wnjoyed sucess in past tournaments|pg||
nt|hawe45: You must add @C Queen third|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: at the end|pg||
nt|po-s: good bidding here - North to get the right lead and East to avoid it|pg||
nt|bridgek: It's not Paulissen doesn't like bidding|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: poor play by declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: if that what happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: but undone|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats inexperience|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was the rush hearts were likely to be continued|pg||
nt|mamos: yes @hK looks wrong at Trick 1    or 2    and defence just has enough tricks to defeat now|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 3NT was ever making realistically  |pg||
nt|lestergold: it tkaes careful defence to beat thjis if declarer ducks two rounds of hearts i|pg||
nt|ahalim: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: more to the point defence have 6 tricks to come now altogether|pg||
nt|mamos: ive always thought thee should be a new card in the bidding box  "Undo"   could I try that one again ::)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp tjat West has shown his 20HCP and good @S-support, so he can stop in 4@S - but he has the @D-cue, so..|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S have to get an early round of hearts in|pg||
pc|c4|nt|puncher: yes 4@C was enough to not allow them to untangle their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c might be taken as weak|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C and 3@H for NS but dificult to find :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: bd 2 paid off for the dutch kids |pg||
nt|sybarra: aka jrs|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes, my point was they had a shakey start (for them)|pg||
nt|davidb: NS  migth bid 3NT in OR in this board !  or at least 3D|pg||
nt|yuval10: this board should also be a good one for Israel|pg||
nt|yuval10: as 3@d is laydown|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might play @d8 or 9 - try to persaude North he has Kx   |pg||
nt|andyv:  as the saying goes, can't argue with success|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has shown a hand worth a game try on an uncontested auction of 1@s 2@s which would ne an acceptNCE WITH SOUTH'SHAND|pg||
nt|the saint: 2H sets up a game force|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  but I'm surprised that West passed when he has a normal 4@h call|pg||
nt|puncher: Other room are currrently playing 5@C doubled so a few imps to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson pretty sure that the ace of clubs is onside given the spade return|pg||
nt|the saint: So 3C can't be passed|pg||
nt|the saint: Many also use a lebensohl type relay in this position to cater for the weak hands|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2nt forces 3C  so 3 C is strong|pg||
nt|peachy: in U25|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: looks like 1 down, maybe 2 -- but it won't make|pg||
nt|sybarra: where would he rather be 6 @C?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: probably a push if S opens 1N in the other room as well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you try to ruff down the @cQ arent you giving up on the finesse?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not open 1NT when holding AQ10xx in a major but I play a weak NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes / I see|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of imps in the lead now|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong red !q in East|pg||
nt|ahalim: but in practice you may go down in 6 on a @C lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: you WILL go down, no possible way to figure the @d's out|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Arifin? You got me? How are you going to make that ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: but perhaps the 4@c bid will make N lead something else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: depends on what NS lead from three small, of course|pg||
nt|007 joosth: missch toch nog ingooi waarbij W van de sch af moet spelen|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play  aow on the lead and let W be high on @sQ... Probably making|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  being told that 13 points is a strong opening bid :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: best by E|pg||
nt|pelu: same bidding over 2NT in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: well so does 6@S -- on this layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be tricky|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45: Must be discussed for every pair|pg||
nt|m_niemi: West passes some times forcing bids, so East didn't want to risk anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: but would bid 3@c with a minimum and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|gowdy: "Ingberman" in north america|pg||
nt|lestergold: lower range of 3@c is suely no9t strong|pg||
nt|the saint: Hence why Ingberman/Blackout is played to allow a direct 3C to show values|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless partnership agrees that 2n only shows a minimum|pg||
nt|mikael_w: A and K@d I think is best now|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he leads a @H from  S |pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, same thing. @h to K and @h back to A and @dA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gowdy: for me penalty  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: have to dash folks but p[lenty of you cu later|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the  @d auction was ridiculous|pg||
nt|kemperg: hook, hook, hook, claim|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maar O zal wel sch naspelen|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dagold: technically he should cash the diamond Ace here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play low....|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suppose West opens 1@h and East responds 1@s, what does West rebid?|pg||
nt|bridgek: dat is slecht, partner heeft 5ha|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|puncher: WBU still 30 or so ahead of England, and Wales now in the 25 zone against N Ireland|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the hand was bid rather well considering how light n/s open|pg||
nt|ritong: clean living:)|pg||
nt|xenya: no problems in 6 -- 4 is different|pg||
nt|ahalim: my grandma wd have bid 6 and finesse everything in sight|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: however this auction points to the ned for a look at theirbidding methods|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ingberman is over reverses but some have extended it to 2-level jump shifts by opener as well.|pg||
nt|the saint: It is definitely worth playing it in these positions too|pg||
nt|sybarra: well see......thats why you bid it |pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks John!|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks John|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cash @H first|pg||
nt|sybarra: Neth girls lead France 38/17|pg||
nt|007 joosth: minder slecht als je p dwingt om sch na te spelen zo|pg||
nt|bobholl: waarom heeft zuid geen 4@H zo zeker zijn de signalen toch niet ?|pg||
nt|bridgek: met ha na kan je partner nx fout doen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Bauke zal echt wel zijn distr hebben aangegeven in de hartens denk ik|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tomi2: EW will be happy to see flat hands after those huge swings in the beginning, they know they dont need more imps because the VP scale stops at 25 vp for 37 imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: trying never costs :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridgek: that seems wrong to duck|pg||
nt|po-s: fortunately he has no more diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: and spades is no future|pg||
nt|bridgek: He must play hearts|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb:  either major is good enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but E will make now. N should have won @cA and a @h shift|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S won't do if he takes A (2@S and 2@C only|pg||
pc|dA|nt|newmoon: he heard u|pg||
nt|jcomyn: love this story = Paddy the Irishman, Paddy the englishmasn and paddy the scotsman attended a lecture on extremes. Paddy the englishman asked what the opposite of sadness was - ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: elation, he said. Paddy the scotsman asked the opposite of joy was - sadness he said. Paddy the Irishman asjed the oppoite of Woe - said Giddyup|pg||
nt|kemperg: as was the 3@D on 5|pg||
nt|mikael_w: it diddnt matter if they cashed the @h first|pg||
nt|yuval10: so he must play @d now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andreasw:  I would almost Allways open 1nt on W hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: maybe S dont know who has the last @d|pg||
nt|bridgek: na drie keer ha speelt de leider snel sch naar de koning, kans voor ncontract|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mikael_w: ohhhh :(|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: u cant balance angels on pinheads good trumps and a  couple of cards must be enuf|pg||
nt|henryb:  All N has to do is shift to a @h when he wins the @cA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: met open kaarten kan een kleine @C maar als zuid 5@C heeft een ramp|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|puncher: So Wales can't do much more, but England might perk up - just a case of whether they can do enough or not|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
nt|pelu: best to play @C now to get some count|pg||
nt|yuval10: South took a view that declarer doesn't have 4 @h's|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I think the slam is a little less then 50%. But I also remember when I was a junior. And this slam would be bid even if you could see all the cards before bidding :)|pg||
nt|pelu: give East @DQ and not @Hq - and we all would say: missed lay down slam :):)|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR West took the @D-finess in trick 2??|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: He looks like Rodin's thinker now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think its a big chanse/risk this slam will be bid in all 4 tables, but lets se|pg||
nt|bridgek: for nine tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|santyclz: It can't be a winning strategy in the long run to allow your opps to play 1 level contracts unless you know they (and you) have no fit.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a stiff i meant to stay|pg||
nt|mamos: The bridge table can be a lonely place when things go badly and get worse and worse and worse|pg||
nt|bobholl: too late|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: i wonder if 2@c was invitational or GF, doesn't look so likely that South will accept an invitation so quickly with his hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|the saint: A chance for Belgium to get a few back|pg||
nt|jcomyn: claim|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was wrong. declarer has 9 now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suppose so but 1@h followed by 2@d sounds like an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Give East 4-2-4-3 and 9-10 points... can easy miss game|pg||
nt|milton_se: the Israelis have done extremely well this far|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|kemperg: I think inv|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzag: 2@c was 2way cbs|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: could have doubled 1@s with the trumps and no other features|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hmmm, wonder what the reason was for that ?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lucky man|pg||
nt|psridhar: I have -but my above comment applied to me as well :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what if East had 6 hearts, PS?|pg||
nt|psridhar: However Westra backed himself rather earlier and landed wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|psridhar: valid point Roland question of odds i guess...besides these guys make preemptive overcall whenever they get a chance|pg||

nt|cicus: Emight recover here after making a heavy pass first|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|cicus: other table doubled over 1@D, 1@H is another option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you double 1@D, Gábor? And if you do, what do you bid after 2@C from partner?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|cicus: first thought was I 'd bid 1@H but I like X, then subside|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Fair enough, then you must pass 2@C|pg||
nt|psridhar: some play 1N by W as 4@s and 6+ @c here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a strong believer in not overcalling with 4|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||

mc|10|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but he'll compete with 3 and not such a good hand|pg||

nt|paulg:  unfortunately the crash meant that our operator could not catch up with the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  not Alan's fault of course, but unfortunate on an interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Operation misfit :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well only 8 tricks at that point but defence is under a lot of pressure omn the run of spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but what shall W return when only minors left?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compliments to the players, they are playing at a fast pace:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good result for Austria(Österreich)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Another bad minor-break here|pg||
nt|santyclz: You also need to discuss what a jump shift forces to, game? 4 of a minor?  Both are used.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finns made 4@h in OR bd 23|pg||
nt|gowdy: on the muli hand  NS had a good auction to 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: nine tricks are easy now so North was obviously   correct :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: we all have that experience|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 78@d auction when south rebid 3@d after the 1H response north had AKxx of spades which she should have showb rather than raise to 4@ds with a low doubleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Tofte telling Lee he almost finessed in @c as Lee ducked so quickly|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and here|pg||
nt|po-s: doesn´t everybody nowadays play 2C as puppet to 2D?|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a nice slam hand|pg||
nt|davidb: playin J &10 shows 2  J 10X  -J& x|pg||
nt|ahalim: playing for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: was that a safe line?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: un  4@s  qui me semble bateau|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Nederste linje med bl. a. grønne firkanter, ses kun halvt. Kan jeg rykke noget|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am happy it is only practice :) rooting for the dutch|pg||
nt|bridgek: goed 1down, goed bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Fight between North and East here|pg||
nt|paulg:  NS may bid 4@s if Matheson supports in competition|pg||
nt|lestergold: what do u do with 8 spades vul but only one high card and not in spaxdes?|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   this is where I have results |pg||
nt|tomi2: other table already finished, that is not so seldom with Hop-Helmich playing :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner wopuld then  have rebid 3N whioch would have ended the auction|pg||
nt|santyclz: Echo.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 10 points and 4 @d East might raise 2@d to 3@d|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: il ne va rien se passer sur celle ci|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 3nt reached (partly because of polish club)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|2hplus4: E would like to look for @H fit and play in 3@C Can he achieve that?|pg||
nt|gowdy: will west be quite here|pg||
nt|gowdy: I think not|pg||
nt|mamos: NS can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is W thinking he should get in?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west is a she and yes she is thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty :)  didnt know a "she"|pg||
nt|bg: with S I like a 4 dia splinter firstly you have the single dia but you should also promise not ot have two club losers thus on this hand N could move with confidance but now has a ...|pg||
nt|bg: problem with his club holding|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 13|pg||
nt|jcomyn: alright be like that - anyway i think it is funny|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H = 4+@s|pg||
nt|bridgek: 6kl??|pg||
mb|d|nt|newmoon: If NT here, and a @H lead... is the timing out now?|pg||
nt|paulg:  upgrade from Walker, nice intermediates|pg||
nt|puncher: an unlikely 6@D here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be fun |pg||
nt|lestergold: i would open 3@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have jammed them up a bid  now a free ride really |pg||
nt|mamos: i prefer to bid my Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: 21-19 points   for this one looks less exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry guys, I'm almost faling asleep with the speed at this table|pg||
nt|mamos: did North really pass??? surely 1NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Took the middle road between 3@h and 4@c and went directly to 4@h.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East acts: flush in @d|pg||
nt|bg: W double another ambiguous bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @C in tempo ...pls|pg||
nt|davidstern: Everyone happy with 4@S bid?|pg||
nt|bg: not I|pg||
nt|davidstern: Im not a fan - too big a chance of hearts, more in spades and other things|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am so sure of the splinter with that ht holding,  but can understand it |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: the 4@S bid was alerted on both sides maybe not the common 4@S?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Im not interested in slam but with boss suit.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i pass as N|pg||
nt|sommer: a gerber 3@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: close|pg||
nt|sommer: ..they play it standard|pg||
nt|po-s: they´ll learn...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord another one but hardly bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|2hplus4: Obviously not|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think most cannot do that these days, playing 2@c.... 3@c as game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think most british players i know would if pard say bids 3n u can play 4@s with confidence|pg||
nt|sybarra: or use:  http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   Competitie (left), then White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 4@s  that much  -- it depends on what you agree about splinters|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid 4@C if he has a chance|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: my agreements with splinters are may be unique, but I dont have xxx (or jxxxxx) in an outside suit |pg||
nt|davidstern: If 5@S asks south to bid six with club control I would have perhaps tried that|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyone understand the double of 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: "cards" ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 5 @C if you want  |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Even if you hold your thumbs for Israel you must feel better that Fisher makes the finess. In the long run he will make alot of IMP:s doing that|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably some imps back to Israel here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: or correction. He will lose alot less IMP:s doing that|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s = in the OR is a very good score|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction in the OR is a little surprising after WEst overcalled|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the alerts should be moved - 1@C and 1@H are alerted|pg||
nt|pelu: pass and 1NT naturel|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|mamos: surprising that East let NS play 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Rodin is back again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks, pard, thinks West |pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: bold but sensible double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, in that case n-s weren't robbed.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3@c shows a fit so Short might be tempted to bid on|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was thinking more of getting to the better game|pg||
nt|paulg:  which is probably 5@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime will just bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East will be on the spot ... and the one thinking now|pg||
nt|mamos: looks a very ordinary 3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Problem is, that when you bid with this West-hand - partner will bring you too high|pg||
nt|arno11: 6 in a minor possible here but difficult to make....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w are not too flush here in a high level club contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Pass alerted by east, not by west|pg||
nt|pelu: S was on the france junior gold-team in 2009 (Brasov) - and 2 x spangenberg on NL-girls in 2007 - Silver - so we have real topclass here!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho i would nevber have jumped to 3@d with such an awful suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think both of them take some blame for that auction|pg||
nt|sommer: many Danes play Gerber up-side -down|pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer(Walsh?)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Have to be careful not to get overboard on this one.|pg||
nt|kemperg: p and I use it for weak hands, with inv+ we use transters|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i don't think everyone would've accept the invitation with South's hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1H = @s ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, my guess is 6@c even if 6 NT will do as well|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C slams some times hard to find...|pg||
nt|sybarra: N thinking about this  |pg||
nt|bridgek: North should rdbl, 160 is no prize|pg||
nt|bobholl: curious what jan jansma does after redouble pass pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it may be that South's pass denies three spades|pg||
nt|bridgek: beter dan de 6sa ze eerder boden|pg||
nt|roswolf: a thin 3nt here for e/w|pg||
mb|r|an|3|nt|paulg:  but West's pass is deafening|pg||
nt|sybarra: ehaa....every hand an adventure!|pg||
nt|mamos: West had better not think she has defence|pg||
nt|bg: The doudle is cards vut as happened in last match partner thought otherwise and allowed -590 vs makinf game themselves|pg||
nt|bg: double|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Israel NPC reaches for more heart medicine?|pg||
nt|peachy: this looks like transfer|pg||
nt|bobholl: but N @S are too weak for that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: Excellent grand slam in a balck suit here as long as they promise not to lead diamonds :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd prefer to double with the North hand rather than introduce that club suit, although it would complicate things later on|pg||
nt|paulg:  South a little fixed now and may just raise to 4@c|pg||
nt|puncher: hand for the bad 2N for south - to show a minimum opener with 6 diams|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think 3@h is likely with nothing in hearts when his partner has failed to double|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might miss 4 @H though Mike?|pg||
nt|mamos: op????|pg||
nt|mamos: undoo??|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh thats better|pg||
nt|m_niemi: his shape is good suit texture not so good|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4 th suit forcing 2@D |pg||
nt|jcomyn: very odd|pg||
nt|kemperg: think it is|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass as North|pg||
nt|peachy: It is a current trend, to use transfer bids in a lot of sequences|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N was the better choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know 1NT here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dekkers and Robert very surprised the tray came back without further bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: must be 4/5+|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 1NT hearts and diamonds yes|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like 5 IMPs for Israel|pg||
nt|mamos: so this should be a gain for Israel|pg||
nt|milton_se: no surprise, Brink couldn-t resist|pg||
nt|bridgek: dbl of 2C would be penalty on spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: jan will be glad with @S Q in dummy |pg||
nt|bridgek: With a good defensive hand vs east, you should aim higher then 160|pg||
nt|bobholl: snitje op @H B|pg||
nt|roswolf: support rdbl?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: South checking cards re the club bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: internet problems at hotel folks, sorry for breaks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3@s it might not have been very easy for e/wto reach this meakeable game|pg||
nt|mamos: NORTH 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!|pg||
nt|mamos: too late he dropped dead :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may have dropped dead on this hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: mee too|pg||
nt|kemperg: mee too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still might work out well|pg||
nt|lestergold: my principle is simple a jump rebid always guarantees a suit with no more than one loser except in very exceptional circumstances when u are really fixed for any altgernative|pg||
nt|mamos: Im told 4-6 H+D|pg||
nt|sommer: Bergen:)|pg||
nt|sommer: sryyyyyyyyyyyy Roland for the G word:(..mistypo|pg||
nt|kemperg: many Dutch play 2N nv|pg||
nt|kemperg: inv+|pg||
nt|yuval10: though kibitzers suggest that NS' style of play is to invite with very "heavy" hands|pg||
nt|chmitty: 11 levées probables|pg||
nt|milton_se: but why bid again in the N seat with a passed pard?|pg||
nt|bobholl: w regretiing his X i guess but it worked well :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Brink shaking his head...|pg||
nt|bridgek: in het bieden kan je ha-B niet vinden|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why E didn't overcall 1N first time... they may be playing some 2 suiter showing when they overcall 1N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzzc: rewiring tomorrow morning so should be back to normal|pg||
nt|dagold: unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: 9 tricks only, it seems on a @H lead, else 11|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like a bidding missunderstanding |pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 3N showed or was thought to show 4/4 M or something?|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway another 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|mamos: or Imight misss a nice safe Spade part-score|pg||
nt|mamos: noooo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: try for a 5/3 fit |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if he pushes to 3nt or not |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4s a good xcontract|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H was minimum, 4 enough|pg||
nt|santyclz: That solved that problem, I was worried about a 4@c cue bid.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 losers, better not|pg||
nt|andreasw:  He Might...:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Transfer?|pg||
nt|bridgek: Looking for an excuse to bis again, |pg||
nt|ralfwil: N can take the first 7 now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d finess is almost 100% and 2 more @d ruffs |pg||
nt|bridgek: Di K certainly with east, West would have bid with KJT92 + DI K over 1di|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: East will be relieved that west has four small hearts |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C puppet?|pg||
nt|newmoon: even so, 3N T a sign-off|pg||
nt|dagold: have seen 3N played as 4/4 majors|pg||
nt|dagold: in that structure 3@h= spades or no major|pg||
nt|newmoon: if 3@D = 1 or both 4xmajor, 4@D would ask for 4M|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT could be 3=3-4-3 hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 5 more imps to England on 21 for 620 to NI and 800 to England|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not sure of the wisdom of that|pg||
nt|paulg:  if the clubs were breaking then it would need accurate defence to beat 3NT, but when they are 3-1 Walker does not have the tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing our operator lost the play with the crash of the connection, always difficult in these circumstances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What causes all these crashes?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Poor phone connection?|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can imagine that everyone except Short taking their time on this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be the wifi in the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problems this weekend have all been in the closed room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that should be a consideration in future when considering venues|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect the signal strength is not great in that area of the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Part of the problem is the devolved nature of the adminstrators|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bridge Great Britain relies on the home unions|pg||
nt|paulg:  The home union typically asks a district to run the event|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but surely an audience of over 1000 should be considered|pg||
nt|paulg:  and each district ends up running an event every seven or eight years, so never has the experience|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not write it down and pass on the experience gained?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Because there is no-one co-ordinating it all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So all bridge in Britain is as badly run as the SBU?|pg||
nt|paulg:  he does not need two diamond finesses, but has the entries for them anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: matheson says should be stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if I bid spades, I would then bid hts|pg||
nt|sybarra: if bidding the same |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i do not like this 1N opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|kemperg: soory 6 in N|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 more to Israel on 3, when EW slightly overbid to 3N in the other room (1@S by S -2 here) |pg||
nt|bridgek: bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|arno11: good idea to stay in 3N...|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite  but my juniors when I was captain bid  but if you don;t think you can buy the hand don;t give free information|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - double-dummy 6 NT is rather dold|pg||
nt|hawe45: cold|pg||
nt|davidstern: Stripe tailed double|pg||
nt|mamos: 1280  is an "interesting score"|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it was XX |pg||
nt|davidstern: Just so you know 120+120+120+120+50+50+200+200|pg||
nt|davidstern: +300 for game =1280|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4@S was something like 0+15 HCP with 5card spade and no interest in slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: why dbl in S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what s woiuld have bid if e passes|pg||
nt|mamos: I think 2@D by North might have been wiser :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: If it would've promised 6@d's, north would've bid 2@d I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: trf to 4@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4NT quant.|pg||
nt|yuval10: and South should accept|pg||
nt|yuval10: as he showed 20-21|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so now a quant with 5 or 6 @c ?|pg||
nt|davidb: can  we have explanations ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT is 20-21|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT trf|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps S shud cue instead of 4@C|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4NT quantitive|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@c will be to play|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think N has bid the hand well|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: just claims 11 |pg||
nt|xenya: a contract to my taste|pg||
nt|hawe45: Best lead according to the bidding|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice try here|pg||
nt|kemperg: French captain confirms 4-6|pg||
nt|pelu: so prob 9+ red cards with longer @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: wow the israelis are human after all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They play canapÃ© - but not both of them|pg||
nt|bridgek: heel slecht  bieden|pg||
nt|bobholl: zuid heeft 3 kleine rot @S en zwakke @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the thin game is reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: west bids what he thinks he can make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: variation of standards with overcalls e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  might bid 6@c now|pg||
nt|mamos: EW more likely to make game in Spades than Hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have two suits with all ur points in them as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i hope this gets whacked and defended properly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes he did |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 quick tricks need a 9 th |pg||
nt|sybarra: vul,  probably tempting |pg||
nt|jcomyn: spose he thought n had something for 1nt|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: French girls captain|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Laura asking about French weak 2 openings|pg||
nt|mamos: either pass is some forget or a little unwise opposita partner who passed originally|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I'll ask the players after the board|pg||
nt|ritong: voyons ça|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzag: not 100% about the bidding, just took over|pg||
nt|the saint: West doesn't have a big enough club fit to justify 4C|pg||
nt|lestergold: at equal vul this is ridiculous|pg||
nt|m_niemi: W should have 4 card support|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H+1@S+@C+1@D=8|pg||
nt|bg: anthing but a club will make it hard to find 9th trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C in bad position for the Q@C |pg||
nt|xenya: interesting double of 3N in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ouchhhh|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Looks like -1:(|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahalim: asking for a @D lead  ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: And so did S|pg||
nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3x ruiten nu   kost een iintroever maar de hartens ga je dan wel goed doen|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Does this auction call for the lead of the highest card in your hand?  Lindsay doesn't think so.|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@d is probably keycard blackwood (kickback)|pg||
nt|kemperg: I have a younger partner, so I use them a lot|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR also in 7@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: price of lack of discipline|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, it really starts to look tough for sweden now when board 16 was no income|pg||
nt|ritong: j avoue ne pas visualiser l affaire directement|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: pas encore vu la 11 ème levée|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  with 4NT showing 2 keycards and no @cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i must admit that I thought this was the stronger form of weak raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East had already told his cards, so why bid 5@c|pg||
nt|santyclz: or HHx with Hx in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kemperg: No @D cue, always end in4|pg||
nt|santyclz: One would assume - and might make 5 anyway;.|pg||
nt|chmitty: voyons si le flanc peut casser le squeeze @h@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pitiful:  9 or 10 tricks looks likely here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: sime gave adam stronger version|pg||
nt|tomi2: he was on lead himself|pg||
nt|mamos: a little surprised tht North has sold out to 3@h|pg||
nt|davidb: nice bidding . 12 tricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: now 8 possible|pg||
nt|po-s: overtricks are as good as redoubles|pg||
pc|s2|nt|puncher: seems I've missed some excitement!|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S Q saves the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: K telling her partner something?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and dats dat|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has to make this one |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dagold: this is ok on careful play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: That is the problem with 3@C |pg||
nt|puncher: the dodgy connections are infectious|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short knows that it is on the club finesse, but his club intermediates are good.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the cards are very friendly and every chance of a gain|pg||
nt|paulg:  but eleven tricks nevertheless|pg||
nt|lestergold: to m ake a voluntury call holding no more than 3 to the K and a stiff in pard's other suit is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|the saint: Ducked?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should duck the @S JIng|pg||
pc|d3|nt|puncher: this will be a fortunate make for scotland but we've all been in worse :)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has eight tricks here now   can he find a ninth?|pg||
nt|po-s: North did have a heavy hand|pg||
nt|mamos: thats seven tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  King|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C now is best|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jameslee 2: rule of 7 he duck 1 @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: help from opps|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|pelu: no down 1 in toptricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: I think South might have just bid 5@C over 3@C since it would be a picture raise|pg||
nt|garnetts: Since the clubs break maybe lose 2 imps to 4@S making five |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps not everyone, but we certainly have|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may not have been the greatest duck in history|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho it has grosvenor elements about it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Aflac...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N want's to retain trump control|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N expects p not to have trumps anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so that way ducking wouldn't cost anything|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bad breaks in the majors are gong to make the play tricky|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, are you that sure 1 NT will make ?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 35 minutes: Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @s8 and W will make|pg||
nt|ahalim: can make now|pg||
nt|lestergold: east hassnt promised 6 @cs|pg||
nt|bg: EW not on same wavelength |pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as spec notes - have you discussed with partner whether the pass of 4@Sxx by Eats suggests he wants to defend or nothing to say|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kemperg: not now|pg||
nt|sommer: 2NT GF mainly in DK|pg||
nt|mikael_w: just giva a @s away and 12 tricks are 100%|pg||
nt|bobholl: dat is nog niet zeker 6@D tegen 7@S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone. Sry for delay|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sch heer na maakt het nu wel moeilijk|pg||
nt|bridgek: sch na  en down??|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: down zal toch wel nniet lukken? |pg||
nt|bobholl: zelfs @C na is nog lastig |pg||
nt|bridgek: ha 3-2 kl 3-2 harten boer goed en nog steeds down??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ik hoor net dat op spel 5 idd 4S is gemaakt op andere tafel|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dj Pieter|pg||
nt|bobholl: als hij speelt op @H 2 (w) en 3(O) kan het inderdaad down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: j|pg||
nt|roswolf: north working out that the contract makes and therefore cashes out|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kemperg: o yes still 1down|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive reviewed board 1 which i was late for and there was a 10 imp swing there when the dutvh giels here went off in 3n the french declarer made the correct technical play of cashing ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: the AK @s in case !q dropped and then fell back on the heart finesse which worked|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: a mon avis le déclarant va le casser lui même|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: maybe only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now trumps and this will go down a lot|pg||
nt|the saint: To be fair, one nation's juniors who I would certainly not expect to be reticent in the auction are the Finns!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most of the reticence has come from s.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he goes or a 50% position |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, NOW it sure will|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes :)|pg||
nt|ritong: voila qui est fait:)|pg||
nt|bridgek: kijk we openen ook wel eens licht  AVxxx, Kxxxx, x,xx|pg||
nt|007 joosth: als Oost harten B zou hebben,  zou hij dan klaver naspelen?|pg||
nt|bridgek: normaal gooi je een klaver weg, maar nu moet je eerst wakker worden en bedenken dat maat niks had om over na te denken|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: seems like 2 club tricks and 2 diamonds from now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oops|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 (or even 12?) available here -- but EW could hardly achieve that  |pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: frankly, i don't see what he was trying to achieve with that lead -- remember that E had shown at least 4 spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: the dutgch girl here simply chose the losing spade finesse which happened to be wrong so that was not luck but incorrect card paly|pg||
nt|lestergold: so to be fair that swing was caused in this room in effect|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if he takes the A@d no matter|pg||
nt|kemperg: try a sqeeze|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually 5 clubhs a heasrt 2 @s and a @d is enuf|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pitiful:  3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ireland 161; Eng 160; Scot 153; WBU 152; NI 103|pg||
nt|lestergold: open 3@s and arent e/w pretty stuiffed up|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right - here we also comment to play @S first|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Maybe can win on an endplay?|pg||
nt|yuval10: she sry|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzag: sorry, missaw the first @d, south took the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: position is now correct, but north on lead with @dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: makes then|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no endplay, Grönkvist shrugged and conceded down 1.|pg||
nt|roswolf: every imp counts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|m_niemi: -6!|pg||
nt|davidb: 12 tricks  100 %|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|newmoon: interesting would been a @C back after ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so, in a sense, they did quite well|pg||
nt|mamos: that was odd|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: then only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe my prediction of 9 was a little double dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it is always easier when you see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|newmoon: and another @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  E did not pitch a @c from dummy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2: he can exit with a high club and if that is ducked passively|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: Perhaps he was thinking that west had needed a @S stop and was hoping for 4441 @s distribution.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes sorry i had been late|pg||
nt|bobholl: another way of 380|pg||
nt|bridgek: 360 vs 800+ in 2ha|pg||
pc|c2|nt|puncher: Short feeling happier now|pg||
nt|the saint: Only -3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: a real horror for the German team -- the'd better wipe it out of their minds as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|tomi2: in amsterdam the comming rounds start very fast, you get the chance to make it better very soon. 6 matches a day...|pg||
nt|mamos: next :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but after a small @d from S its not clear how to play. And I have seen worse thing happend then 1 NT going down on this board even after @dA on @dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Three of the four were in the Israeli gold medal team at the World Championships in Philadelphia last October. Only Dror Padon (playing in the other room) was not. For France, only ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lhuissier and Robert were in the silver medal team then|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45: Nice squeeze againt East now|pg||
nt|kemperg: W bought it|pg||
nt|lestergold: im syre peter u would not have missed a textbook precaution like that!|pg||
nt|pelu: np - as long u have a fine analyse :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: such hands aRE VERY INSTRUCTIVE FOR THE LESS EXPERT SPECTATORS|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorrycaps lock|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I confirmed with S about the 1NT overcall: it indeed showed 4@h/6+@d's|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzag: would have been interesting if north exited with @sT|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes to keep NL firmly at zero needs a gr8 game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the old days, around 1871, one could double 4@S for penalty with the South cards. Not today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember it clearly|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cicus: this might be a 2 IMP gain for NL though|pg||
nt|psridhar: that BOTH tables passed quietly is ample evidence of what Roland says about the modern times|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be 3rd table did likewise too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me check|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No because West opened 3@S pass pass 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: a wet 3@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 7-3-3-0 shape not ideal for 3 lev preempt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Talk to Jansma about it :)|pg||
nt|cicus: as for this hand, a high @H now might be costly|pg||
nt|psridhar: Jansma had tble chemistry with him when he bid 3@s-cant argue he may beat 3nt and go plus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he led a club|pg||
nt|cicus: later the @HJ could be pinned and 2 minor suit losers disappear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: now declarer has time to set up an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|psridhar: how?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: duck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which was what he played at trick 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: dont underestimate Jansma pl :)|pg||

nt|idc: Welcome all, and we will hope that network problems in Wales will be gone now|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime will be surprised by the 1@h bid on his right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@D opening in OR was enough|pg||
nt|mamos: a part-score "steal" for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45: Minor-break again - how is the program???|pg||
nt|hawe45: This is not normal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus  for results and standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it's kinda against the odds indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: I honest think that will be a push |pg||
nt|davidstern: Being 00:30 I wish you all adieu|pg||
nt|davidstern: In Sydney Aus|pg||
nt|mamos: West's touching faith in her "cards"  has not been rewarded :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: some where some how,  we need to sort this out i the system notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn David |pg||
nt|sybarra: slaap lekker |pg||
nt|mamos: dont haVE NIGHTMARES dAVID|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no excitement here|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty wessel|pg||
nt|sommer: N played it safely, fearing a @Druff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems daft in 4|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's 25:9 for Sweden now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would need West to have 4 clubs, which is impossible on the bidding|pg||
nt|andreasw:  No 3@c is enough?|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  MUCH worse|pg||
nt|yuval10: clear to play 9@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: (of course we can see he doesnt even have to do that|pg||
nt|chmitty: hihi|pg||
nt|roswolf: another hand of mystery|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  and also by a strong 1NT|pg||
nt|wendle: open room of Match 5C will remain open to announce official result (also available at www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk)|pg||
nt|paulg:  he can double this for penalty|pg||
nt|puncher: are they 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes|pg||
nt|mamos: Im not a scientific bidder  so I'd justt smack6@c on the table if I was West|pg||
nt|mamos: NS have  big hands again    with just two diamond losers but 5@S may be too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: no might about it|pg||
nt|sommer: now slamtime|pg||
nt|jcomyn: back to excitement  how are they with minor slams|pg||
nt|yuval10: 13 more imps @@ board 4|pg||
nt|hawe45: 6 @C - mais avec pas mal de travail|pg||
nt|bridgek: how much is 1spXX+1 anyway|pg||
nt|bobholl: toch zit je wat liever in 6@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: pass missing|pg||
nt|gowdy: more shape hands the pute has gone crazy !|pg||
nt|po-s: how can you tell - there are no results from the other table|pg||
nt|yuval10: no need to hurry with the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: hi kibs , hi david :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: hi all, severe problems with internet at hotel|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: working hard to get all tables up and running|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry you had to deal with all that|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently the 2@H opening shows a weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: put it another way god didnt deal me 8 in the master suit to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - so far South´s risky bid has been a help for opps|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam in the offing? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid game?|pg||
nt|tomi2: north can open this hand 2@C if he feels he needs to do somethingk|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is 10-14 with 6+@C and no 4 card major in their system|pg||
nt|kemperg: seen that, but I believe more bidding space with inv+|pg||
nt|ahalim: 6NT by N safest and best contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@c is their balance opening|pg||
nt|ritong: double looks clearcut|pg||
nt|chmitty: à dexu jeux c'est un excellent chelem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1070|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl is penalty here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Undo?  (Ihope)|pg||
nt|paulg:  they bid the slam because Walker showed a huge club raise in the context of passing over 2@h|pg||
nt|puncher: But unfortunately looks like 4@H made on board 5 in the other room - it was a spade lead and then a club switch|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Short expected a bit more?|pg||
nt|bg: E should jump to 4 hearts right away not likely to miss anything since pard passed|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a big 7/5 @H/@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west cant believe it and is thinking|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not 1 trick in parner to make 4@H |pg||
nt|bg: what is 3 dia obviously E is trying to show something but what|pg||
nt|bg: best with E type of hand just to haul off and bid what you think you might make|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure dbl|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LetÂ´s see how West plays the @H-suit here, beginning with the !Q will cost a trick|pg||
nt|bobholl: i said 380 but 360 is coreect :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pitiful:  i would say it would be a good effort to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as Roland says:  "What do you call an 8 card suit?"   (Trumps!)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S transfer I assume |pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - West bid 2 @S...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not depends on agreements,  I play 2 nt as honor 3rd or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: *and now|pg||
nt|mamos: often shows a Club honour  depends  on agreements|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems bizarre to bid on flat 10s and not bid on all that stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: now what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems she will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h? 2@d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but if she dos will it showe some support for s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i vote for D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead 2 x @S|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@H shows @S one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must go folks dinner time here leaving you in very many capable hands thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: explained as Majors by east|pg||
nt|davidstern: I only have nightmares about my own bridge. A good friend told me once thta I should only worry about my bridge if I worry about partner's I dont have enough faith to play with ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: him/her|pg||
nt|sybarra: my dutch friends will explain slaap lekker|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not the right time for the Moysean @h slam.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no sry W can pitch @d :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if you play 9 you can get down even with @d A onside|pg||
nt|ritong: now it will be tougher|pg||
nt|ritong: si birman dit 3@c ou si ils ont un gadget, ça pourrait s envisager|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: le roi est placé mais le partage des atouts oblige à perdre une levée   cependant 6@c gagne sans douleur le problème st de les enchérir|pg||
nt|chmitty: et je pense que ça gagne assez facilement même sur entame @d|pg||
nt|bridgek: Brink is probably supermax in their style|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rich89: xx??|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well i must admit that this mixed hungarian partenrship is making goulash of the italian pair|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h is 2-3 @h's|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel bids 3NT on board 17 that went through because there was no @h lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C shows good @H raise|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pour gagner, je recommands l´impasse á @D - et pas á @S...|pg||
nt|ritong: je ne crois pas qu  un garçon prudent comme lui prenne le risque de déclarer un 3 SA ridicule avec 6@c sur table possible|pg||
nt|ritong: genre l ouvreur a xx(x)(x) a @d|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry missed the xx|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: lets try it one more time|pg||
nt|garnetts: why not |pg||
nt|puncher: but he can't have much more for passing over 2@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe XX is honor x,  (kx, qx or some such?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Don't make me laugh out loud, the players won't appreciate that :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs set as trumps already |pg||
nt|sybarra: cue bids coming up |pg||
nt|mamos: East wont like his soft cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 3 @H p 3 @S |pg||
nt|hawe45: But he will like @D K-Q|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: so south does not have to check for a heart fit but ccan either invite to game or simply bod 3nt and try to make|pg||
nt|kemperg: using 2@C with 3card, 2N gives 4crd|pg||
nt|sommer: Bergen makes that not necessary, you see|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my money on 6c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we think 2NT is constructive?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@c would have been 'pass or correct'?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here 4 @h is gone make for e/v becuse the lucky KQ@s onside. But will not be easy to come to 4 @h I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: so they looks very much on their way to a 3rd final in 4 years|pg||
nt|bobholl: weer zo'n "lange "kleur :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: weer  een preempt met HVBxxx(x) kijken hoe dat nu werkt|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can always point to pc and say "silly commentators"  telling jokes|pg||
nt|lestergold: the e/w pair would if they knew why u were laughing|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this redouble meant to mean?|pg||
nt|ahalim: they may get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is not alerting, south is alerting bother 2@D and 2@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Always lead TRUMP|pg||
nt|davidstern: Newswires announcing death of Elizabeth Taylor|pg||
nt|mamos: 2NT invite now?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohhh never mind, Probebly it will always make one way or another|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: le partenaire pourrai à la limite avoir 3 @d médiocre et roi valet de @c cinquièmes|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a new idea, 2@d being a transfer to 2@h|pg||
nt|bridgek: I think EW are happy with 360, I would be|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: I hope i'm right, i was with Jan in hte car this morning and heard it being discussed|pg||
nt|007 joosth: mooie 4H dankzij de dubbele fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm if i have to pass with the south hand i need to change the system - you get pushed around too much otherwise|pg||
pc|s3|nt|newmoon: yay   well passed|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm surprised Matheson did not bid 3@s (or even 4@s)|pg||
nt|mamos: ah perhaps 2@D was transfer?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is one transferring and the other not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I believe N was bidding naturally|pg||
nt|mamos: in thart case  North will jump to 4@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: c u|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: maximum hand in N what to bid?|pg||
nt|bg: 4 hearts makes as long as E is patient uhtil he gets to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4NT sounds like a good option?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true x@S+x@S entry in dummy or @H finesse by opps played :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H=|pg||
nt|mamos: Spade lead will curtail his efforts to mae many more than seven tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: this was one good example of why transfer bids work; if n was on lead, a d would be much easier for the def|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pitiful:  for my money north might have bid 3@s then bid 4@h next but maybe they would not be on firm ground|pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@h is much better by south|pg||
nt|idc: last time we saw a hand, Scotland gained 14 for bidding a different slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  5th club, @d10, @sQ?|pg||
nt|puncher: board 5 played the other way up which made things easier for declarer|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bidding seems sensible despite both being maximum|pg||
nt|mamos: East is "fearless"|pg||
nt|kemperg: I know, but we use 3@C/@D different|pg||
nt|yuval10: many possibilities now for E - Pass, 3NT, 4@h|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, but spending this much time in this posision only shows they are really good, They done want to leave anything to the chanses or luck|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if he founds pass I will be extreamly impressed|pg||
nt|mikael_w: even if its wrong on this board when @sKQ is onside|pg||
nt|ritong: a happy make at first sight|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C well placed|pg||
nt|xenya: and at second sight too, Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: @s jack is singleton for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant do much wrong|pg||
nt|ritong: eas has no reason to try a fancy lead with @s Jx when he has not the @d Ace in their raised suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: 160 would have been even nicer :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Let's hope West remembers|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: hate 3@D and the second double |pg||
nt|xenya: 4N --quantitative -- looks reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right sided.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the redouble is honor and one  |pg||
nt|lestergold: means i like the sound of my own voice|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the @S suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told I am correct as to the redble |pg||
nt|sybarra: by someone who should know, like the coach  |pg||
nt|lestergold: is it not somewhat ambiguous in such an auction might allow pard to think that yhou actually had ur overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: North must have seen her partner's bidding before|pg||
nt|mamos: or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is now waving her hand over 2@D and 2@H a bit and smiling |pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is clearly con fusion here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, this may explain the 3@h bid.  Perhaps the 4 level shows a big hand as they play.|pg||
nt|the saint: The strong option in the multi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks mike.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Tim there you are |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4Nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we might make too many |pg||
nt|mamos: i think we always were making too many  for 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w is even more fearless|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@S?|pg||
nt|sommer: if you play sayc, you can use jump in opposite MA to show 10-12 with 3cards..with 2/1, 1NT followed by 3@S..or?|pg||
nt|kemperg: good suit, inv. not forcing|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|puncher: Possibly so if they don't play bad 2N|pg||
nt|sybarra: good sac????? |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was right south did think pard had his overcall|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeah|pg||
nt|lestergold: good sac against the 4@h they were never bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: acyually 4@h is off in any case|pg||
nt|bg: by fooling around with the 3 dia bid E has given N an option to bail out in 4nt which will only be beaten by a non heart lead|pg||
nt|daman: It will be hard to beat this contract|pg||
nt|peachy: I should say so too :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: don't forget the bidding space won|pg||
nt|daman: 8 toppers with a myraid of ways for 9|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N +3 on 4|pg||
nt|mamos: interesting that on this board the Swedish bid 1NT at both tables|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Here the swedes takes control over the bidding and play 1 NT on both tables|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR plays very agressive opening|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H here's probably against the odds view pd's pass open. |pg||
nt|ritong: et avec tout le jeu qu il a, ça n est pas excessivement dangereux de développer, donnant des infos gratuites aux adversaires|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 sa sans soute et la tâche d'Ouest est difficile|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: doute|pg||
nt|bridgek: tough lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: East explains wests bidding as probably 4144...|pg||
nt|bobholl: jan jansma has close to maximum playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  but pass keeps S true to his form so far in this match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: on Bd 21 - not a great slam at all but as the cards lay it was more successful|pg||
nt|puncher: my dodgy connection is proving a little tiresome|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we wrong sided clubs :(|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C cue comfirming @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: alright now 3h|pg||
nt|xenya: well things do happen (board 5)|pg||
nt|bobholl: old fashioned 4th best ?|pg||
nt|bridgek: best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 4th best indeed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|puncher: With a bad 2N available they could have shown a 5/5 shape in the minors - 2N would be artificial showing 5/5 in minors or 6 diams - both minimum openers|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Walker now|pg||
nt|puncher: Open room in 4@S on the previous 6@C board so a gain for Scotland - looks like this is not to be a flat match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short encouraged in clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: yes this is not easy|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt?  do "we" play  that?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why did s not crack 3D|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
nt|sharkey: But Vul bonus looms...|pg||
nt|sybarra: even 3 nt is pushy |pg||
nt|sybarra: and you are right Carl |pg||
nt|sharkey: At MPs I think a Pass stands out|pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is a different game |pg||
nt|ritong: with @s Jx, he would simply lead a @d no matter what he holds|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: it takes a spade lead to beat the slam |pg||
nt|garnetts: well it could be worth someone might have doubled this--strong case for east to |pg||
nt|garnetts: worse not worth :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: to beat 4@h spade spade cah K@d and play third spade|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think, that 3 NT from East was a bad bid - why not just 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D by E?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - or 4 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like 3 nt either |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: ii think anyh partner would have done same|pg||
nt|mamos: too be fair the pre-empt warns of the bad breaks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@H lead ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@D|pg||
nt|pelu: in bord 7 France in 3@C X - has to guess @HQ to make - W didnt - and down 1|pg||
nt|mamos: so some work for declarer|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, If I rememebr right they play 9-12 NT or something ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think NON-vuln E would have pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - according stats games with 37% chance shud be bid Vul due to game bonus 500|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and it might be that close that vuln shod decide this ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: amazing comeback in the other SF - France overtake NET, leading 40:38 now|pg||
nt|yuval10: all Israeli kibitz who starts asking regarding the final - it's in about 50 minutes, according to schedule, i believe|pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see 10 tricks for the taking...:) - not easy at the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely worried about the @D coming back if he ducks|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer is rightfully affraid of a @d switch if Q@c is with N|pg||
nt|yuval10: and remember this 1@c can be 2 as well|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS have 15 HCP between them so odds @CQ with N|pg||
nt|davidb: depends what 9 lead can be|pg||
nt|sharkey: May try cash 5@H after winning with in dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: bon ba tant pis|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: oui un peu inhumain|pg||
nt|ritong: c eut été gracieux|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gowdy: well a heart they could life with  but ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is leading!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sry other side leads ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is shaking his head, east says wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: its sort of in the rules :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3 SpaDES 3 diamonds 2 Clubs and an extra red trick|pg||
nt|sommer: ..SW on the same side of the screen...S didnt think about a panther double:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South needs to cash @h now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If declarer will take it for 4th best he´ll play @h7/@h8|pg||
nt|bridgek: this is going to take a while, many options|pg||
nt|bobholl: jan studing his (not so best) prospects|pg||
nt|bridgek: he has 3di-3sp 2ha-1C, but he must play north vor T98 of di and leave ha ace stranded for now|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he so oftens takes the rigth decisions :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: often|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup the pship philosophy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|mamos: well Herats looks lik eten tricks now  but wasnt cold so perhaps this will turn out ok|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good bid 0 are they playing minor key-card|pg||
nt|hawe45: 13 levées a SA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT???? |pg||
nt|mamos: I think 3Nt was  just a bit timid |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh whew|pg||
nt|sybarra: Erwin, you trying to give us heart attacks?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@c = puppet Stay|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sabage layout...|pg||
nt|pelu: if u only sse EW-cards looks easy, but @Ss 4-1 great problem|pg||
nt|mamos: very easy to go off|pg||
nt|sybarra: guts!|pg||
nt|bobholl: his intermediates are bad to say the least|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: ho9wever im nor convinced they would have found best defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: should this be whacked?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@s = 4@h|pg||
nt|ahalim: NS had a chance to go plus, but not anymore|pg||
nt|santyclz: Judging from the length of the huddle, I would assume not.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 4@d is -4 too:)|pg||
nt|sommer: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: strange 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky again for DK, that USA went the same 3 down in 3NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, see board 8 & 12|pg||
nt|sharkey: He's too good :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: een kangaroo kan dit maken:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  Sime can lead the @sK, hoping for 3-3 spades, and forcing West to duck|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ire 161, Eng 161, Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 103|pg||
nt|paulg:  but he is banking everything on hearts, which will be less successful|pg||
nt|mamos: and sometimes eight :)|pg||
nt|po-s: best tu duck by South|pg||
pc|h6|nt|puncher: yes with the club entries might have been better to go for spades|pg||
nt|mamos: it certainly wasnt intended as a Spade cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: we landed....how ever we got there   (dont ask) |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I got all the alerts from W|pg||
nt|mamos: ok   we arrived|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: doubles are always t/o John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: evcen when p doubles 1nt?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E will be crushed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jameslee 2: ohh no did not see 5@C |pg||
nt|bg: France now has 9 imp lead as a result of the mix up on the double on board 3|pg||
nt|kemperg: if that is cue S has a problem, @H Q not sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5d now|pg||
nt|pelu: and also close to make in OR: @cK, @S to A and now @HQ ducked and @H again - but decl did'nt take the finess|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Not many cards are at the right place in the def for dec on this board|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needs to be patient here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess its itching in w:s fingers now wanting to turn @h. Lets see if he can hold himself ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: the question is if he can be sure of how many @h's his partner has|pg||
nt|pelu: @S again will work fint for defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he know it's 2, then playing @h might be the best thing as he only needs 9X  from partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Fisher up to now has taken all the playing time|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so far the def has been perfect I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c duck by East was very elegant|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: But he had all the problems|pg||
nt|bobholl: mijn moeder (96) ook :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|007 joosth: speelt zeker tegen jou|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|garnetts: nothing else to do |pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Chiu very surprised seeing @dK|pg||
nt|po-s: or North might be endplayed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  i think he failed to appreciate the defensive problems that he *might* cause by leading the @sK|pg||
nt|peachy: W does best to return pds suit|pg||
nt|ahalim: I hope thay kanow what they are doing|pg||
nt|kemperg: on the internet site from BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: and defensis time :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes - is endplayed now|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a of @C saves the day|pg||
nt|po-s: not really an endplay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one trick too early!|pg||
nt|bridgek: North cannot be endplayed for nine tricks, either he has an exit or west has no entry's left|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What about @cA , @d to @dA and a @s to @sK, @dQ and a @c exit?|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: do much for your goulash Mike....|pg||
nt|ahalim: *know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they do indeed|pg||
nt|ahalim: well bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: now he'll roll to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: looks like declarer will lose 6 tricks for 1 down -- still NS have an easy no-trump partial|pg||
nt|mamos: doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: im trying to think whether sungkle dummy it is technically correct to play a small spade from hand to the 6 as u c a afford 2 spade losers so long as u maintain control of the hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d weill hardly be led|pg||
nt|kemperg: than 1 up|pg||
nt|yuval10: now E will duck the @d|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oppps, the was misstake nr 1 I think|pg||
nt|mikael_w: really nice def if e took this and returned @h3|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welllllllllll|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a make now|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt pard open 1 @D???|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: well i see that @h got away in open room i csn imagine how cash rtwo spade and a @d tov ace end of defence|pg||
nt|pelu: still ok for defense|pg||
nt|chmitty: décidémment les 4441 sont un cauchemar|pg||
pc|h7|nt|idc: Am told that North led a @d in other room, making declarer's task easier - this may go down here|pg||
nt|idc: That slam on Bd 21 - 6@c is better than I first thought, a very good contract in fact|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N discard @cK, play a @c from Dummy after @dA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: I bet he knew they were 3-3 --no double lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i prefer hearts to herats|pg||
nt|santyclz: Meanwhile the open room has caught up to us.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and then @d to A and @h2. But remember its alot easyer for us looking at all cards :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Easy game...:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C misunderstood?|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|bridgek: SP Q exit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yuval10: good play rewards good bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: If he'd delayed the @C N may have been squeezed in @D & @S...|pg||
nt|sharkey: For 11 tricks..|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: Houston we have landed is what the astronauts say |pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt work...|pg||
nt|andyv:  W trying to shorten himself|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: well they seemed to know what they were doing,  just scared the rest of us|pg||
nt|hawe45: East will regret, that he skipped a @C|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact 4 rounds of spades does it too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and see you nest match!|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many swings here despite the swingy nature of the boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: almost falls out of his chair now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  but he is still going to make this I think, West will have to concede a heart or spade|pg||
nt|puncher: Carroll opened 3@H after all so board 22 looks to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  with spades 3-3 I think you need to get a heart ruff to beat 4@s on this hand|pg||
nt|ritong: gling|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|nt|garnetts: spade discard ---hmmmmm  |pg||
nt|santyclz: Better to cash the @cak before crossing to hand?|pg||
nt|kemperg: :) http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|garnetts: probably expecting better diamonds from partner |pg||
nt|kemperg: then 4@H strange|pg||
nt|sommer: very...hiding those @D's looks very strange|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: Looks like SOuth switched to @dT at trick two - may have been right to do so but not this time|pg||
nt|arno11: shld now make shld hacve ruffed diamond then !T Q  pitching his heart loser and coming to 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45: he still makes it easily|pg||
nt|arno11: @c Q I meant|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  and S just helped|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: cereless play - why not start ducking a @S - the loose (on normal sits) 2 @S and a @C - even with @Ss 3-2 problem now - only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: even double dummy not simple|pg||
nt|lestergold: after all this is a hand where u have a few problems in the club suit so u need to prepare a cross ruff|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: this may be a swing for NI |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west discards @d on third spade 4th spade does the buysiness|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not now, well played to play the last @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: now K@s and @h, but can he see that?|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@s that is|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now @s and a small @h|pg||
nt|mamos: top Spade now and endplay |pg||
nt|mikael_w: @s Q that is offcurse|pg||
nt|pelu: can take @SQ and play @H to 9 = 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 1 is an excellent result for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: I might have considered 4@S with the S cards....|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: approx an ACE extra |pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes, and 590 away|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so much for the perfect double :)|pg||
nt|cicus: particularly playing a strong club system, which NS don't|pg||
nt|psridhar: :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: you win some lose some -but back your conviction all the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second double made it a certainty that Bertens will not misguess clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: @CA only chance as I see it|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: only consolation is -at end of the deal Zack will be certain he wont lose on the board....( now waht happened in T3 Roland? )|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@SX :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: on a slightly different auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: finally i get one right :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Townsend as South bid 2@H (spade raise) over the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H rather, corrected now|pg||

nt|xenya: so the gadget has worked nicely|pg||
nt|xenya: it seems EW were not quite sure about the combined strength of their hands|pg||

nt|Walddk7: and hello Ian|pg||
nt|idc: G'day Sam & Roland|pg||
nt|puncher: but that was quick!|pg||
nt|sybarra: but nicely done |pg||
nt|mamos: ok  well I say "Well done"  I hate you lot to watch some of my bidding :)  Good contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 and 10 still to come|pg||
nt|mamos: two more boards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 herats agsain|pg||
nt|tomi2: vuln 2nd seat this is very much "bottom of range"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nice spade situation makes game easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they reach game|pg||
nt|lestergold: would a world class wizard have made this contract that is the question|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR h opened 2@H, leader expects 41|pg||
nt|sommer: nice possible 3NT again NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, I dont use the movie|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mm could be trouble for someone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 15 the Israeli NS bid to 4@h and went one down|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Israel is getting closer every board now|pg||
nt|sybarra: David sending telepathy messages |pg||
nt|yuval10: N can leave KQ @s and AK@d |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think sweden had 19 IMP after 3 boards 19/1 then. So after that start Israel has been untucheble|pg||
nt|xenya: was skating on thin ice|pg||
nt|bobholl: this can only loose for the dutch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very well done indeed |pg||
nt|po-s: South should have ducked the diamond|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: interesting hand since 4@S seems better than 3NT--but no way to bid it I think|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|puncher: good effort|pg||
nt|xenya: i see, thanks|pg||
mb|d|nt|pitiful:  2@d multi|pg||
nt|ady: club guess |pg||
nt|dagold: or one of these constructive 2@h|pg||
nt|dagold: is fine|pg||
nt|dagold: as Espen has done|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib said:  "or one of these constructive 2@h"|pg||
nt|sybarra: we seem to be at the "speed table" |pg||
nt|ralfwil: two more boards!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Things are getting a little out of hand for Belgium.|pg||
nt|tomi2: they might be missing 5 tricks but how often are opps not able to catch them in time|pg||
nt|ahalim: slam time now|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 -- 6 ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but jan is VERY good player|pg||
mb|3S|nt|april7: EW might reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 1@s....|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike you get the last 2 hands,  I have to catch a train |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all,  and have fun |pg||
nt|kemperg: north|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another easy contract - getting there might not be as easy|pg||
nt|ritong: fisher might consider playing in NTs|pg||
nt|ritong: after all, Kx is not rocksolid|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes 6N looks safer|pg||
nt|ritong: first step is checking for keys i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this will be a scrap between north and east|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was first hand in the open room |pg||
nt|sybarra: all speculation was wildness|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland I think you were commenting there |pg||
nt|mamos: A poor result for US from OR   East put too much confidence in his cards and partner's overcall|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S?..|pg||
nt|sommer: no|pg||
nt|kemperg: too weak for me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play here for 6@h|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not with a trump lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  can throw a @d on the 3rd @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable 1@H ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: aha polish i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: with south playing a small part|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: looking for an adverse save |pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white saves not often best|pg||
nt|garnetts: loses a couple of imps|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if I like the 2NT bid or not |pg||
nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard for us to believe that Walker-Short could play too quickly for the operator :)|pg||
nt|rich89: x better than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had the italians been doing this to the hyngarians i could have said made spaghetti of them but today no pasta for lunch i'm afraid|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Vincent!!! great job|pg||
nt|sommer: 2 @Sducks and a flat board|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d = @h, 1NT = 18-19 bal. |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and NS will probably be at 4@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|dagold: with short majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must have been declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: depends what they had for lunch|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is limited to 16 points|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D a ht raise of some sort|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a good raise   |pg||
nt|mamos: better be a good raise|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although they rate to pick some up on 27.|pg||
nt|bg: E opened 2 spades in other room led to a lebensohl auction to stop in 3 dia|pg||
nt|peachy: makeable, anyway:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I was thinking of 4s|pg||
nt|mamos: It's easy to be wise :)  but for us oldies watching it does seem at time that mistakes are made by rushing play - technically most of these players are excellent  -- better than me ...|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure but need to be a little more patient with the cards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  on any lead?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1 @d ruff and 1@s ruff appear to be enough|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK with trump lead also|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed you do not want to be in it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Israel have played well - on the other hand Sweden had opportunities on several boards|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't show his max now :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: nice toy|pg||
nt|bridgek: I prefer opening the north hand to dbl|pg||
nt|bobholl: only if 10-12 or 11-13 nt |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the four nines make it almost irrestistible|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: South takes 1@S out of the bidding box but replaces it for 1@D after some time.. (it was not on the tray)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: anyway, one can sympathise with S's decision to bid 3N, considering the state of the match|pg||
nt|ritong: 6@d one key @d void|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe they prefer one ACE @d void|pg||
nt|andyv:  at these colors, W is in a tough bind|pg||
nt|roswolf: south maybe regrets his bid but may cheer up soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may pull to 5@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: tes should pass since he cant guarantee any contract of his will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I must say,  the lady (east) at the table is NOT bashful |pg||
nt|bg: W pass good decision  in other room W bid 2 clubs and that led E to double 4 spades whichmakes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4h|pg||
nt|kemperg: or 3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Let's hope that's not reverse Drury.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: de spelers zijn bang om al te ruim voor het eten klaar te zijn     eten liever mee|pg||
nt|bridgek: zzzzzzzzzzzzzz|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D goede redding|pg||
nt|007 joosth: voor 4H zal je de schoppens goed moeten doen  althans,  als de klavers niet zo goddelijk zaten|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Noord zit echt te denken, werd wel afgeleid, er moest iets voor een raampje worden gezet tegen de zon|pg||
nt|bridgek: klaveren uit is tricky|pg||
nt|007 joosth: klaver uit zorgt missch voor een restricted choice probleem|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
nt|kemperg: isthat forcing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dangerous approach|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bull at a gate stuff|pg||
nt|peachy: South's suit is good enough for trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: trump Q ask?|pg||
nt|ritong: surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: ?@SQ|pg||
nt|xenya: is he going to stop in 5?|pg||
nt|bridgek: But then I don't seem to be able to pass ANY 11 count|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup the least of evils|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
nt|idc: Result from other room just in - 3NT -1 by East|pg||
nt|paulg:  A much easier hand for Matheson to bid when his partner has already passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: can u arrange an intro in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not be a success I am afraid |pg||
nt|kemperg: some points for Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N led the @sA, no director called'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden v Norway next, in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|gowdy: hard to miss 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: also hard to make :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@h   may be some mini splinter or some Bergen like raise|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree don't like 2@c  at this vul|pg||
nt|bg: if pard made a two level overcall I would double 4 spades also|pg||
nt|mamos: "1-under mixed raise" Im authoritatively told|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree  -- it was East's confidence in his partner's overcall that was misplaced :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bejaypers|pg||
nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Sorry, backwards)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d FG XT-NT and now probably 3 @h's|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, this looks like a flat board, If they just bid 3 NT now its time to get some coffey for me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Boards 14 & 17 cud have been IMPs to Sweden|pg||
nt|davidb: N can make 3NT on H lead|pg||
nt|davidb: S  will bid sure|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: again straigth to the max but will brink pass ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: suspect north will get it right|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
nt|puncher: 2@S seems a little conservative but north is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it that way,  (not sure the world does)  but that means 2 @H is 13 cards and 3 hts |pg||
nt|sybarra: saved by N |pg||
nt|mamos: saved by North|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can hold 2 @S in 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3nt in this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: will most likely also be one off|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finn S bid 3NT, N removed|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wouldn't want to be there but you might conceivably get a @sq lead.|pg||
nt|the saint: With the @S 9 wrong that just delays the inevitable...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT has a chance, this has none|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1NT 15-17 here?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh oh|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happened the c suit - sorry forgot it doesnt exist any more|pg||
nt|yuval10: *2 @h showing 3@h's, that is|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think S shud have bid 2 NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: S knows his side has most of the points, so i don't think he can stay passive with 2@h. What should he bid is awkward|pg||
nt|ritong: very possible  if not he would bid direct 6|pg||
nt|bridgek: nee restricted choice is alleen bij zelf een kleur aanspelen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ach  als 1S 5kaart belooft kan je die niet fout doen|pg||
pc|hT|nt|puncher: what would you do if partner wasn't a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should just use copy/paste |pg||
nt|mamos: Hearts or herats  didnt make much of a showing there|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 3 x @S and a @D will endplay South|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was French E,  I guess SEF went out the window for the french jrs |pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think there weas much chance of missing game on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fighting for part scores is one of the most fataql bridge diseases|pg||
nt|sommer: me2..despite, he may be able to trans and show 5-4 min with singleton @S.. still stopping in 4mi!..?cant trans and invite below|pg||
nt|sommer: ..last part out|pg||
nt|santyclz: Let's hope it's not normal Drury.|pg||
nt|kemperg: whats reverse Drury?|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is not so easy against a @d lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Return to the base suit is the weak hand rather than 2@d being the weak hand.|pg||
nt|mamos: North does have a hand with little to reccommend it|pg||
nt|kemperg: thats normal for me|pg||
nt|davidb: not sure... partner showed 18-19 !|pg||
nt|chmitty: quand les adversaires interviennent sur 1SA par des conventions multi-significations, il est important d'avoir discuté de l'attitude de notre camp|pg||

nt|bridgek: nooit|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|puncher: 3N looking like a normal spot but the poor @D break kills it|pg||
nt|paulg:  @hA and club switch will keep it to nine tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically about 50% contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be careful now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: so cannot criticise|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will be a struggle|pg||
nt|bridgek: And I play 11-14 1NT also VUL-vs NOT|pg||
nt|bridgek: stomme start|pg||
nt|roswolf: if west had an ace plus long hearts he would probably have bid - declarer should take this inference|pg||
nt|roswolf: a classic - dog which didnt bark in the night|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...also, because of dbl, S has to play E for the A@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may easily try and cash out as well|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk7: Sam is a debutant commentator. I wonder if she knows that co-commentators expect to get a drink from newbies :)|pg||

nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Alok|pg||
nt|puncher: hi there|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm not a fan of MUD leads but they can be difficult for declarer to read too|pg||
nt|alok_daga: btw what was 3nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW playing Blue Club, so 2@s only promised five|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double or the t51d bid Shirley?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: havent seen any alert but im not sure|pg||
nt|mamos: 14-16 im told|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 14+5-card suiit = 15|pg||
nt|kemperg: you cant do without|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not so hot on a d lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as in no hope?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but s will hardly pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: Technically in Drury a 2@d bid shows a sub-minimum, reverse Drury is perhaps more common than "normal" these days.|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes but will W lead a @D from AJ10x ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|henryb:  I doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jack is technically correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought you meant what West would lead back after a diamond to the ace|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @C lead :) is good for NS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  i'd invite showing a heart stop and four spades if partner was in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Ire 161; Eng 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needs care|pg||
nt|lestergold: now defence have to cash their tricks in teh right order|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be clear which is not the same as easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks again to Johan Gronkvist in the kibitz for explaining NS' system|pg||
nt|mamos: yes cant see any excitement here|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can....if declarer doesn't play @c's right away to knock out E's entry, but i agree he's likely to do so|pg||
nt|yuval10: this lead won't faze declarer at all|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|kemperg: but still the @H problem, so 6N just as good|pg||
nt|ahalim: they have reached the best contract|pg||
nt|ritong: schwartz considered that KJ10 is worth Q|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: you very seldom get a good score if opps.play at 1 level|pg||
nt|dagold: some Kibs do not like the side 4cM|pg||
nt|sybarra: dear me,  e/w....where did our jrs go?|pg||
nt|mamos: East has a good hand West has some tricks   come on lads   bid B% &*( game|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 1/2 hour is not super fast for 10 boards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N should make but not laydown|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??? did not expect that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not often the israel team gets it wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: next round we have a big match: Dutch Juniors vs. Sweden, 3 and 4 in the standings|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know what 2@c wa?s|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|newmoon: my shpellingg iss garbage these dayss|pg||
nt|idc: Bad Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: man up as we say!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I cannot conceive of a passed hand where 3N is the right contract with the South hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: me neither|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i third that|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@S X was par|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the club slam attempted in the other room was less than thin|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Difficult for eitrher to come in|pg||
nt|paulg:  Only going to happen if East opens|pg||
nt|puncher: other way round surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am cheap, just diet coke|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yep, I'd be with the field on this one.  Going down as usual.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, they are so far behind that they cant lose a lot anymore but win some vp if those games are somehow working|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North showed his hand with Drury first|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT maybe but not 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh @H would have been much better|pg||
nt|po-s: let´see if Tom feels the need to discourage in spades...|pg||
nt|bridgek: It's a bit difficult to play partner for 2di and 4 CLUBS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dQ is for me an desparate lead. a passive lead on this biddiing - @cx|pg||
nt|bobholl: especially now that w hasn't promised more than 2 @C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahalim: that means a @D from W and a @H back|pg||
nt|arno11: action over for now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks promising  until trick 3 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: then the nature of his hand, balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: also, he has some extras|pg||
nt|bridgek: schoppen na en we kunnen naar bed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|newmoon: still, -2 not too bad|pg||
nt|dagold: here for example the handwill not play so well facing many hands with 4-card spade support|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me start some thank yous  in the mean time |pg||
nt|lestergold: westknows that only hope is to play partner for A@d and Q@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3nt would have some fun :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or actually this trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: with @D not breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 12|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5-0 distribution not nice feeeling when you push a close game |pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@C is good with this layout, but not reasonable|pg||
nt|007 joosth: je wilt dus toch weg?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: ik denk dat 1@S er 5 beloofd|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E is to blame here|pg||
nt|idc: same lead as other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also inferences that East did not have four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator  Erwin Huzen. Super job!   (as always) |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like you've forgotten my performance last year|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators Mike and Hans for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|kemperg: not in Kleinman points|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So we must assign the blame to South|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally, I would pass 3@h with North|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H would have been interesting:(|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed 3@H looks like a sign-off|pg||
nt|henryb:  so when they lose 13, 3 of the imps go to North, the other 10 are rub of the green|pg||
nt|santyclz: You're blaming the Irish?|pg||
nt|kemperg: spoken by a golfer|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is a bad contract that happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I blame society|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well said roland|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dagold: probably need 5 spades opposite|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me start some thank yous as we have one more hand in this set |pg||
nt|kemperg: same for  N|pg||
nt|yuval10: she again, sorry :)  |pg||
nt|ritong: courageux, le 10 de @d|pg||
nt|ritong: j aurais pris l autre 10 rouge|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: pas de 6 @c non plus en salle ouverte le sablier s'égrêne dangereusement|pg||
nt|ritong: le contrat est tres probablement sur table, donc l idée est de limiter les surlevées|pg||
nt|ritong: et le dix de @d risque fort de faire grand gin|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: oh he doesnt kn ow |pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing not even 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: low scoring match so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: only in 2 |pg||
nt|sharkey: I think 2 NT wud cover all - however N wud interpret|pg||
nt|kemperg: Huh|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: beloofde|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dj Gerbrand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|2hplus4: Needed to lead @CK to beat this.|pg||
nt|puncher: unlucky but a flat board|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought "rub of the green" was a billiards term|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cledver54|pg||
nt|peachy: singleton is unlikely, he would have led it on the go|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nog iemand die blijft opletten|pg||
pc|d8|nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still making s thiunk|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: yes although boards look swingy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would imagine more competition from juniors|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S was OK i think, but not 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: long gone Erwin|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||
nt|paulg:  South can suggest doubleton heart because his partner knows he cannot have doubleton|pg||
nt|puncher: does N have to avoid playing a club now to stop declarer shortening his trumps?|pg||
nt|paulg:  it cannot cost to lead diamond here|pg||
nt|arno11: flat board|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe the jack had been clearer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and another endplay on N...|pg||
nt|bobholl: still see only 8 tricks |pg||
pc|c5|nt|bridgek: Now north kan bring the ninth trick to dummy's Ha J|pg||
pc|c9|nt|the saint: I guess you would try to get a spade trick and then try for a partial elmination in clubs hoping for Kx and a failure to unblock - doesn't work here|pg||
nt|lestergold: now 8 easy tricks the 9th can come from the club suit with the layout as it is but not an obvious source |pg||
nt|sharkey: Difficult view N cud have 2@C only|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: hij claimt op de @S snit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  1@d was not alerted but showed 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should have seen the danger of a heart loser disappearing up the swanee|pg||
nt|po-s: bad techniqu in trumps - if all four in West|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he really do that?|pg||
nt|hawe45: 11 levées|pg||
nt|bridgek: kleine schoppen uit de dummy is safetuplay vs K|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  from the carding he knew Walker had @cQ7 or @cQ75|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think someone put too much paprika in Miss Wagner's goulash|pg||
nt|pelu: decl cant be sure - only 8 tricks - need to remove the right A from Easts hand - here ut will work fine|pg||
nt|po-s: another heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  the match is not going well for Netherlands so far.|pg||
nt|roswolf: no indeed but they are well able to recover|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: My guess is that it's from cricket, like many other terms|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone tell me why a 5-4 club fit is ignored in this room|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|nt|xenya: not on this layout though|pg||

pc|c6|nt|ady: guessed    potential swing|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson finding a nice safe line for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|puncher: do you have the system to invite, show a heart stop and 4 spades? I can show a heart stop and 4 spades but only game forcing not inviting|pg||
nt|sybarra: she had the warnings with X etc |pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Erwin Mike, Shirley,and specs|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators Mike, Germ  and Riccardo for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|tomi2: he played for a @C ruff but he should know that his partner likes to lead from three small...|pg||
nt|mamos: well done for bidding this -- (I think)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: maybe ducking Trick 1 better |pg||
nt|lestergold: when u play for these kind of against the odd ruffs they never happen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can aslo come from an endplay ity will come in the wash one way or abother|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing @S was better|pg||
nt|sommer: W has clearly shown, where @DA is:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
nt|idc: I like that @sQ play - on the bidding declarer cannot have 3 spades, since they never supported the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Unconfirmed, but current live ranking: Eng 163; Ireland 160; Wales 160; Scotland 154; WBU 149; NI 112|pg||

nt|kemperg: no definitly golf|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: true or an inspired club lead and a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Although the pitch is rarely green nowadays|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly not in india anyway|pg||
nt|santyclz: Apparently it is both billiards and golf:  http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/rub-of-the-green.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: and the billiard blue|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|idc: not that it will make much of a difference either way on this hand|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|newmoon: thx :)|pg||
nt|xenya: N didn't throw a spade of course|pg||
nt|puncher: I guess you are better at predicting than me :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  possibly not, i don't think there are any invitational bids in any part of my system|pg||
nt|sybarra: with that a Our special thanks to Roland who "herds the cats" called  commentators.... |pg||
nt|m_niemi: East has 1NT opening|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10-12 bal or not|pg||
nt|sommer: "who offers against whom?" ..now|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like Sweden had a big win here|pg||
nt|kemperg: NS wer in 2@H on this board, 4 off|pg||
nt|yuval10: might ensure them a final-four berth|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a Roland slam here in 6@c, but not likely to bid. |pg||
nt|bridgek: 3sa in de west hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pitiful:  4@h again |pg||
nt|puncher: as a rookie commentator I need to learn to reign in my predictions|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont but ive never heard of second highest from an honour|pg||
nt|tomi2: they lead the 8 but Weyand leads another suit with that holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so they shouold change their methods|pg||
nt|mamos: despite the Israeli gain on the last board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: mut impossible to make after  a passive @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but....|pg||
mb|1S!|an|no 4+!S|nt|ady: multi from east|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to get to 4@H   |pg||
nt|xenya: what is N to do now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undaunted...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes :)|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2@S if weak ( and what else could it be?) looks almost perfect|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember we are the "speed" table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They actually do lead the 8 from that holding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus  for results and standings|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I dont like that convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator Tim Verbeek. Super job!  |pg||
nt|kemperg: but in both rooms|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks Vincent, Raija, John, George|pg||
nt|kemperg: and kibs|pg||
nt|sommer: NS will for sure go to 4@S..soon, but then?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fitbid|pg||
nt|sommer: yep|pg||
nt|sommer: inv+:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good win for USA |pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting hands but israel slightly off day|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This could well be Israel's first loss in the tournament|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4@h by N?|pg||
nt|ritong: now how do they show @s fit balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming north bids game|pg||
nt|ritong: but with 19 i guess he will|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pour battre 5 @C - il faut le faire en express|pg||
nt|007 joosth: knap om die safetyplay te vinden in deze toch wel slaperige ambiance|pg||
nt|bridgek: maar probeer maar eens geen ru te starten met zuid|pg||
nt|roswolf: it may be systemic but 1@D really!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|puncher: most invitational bids are just transfers anyway at teams :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empts own @s-suit this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks magiv only needs the ace of @D on side|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Hans tu n'entames pas un petit @h contre 5@c ?|pg||
mb|2S!|an|4!D|nt|newmoon: South never passes, playing Junior bridge|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps a major suit struggle this time?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think EW will bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then if he ism playing pard for that why lead a trump as theen pard cant have the A@d and the @ds can providfe discards for heart losers|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be the same problem if they lead 3rd and he plays the 7...|pg||
nt|po-s: cute hand - both sides make 3NT if on lead|pg||
nt|mamos: now less likely to play hopeless NT contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: thx :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators James and Bruce for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|bg: schools could pick up here in 4 harts with correct guess in dai /clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: And thanks to organizers of this annual Junior Tournament, excellent chance for young players to gain some experience and meet other young players from around the world|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to stop in 3@H:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  One of my mentors suggests that South should take 15 of the 14 imps blame for bidding 2@d instead of 2@h. I think that is severe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, they have lost 13-17 also|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: israel already lost to their schools team in the first match|pg||
nt|mamos: I think they are likely to get 24 back on this board Roland :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: a real psych|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't even need that when @s's are 3-3 and @c 2-2....|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes so I see |pg||
nt|hawe45: Sud joue|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumably showing canape|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  Sime decides the anaemic distribution is not worth searching for a thin game|pg||
nt|paulg:  rightly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: when i see that @d holding in dummy i think we need to get busy Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: not play a passive trump back|pg||
nt|santyclz: S passed a 10-12 nt.  As I said, most of the reticence...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done by open to miss slam but it is uinlucky lets see what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: last board here - OR still habe 2½board to play - so Fishers lang time didnt mater|pg||
nt|yuval10: South has a big hand now, AK@c singel @s and he knows P is probably void @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess this shows @D|pg||
nt|bridgek: Not a good hand for these methods|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and NS will not be interested in playing @d...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If West bids 2@d, East will bid 2@h |pg||
nt|roswolf: has east shown @S/|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: pass is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt looks like minors, others might use it as a xfer to 3@c (lebensohl-ish).|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The response makes the xfer more likely.|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully E didn't intend it as the minors|pg||
nt|paulg:  the England team won the Premier League on a split tie after an appeal, you could see them repeating that today!|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: blue coming up..|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: or not|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass instead of 1N?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: encore plus facile (!!)  roi de @h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  II would call WestÂ´s 1 @S a minimum, vulnerable|pg||
nt|bobholl: can drijver guess his P has this maegre card ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  doesn't look like it so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|idc: WIth South holding a 15 count, passed out in other room looks a bit unlikely|pg||
nt|idc: we will check|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C  looks a bit ambitious and has no hope with the bad break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone think E should pass instead of 1D|pg||
nt|arno11: wow|pg||
nt|kemperg: some imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board nice chatting with you John, thanks Natalia and succes playing|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maintenant la manche|pg||
nt|ritong: sud connait donc un arret @s tres ténu|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: hi Mike|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is an IMP event|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's 4@D is "pick-a-major" - he can't underwrite game, but any kind of fit will produce a reasonable play|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're probably joining somewhere in the middle of this tournement|pg||
nt|xenya: he did not|pg||
nt|puncher: sticky cards perhaps|pg||
nt|puncher: not the most exciting of boards at this stage of the weekend... |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to all of  the sponsors:   All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty Tim last board ty specs , Shirley,Bruce |pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either 12-14 bal, natural but not 10-15 onesuited (as the 2@C opener) or any 18+ hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knew it|pg||
nt|sommer: ...woooo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are in deep  .... trouble now|pg||
nt|mamos: although West is having a go|pg||
nt|yuval10: i might bid 5@h  with his hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is being bid beautifully |pg||
nt|yuval10: 4NT is a good hand and 5@c is of course pass/correct|pg||
nt|ritong: that way|pg||
nt|ritong: fine|pg||
nt|ritong: allows to stay in it|pg||
nt|ritong: après 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: et beaucoup de jeu chez son partenaire|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @s en Sud|pg||
nt|hawe45: Une seule raison pour l´entame du R de @H = les @D placées|pg||
nt|bridgek: pff, luckily no dbl|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  Major suits are for children, Jim|pg||
nt|mamos: looking at that dummy and @dJ87   not so easy to play back @d  |pg||
nt|lestergold: well im toldf that 8 9s the standard lead in poland from K87 |pg||
nt|gowdy: and I thought they may find slam !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: have been a plenty of voids today|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@H and then 3@H forces to game|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, th to Wessel, Mike 2x, Peter, see you next round|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = 11-15 with 6@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: yuk this is a bad hand for e/w's system - if he had opened 1@S south might nor have entered the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: not|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: still a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how juniors can create swings on almost every deal when we arf used to three hands in four being as flat as pancakes normally|pg||
nt|mamos: North likes bidding Clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks a little ambitious|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is a do or die attempt|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: When tabling the dummy, Laura says: 'I think 10 or 7 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  that was the first 5. the other 10 for passing 3N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that was a near one roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure why Padon decided against defending at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He also knows about the psyche|pg||
nt|kemperg: has N a choice?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How few tricks does he get in 2@C on a trump lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe 4|pg||
nt|henryb:  certainly has four, possibly five|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is worse|pg||
nt|mamos: North is cofused I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: confused|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hw|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C OK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: heavens EW not even bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this is not the cind of boards you like to see when you are trailing in the match. offcurse Israel done know they are trailing now |pg||
nt|sharkey: Righthanded the contract to boot|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt minors |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: et puis de mauvais @s !!|pg||
nt|ritong: c est une excellente raison, a mon humble avis|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ce que fait Sud ici, j´appelle un bureau d´information. 5 @C - et fini|pg||
nt|ritong: il sait qu il y a zéro levées de @s pour son camp|pg||
nt|rhelle: X = the relay|pg||
pc|s3|nt|puncher: a lot more flat boards in this half of the last match - I guess Wales must be quite relieved by the lack of potential swingy hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks germ me too|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks kibs, nice comments from polish peaple|pg||
nt|kemperg: W expects more from the fit|pg||
nt|sommer: ..like men!!..now beat it!!!|pg||
nt|mamos: 12 board set?|pg||
nt|yuval10: we still have 11 and 12|pg||
nt|ritong: there are several ways to proceed in these situations|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N is not mine|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 2@S denied AK or Q of @S|pg||
nt|po-s: playing "those methods" allows you to pass of course|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  Carroll/Hanlon play 14-16 1NT, so they will be in 1NT too|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen miracles before in this match |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  you are special We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.  |pg||
nt|kemperg: N worried about the sigleton in S:)|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry wrong way - WE are to play 2 boards more|pg||
nt|sybarra: good going guys!|pg||
nt|yuval10: good hand, not specifically minors, could've very well be a slam invitation in @s|pg||
nt|xenya: neatly done -- just a bit too high perhaps|pg||
nt|ritong: i have affection for 3NT balanced fit because it allows to play that contract quietly with no complications|pg||
nt|bridgek: nog steeds mar 8 slagen na ru start|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Simon keek niet heel blij naar 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|newmoon: even 4@S was ok here, as it happens|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@H I meant|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 1@d   |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then very difficult to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: thanks everyone  and Erwin   great work!  see you Tomorrow|pg||
nt|tomi2: letting south pick the best game, 3nt or 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe a German imp now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: people|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes indeed very helpful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kept the pot boiling nicely|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead but the ;ads will get a second cracj of the whip and hard to see them getting itg wrong4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|newmoon: playing check-back, 3@D would deny 4@H AND 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks if "we" can find them |pg||
nt|mamos: agressive double again|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N with long clubs|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is trick 8, where is the 9th ?|pg||
nt|ritong: voyons ça|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: je  comprends mal 4 @d|pg||
nt|bridgek: Because he knows parter has 4C and not 7 di? of course|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: and us on the straight and narrow|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to finesse S for @HQ now...........isnt it?|pg||
nt|sommer: imo, E is too weak for 4@D, but depends on agreements|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me 2N forcing, and S will pass|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spel zit wel erg slecht sch snit fout  harten aas fout en klavers scheef|pg||
nt|bobholl: de professor denkt na en gaat het wel maken gok ik :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: noord is aan slag bob|pg||
nt|rhelle: wedden om een ijsje ... hijgaat down|pg||
nt|bobholl: twee bier in vorden rob :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: harten switch is goud   maar onvindbaar|pg||
nt|rhelle: deal :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sch switch is ook vrijwel down|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mamos: oh no I see 450 in the other room|pg||
nt|kemperg: The Israelian pairs are high up in the butler|pg||
nt|henryb:  already had problem with void.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this is a nice 12-7 HP slam|pg||
nt|yuval10: still only 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|sybarra: "guys" was euphimism.... maybe should say "kids"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: N is a young lady |pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not even sure what they were playing if 2@s wasn't canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 2@S: 5+@S 4+D, canape indeed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  test hearts, claim|pg||
nt|puncher: It's certainly going to be close - quite exciting and some swingy boards to keep us all awake in the last match of the weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as the top three are playing the bottom three ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club lead and d switch - AARRGGH|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why did e not double - what did he know we dont|pg||
nt|ritong: chicken:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: il voulait faire une enchère forte et laisser la place pour un cue-bid à 4@h en Sud ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ouest n´a pas vu les encheres|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: exploit   trop délicat   pour Ouest   qui dans l'état du match ne cherche pas à faire des folies|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  BBO|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Well 4@H had good chances and 3@S makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: friendly lay out   (no IF) |pg||
nt|ritong: trying a zia|pg||
nt|ritong: exactement|pg||
nt|bridgek: Ik wil wel kunnen incasseren|pg||
nt|bobholl: de @D kan hij niet fout doen :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: da's waar, maar de @c wel|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hoop[t N echt op 5 ruitens in Z?   dat zou wel erg raar zijn.   maar waarom dan deze passive nakomst|pg||
nt|bridgek: niet vandaag en ik kom niet in engeland, te eng voor mij|pg||
pc|h5|nt|newmoon: then show 3@S before 4@H, in their way|pg||
nt|sybarra: q and I think she was home |pg||
nt|sybarra: no?|pg||
nt|kemperg: !Q better, but home?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D pitches |pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt say no hope mike|pg||
nt|mamos: but Im not convinced by 3@C after opening bid and response|pg||
nt|kemperg: 41@D beats it I think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Is this @c system build on getting the contract on the right hand:)?|pg||
nt|bridgek: but it works well enough|pg||
nt|po-s: allowing East to pass, not West|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Kon zuid @DJ niet nog hebben? kon Noord zien dat de @D zo zitten?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: got  10 now    probably thats all|pg||
nt|xenya: particularly if they freely preempt with hands like S's|pg||
nt|mamos: well its a two-way shot in Diamonds I guess you have to work out which opponent has King|pg||
nt|mamos: and I agree double might put him off|pg||
nt|tomi2: 25-2 VP for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|yuval10: first swing for Sweden this set, but looks like it's a little too late|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  when none of the bottom three want to get beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if i got the typing wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: spades 3/3 helps a big bunch|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed maybe overtrick|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are obviously playing a system where 3@D is not forcing to game.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nayther|pg||
nt|peachy: webpage http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/|pg||
nt|kemperg: Israel well on top of the bill|pg||
nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT was easier to play here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Erwin and all commentators|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i find it hard to believe that fantunes would have let thru that contract for example|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, thanks to our operator Vincent, Mike and John, see you again in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: righto tx|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks Vincent|pg||
nt|bridgek: but if you play natural, you might be allowed to defend 2di.  after rdbl or 1nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Roel|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: even vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: perhaps there's some excitment still to come... |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but can you fix the oesers?|pg||
nt|mamos: nope   I t will be flat of course :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: while you cant judge the merits of a system on just 1 hand - this looks such an everyday situation that perhaps it suggests there is a serious flaw|pg||
nt|andyv:  they've done well with the system|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: just kicked me out.   Was it something I said?|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 76@C might have helped|pg||
nt|mamos: or nine :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the frence West made 4@s on the hand with @Ss 4-1 - but here N had shown a red hand - but still long way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: now couldnt see the need to cash quickly perhaps wasnot that easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: bye all|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering what !6 7 meant    maybe Smith?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the heart lead was a poor shot on the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: count?|pg||
nt|lestergold: almost guaranteed to give bioth a tricka nd a tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: can't ask them anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: everyone is gone|pg||
nt|mamos: ty  all|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: i'm closing down now, tot straks|pg||
nt|lestergold: so gilrs sved another disaster here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ik hoop dat NZ afspraken hebben waaruit dat blijklt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: cash some winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hop is saying "what is going on??"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx all cheers - or go neirigh on bothar leat|pg||
nt|mamos: this really is a quick board :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But nut for sure a winner|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: he wanted to bid game quickly and avoid intervention, he figured out slam against a passed hand Partner will be tough |pg||
nt|bobholl: rob ik denk toch dat je 2 bier hebt verdient maar we zullen zien|pg||
nt|bridgek: hij kon negen slagen zien zonder ru na|pg||
nt|007 joosth: niet als hij sch nakomt|pg||
nt|rhelle: zelfs met @s na - NZ maken 1@c, 2@d, 1@h en 1@s slag|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kemperg: losers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back in 15 minutes with Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer must guess @ds to make this|pg||
nt|bg: not any more|pg||
nt|mamos: no problem for this declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: folks sorry have to leave,  I am crunched re the work requirements (shame when it interfers with bridge) |pg||
nt|roswolf: well they are fine players so they are likely to do well whatever the system|pg||
nt|andyv:  very true|pg||
nt|andyv:  I've had the pleasure of playing against them a couple of times when they've played for the Schwartz team|pg||
pc|sK|nt|newmoon: will be a quick claim after 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos: and now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: needed a balcony finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: Impressive players|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when you have 12-14, you do not know which is the right hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dat zei ik|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract has become difficult now|pg||
nt|roswolf: too difficult i think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: his name is Gerband right?|pg||
nt|mamos: defence have found his winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: its Gerbrand |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, Gerbrand it is :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry misspelled it at first|pg||
nt|mamos: great stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: really enjoyed|pg||
nt|mamos: out to teacxh beginners tonight|pg||
nt|mamos: I know I know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh that it. thanks all|pg||
nt|mamos: back tomorrow|pg||
nt|mamos: looking forward  thanks everyone especially op|pg||
nt|kemperg: TY all |pg||
nt|kemperg: w Forgot the @C A|pg||
nt|po-s: trumps 31 saves declarer|pg||
nt|kemperg: cost the down|pg||
nt|andreasw:  So it is not:)?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think the idea is to find 4-4 and 5-3 fits easily|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: now 11  refused club finesse|pg||
nt|bridgek: 3xSch 5x kl+ 1ha|pg||
nt|roswolf: no maybe not|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|sommer: duck:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..does it matter?|pg||
nt|po-s: the problem for East is what to do if opps bid spades|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: thx all and bye for now hope to c some of u later|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all and see you next match|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd still be scratching my head   and thinking how much I hated two-way guesses|pg||
nt|mamos: well done so I think a deserved pick up for Israel on that board the souble didnt make much difference it was bidding  and making game that gained the imps|pg||
nt|mamos: thaNK YOU ALL|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to our great op|pg||
nt|mamos: thank to Dutch organisers and to BBO for bringing us this great JUnior tourny     see you all in a little while|pg||
nt|mamos: Netherlands Juniors v Germanty|pg||
nt|mamos: ten minutes or so from now according to schedule|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think he has read the cards well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  if 1@h shows exactly three hearts, responder know the position|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but somepairs play 1@h is 2 or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 1@H did not promise 3@H, 2@H did. 1@H could also be some hands with 2, I think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  If not i must be build on getting contract on the "strong" hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: the surprising Dutch girls in routing France, 32:2 at the moment|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: releaf for N seeing @H Q|pg||
nt|po-s: if he has redoubled|pg||
nt|bridgek: 1NT natural (no spades,2ha 7-9 hcp) would solve that actually|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: South left the table.. |pg||
nt|po-s: no doubt that is more likely than their biddin diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: don't know why exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: he's back|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: then suggests a controlled psyche to me|pg||
nt|mamos: well  credit to West here  --  I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He did double 1NT. After that he is not obliged to double every bid by opps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|m_niemi: wd|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: did Hop just smile with that ?|pg||
nt|ritong: first you can find Ak onside, which would be pleasant, second it might lure opponents|pg||

nt|newmoon: interesting 3NT here for n/s|pg||
nt|newmoon: a @C lead, as it happens, swing the timing for the defense|pg||
nt|santyclz: Transferring into that @d suit isn't for everyone.|pg||
nt|puncher: does any bridge player ever want to get beat?|pg||
nt|ritong: but none of that today|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice, spectacle|pg||
nt|chmitty: Bon ... nous pouvons féliciter les Israéliens.|pg||
nt|chmitty: Génération très douée|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: this board is a chance for Israel|pg||
nt|kemperg: west :(|pg||
nt|ritong: east has a mega hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: how many @S will brink bid over 1@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: another competitive hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: potential for EW to get overboard if West opens |pg||
nt|xenya: i suppse E felt he had to do something|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson/Sime open 1NT a 5-card major less often than some pairs|pg||
nt|ritong: he will surely make some jumps in @ss|pg||
nt|milton_se: rather modest by him :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  4@c, showing the black suits would be best from Short, if they played that|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@S exclusion?|pg||
nt|ritong: his problem remains @d control, though|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h would be opportune, then|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: mais la messe est dite depuis un certain temps    Les Israeliens confirment leur victoire de Philadelphie  avec talent|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Since I would be bid 2@S on much worse than that--with a semi-solid suit I like 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|bridgek: compare this 3sp with the one on board 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: west passing is slightly suprising|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: west has an automatic pass |pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|paulg:  as they can show an upper range hand using Gazzilli|pg||
nt|yuval10: but looks normal to stay in 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: wow²|pg||
nt|bridgek: I think bidding on the assumption of what the opp's have is inferior to bidding what your own hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: a lovely lead-directing dble!!|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@c Astro?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: EW have 10 tricks in @S if @C ruff not found|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd be in 5@c doing down one|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I prefer to bid a 6 card major than than show 2 suits initially|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure not, but WBU want to win to help their  1 team and Scotland want to win to finish in the top half|pg||
nt|paulg:  so they are not 'dead' matches|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Now (unofficial) Eng 162; Wales 162; Ireland; 160; Scotland 154; WBU 150; NI 110    what a finish!|pg||
nt|pelu: the dutchgirls has played very well thehole way - a strong team with Laura Dekkers from the dutch women team (Silver in Ostende)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Computer/itnernet doet beetje raar. hopelijk niets ernstigs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: there is a chance of reaching 6@S|pg||
nt|april7: actually now its a must with the double fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: slim|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it would help if 3@d was forcing at this point  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: ASPTRO|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, thanks.|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwile NI reached 7@D on 24 (uggh)|pg||
nt|puncher: so who's your money on or would you rather not say?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Too close to call|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, not to West |pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like a standard result in OR and anything els then a push will be a big suprise|pg||
nt|kemperg: rdl|pg||
nt|bobholl: by the way gerbrand (hop) you'r doing a great job :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: nog geen problemen gerbrand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought it would be a boring 4@S by EW but now i'm not so sure|pg||
nt|xenya: 14 imps|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 6 major 5 minor and I don't use Michaels|pg||
nt|puncher: Gazzilli certainly seems to be the toy of the moment|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S 2@C to put it 1 down but alas |pg||
nt|007 joosth: sch V voor een r snitje?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the 4-1 trump break is not going to cause a problem this time|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@S making here|pg||
nt|roswolf: west needs restraint here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@H feels like an overbid |pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead would have defeated this game|pg||
nt|bridgek: it's not gonna make any way|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: how many @d's does 1@d promise?  if it's 3 then how can they know about the "double fit"?|pg||
nt|april7: and all aces, there is even a possibility for 7, but not making|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Ooh-er|pg||
nt|xenya: missing an ace|pg||
nt|paulg:  would you bid 4@c over 3@h?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they've done well as the club lead looks right|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes The opponents seem limited. As it happens so is partner |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4th best from your longest as usual best|pg||
nt|bridgek: 4th best anyone?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|newmoon: @C10 lead here probably better...|pg||
nt|xenya: they gained 14 imps i meant|pg||
nt|paulg:  chances for making 11 tricks if the defence do not cash their diamond tricks|pg||
nt|puncher: but at this stage the overtricks won't help either of these teams very much|pg||
nt|paulg:  @s10 next|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: works well here :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: he always has 9 even after @S lead? 4@H 4@D 1@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: true gerbrand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: surely 6@c now|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice def. by N in the OR to play @d after he's in with the A@h|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|newmoon: but the C5 is higher than the 4 on the 4th round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure?|pg||
nt|bridgek: het is toch 4e van boven van je beste kleur?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: goed de sch T gecamoufleerd|pg||
nt|rhelle: ja, maar de Wijs gooit @s6 - upside down count|pg||
nt|rhelle: dus die heeft 3 @s|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dat helpt  maar N probeert het tenminste|pg||
nt|rhelle: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: bauke telt nu N punten maar die heeft er geen 15 :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: had|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: hij vroeg idd 15-17?|pg||
nt|bobholl: op 5@C komt N nog aardig in de problemen|pg||
nt|007 joosth: overigens kan west met 3 sch nog best de B of T hebben :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: valt mee Bob   hij is dan gewoon snel uit zijn lijden verlost|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: on rute for 6@C - making - need @CJ to drop - @Cs 2-2 or @hs 3-3|pg||
nt|bridgek: on the 360 in 1spade declarer in the other room (South) managed to go down in 2spX|pg||
nt|bridgek: After a DIAMOND lead into his AQ|pg||
nt|po-s: 3 natural spades and AK ruff in clubs?|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's normal :)|pg||
nt|po-s: even after that diamond|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Indeed it was, and he did in a split second|pg||
nt|po-s: but if no spade ever from East then West may be endplayed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: France has won the other SF, 64:50|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quitew but guess so too|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|newmoon: contemplating whether to get to dummy and run the @HJ, playing East for 10x|pg||
nt|puncher: Murdoch just made 4@S on board 9 so the swings continue... |pg||
nt|paulg:  John Carroll led a diamond against the contract, rather than the safer heart|pg||
nt|yuval10: great comeback for them, and they'll face Israel in a re-match of the thrilling final from Phili in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|bridgek: he cannot esteblish di|pg||
nt|bridgek: establish|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: maybe N should have taken a sve here -- with his singleton diamond |pg||
nt|puncher: all gratefully received - we're still in with a shout after all... |pg||
nt|bridgek: hoe die ook telt, alleen kl na is down. noord heeft tenminste 4ru 2sch|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|april7: not to be understood, the pass by E with this hand|pg||
nt|davidb: D-H  easy squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or QJ doubleton with N (then no guess), or singleton honour with South, then a guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No entry for @D now|pg||
nt|bridgek: see|pg||
nt|milton_se: no way|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think I could have passed the W hand as smoothly as he did:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes. It even looks like 7@c would make as the cards are|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7@c won't make as you have only 11 top tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: ?? how - u have to give up a @H and ruff the 4. @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no 13th trick, which is rather irrelevant when he is in 6|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Yuval, you are right. only 11 tricks. I was only watching the @d-@h squeze mon S|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like you need to win in hand , AQ @c, @d to Ace @d ruff, Q@c discardsing @s and @h to 8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not really on this layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: TD just warned for time|pg||
nt|bridgek: drijver could also throw a diamond|pg||
pc|c4|nt|newmoon: what other legitimate chance is there?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So Ew have done better than either you or I would have done|pg||
nt|paulg:  Well defended|pg||
nt|wendle: subjec to correct bridgemate entry AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ire 161; Eng 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 103|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahalim: what does your abacus come up with Henri ?|pg||
nt|ritong: 650|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: when u take @CA and see the Jack thenjust play @h to K and @H from dummy to E and ruff the 4. @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a red squeeze or you can ruff the 4th heart after only drawing one round of trumps|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Ernst, you said before Fisher was the one that had take all the time when they was late. Is that still the case?|pg||
nt|ritong: with no uptrick, 550|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|newmoon: well... can also play East for @SA-@SK, with no club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The intermediates decided|pg||
nt|roswolf: west judged the auction well methinks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: Emergency @d cash.|pg||
nt|paulg:  indeed they have|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|davidb: peter  h to the 8 is the play now-safe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He was in the tank for 5 minutes before finessing diamonds in 6@S, wasn't he?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least it felt like 5 minutes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: remember all that after board 12 this table still has to play board 1. Board 1 was missduplicated from start|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep,the swedes think, but not half as long|pg||
nt|mamos: was there a delay at the start ?|pg||
nt|pelu: why David - @H to King will work i almost alle layout|pg||
nt|davidb: not with N hxx|pg||
nt|davidb: sp ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, BBO was not connected and misdeal 1 cost time|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a small delay but not that long from start. ok Ernest, have they disgussed this at the table and Fisher admit ?|pg||
nt|mamos: with North's Spade call it's reasonable to play for the red suits in South|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no, not a word|pg||
nt|pelu: ok the @s-ruff - agree I will go for coffee|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, ty|pg||
nt|davidb: in Eilat November|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Right this moment cecilia sais fisher has to take the blame and he admits|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: S rates to have maximum 1 spade on the auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually they should go down in 3@s whereas I was down in 5@c|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dT|nt|bobholl: guess drijver will take his trick now down is sure then :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: throw a club in case brink has 53 of hearts|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|newmoon: playing west for Kx in @H tight|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: Est joue @C-@C - ce qui est bon pour le flanc|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south playing the 2 here, hearing declarer say Ace, instead of Spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: director is called|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: je crois que ce qui compte est la carte  détachée    nous n en sommes pas à 1 imp près|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, ça pourrait etre plus grave|pg||
nt|ritong: genre lauria a monaco|pg||

nt|xenya: good double by S|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Could he not read the @C pip for a second ruff?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but we would have been doubled|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, did he think his partner has raised on singleton king of hearts?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must be getting close to time trouble here, with five boards still to play|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3NT likely to make here|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be another multi auction and North will raise 2NT to 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @C lead needed|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Unlikely from W|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence may block the diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: which might give them another shot|pg||
nt|2hplus4: True and nothing declarer can do about it Is there?|pg||
nt|puncher: England have a big board lurking on their score card - they seem to have lots of plus scores, but again, not sure it's enough to give Wales a headache|pg||
nt|puncher: Ahh - this is more like it!|pg||
nt|puncher: Could be some fun here... |pg||
nt|xenya: yeah, cheap|pg||
nt|ritong: ce serait trop long de raconter cette histoire par le menu|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW can make at least 2@d on last hand so -50 should be ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: pass by north and dbl by south?|pg||
nt|paulg:  deep finesse will be saying that 7@c by South is the contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps all-pass here ( will save time too )|pg||
nt|ritong: sometimes pard holds a six bagger|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, have to miss the next session:(|pg||
nt|po-s: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another bits and pieces hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|2hplus4: It did seem rather strange|pg||
nt|puncher: to avoid the heart ruff|pg||
nt|paulg:  you can make 6@c by North even after a heart ruff, if you get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden may gain some here. If they bid 4@H and are allowed to play there|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: 1@C?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'll boldly predict this won't be openned 1nt.|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: or it may die out on the 1 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h by s?|pg||
nt|wendle: AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
nt|puncher: 6@S a good save over 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i think it is a matter of what level you accept the spade sacrifice|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Now its almost even again after the really good start for sweden|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is a lucky make|pg||
nt|yuval10: last board here, thanks all|pg||
nt|bobholl: did he consider 1nt ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: but the final contract is probably correct|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: North has done well to pass--I might well have bid |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even stranger|pg||
nt|paulg:  May be 2@d from West, weak with both majors|pg||
nt|puncher: welcome back all|pg||
nt|pelu: the swedes "never" pass :)|pg||
nt|ritong: and both games make  extremely expensive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: une cigarette    de Versace qui lui a coûté un titre mondial sur la dernière donne|pg||
mb|r|nt|garnetts: East might also have just bid 3NT over 2@H unless he is really thinking six might be on |pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h is 10-13 6 @h's|pg||
nt|bobholl: gerbrand said they play 9-12 at this vulnarabilty :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: zelfs al had west KVx(x) dan nog had noord 7 slagen|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pitiful:  3@c was pass or correct|pg||

nt|andyv:  rdbl=3 card support|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dislike the dbl on hands which dont have 4-4 in the majors|pg||

nt|bobholl: what happens to nS 4@H ?|pg||
nt|bridgek: I like the bidding so far|pg||
nt|bobholl: there we are |pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2N was a @h raise|pg||
nt|newmoon: with 3-4-3-3, deduct a point = he has a minimum|pg||
nt|xenya:  looks like pass is missing here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson might have bid 5@s on the way there|pg||
nt|pelu: two main boards in the match : 6@C/3Nt and board 4 twere Israel played game in the wrong suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fisher may balance with 1NT now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s is 2-3 @s's and not 18-19 so was easy for him|pg||
nt|ritong: en gros, lauria qui jouait le finale de la bermuda bowl a monaco en 2003 et qui était déclarant tout seul, son partenaire ayant quitté la pièce, s est mélangé les crayons en jouant ...|pg||

nt|puncher: It's the best they can do|pg||
nt|bobholl: he'd like to bid 3 1/2 @H |pg||
nt|roswolf: landed on their feet though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: an odd choice with all that black suit cover --heart lead and spade switch beats it |pg||
nt|puncher: not the easiest of leads for south - trump likely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 IMPs presumably|pg||
nt|bobholl: lebensohl is helpfull than|pg||
nt|bridgek: I don't like pass on 2spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly makes traditional bidding more adventuresome|pg||
nt|roswolf: that gives the spade suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: true andy:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  okay, i think this is close except that Soith opened 2@d multi|pg||

nt|bridgek: nu wordt ie nog een keer ingegooid|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ja het lijkt dat Bauke beter eerst nog een sch had kunnen spelen|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|april7: 3@D by EW and a partscore of 2 @S in @S by NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice club position for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: the bidding will make sure that Erichsen gets the hearts right|pg||
nt|bridgek: maar noord is er ook nog om iets te verzinnen|pg||
pc|s8|nt|newmoon: even 2@H is precarious here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do they still have to play a new board 1?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Ernst and all commentators|pg||
nt|davidb: false card by W  -9 club may put declarer on guess  Qxx  op.109 in EW hands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hope to see you all back in about 25 minutes for the final, Israel vs France|pg||
nt|yuval10: congrats for Sweden, they had a very nice tournement. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  west almost endplayed on the lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @C lead helps a lot|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then they are way behind schedule|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Wa have a new pair then - my uncle and your aunt|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: kiky has many dutch buddies|pg||
nt|bridgek: pass probably denied 3sp|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: un truc épique, quoi|pg||
nt|bridgek: He needs to find the J of diamonds in a hurry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: a save for e/w in spades looks a bit difficult if the east hand gets forced early   but 5@D is ok    at most  500 if a sspade ruff is found|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next set in 13 minutes|pg||
nt|ritong: not a secret, kiky  i can tell, yes?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz: That lead doesn't hurt.  Nor the shift.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: en nog een keer met klaver?|pg||
nt|bridgek: balletje balletje|pg||
nt|bobholl: leuk spel dat heen en weer ketsen :)|pg||
nt|bridgek: eigenlijk moet N eerst ha AK spelen en dan kl|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: otherwse 300|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q@s not a classic lead from that holding but S was hoping that part of the 3 card support that N showed would be the 10 or K of @s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: and 11 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel will play their 3rd final in 4 years in about 22 minutes from now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahalim: of course|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: WE wont tell any other:)|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
pc|d7|nt|007 joosth: dat lijkt me niet want opps kunen dan gewoon h T naspelen|pg||
nt|bridgek: dit is namelijk altiij down|pg||
nt|bridgek: oost heeft 44 zwart met 2 ha is hij ingegooid|pg||
nt|bobholl: op @S A komt w in dwang |pg||
nt|007 joosth: ik denk dat ik als N een kleine harten naar de B zou hebben gespeeld.  ook down, maar wel sneller|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if S can make 8 tricks this will only cost 1 IMP. It looks like e/w needs to get a ruff to stop that|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Bravo   à l'équipe junior  d'Israël   et félicitations aux Néerlandais pour avoir réuni un tel plateau|pg||
nt|ritong: entre parenthèses, c était la première grande compétition que BBO retransmettait, on a pas été déçus|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: just between the four of us|pg||
nt|bridgek: So he needed a extra ha-stopper + running diamonds for 3nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  however declarer still has two diamond losers, spade and a club|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  needed to lead a high heart to pin the 7 i think|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 9 tricks though|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D aj8 en toch nog gemaakt|pg||
nt|bridgek: ha V na |pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: Simon: nou come on|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ka ching.|pg||
nt|xenya: so a close match before the final segment|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg:  as long as the defence does not broach diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker can establish a discard from each hand, but this does not help him|pg||
nt|bridgek: He still needs to find it|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess he'll takes his @S now if that doewsn't work 4@H is on |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|po-s: overtake and diamonds after three spades|pg||
nt|bridgek: di jack wrong and overtaking= two off|pg||
nt|bobholl: but still 4@H on than|pg||
nt|po-s: isn´t it anyway?|pg||
nt|bobholl: dan gaat O stepping stonene|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, as you pointed out geoffrey, it gave up the whole @s suit and makes it easy for declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|april7: safety play by finessing|pg||
nt|newmoon: Declarer hopes that THEY will break @Ds for him|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 rather -- i didn't notice the @H10|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  even if West switches to a diamond, Walker might fly with the king of diamonds because he was given a chance that he was not due|pg||
nt|ritong: yup|pg||
nt|ritong: good for the show|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: @D @H and 2@S if overtake works|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bridgek: He wants to make this of course|pg||
pc|c2|nt|puncher: England's lurking good board has apparently been counter-acted by a lurking bad board, so Wales are unlikely to be caught|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: leaving the hearts late|pg||
nt|ahalim: germ , you Dutch are very lucky, so many sponsors|pg||
nt|milton_se: and the expected 200|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mikael_w: yes, now its even a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: now N will get endplayed for only 1 off|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|paulg:  this board has potential for Ireland|pg||
nt|yuval10: good try by W to put declarer in a guess, but she took the right view|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am not sure we can show board 1 Ernest?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Now they still have to play the new number one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We don't get to see board 1|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont exp that we will see the cards onthe new board 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: see you all soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S+1 in the other room|pg||
nt|mikael_w: see you next half|pg||
nt|Walddk4: by NS|pg||
nt|mamos: good stuff|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We can't give you the layout, sorry|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to our op  Ernst hard job  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The original board 1 was fouled|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I dont think thats the cards. I think they look like the board that was missduplicated|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North and East had the exact same 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: bidding pass-1c-1s-dbl-2s-p-p-d-p-3h-p-p-p. So 3 hearts by east|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So a swibng it will be no matter what|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden has 140 in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: in 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 3@H by Sweden here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: No, by Israel|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, sorry|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 3@h looks like you almost can safe right ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h will make for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: And just made|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so a push on last board ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: See you after the break|pg||
nt|yuval10: can't be a push|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7 IMPs to Israel then|pg||
nt|mikael_w: only 10 min break righgt ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 140+140|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel leads by 5 in intermission|pg||
nt|yuval10: 227:22|pg||
nt|yuval10: 27:22 even|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hmmm, not easy to know on the last board. The cards was wrong and we done really know WHAT was wrong?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h8|nt|yuval10: we'll probably have 3 more rounds of 4 boards each|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: ace and another club now|pg||
nt|bobholl: they score 200 now |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|ritong: oui, les israéliens méritent de gagner, ils ont tres bien joué|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|pg||
