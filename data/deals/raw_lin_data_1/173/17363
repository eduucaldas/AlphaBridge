nt|chilloncan: green on white in 3rd seat, N has a hand most would regard as suitable for a 1S opener. one hand proves nothing and resulting as a general habit is pernicious to devloping ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: judgment, but empirical results are not meaningless...and here 1S by N  might very well find E as declarer in 2N or maybe even 3N|pg||

nt|rodal f: From the opening 1@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that it's easy to reach.  West's minor suit 10s are gold|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E is practially ready to go slamming over 2C...wondering if he shouldnt just bid 3S over 2C|pg||

nt|rodal f: 1@D from me. WHY?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|h2|nt|noodle:  if 3@C showed extras that d be my choice with W hand  5431 pattern|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in my view, E has too much to tell to start with 4th suit forcing. 3S splinter would describe almost he whole hand at once o ver 2C|pg||

pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: In fact, the whole auction is excellent, in my view|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Brightling, on hearing 4@S, realised that his interior spots in the minors make for a good slam|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he was probably aware there was no grand, as East didn't bid 4@D|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: hi there Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the ACBL "printed defence" is a joke - it makes the Multi look like a major weapon that requires pages of defence, when in reality the Multi 2@d is a popgun that requires 2 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3 lines of defence. |pg||

nt|andyv:  we've gone thru this board a couple of times|pg||

nt|rodal f: That intervention made it hard for E but easy for W|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nice logic... psyching the opps out....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: South shouldnt be condemned too harshly .. he didnt know about the "diamond surprise" awaiting him; and the fact pd held K@S|pg||
nt|petergill: More likely, the bidding really might be Pass Pass 1NT P 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, North will lead a heart and 3NT should make comfortably|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last match of the qualifying rounds. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If if it is played by E (mosty unlikely), declarer can counter a club lead by ducking twice..and the major suit kings are ideally placed for him|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|petergill: My point being that Multi 2@d is feared in America due to the length (and existence) of the written defence they provide, which does more harm than good, given that the main aim of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: good bridge is to avoid distraction and focus on being "at the table".|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the more psychological hangnails you can get the, picking, the more chance for distraction:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I agree...if they simply let multi to be played all the time, players would eventually learn how to deal with it...all conventions take some time for the public to accept|pg||
nt|petergill: PO is right in theory, but in practice virtually nobody (except me, who gets laughed at when he does so) ever alerts the Pass that shows 6 spades. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bailey's lead over Neill for 4th spot is down to 7 VPs now|pg||

nt|super nova: If he gets a 25 he will miss out by 1 vp.|pg||
nt|petergill: As Jamie just pointed out, Bailey has finished play and has taken 4th place. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone - Brown will surely choose to play Bailey (with 16 imp carry-forward)  with Hoffman facing a tough task against Klinger in tomorrow's semis. |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: If Ew bid on, 5@DX would cost 500, or 4@SX cost either 800, 500 or 200 depending on how many ruffs NS get. |pg||

nt|bjacobs: Fortune favours the brave, etc etc|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 8 LTC with miniscule offense to defense ratio|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Last board for the match, thanks all|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR got it at the mol?|pg||
nt|petergill: If North alerts South's Pass of 3@C, George Smolanko asks and is told that the Pass shows six spades. That is what alerting is meant to be all about. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: hmmm one left|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A two color this also? Daniel|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Actually we have board 17 to come|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT immensely better contract than the 'blah' 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Can't see the writing, it may be 8-11|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for the Brown team, blah wins this time|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hoffman might stay off the heart, given his previous experience|pg||
nt|bjacobs: (board 26)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So he settles back into the good ol' trump lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can't say it too strongly - these trump leads without purpose are pure rubbish|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OK.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: sadly, though - must like the previous bd, North's clubs are bad news|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: much like|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Only a @C lead to hold them 110 so =|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: Some top experts disagree with me. I do not believe that every little thing should be alerted - I simply think that after any Pass by a Multi 2@D opener that shows the suit should ...|pg||
nt|petergill: be alerted. Otherwise, those with no familiarity with Multi 2@d (e.g George) are disadvantaged. |pg||
pc|dT|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Sr specs. Can't exsplain why the bid went as it did.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rodal f: BUT making the match tighter for shure.|pg||

nt|petergill: I would be happy to play bridge with no other Alerts at all as long as this Pass by a Multi 2@D opener is alerted. In my opinion, it is the single most important Alert in the game ...|pg||
nt|petergill: of bridge, and almost nobody wants it to be alerted. |pg||
nt|andyv:  can't see the harm in that, Peter.  ACBL, when they do allow multi, require printed defenses to it to be given to the opps as well as alerting of all sequences, even when obvious.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: A spec likes the trump lead to "stop ruffs"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it sounds like N/S have a 4-4 fit ... how are you going to stop ruffs with one measly trump lead?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugrapha1: tx all... back in 30min|pg||
