nt|daman: my Mother would open the east hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Shouldn't think he will ...|pg||
nt|daman: 2 1/2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even I would open this one|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Another potential slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Indeed; too little of that world wide|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think this will be difficult to avoid given South's controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Survived.  Didn't get a 2@d response.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: Wanted a 2@H response to give him a shot|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|henryb:  just a little too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: bad trump suit will kill this|pg||
nt|chick: hi Ed :)|pg||
nt|chick: although that lead didn't help the defense very much|pg||
nt|henryb:  For what its worth, I would either pass over 1@h (remember when you needed 6 points to respond?) or raise to 2@h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: I would not pass up the chance to show a 4 card spade suit when I had an A plus something, and backup support for hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  North very unhappy on this lead|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: Or maybe they had to hit clubs sooner?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think she has to hope for 3-2 hearts with the K onside and that she can negotiate a club ruff|pg||
nt|chick: however, I'd stop in 3@H in this auction|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  but slam needs very carefull declarer play|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|henryb:  bidding 1@s and then 2@h over 1N should show a constructive hand, I think|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if no @d lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: Me, too, but maybe they don't always raise with 3-card support and a dead minimum|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: 10@S coming down was fortunate once spades 4-1|pg||
nt|paulg:  I guess North thought that slam would be no better than a finesse opposite a normal 3@s call|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it might be a lot worse|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  having so much points in minors - definitely|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's controls possibly too good for 3@s, but you cannot bid 3.5@s|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Hmmmm.  I'll have to remember that play...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He had two trump losers. He lost them. :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  my line on this hand would have been to duck a club, win a @d return in dummy, finesse the @h, lose another club and hope that a diamond ruff was with the long trump|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|c19|st||md|1SAKT5HA53DA2C8743,SQJ7HT842DQ754CK2,S93HKQ6DKJ98CAQJT,S8642HJ97DT63C965|sv|e|nt|chick: another partscore here, but hard to guess who will win it|pg||
nt|kmb24: another great result from robles/caracci coming in making 3N off the first 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|brobles: Goren says that with this quantity of points you can play 3N :)|pg||
nt|brobles: The Open room had a misunderstanding on this hand but stopped safely in 4NT. Smith was denying majors with 3@h but apparently they weren't in the same page|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: Hi|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brobles: Valdes is going to prempt?|pg||
nt|kmb24: here's a nice little trick... open the south hand with multi, and show whichever major partner doesn't like|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: now everything is okay|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: but have to play the bad version of multi for that.|pg||
nt|henryb:  on the other hand, 4 imps is the difference in the match at this point|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: still got the club away   so  down 2 last hand|pg||
nt|friggi: plain 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rick3son:  l have been told that the score is not accurate|pg||
nt|alamiro: Interesante mano de West, aunque solo se pueden hacer 11 tricks en 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kmb24: dbl!|pg||
nt|brobles: so 2@s is 0-7hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Is there another set in this match?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kmb24: anyone like double on paca's cards?|pg||
nt|kmb24: 3n looks normal to me|pg||
nt|brobles: 4@d is pretty conservative in my opinion|pg||
nt|kmb24: i agree|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca not liking his trick source in 3N with only 1 stopper, but it has to be a winning bid more often.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: well, given that your partner would take a trick in spades this hand in 3n, maybe it's a better stopper than it seems|pg||
nt|brobles: 5@d turns out to be an excellent spot, because he prefered to evaluate his hand as suit playing cards|pg||
nt|brobles: now rafa should definitly blast into slam|pg||
nt|brobles: and take an overtrick :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|alamiro: Me gusta el 2@C de East, es una buena mano y el splinter se comeria mucho espacio prefiero tener primer mas informacion de la mano de mi compañero!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Sure a lot of bidding with this piece of junk|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
mb|4N|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|alamiro: probablemente el 2@h disminuyo las expectativas de algo mas para east|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: apparently he bid only 5@d|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brobles: let's see if EW can cash their first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|kmb24: they squealed|pg||
nt|brobles: Nice try by Joaquin but Rafa decided he was missing too many key cards to get involved|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ralfwil: @hK is a bad honour, so pass on 3@s|pg||
nt|brobles: NS playing 4 card diamonds so I think that a club lead is reasonable. Well done|pg||
nt|kmb24: should lead a club now no problem and the first 5 not hard looking at that dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: good god|pg||
nt|friggi: jacobson has the same illness as Claassen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: overboard again    unfortuantely  diamond honors wasted |pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|henryb:  Do you want commentary in English here?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|brobles: East certainly did the only auction to get to 6@d|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|alamiro: Algunas parejas pudieron haber contestando sobre el 4nt , 5nt, numero par de keycards y 1 fallo|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: change the red suits on E and 4@s is clear|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kmb24: great choice by paca to get them looking...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kmb24: though i still hate double|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|tez: i m not fun for lead..but it worked|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|alamiro: sin control en @D el 4nt me parece exagerado!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|alamiro: Probablemente ya reclamo el resto de tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|henryb:  declarer should make 7 and will because the @dQ will fall on the third round|pg||
nt|Rafa2: Hola a todos|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I think I liked the 1@H opener on the previous deal better than this 12 count|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you can call this a 12 count with qj-.|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 with west|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, especially if you have a meaningful lead in the match.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it was a lock. Given the 1@s bid, West would never have pitched two spades from an origina holding of QJ10x|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: This is more like it|pg||
nt|paulg:  looks dangerous hand for West|pg||
nt|ady: would not play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not a bad responding hand to a strong @c, 12hcp 3 controls...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: I presume 1NT is wide-ranging|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|santyclz: 6@c (or @ss in matchpoints).|pg||
nt|ady: double from south?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: It makes the auction game-forcing, and hopefully West will not worry about too much wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, W is aware now|pg||
nt|paulg:  on hands like this it is better to play multi 2@d as North may overcall 2@h :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  the only good news is that there is a chance that this auction will be duplicated|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  agree, the distribution is awful here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: 3nt?  Perhaps 3nt*?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: it was not alerted|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think it was probably serious|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d 9 asking for @s return|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Thanks, Tommy.|pg||
nt|daman: let's hope they don't get to the grand salami|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: looks horrible   3 tricks |pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe EW would have been able to be more competitive if east had raised clubs.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|daman: asking for the @S Q'|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Response denies the king of hearts so all is well|pg||
nt|daman: 5@H was asking partner if he had the @S Queen    |pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: I'm told 3nt was forcing|pg||
nt|daman: right Joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: 5@H asking for @sQ, Rdb = Ace or void|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only worry would be a bad spade break, so this lead is a pleasant sight|pg||
nt|henryb:  would you bid 2@s or 2@c over 1N? I think the South hand is too good for 2@s|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|chick: I agree with that, I would bid 2@C|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|ady: spade    then heart from south|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|othered1: If my overcalls are sound, I agree.  if just to hear ourselves bid, 2@S is OK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s7|pc|cK|nt|henryb:  Mind you, GIB would tell you that 3@s is the limit|pg||
mc|12|nt|ady: 1400  I would think|pg||
nt|paulg:  anything from South, really straightforward defence|pg||
pg||
qx|c20|st||md|2S86HK872D9CAK8763,SAT543HJ94D543C95,SJ9HAQ65DAK76CQT2,SKQ72HT3DQJT82CJ4|sv|b|nt|friggi: take 2 rounds of @C|pg||
nt|friggi: no but the small numbers add up over time:)|pg||
nt|chick: EW shouldn't have too much trouble getting to this fine slam|pg||
nt|friggi: the question remain will it be play in N in the other room?|pg||
nt|brobles: Well done Rafa and Paca|pg||
nt|brobles: this was THE hand where double could get you to 12 imps :)|pg||
nt|brobles: good result for NS in the Open Room|pg||
nt|alamiro: Ultima mano de este segmento!|pg||
nt|alamiro: Gracias a todos, especialmente a la operadora por su excelente trabajo!|pg||
nt|alamiro: En la otra mesa sobre el apoyo simple decidio remtar 4@h, no se que tan conveniente con semifallo al palo de apertura de mi compañero!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: they will argue in the comparrison about who gets credit for that one, robles-caracci or paca-rafa|pg||
mb|1N|nt|alamiro: de repente hubiera trabajado un game try posiblemente con 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: do you bid 1@s with rubio hand|pg||
nt|brobles: Smith chose not to double 4@s with his singleton @d and West went for the sacrifice|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzwd: West actually put on his glasses after East´s 2@C :)|pg||
nt|chick: hahahahahahhaaaa|pg||
nt|kmb24: i wouldn't dream of passing :)  you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: What about @C opening here then reverse @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  good night all, and good luck to everybody|pg||
nt|henryb:  well done by Schnetzer|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: Never for me|pg||
nt|chick: There are still about 75 people in the world who open that hand 1@C, but I'm not one of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: I think there are more people Chick, most people that play 1@C 17+... :)|pg||
nt|friggi: I kind of like it more and more:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: strictly speaking not a minimum but close to it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: another strange bid by Juan Pablo Valdes. Maybe he was expecting EW to bid up|pg||
nt|alamiro: ahora despues de 3@D entraria el criterio del abridor si k10x lo considera como ayuda|pg||
nt|Rafa2: Welcome to the chilean women teams trials final|pg||
nt|Rafa2: the winner of this match will represent Chile in the next southamerican championship to be held in Asunción, Paraguay, June 11 2011|pg||
nt|Rafa2: http://www.sudamericanobridge2011.com/ for info of that tournament (in spanish)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But the closed room result will be hard to duplicate|pg||
nt|henryb:  on this board|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tez: i would bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: so maybe 76 in few weeks|pg||
nt|brobles: I would bid 2@c if 1@s wasn't available :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: when its this close go for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: they open very light when not vul|pg||
nt|brobles: nice lead|pg||
nt|tez: briland:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: too tough to avoid 3n, but they got there from the wrong side it seems|pg||
nt|tez: ne count here|pg||
nt|tez: need|pg||
nt|brobles: maybe declarer tries to sneak a diamond and then play for 7 tricks in the majors|pg||
nt|brobles: it's his best shot really|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room bid a direct 3n over 1S|pg||
nt|brobles: win the club in hand and try a suspicious @dJ :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: seems like a good plan to me|pg||
nt|tez: if duck 8 trick again|pg||
nt|brobles: I really don't see another plan, but I'm guessing that Rubio will pop Ace knowing the layout|pg||
nt|rick3son:  good night Henry|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|espooz: They dont play 2/1 ?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|brobles: @c7 really helps|pg||
nt|kmb24: 7 was a good card|pg||
nt|alamiro: Asi como en la otra mesa fue sobrevalorada la mano de east, me parece que aqui fue subvaluada!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|friggi: friendly @S brake it the key here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kmb24: well there goes the contract|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: isn´t this maheable?|pg||
nt|kmb24: oops|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: multi in closed room   2@D  from west  2@S   east    showing good hearts   but not good spades    south tht spades good enough to bid at the 3 level   bit missed that could be ...|pg||
nt|ady: wests suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: makeable...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|alamiro: Esto les permitira recupar 6 imps |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|alamiro: 7 luego de jugar el A@d :)|pg||
nt|alamiro: Chao a todos nos vemos luego!|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: we come back later|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|tez: @c 7 was very good|pg||
nt|kmb24: looked very likely that 4 spades were possible, and given the clubs i think @h finesse was a better shot|pg||
nt|brobles: Yep|pg||
nt|henryb:  Apparently N-S had a misunderstanding in the other room: South bid 4@c over 2@h, which N interpreted as a cue and S meant as keycard Gerber|pg||
pc|c2|nt|friggi: but not enough|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brobles: Rubio team picked up 11 imps on board 25 after a terrible club split for NS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: this happens with a multi sometimes   both sides playing in the same suit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jpvaldes: Now she need @D 3-3 to win this hand.|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|c21|st||md|3SJHK3DAKQJ765CJ64,SAKT8754HQ9D8CAQ2,S9632H764D93CK953,SQHAJT852DT42CT87|sv|n|nt|ralfwil: Interesting to hear teammates - we have 800 and....|pg||
nt|ady: team mates will be very gratefull for the unexpected plus|pg||
nt|chick: This would have been much better bid using control cuebids instead of ace asking|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|espooz: I dont think V should bid 4@D so long they play 2/1 "game force"|pg||
nt|friggi: I think Blandat will gain some Imps on this one|pg||
nt|kmb24: JD to the K for a H finesse was a winner|pg||
nt|brobles: yeah, for sure.|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: we'll be back in a few minutes|pg||
nt|henryb:  Neither E led what I would think was an obvious @sK against the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: this board likely to be the third push of the segment|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|kmb24: when they cover then you have to play the T@s and you could take enough tricks...|pg||
nt|tez: i bet @c|pg||
mb|4S|nt|friggi: this could be fun|pg||
nt|kmb24: looks like a normal 3n|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would probably try 3N as South -- with a @h lead I have 8 winners. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: and they will play 3 nt|pg||
nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes as West in the Open room took a lot of tricks after a spade lead|pg||
nt|kmb24: but you never know|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: I agree Espen, splinters are for game hands, slower is better for slam hands|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h is not enuf for me:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: you never know...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tez: for you?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|nt|brobles: you were right, but still a push|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|espooz: Exactly|pg||
nt|chick: replying to a couple of private comments .... splinters should be used by the person who knows there is game, but doesn't have a slam force hand.|pg||
nt|brobles: I agree, I try a NT bid, not sure if 1 or 2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: in that case, West is the one who knew there was slam, so he should NOT splinter ... his partner doesn't need to know about the @D shortness|pg||
nt|friggi: do you like W's dbl?|pg||
nt|kmb24: i kind of like 2n over 1s|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzwd: I do not like it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: and neither did East :)|pg||
nt|chick: no, I don't|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|h5|nt|barbyh: true theyre down but also cold for spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzwd: Exactly :)|pg||

nt|santyclz: Would have avoided a violation of imp rule 2 as well:  Go + on part-score hands.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  N-S go down in 5@s only if East shifts to a club rather than a heart|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3D|nt|othered1: vul save here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|5H|nt|ady: 3NT makes n/s   but has some good fortune|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good decision of S - to open 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  after 1@h may be problem with second round bid |pg||
nt|paulg:  i open 1NT on these hands, but the Italians rarely do (which is a concern to me!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|ady: east has no entry to play spades  and the hearts lay very kindly   and with stiff K@C  should make 10 tricks at least|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  will be relying on 3-3 hearts and a finesse in a minute|pg||
nt|ady: might have chosen to play hearts immediately as if K@C with east a spade switch might have been bad|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|henryb:  Roland, could you tell people where to find standings?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: now will try and club|pg||
nt|ady: lucky there will be a show out  so force to the winning line|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: even if west followed   might be best to try ace of clubs and when the jack does not appear  try the hearts|pg||
nt|paulg:  playing clubs first may mean a guess for East for which major to switch to (when he does have @cK)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: One of heaven's little jokes on mankind.  Occasionally you have to watch a 1nt contract.|pg||

nt|ady: easy game missed in CR for e/w|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: wait a few minutes|pg||
nt|henryb:  more possible slams|pg||
mb|2H|nt|friggi: Blandat (Mixed in English) is kicking back, just 2 imps from its handicap|pg||
nt|brobles: Caracci team leading by 17 so far (7 carryover and 10 more in the segment)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@h is cold with the @hK onside|pg||
nt|henryb:  but hard to bid|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|kmb24: only 3 of the 15 boards this segment were played in partscore at both tables!|pg||
nt|kmb24: 1n overcall in the other room was a little weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: This event has a very nice trophy at the entrance of the main chilean Bridge Club where you can eventually print your team name if you win :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|5D|nt|espooz: standard 1nt here|pg||
nt|kmb24: especially with double so close to describing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: finally, a makeable contract :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes that is a bid odd to see that:)|pg||
nt|brobles: Slam is agressive but easily makes on this layout|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes, very odd|pg||
nt|kmb24: i think rafa should bid 1nt over 1s|pg||
nt|alamiro: Hola a todos!|pg||
nt|alamiro: un rutinario 3nt para N-S en esta mano|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: only 12 cards on E on board 17, so they play 18 now|pg||
nt|brobles: Yeah, partner could have enough values for game on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kmb24: for sure, not to mention 1s could be a silly contract with 1nt cold|pg||
nt|alamiro: 10 tricks luego de la salida a @C|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@h will push the board. 6@h will win 13 for E-W. Unless S bids 7@d which goes down 3 or 4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|friggi: I dont like the lead|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@H is a far better contract then 3NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|alamiro: no hay problemas ni con @D ni con @h, asi que seran 5@D 4@h y 1@C|pg||
nt|jam11: buen analisis de del remate por parte de O|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|chick: W bid hearts.  I'm sure S was just leading the unbid major|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Every so often they have some inteest - must be the contract that is most often let through|pg||
nt|ady: close   J@C may also fall|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No standings|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: this is just one of the matches in round 5 of the Norwegian Club Team Championships|pg||
nt|henryb:  No standings as this is a 6 round KO leading to a 7 team round robin final|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The finals to be played later in the spring|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|santyclz: I predict (fearlessly) that this won't be played in 1nt.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb:  if I understand correctly|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: So brave|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought double might be 4 major, 5 minor type ... but clearly not|pg||
nt|ady: club lead  will not be good for defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: That is correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  So something like 440 teams entered the event, and we are down to the final 28|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|ady: even a heart lead it looks like 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North had an nasty lead, and no idea that dummy had quite so many diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT-X making is not a disaster, but overtricks are not good|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ady: on hand 1  6@H n/s   in OR   7NT played down 1|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  right time to find a swith to @h|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|s2|nt|santyclz: That lead didn't hurt.  The @d98 (and split) make them easy to establish.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|d7|nt|ady: had west taken out the double to hearts  this would have made|pg||
nt|paulg:  doubling a strong 1NT opener is always problematic, which is why many use double as a conventional call|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  but then you always worry about third-hand 1N openers|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 71Y??  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry private!|pg||
nt|ady: have a play for 4@S    must keep diamond loss fown too 1|pg||
nt|ady: can do it by elimating hearts and clubs  finessing club king on the way   and exiting with a spade|pg||
nt|friggi: yes low |pg||
nt|espooz: Very optimistic|pg||
nt|brobles: I remind you all that there is a live camera in this table right here: http://www.bridgesantiago.cl/vugcam|pg||
nt|Rafa: hubo una corrección de resultados|pg||

mb|1H|nt|tez: we will see..how will smith play |pg||
nt|brobles: I would game force on this one, specially vul|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brobles: Open Room in 6@c on board 15|pg||
nt|kmb24: for sure|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brobles: Seems normal|pg||
nt|kmb24: just need AK A to wrap 3n|pg||
nt|alamiro: Particularmente no me gustan los overcalls con 5 cartas a nivel de 2, pero en este caso trabaja bien!|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ady: can still make if ruffing a heart early and playing a spade  if later finessing a club  and eliminating and playing ace and another diamond     east willhave to unblock or be end ...|pg||
nt|ady: played   either way declarer makes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice play David - eliminate @c and @h before playing @s|pg||
nt|chick: EW could end in 3N, and if a heart is led, he won't get to use the diamonds|pg||
nt|friggi: @H is a mandatory lead from N|pg||
nt|tez: q of @c or ace and small|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I guess maybe any lead other than  @D  will give him entry problems|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT?|pg||
nt|barbyh: what is 3 cl is their system?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: So it will be 11 more imps for the Rubio team|pg||
nt|brobles: maybe they have trouble in getting to 3n now?|pg||
nt|kmb24: 3d wasn't best|pg||
nt|kmb24: i like 2n|pg||
nt|henryb:  South with a minimum opening is clearly torn between raising to 3@h which would be a major overbid, and passing which conceals the support|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kmb24: !|pg||
pc|h5|nt|friggi: operator do you know?|pg||
nt|brobles: wow|pg||
nt|kmb24: rafa|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: how do you play it?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kmb24: well, on a heart lead i might play for rho to be short @h and play !a and small.  you?|pg||
nt|tez: i bet he will play to 7|pg||
nt|tez: @c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|friggi: some guys have all the luck|pg||
nt|brobles: I would never bid 3N, but on this hand: nicely done what can I say|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brobles: I would either try 3@h or even 4@d|pg||
nt|brobles: but not 3N|pg||
nt|kmb24: it's not easy|pg||
nt|kmb24: necer 3n for me either|pg||
nt|alamiro: Este 3nt se esta jugando del lado equivocado! mejor si East lo remataba!|pg||
nt|alamiro: Solo 8 tricks posibles si acierta la Q@C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kmb24: low to the 7 maybe is the best at imps. you always get your tricks|pg||
nt|tez: not 8 pls:)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb:  That's quite a lead by S. which conceals the @hA. East should probably not finesse the @s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kmb24: but you're scared about spades|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|kmb24: J?|pg||
nt|brobles: that helps :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|ady: 9 card suit|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D?|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club lead to beat 6  not too difficult|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am corrected: about 300 teams entered, and if you lost close in the first round (or maybe it was random) you got to the second round anyway|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  5@d will get 6@d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd afraid of missing big play with N hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 5@d opening|pg||
nt|ady: goulash|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I suggested, opening a multi 2@d on  4 was a lot more successful as North did overcall 2@h, so the penalty was missed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East must be worried about missing something too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  I play my defence to 1NT over a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I'd have to bid 5@c (or pass)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  pity, but E has no decision, he has just to guess|pg||

mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

mb|2C|nt|barbyh: still get s his d|pg||

mb|p|nt|kmb24: paca1987|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: 4@h from S?|pg||

nt|kmb24: he likes to bid 3n|pg||
nt|kmb24: would u bid game?   it's close|pg||
nt|brobles: Board 27 turned out to be very costly for the Rubio team as 9 tricks were available in NT|pg||
nt|brobles: I would go for it|pg||

nt|brobles: Joaquin is my regular bridge partner and I can tell you that he was borned in 1987 :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ady: this looks flat|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the other table there was apparently confusion: West opened 3N, intended as 25-27, and East passed expecting a gambling 3N with solid clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: born*|pg||
nt|kmb24: xxxx of @d, thx|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: round 9 of 9    does this session finish the tournament?|pg||
nt|brobles: We will have a very close match towards the end|pg||
nt|kmb24: maybe given the set so far he hopes going lower will get him some imps|pg||
nt|kmb24: it's right here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|kmb24: now he'll keep denying a diamond fit unless forced to admit it|pg||
nt|tez: friendly hand|pg||
nt|brobles: Joaquin is a three time Southamerican Champion (2008-09-10), Rafael de la Barrera has 1 Southamerican Championship on his CV (2010)|pg||
nt|tez: @s and @h's ok|pg||
nt|tez: and @d --3-2|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kmb24: whats the best game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: has to play @S in second then he can make it|pg||
nt|friggi: due to friendly @H distribution|pg||
nt|alamiro: Segun el cc de N-S 5nt es, tienes algo extra?|pg||

nt|ady: seems should be ruffing a heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|espooz: E have a easy def|pg||
nt|kmb24: last few comparisons are close games bid and made by rubio|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@h in normal KCB should ask for the @sQ, and 5@s should deny it, but West was having none of it|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: and with @d 2-2 the same result|pg||
nt|henryb:  Another 10 imps for the E-W team|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt is miracle game for me|pg||
nt|kmb24: kibs telling me partscre is best, and i certainly would not jump shift, but he'll make his game this way|pg||
nt|kmb24: unless he starts believing the 9 and 8 of @h's are something special....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|espooz: I think E have a easy def to play @S K and more @S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brobles: declarer needs more than 2 heart tricks so he should play the 10 now.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|alamiro: Probablemente saque todos los triunfos, juegue @D al as , luego regresara a su mano con @C, @d y tendra la buena noticia que aparece la Q@D|pg||

nt|Rafa: hubo un error en la sala|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: Hi all and welcome to the final of the Gold Cup, live from Santiago, Chile.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Although it is obviously cold, 7@d is not straightforward to bid|pg||
mb|4N|nt|barbyh: 4 card majors are not alive and well in the us|pg||
nt|friggi: no but they are in Sweden|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kmb24: not often you have 6/5 in the opps suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: and your pard stays silent|pg||
nt|alamiro: tiene mucho Norte para haber tomada la decision de pasar! 3@h era su mejor opcion, dejando abierta la posibilidad de jugar 3nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  0 or 3 key cards|pg||
mb|7D|nt|barbyh: so I see|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: kib suggested X from soth take-out|pg||
nt|friggi: Acol style|pg||
nt|brobles: Valdes doesn't even consider a club slam, needs perfect spots in front and his stiff @d is not the best holding|pg||
nt|kmb24: cold for 6 now with the amazing layouts|pg||
nt|henryb:  now West must take the chance that East has no more than 2@h, and she has|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|paulg:  Did South really pass?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C a make for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: the 4-0 fit cost 11 imps when they reached 5@C in the other room - did well to make that, I think|pg||
nt|henryb:  5 of either minor makes|pg||
nt|othered1: Good test on gettng to 5@D here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  i know it is light but it is classic distribution |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ady: some like full opening for a take-out double  in case partner has a penalty pass |pg||
nt|ady: 2@C inverted minor raaise|pg||
nt|paulg:  who does a penalty pass of 1@c? :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough problem for West now, perhaps 3@s?|pg||
nt|othered1: But maybe not a tough test|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C doesn't make north's hand look any better|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|paulg:  as we can see, 3@d does not promise considerable extra values|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: 6@C on spade finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  they will bid slam now|pg||
nt|ady: south has an easy lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  At least 4@c kept them out od 3N|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|paulg:  5NT for me, two key cards and a void|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  of course, that would mean I could not count|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  so I'd bid 6@c to show 1-3 and void diamond|pg||
nt|ady: switch to trump or J@D|pg||
nt|othered1: Put this hand into a matchpoints setting and you'll see lots of NS minuses in 3N|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  declarer has several options, actually - short @d K, for instance, before rely on @s finess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  but at the table, in reality, he rather goes down, unfortunately|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, a pretty good slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  GIB would run the @sJ of course|pg||

nt|brobles: I wouldn't be very happy to double 6@c and then go -990 on that board :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: just have to lead a diamond to beat 6nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: yes, he was|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2hts the limit on this hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@h or 6N, even 6@s by North are all good contracts|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kmb24: more action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: yes it is|pg||
nt|barbyh: but how do they get there|pg||
nt|henryb:  The key is for N to play it to protect the @dK|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kmb24: 1@c joker|pg||
nt|brobles: Let's see if NS can get to slam after this light 1st seat opening by Joaquin|pg||
nt|kmb24: I think plaut bids 3nt every time it's his turn|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@C can be beaten last hand   so if south had been more active they may have saved some imps|pg||
nt|friggi: they dont :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: not playng forcing nt also|pg||
mb|4N|nt|friggi: no the opening can be very light|pg||
nt|brobles: This was auction was far from science, I definitly disagree with X and 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: 3@D ahora?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chick: good stopping this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: Rubio will consider a slam try in this hand but my guess is that they will stop in 4. |pg||
nt|henryb:  South is feeling a little embarassed by her opening bid now: light on high cards and no aces|pg||
nt|henryb:  But North has her covered -- and should now bid 6N|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kmb24: i think so.. though slam only on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes was planning to bid 1 or 2 spades after the double but I bet he was very prepared for this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: No deberia haber mayor complicaciones en este contrato ! |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|friggi: that has been a rare thing until now:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: pretty big pass|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kmb24: looks like 5h was asking for trump quality|pg||
nt|brobles: Agressive bid by Jack Smith, but somehow Rubio is not buying slam|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|brobles: wasn't*|pg||
nt|henryb:  South almost has to have either KQ sixth of hearts and the @cK or @dA or both the @dA and @cK and something like @hQJxxxx|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kmb24: seems if you're good enough to double and bid, and this happens, you're still good enough to bid|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca will surrender soon :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kmb24: maybe the problem was he wasn't good enough to double and bid the first time|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: yes and aslo 3@c is -1 with 2@d 2@h and 1@c trick to the defence|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: good session for Peking|pg||
mc|13|nt|henryb:  South should have cashed the other three hearts before the spades, coming down to stiff @dK and @cA8|pg||

nt|paulg:  very nicely played to maximise his chances|pg||
nt|paulg:  a successful operation ... but the patient died|pg||
nt|henryb:  Given the overcall, wouldn't you think that four diamonds in the E hand is more likely than four with West?|pg||
nt|othered1: yes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: we start in this room with boards 11 and 12   and then revert back to board 1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks..|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: Strong club from both pairs|pg||
nt|ady: 3Nt  a make for e/w|pg||
mb|2N|mb|4H|nt|henryb:  3N makes E-W, but five of a minor is more likely, and the nasty minor suit breaks doom either, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: NS are playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|santyclz: So to speak...|pg||
nt|daman: reminds me of my youth|pg||
nt|daman: and my days plaing canape|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: a @D lead would have caused a problem|pg||
nt|daman: still    this hand is not chopped liver|pg||
nt|santyclz: A major advantage is the dearth of information given to the opps.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||

nt|ady: looks|pg||
nt|ady: I doubt it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb:  A @s shift is necessary to beat 5@c, though not 6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: Can't west survive by playing @D very carefully (trumping @H for entries)?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: not the switch that hurt|pg||
nt|othered1: but here west in 6 has simpler plays to make|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|paulg:  ten tricks now|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably East overbid since North showed short @d with his 3@d bid|pg||

nt|kmb24: especially if south's hand is a normal super accept for them|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h down 1 is an excellent result since 5@c (or 5@d) is cold for E-W|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2N|nt|brobles: NS aiming for normal 10 tricks (maybe 11 if hearts are untouched) in no trumps|pg||

nt|Rafa2: En paralelo se juega un torneo invitacional de 6 equipos con estas mismas manos|pg||

nt|Rafa2: El equipo Severin se tituló campeón, 2do Alti, el 3er puesto no ha terminado|pg||
mb|5H|nt|chick: seems like this session has had a lot of flatish partscore hands, not very exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: i don't really get the double|pg||
nt|brobles: odd double if it's meant for penalty|pg||
nt|kmb24: whatever double means, he surely doesn't have that!|pg||
nt|kmb24: i'm betting on plaut bidding 3N, since he always bids 3n.|pg||
nt|kmb24: but i would pass the double|pg||
nt|brobles: so far has worked out fine|pg||
nt|brobles: me too, I'm really happy if partner doubles 2@s and I have North's hand|pg||

nt|kmb24: hi tez|pg||

pc|c3|nt|friggi: you are very right Cornelia|pg||
nt|friggi: not the best lead|pg||
nt|barbyh: dont think it much matters 4 on any lead|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca must be like: THANK YOU PARTNER|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: n/s unable to keep in the bidding   have 10 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|kmb24: i'm a big fan of bidding 1@h on the south cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|friggi: decl is forced to take the Ace|pg||
nt|friggi: could be|pg||
nt|kmb24: good lead though|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after this  honours on N easy to drop @cK|pg||
nt|brobles: me too, if you're not worth a game forcing it's better to always look for your major fit|pg||
nt|kmb24: now the defense knows a little more... this time doesn't make any difference|pg||
nt|tez: if hand is weak first majors|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@c would in fact make after a non-spade lead|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|alamiro: Este set se esta dando de una manera favorable para el equipo schnetzer!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: e/w  may make 10 here  and possibly 11 dropping K@C|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: but know decl has not problems|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|brobles: with this lead declarer is likely to take 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|nt|friggi: now|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|brobles: let's see the good side of this: it will surely set some action for the remaining 13 boards :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: lets hope|pg||
nt|brobles: I think Paca claimed already|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|daman: the @H 10 in dummy would have kept me away from Playing that suit|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 4@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  lead-directing 1@s overcall|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: Not easy for South to cope with the natural 2@C opening here|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  i guess 2@c shows 5@h with inv+ values ... some like to distinguish between 5@h and 6@h|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|nt|daman: I would have raised as East at my first opportunity|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even harder if West had been able to make a weak raie on the previous round|pg||
nt|othered1: good example of use of "creeping" STayman (aka Garbage Stayman)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  i swap bids around when the suits are touching, but not in this sequence (so 1@c-(1@s)-2@d=hearts, 2@h=diamonds)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  the advantage is that you can get major-suited hands into the auction with fewer points|pg||

nt|ralfwil: pass from N with @sKQ and @dA....|pg||
nt|henryb:  Do you all want commentary?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: In the round robin Caracci beat the Rubio team 42-28 imps (19-11 vps), and 50% of the difference is the carryover|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: what to bid Ralf    2@S?|pg||
nt|henryb:  would you bid over 1N? I would not, because my defense is so good|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: This is the last board of this session, next one starts in about 10 minutes|pg||
nt|henryb:  then after 2@d (transfer) by S, 2@h by N I would bud 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kmb24: that's a huge hand for 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@h I assume was a "negative free bid", e.g not forcing|pg||

nt|alamiro: 3@D ahora, preguntando por 3 cartas en @S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|friggi: lets hope it will be more fun|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: A big thanks to our excellent operator, Staffan Hed!  Good job, Staffan :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I´m so oldfashioned, so I had bid 3@d - one round forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is somewhat surprising that South would not make a negative double instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and I would certainly not bid over 2@s with the E hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  West, I mean|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: overboard here|pg||

nt|paulg:  the club slam on  10 was a flat board, down one, but South did make the thin takeout double which would have given East a better chance of making the contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbk: south went out and north explained 2d as natural|pg||

nt|ady: looks like 500   on a part score hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  (mikesl on BBO)|pg||

nt|paulg:  wasn't it clear to duck the spade switch?|pg||
nt|ady: could also have got 500 forcing east trumps|pg||
nt|ady: ducking the spade would certainly have been better if north continues hearts  but  club switch would then lead to same 500|pg||
nt|paulg:  going up with the @SA seems to guarantee -500 on likely defence anyhow |pg||

nt|kmb24: avoid some rebid problems|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N looks likely and cold for E-W. No traps in the play|pg||
nt|henryb:  In fact 6N can be made on the layout|pg||
nt|henryb:  two extra tricks in @h, then a diamond-spade squeeze on South.|pg||
nt|henryb:  But no one would do that at imps|pg||
nt|henryb:  break?|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes, Israel isn't here|pg||

nt|vugraphzja: Israel is back!|pg||
nt|henryb:  to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  although not to reach a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  a @d guess for 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: Probablemente 3@c sea el contrato final en esta mano!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|brobles: Smith not getting involved vulnerable on those cards|pg||
nt|kmb24: looked hard to end anywhere but 3n here, but this will shake things up|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: i would open 1@s:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: i would get involved with south's hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d shows a weak 2 in either suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: paca will pass with a smile and be disappointed with dummy's trumps|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|kmb24: and west was close to an invite|pg||
nt|henryb:  You might persuade West to break @d by winning the @h lead, drawing two rounds of trump; then ruffing your @h loser and playing a club to your J|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|kmb24: good he didn't|pg||

pc|sA|nt|henryb:  I think 3N is an underbid with the E hand -- the heart holding is awfully good on the auction|pg||

nt|paulg:  may be helped by NS bidding spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|paulg:  East will always be concerned about trump quality|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S looks some sort of save|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@s may be enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|paulg:  tough for West with no first round controls|pg||
nt|ady: with those excellent hearts west likely to go to 6 level|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: but great cards for east|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|chick: North is being very brave with his broken 11 and 3 losing hearts|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  5@d a sort of last train effort, but well bid by EW|pg||
nt|ady: well bid  |pg||
nt|ady: 100 honors as well|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d may not have been splinter, perhaps some form of raise?|pg||
nt|paulg:  honors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: any comment on east's 3@H?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Marius, our excellent operator, tells me that East was uncertain about the meaning of 3@d|pg||
nt|chick: also pretty brave|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: rubber bridge for some    4 of top 5 honors in trump suit   woth 100 pts|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ady: worth|pg||
mb|5H|nt|paulg:  which explains his 6@d grand slam try!|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I guess it's safe if methods don't allow opponents to bury you in 3@HX.  But it also won't help partner on lead . . . |pg||

mb|p|nt|kmb24: this one i like 1@s|pg||
nt|tez: if my suit is not very strong and my pd and i have an agreement of not asking 5 cards major to 1 nt i bid 1 nt|pg||
nt|brobles: maybe EW stop in 5@s on this one after finding out that 2 KCs are missing|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kmb24: i bet they stop in 4|pg||
nt|kmb24: and make 6|pg||
nt|brobles: This is the live camera link for this table: http://www.bridgesantiago.cl/vugcam|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@d is certainly a good contract to reach as the diamond finesse makes it cole|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|tez: 1@s 2@h 2@s 4@s?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brobles: 4@s will have no trouble in this hand. I wouldn't bid game directly with Rafa's hand over 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: 3nt era el mejor contrato!|pg||
nt|alamiro: Va necesitar mucho cuidado para cumplir este contrato!|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brobles: Paca likely to splinter now|pg||
nt|henryb:  cold*|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kmb24: they're a little more fond of their hands then you are Tez|pg||
nt|kmb24: i would|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|tez: brave bid 4@d with minimum hand|pg||
nt|kmb24: i don't like 4@d for a lot of reasons|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  on the other hand, if you are going to bid 6@d, 7@d is only a little worse. so perhaps you shoudl try that at the state of the match|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brobles: I think East's hand is pretty good but I wouldn't bypass that club control|pg||
nt|kmb24: exactly|pg||
nt|kmb24: when he skips clubs it's hard to know about a control there|pg||
nt|kmb24: e/w aren't a regular partnership, but they might have had time to discuss something like serious  or non serious 3nt|pg||
nt|tez: in my system notes 4@d shows singleton @d:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  For what it is worth, I think East should rebid 1N, not 2@c. He has a balanced hand, and 2@c should almost always show a six card suit|pg||
nt|jam11: buen remate de isabel |pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|henryb:  are we stuck?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  One of the problems with key card blackwood is that North does not know whether South has @dAK, @dA/@cA, or @dK/@cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|brobles: Declarer will probably take only one heart finesse|pg||

nt|tez: danger @s shift..no @h stoper|pg||

nt|othered1: partner show a major|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|paulg:  EW play Walsh, so East's 1@d denies a major if a weak hand|pg||

nt|brobles: Pacareu will definitly show his clubs after a stayman bid|pg||

nt|henryb:  in which case 3@h is a game try in @s|pg||
nt|henryb:  with no reference to @h|pg||
mb|5D|nt|brobles: Plaut will at least try after this match|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: very good spots|pg||
nt|kmb24: hard choice now by west|pg||
nt|kmb24: rafa serving up 500 just in case plaut wants that instead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kmb24: maybe 800|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  three rounds of @h or a spade shift at trick two will beat this|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kmb24: such a big fit, but all his cards unknown value|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|brobles: Did he really win the 9?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kmb24: paca!|pg||
nt|kmb24: some wires crossed there|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|nt|brobles: Nice auction so far, and after 4@c they certainly both know that they are in clubs|pg||
nt|kmb24: i guess they lead 4th best...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kmb24: i wouldn't have bid 4@c on paca's hand, but looks like they're unstoppable now|pg||
nt|henryb:  leading anything but a @h now will let it make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kmb24: sry 5th best|pg||
nt|kmb24: and rafa assumed he had 5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brobles: don't know about the club queen though|pg||
nt|brobles: It looks like West should have taken control|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d is natural for me..3@h is showing @c support here|pg||
nt|kmb24: also seems like 4@s is normal, when all you have is aces let your partner do the keycarding...|pg||
nt|kmb24: now he doesn't know anything baout partner's clubs|pg||
nt|brobles: Pacareu must be regretting the key card bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kmb24: for sure|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|tez: undo:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: chicken backwood!|pg||

nt|kmb24: not very well thought out, should have found a way home after the power start.  now they even lose imps to 3nt!|pg||
nt|brobles: so Rubio will have a big pick up chance here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kmb24: he hasn't played enough with paca to know 3 is more likely than 5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|ady: many prefer to overcall with a decent 5 card suit   and double later if partner quite|pg||
nt|paulg:  that is my style|pg||
nt|ady: double may place the red aces as the opening lead has revealed AK clubs with north|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is a little aggressive, when the hearts may be over you. 3@d game try probably better|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|paulg:  if you held four spades and, say, @hAQ then that is not enough to double?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|chick: I don't care for the 2@S bid either|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: with pushy preempts, this is the type of contract you'll get to, not one you'd plan to bid yourself NV (needing to hold majors to 2 losers)|pg||

nt|Rafa: Thanks all for coming, and thanks a lot to Sofia, our great vugraph operator for an excellent job|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brobles: I would bid 2@d and over 2@h I would try 3@c|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brobles: Nice bid by Rafa, bulnerable and with good cards|pg||
nt|brobles: vulnerable*|pg||
nt|kmb24: i might just bid 2n on that start   i want to play 3n from my side.|pg||
nt|kmb24: and i want to stop in 2n if pard is broke|pg||

nt|kmb24: interesting choice int eh play here now.  looks like spades are 4-4, so maybe it's right to cash A/K@d and play on clubs if the Q didn't fall.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|brobles: They both took the shot after missing a slam and they will get their prize|pg||
