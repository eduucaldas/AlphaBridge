mb|2D|an| |nt|kiwi_joker: South shouldnt be condemned too harshly .. he didnt know about the "diamond surprise" awaiting him; and the fact pd held K@S|pg||
nt|petergill: More likely, the bidding really might be Pass Pass 1NT P 3NT|pg||

nt|petergill: This is the last match of the qualifying rounds. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If if it is played by E (mosty unlikely), declarer can counter a club lead by ducking twice..and the major suit kings are ideally placed for him|pg||

nt|petergill: good bridge is to avoid distraction and focus on being "at the table".|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the more psychological hangnails you can get the, picking, the more chance for distraction:)|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|andyv:  I agree...if they simply let multi to be played all the time, players would eventually learn how to deal with it...all conventions take some time for the public to accept|pg||
nt|petergill: PO is right in theory, but in practice virtually nobody (except me, who gets laughed at when he does so) ever alerts the Pass that shows 6 spades. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bailey's lead over Neill for 4th spot is down to 7 VPs now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Hoffman can gain 5 imps on board 22, they will win this set|pg||

nt|petergill: excellent results in recent years, so Neill has good players in their team. |pg||

nt|petergill: As Jamie just pointed out, Bailey has finished play and has taken 4th place. |pg||
