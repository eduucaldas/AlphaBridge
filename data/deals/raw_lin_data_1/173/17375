mb|p|mb|1D|nt|rodal f: 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Style. I use 3@H as single and @S support|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was on my to say: If EW bid after 3@C they'r might down. |pg||
nt|davestern2: Hi all from the venue|pg||
nt|davestern2: Looks like a 4@S 5!/5@D battle here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: every once in a blue moon, a 3-level preempt bears a faint resemblance to the associated poster child|pg||

mb|1C|nt|davestern2: The 16 imps is the carry forward prescribed by tthe finishing order in the Round Robin. As pointed out this is somewhat inequitable as Klinger beat Brown twice in the RR|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Daniel and specs:)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rodal f: A interesting hand NS but a spot to become I belive|pg||

nt|ianmcc: odd|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Welcome all|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Rodal, hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|vugrapha1: just been informed that the running score incorner is incorrect|pg||
nt|davestern2: A heart lead would be bad|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but 17 would be even...worse|pg||
nt|davestern2: No major will be a disappointment to North of course|pg||

nt|davestern2: This hand is a good cup of coffee hand \_/?|pg||

nt|hoffers: Both pairs play standard.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|davestern2: Not often partner overcalls a diamond and you hold KQ109x|pg||
nt|davestern2: the @C9 at trick one made the hand a lot less scary for declarer|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ianmcc: dilemme - set up a club and weaken dummy|pg||

mb|4C|nt|davestern2: Mr Richman sitting behind me is not enamored of the 4@C bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: X=3@S|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Nice 4@S for EW here, even with two cards (K@S and A@D) offside|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: comment about running score was on advice from fellow operator... so not sure what's going on..|pg||
nt|davestern2: West will raise|pg||
nt|davestern2: We suspect|pg||
nt|hoffers: Having a stop (especially over 1@c) is going out of fashion|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Two colored by S and a nice end EW |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: +2 next|pg||

mb|p|nt|davestern2: Lead suggestions|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: N/S win the race to 1NT.  |pg||
nt|mrdct: @d to A and @s back might test declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: And also down if no @D lead but turn|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: aha, got caught by the old "operator undo" trick  :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr 4@S|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|davestern2: Oops|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: and*|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On hands like this, it often pays to declare rather than defend.  Defending is so much harder|pg||
nt|mrdct: with east having some holes in his @d suit, north might play him for the @sA for the vul overcall at the 3-level|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mrdct: although the counter arguement could be that with @DAQ and @SA he might've made a 2-level overcall|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: But first trick can't be right if 4@S ans S to lead.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Normal lead at 4@S is @H and if S turn @D? 10.     Can be a IMP in EW here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|davestern2: That undo caught me unaware|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mrdct: as happens more often than not, richman gets it right|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Not that it's easy to reach.  West's minor suit 10s are gold|pg||

pc|s3|nt|rodal f: It was a ask by biddig tempo.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D from me. WHY?|pg||
nt|hoffers: At last a hand of interest. KH have done well to bid game. Now Ron needs to get clubs right|pg||

nt|noodle:  with 18 5-5 and finding a fit momentum will be high for S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But perhaps a better hope was simply that the short clubs were with the 3-card spades|pg||
nt|davestern2: If opps get to five minor NS will have their work cut out needing to pick up @HQ9|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, this one is easy for everyone.  East has the short hearts, so finesse through him.  What could be simpler?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: S safing in|pg||
nt|hoffers: At risk of playing in 33 spades|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h could be 2 down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: 4@C spilinter=max one|pg||
nt|noodle:  S learnes he's off 2 key cards  :P|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The right contract here is 3NT, but it's unlikely to be reached.  No harm will be done in 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West has the short hearts ...|pg||
nt|davestern2: Agree and it is likely.........|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I doubt Smolanko will let them play it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: So S mean that N at vul 3@C don't have cards? X 100 by 100 times from me.|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 9 or 10 tricks. If @S lead 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: But ain't easy from AKXX|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|chilloncan: 6H is not a hopeless spot, a priori spade lead is likely thn just need 32 hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: Seems as 14-03 is on. I mean it is better then 03-14 by asking asses|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: that's a tad high on this one  :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hi there Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the ACBL "printed defence" is a joke - it makes the Multi look like a major weapon that requires pages of defence, when in reality the Multi 2@d is a popgun that requires 2 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3 lines of defence. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: board 22 was fowled getting replayed now|pg||
nt|andyv:  we've gone thru this board a couple of times|pg||
nt|po-s: WBF says everything conveying a message should be alerte "unless it can be reasonably expected to be understood by the opponent" Hmm|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah, that's about it|pg||
nt|davestern2: Thats the real value|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I think you need to keep going with 7@D|pg||
nt|davestern2: 4@S a bit unlucky here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so would be 4@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: bobby's correct guess in @s on board 3 yielded 10 imps|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: Fun to come? |pg||
nt|rodal f: U are for shure correct by the result Daniel, but looked like a -1|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chilloncan: there is another thing too....when opps are in mere game and they would have made slam on any lead but club, you for sure dont want to lead a club. and a trump lead is the one that ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: will make them most wistfuyl of all|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: How to bid this by best control?|pg||
nt|rodal f: That intervention made it hard for E but easy for W|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nice logic... psyching the opps out....|pg||
nt|davestern2: Send more chips to table 2 please|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@S  is pretty interesting to play ... |pg||
nt|davestern2: Vwery but should fail on a heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Should it?  Might not a safety play be a good idea in spades?  Cash the ace?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it's much harder on a diamond lead though|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c lead need to beat 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: South shouldnt be condemned too harshly .. he didnt know about the "diamond surprise" awaiting him; and the fact pd held K@S|pg||
nt|petergill: More likely, the bidding really might be Pass Pass 1NT P 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, North will lead a heart and 3NT should make comfortably|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last match of the qualifying rounds. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If if it is played by E (mosty unlikely), declarer can counter a club lead by ducking twice..and the major suit kings are ideally placed for him|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: cards are wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: Four teams qualify for tomorrow's semi-finals, then the Grand Final is on Sunday|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a bit work to do also for EW|pg||
nt|petergill: 6 teams in the field - 2 are about to get knocked out|pg||
nt|petergill: Team Bailey is running 4th and one of the favoured teams - Neill - is 5th|pg||

nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/2011/spo/cards/Anderson-Smolanko.pdf|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: I belive Anderson will go for it now. The slam in @H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: wd|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: My point being that Multi 2@d is feared in America due to the length (and existence) of the written defence they provide, which does more harm than good, given that the main aim of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: good bridge is to avoid distraction and focus on being "at the table".|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the more psychological hangnails you can get the, picking, the more chance for distraction:)|pg||
nt|davestern2: Well that discussion was all a waste of time|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...if they simply let multi to be played all the time, players would eventually learn how to deal with it...all conventions take some time for the public to accept|pg||
nt|petergill: PO is right in theory, but in practice virtually nobody (except me, who gets laughed at when he does so) ever alerts the Pass that shows 6 spades. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bailey's lead over Neill for 4th spot is down to 7 VPs now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Hoffman can gain 5 imps on board 22, they will win this set|pg||
nt|po-s: I certainly do, particularly against unknown opponents who may never have heard of Mult...|pg||
nt|davestern2: Bill have you spotted a super safety play for this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5? what was X?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The $64 question, that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Clearly, E/W have had an agreement malfunction|pg||
nt|ianmcc: support?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: I'm told Anderson explained X as "takeout"|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: Sr. Christie came as a frech wind.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B2 NS fighted to there max 3@S and got a doubble score 6IMP.|pg||
nt|petergill: Neill has 3 boards to gain 7 VPs, with Bailey having one board to go before they (?) qualify. |pg||
nt|petergill: It will be a major surprise if Neill fails to qualify. Neill and Gumby were both in the 2007 Aussie Open Team that came 5th in the world, and Lavings - Krochmailk have had ...|pg||
nt|petergill: excellent results in recent years, so Neill has good players in their team. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Thanks all, thats it for today|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Semi finals tomorrow, in 17 hours time roughly|pg||
nt|super nova: Neill is 20-10 up against Klinger.|pg||
nt|super nova: If he gets a 25 he will miss out by 1 vp.|pg||
nt|petergill: As Jamie just pointed out, Bailey has finished play and has taken 4th place. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone - Brown will surely choose to play Bailey (with 16 imp carry-forward)  with Hoffman facing a tough task against Klinger in tomorrow's semis. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Thanks Peter|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: We're closing now ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Amy for a good job, and thanks to convener David Stern and the ABF|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: By the interrupt from NS it was hopless for EW to find the 6@H. Only one quest left. S ask to N after 6@DX|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No amount of safety playing helps this one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nasty hand, but this should come home with the help of a 3-3 break in a black suit|pg||
nt|hoffers: KH use a 54321 count for NTs, so sometimes they will open 1NT outside the 15-17 range|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|davestern2: Ah sorry Ian I see support for diamonds|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: This contract will not be blessed by success, but it's hard to criticize the auction |pg||
nt|chilloncan: Klinger torn no doubt. between the spadish orientation of the hand, and the 9cc of hearts which argue for NT. some could use 3H as a choice-ofgames cuebid here (Ed Manfield, Bridge ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: World circa 1981)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's very tricky though - if he ducks a club, for example, and a diamond comes through, he has to decide whether to finesse before he knows that clubs are 3-3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: -5 is 1100 so still ok over 6@H 1430|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: wd by Chan|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: So I guess after drawing trumps, he will play on spades|pg||
nt|hoffers: His pips in spades ensure a second trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah - it's completely safe.  He can claim in fact at this point (not that he will)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: surely west pitched a @c on the @DA|pg||

nt|mrdct: we'll soon find out|pg||
mc|7|nt|bjacobs: For what it's worth (not much), I think Anderson's interpretation is a good one.  3415 shape and a decent hand needs the double|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like we're skipping past Bd 22 in the meantime :)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Enterence good enough to make it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, also it ist really clear from hat S hand that NS belong in game facing only an invitation. but one thing is sure -- exactly 8 tricks at NT is not a sensible target. |pg||

nt|bjacobs: well, it IS the seniors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think we can assume this was natural bidding|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: If Ew bid on, 5@DX would cost 500, or 4@SX cost either 800, 500 or 200 depending on how many ruffs NS get. |pg||
nt|davestern2: Now Bill you will be here soonish I suspect|pg||

pc|h2|nt|chilloncan: W unlikely to get D right i think |pg||

nt|rodal f: An actual bid by -1|pg||

mb|4D|nt|rodal f: 1@H=3card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it's a bit like the earlier hand ... what's the point of playing 2NT?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: most aggressive bid so far here is X|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They are behind screens ... but Ron knows the auction has exploded, because Haughie couldn't bid a non-forcing 4@C then make a grand slam try over 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Not this time:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fortune favours the brave, etc etc|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 8 LTC with miniscule offense to defense ratio|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he's going to have to guess the club suit to make this|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H looks very academioc on this auction|pg||

nt|hoffers: 800 in 6NTs|pg||
nt|po-s: spades is best|pg||
nt|hoffers: but hard to stop there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think Klinger is trying to get back to a semblance of a "fit".  If South has club shortage, then maybe he has a little length in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Meanwhile, perhaps Bill Haughie has woken up to the problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In which case he should pass 6@DX|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So West has 4 hearts, East probably has 5 spades|pg||

nt|bjacobs: or 2443?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@C Daniel?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Mind you, 5@D might be tricky to defeat|pg||
nt|mrdct: as a new partnership south was perhaps a bit worried about how north would've interpreted 2@h at either of his opportuntiies|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|chilloncan: the curious thing is that up to now N has bid pretty conservatively....now he comes out of the closet to make a takeout double on a totally defensive hand....|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: perhaps 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chilloncan: i can live with X also, if consistent with general style. my points were : 1) seeming conflict between this action and previous dossier for N    2) having doubled, N  has no extras|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The swing could certainly go either way on that deal|pg||
nt|hoffers: A pitty since they had gained 25imps before that board|pg||
nt|po-s: Was South really alerted to the meaning of 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Did Larrys Law work?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps West claimed only 9 tricks, not 10, on Bd 24, given that he had 4 losers. |pg||
nt|hoffers: 9 playing tricks, but Lilley just wanted to open 2@c again!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: why not?  System cards are distributed prior to the event as well ... there was plenty of preparation available|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: 2@C= a color      2@D=majors      2@H and @S= Color + minor      2NT=minor       THAT is cappaletti|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On 1), you probably don't have enough data.  Haughie is a pretty "normal"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sort of bridge player.  On 2), I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: very likely right about (1), have only these two sets to go on|pg||
nt|hoffers: Just a memory lapse|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: no doubt|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s will also make with the 3-3 break and K onside|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: 2NT force|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Richman gave  4 no thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: half-way point now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: by time and board  |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: needs to pick the @S position to make this|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: Yes, that swing was a bit of a gift from the Brown team|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: On Bd 22 , 3NT actually made 10 tricks for 630 to EW, so the score is 41-13. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: all comes down to how declarer plays the diamonds, i guess|pg||
nt|petergill: My source is the official scores from the Bridgemates at http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=spo&E=0&T=S&R=10&U=1|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@S min|pg||

nt|bjacobs: They've missed a fine game ... almost laydown |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: if*|pg||
nt|davidstern: THis is more interesting especially on club and return|pg||
nt|mrdct: in 3NT declarer might need to take a view on which M is breaking 3-3 as he may not be able to combine his chances on a @c lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: A low heart to jack may obviate the 3-3 to simply queen onside|pg||
nt|mrdct: true|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c lead looks indicated|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|davidstern: Well that lead is uninspiring|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: Yet another trump lead proving useless|pg||
nt|hoffers: This is optimistic by Lilley (8PTs the way I count)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The hands fit well, but not well enough|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Lilley can't want a slam opposite a passed hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: he can, apparently|pg||
nt|po-s: wanting is easy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: East should switch to clubs for a very good reason ...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the 500 comes back|pg||
nt|hoffers: Provided Ron has @DK for his bid, it is basically 50%|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bless that @h10|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugrapha1: should make now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: to solve his own subsequent problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now if Ron had just led his partner's suit, East would need to find @DQ to make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: More diamonds is best - go passive|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: But of course, against 3@H, who cares|pg||
nt|mrdct: but it does give extra entries to dummy to take the losing option in @h of running the J|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: East has to duck when a diamond is led, as the only chance for the defence is 2 diamond tricks - one @D trick is not enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still ain't down Peter. Ice for @D is the point.|pg||
nt|petergill: so @DQ was not best play|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will pick the @d's now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, Lilley will now know he's basically a goner|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade Jack would also be good|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|davidstern: This will fail now|pg||
nt|mrdct: now @d|pg||

nt|davidstern: ninth|pg||

nt|bjacobs: So 11 tricks, and E/W will be glum|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: If East plays low on the first @D, then declarer's best %age play is to finesse the eight of @D|pg||

nt|mrdct: @CQ!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|davidstern: How silly of me|pg||
nt|davidstern: A spade by south would have tested declarer|pg||
nt|mrdct: he still needs to choose which M hook to take|pg||
nt|kemperg: squeeze|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i think best to cash @HAK and if 10 doesnt drop then @s hook|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: EW got a nice lead so no problems if @S ain't 4-1|pg||

mb|1C|nt|rodal f: NS on for a hard one?|pg||
nt|petergill: The reason East should switch to clubs earlier is to check that partner has @CA, so the defence knows to aim to beat the contract via 2 @d's, 1 @H and 1 @c |pg||
nt|petergill: Neill has taken a 25-11 imp lead over Klinger to be on 133 VPs after 5 boards of Round 10  ref http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=spo&E=0&T=S&R=10&U=5|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ianmcc: the other table has skipped  10|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Assuming no dramatic change in the standings in the next hour, in tomorrow's semi-finals, Brown will choose to play Bailey (not Klinger, Brown can choose between 3rd or 4th)...|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: finally -  10 13 for Brown|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i'm confused - what was the last board?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|nlu: EW are helping here|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|rodal f: There the bancing came wich I was waiting for.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And was sold to the mol!!|pg||
nt|petergill: and Hoffman will play Klinger tomorrow. The carryforwards will be 16 imps to Brown and about 10 imps to Hoffman.|pg||
nt|mrdct: was it board 13?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: N have bidded his hand nearly full out and risk problems if he bid more but no clouds at the sky there:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Klinger will not get + here|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Now S have a clear bid in my eyes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3h=min|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nlu: showing 64 most likely singleton @d but doesn't have much to help|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope:(|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: will start again in 15min (not 30 as scheduled)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: restart 5.30 AEST...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|nlu: this is a less then 15% chance game anyway|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile - brown can pick up a needed swing here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|rodal f: 110 and fin. One @S run at @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: S had no cards wich could help N by a trick???? Unbelivable. HUM|pg||
nt|mrdct: and with the failed 3NT not looking good for klinger this match could be just about square if this makes|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: can't really go wrong here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|rodal f: 1.5 trick S have and N bid freely alone 3@S. |pg||
nt|nlu: not really :) opps forced him to take the last bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Match? or team?|pg||
nt|nlu: you need @h to split @s to be KJ empty ON, very low probability|pg||
nt|nlu: now he is thinking wich finesse to take - last time on the board|pg||
nt|rodal f: N overbidded a bit liked it, but S had (then) a clear 4@S. If it go down it's Ns foult by bidding to hard. Finito for me:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hook the @H or the @S|pg||
nt|nlu: i think by now he knows @dAK and @cK with east|pg||

nt|petergill: Normal for David Anderson to upgrade to 20 -21 (22) with nice long suit and aces, but at other table David Lusk could not upgrade as his 2Nt would be 21-22|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Just on my way to ask Daniel:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D Multi|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mrdct: this might play better in @s than NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S pass or correct|pg||
nt|hoffers: For those who read Ron's column in SMH a few weeks ago, this is an example: continue playing (ie for Q doubleton onside)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petergill: Pass by South = spades - with hearts, South would bid over 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: So 3@S is stopper ask |pg||
nt|mrdct: another word for AKQxxx is "trumps"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3.5 trick seen at defence from W, but nope|pg||
nt|mrdct: east and west might have a competitive auction without NS ever bidding|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: If clubs broke 2-1, 3NT would be o-so-easy ... but not this time|pg||
nt|petergill: Dutch expert Jan Jansma says that it's better for North to respond 2@H (not 2@S) on a hand like this, so that if East bids 3@C, EW do not find out what NS's major is. Jansma likes ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D P 2@s to be natural and nonforcing with long spades. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm! has the multi done its evil work again here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  playing 3-2s requires special skill and temperment|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: oonly game making....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good judgment by North there - not pushing on with a void in his partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Sorry all we are having connectivity problems|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3.5? 3.75|pg||
nt|rodal f: I am wrong by the endings all time. Sorry specs.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thinking: 2@S at vul. S ain't weak so near by opening.|pg||
nt|petergill: George Smolanko, perhaps because he has not often played Multi 2@D himself, got muddled. |pg||
nt|mrdct: @d lead might produce an entry to dummy and a free trick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: Normality prevailed|pg||
nt|mrdct: there it is|pg||
nt|mrdct: still some work to do though|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well, there's still time|pg||
nt|davestern2: Christie should duck|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: A pick up to come for Brown by 5IMP if 110EW 130 make it 6IMP|pg||
nt|andyv:  push board?|pg||
nt|hoffers: Bill has upgraded again, when not justified by 54321 count|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Some top experts disagree with me. I do not believe that every little thing should be alerted - I simply think that after any Pass by a Multi 2@D opener that shows the suit should ...|pg||
nt|petergill: be alerted. Otherwise, those with no familiarity with Multi 2@d (e.g George) are disadvantaged. |pg||
