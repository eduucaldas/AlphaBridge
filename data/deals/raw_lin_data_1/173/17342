nt|woozle: Klinger prefers a very minimum takeout double to a (vile, IMO) 2D overcall or cautious pass|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently this NS pair are measuring their raises with the Losing Trick Count|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I'm more than a little sceptical about the merits of LTC - I've often found that the best way to count losers is to get the people who play LTC, line them up, and count them|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Today, the raise gets the job done - Zollo should have time to try options in hearts and/or clubs before finding out that every diamond honour is onside anyway|pg||

nt|woozle: Ron's reasonable (though almost certainly doomed - partner with 10 cards in hearts+clubs might have bid) attempt to deal out a diamond ruff speeds the play|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|woozle: NS can make 4S with a deft heart guess unless the opponents find a diamond ruff|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|woozle: Klinger's 1D bid is actually hearts...the six card diamond suit is just a distraction|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|woozle: Unusually this time, the hand that Klinger doesn't open isn't an opening hand|pg||

pc|h9|nt|rodal f: S had no cards wich could help N by a trick???? Unbelivable. HUM|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|rodal f: 1.5 trick S have and N bid freely alone 3@S. |pg||
nt|nlu: not really :) opps forced him to take the last bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Match? or team?|pg||
nt|nlu: you need @h to split @s to be KJ empty ON, very low probability|pg||
nt|nlu: now he is thinking wich finesse to take - last time on the board|pg||
nt|rodal f: N overbidded a bit liked it, but S had (then) a clear 4@S. If it go down it's Ns foult by bidding to hard. Finito for me:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hook the @H or the @S|pg||
nt|nlu: i think by now he knows @dAK and @cK with east|pg||
