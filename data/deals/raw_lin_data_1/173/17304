nt|super nova: They say you are supposed to bid 50% slams. This one is below 50.|pg||
nt|super nova: So even though it does make, technically n/s should stay out of it.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|super nova: The chance of having one heart looser is just below 75%.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|super nova: Since either KQ both off side or a really bad break.|pg||
nt|super nova: Then you also need KC on side that is 50%|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i lost connection to BBO, but not the internet|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: So 50% of 74%|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: = 0.5 * 0.74|pg||
nt|adkpt:  you dont need CK, just hearts for 1 loser and spades to come in|pg||
nt|super nova: So it is just below 37%|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i have Duncan from Scotland ..welcome|pg||
nt|adkpt:  6H that is|pg||
nt|adkpt:  hi|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|super nova: Done forget you have to take into account a ruff in spades on the opening lead etc etc|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Duncan is quickly becoming our star commentator :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|adkpt:  yes in 6H there are definitely problems now with insufficient entries to finesse again and enjoy the spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Brad thinking|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: http://vba.asn.au/php/resultsShowRevamp.php?prm=E1308S1&bckPag=home|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: results from yesterday|pg||
nt|adkpt:  so perhaps 6S is the best slam, lots of possibilities especially after non-heart lead|pg||
