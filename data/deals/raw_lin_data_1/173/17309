nt|zyxzewski: they are playing control responses|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but it would be beatable by East, on a heart lead|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: 1@S showed 2 (Ace = 2, King = 1)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they changed the original concept of control responses|pg||
mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: natural i guess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They are the original Blue Club responses|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: they have 1@D as general minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: the 1N openring woudl have been 15-17, so this 1N must be 18+|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|sharkey: However - being Vul not sure|pg||
nt|rv: couple of Ts in addition to 4 card @s has tempted East to bid here as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|zyxzewski: yes, in VUL you are more afraid to miss the game|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: this deal is a curse of vul at IMPs|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: some deduct a point from 4333 hands, but not this West|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and exact replica from CR bidding|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: is there a chance to let it through?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: being VUL nobody deducts :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think so|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: probably only with spade lead|pg||
nt|rv: both East and West would have passed in their earlier turns if white or at MPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everyone upgrades, no-one downgrades|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some say that 2NT can never be the final contract|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I've taken to dropping a point as responder, with 4333 and 8-hcp won't invite, but with the shape of East here would invite|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rv: West also had a case for passing 2n with flat 16 and no intermediates|pg||
nt|rv: but as Roland said, nobody downgrades esp at these colors at IMPs:)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: if 2N is never the ifnal contract, then East does better jsut to bid 3N directly as it tells oppo less and makes a tight double less likely too  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often do you take exactly 8 tricks in 2NT? You more often take them when you are in 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because people overbid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|rv: folks possibly still keep invititational bid to cater to partner opening with upgraded 14:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think at MPs 1 NT wud be the par contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a "you make the final error, partner, bid"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing the buck|pg||
nt|rv: yes at MPs, I will surely pass with East hand, even White at IMPs I might pass missing one of the Ts|pg||
nt|sharkey: Vul wouldn't enter into the picture at MPs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|zyxzewski: i saw somewhere an idea, that when you partner often tends to upgrade good 14 to 15-17, he has more often 14 than 17, because 14 theoretically comes up more frequently than 17|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but I do hate putting down 8 hcp and finding partner had 17 ... I'd always bid|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||

nt|doks: I predict more action this board|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N by EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|doks: 12 tricks in @H for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: not easy to bid 6th level|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|xenya: 6@S would be a good save -- if EW get to slam that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1 perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will require a lot of work|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|xenya: not too likely thery will after this start?|pg||

nt|andyv:  with this vul, E will invite|pg||

nt|kemperg: then its 3|pg||
mb|3N|nt|doks: no cigar|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: right, very tough to bid 6 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  normal @h lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  with the poor lie of the black suits, this should not be a success|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: this is likely to fail|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Absolutely|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW put the pressure on next door...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Estonia and Latvia both are|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They are small nations with a bright future|pg||
nt|sharkey: West's failure to open may prove costly|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: you are very optimistic :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: so, we might be watching some future superstars in these Vu-graph boradcasts|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Yes, N-S are members of the Estonia Open team|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I was going to say that 4@S had some work to do but this lead makes it a lot easier|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: That did so well in Ostend last sunmmer, reaching stage 2|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sharkey: South's 4@S is ok playing Precision or strong 1@C opener and shut EW out of the bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: as North is limited|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzbn: sorry, something is wrong|pg||
mc|11|nt|rv: @c lead possibly best for defense where declarer may need to tackle red suits prematurely, else declarer can draw 3 rounds of @s before tackling @ds|pg||

nt|andyv:  W line of play was reasonable...to play to k@c, strip hand down as much as possible with @d suit and hope NS make a carding error is a bit much to hope for.|pg||
mb|2C|an|precision|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|doks: ok, next board|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|doks: NS will find @C fit|pg||
nt|xenya: asomewhat thin overcall, but no other choice perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c not for the faint of @h....even if you are playing precision|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  this can get very expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: now N is in a quandary|pg||
pc|cK|nt|doks: @D guess in first trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  W got away with murder|pg||
nt|kemperg: was N afraid of something??|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably because his dbl was so shape oriented and has little defense|pg||
nt|kemperg: N did enough by dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  no argument here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|xenya: 10 easy tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Other top pairs play 1@D as 0+ cards. Grøtheim-Tundal of Norway for example, 4405 shape is 1@D for them|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Back to board 30 for a minute. Maybe the invitational hand should double, then correct 3@H to 3@S. If partner can jump over the double, you probably make 4@S. That leaves 4@D as ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the strong hand with spade support|pg||

nt|rv: most partnerships play lebensohl only on 2@d and above Interference|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: this could be a natural 2N and a 3@C checkback, but then why didn't S bid 3@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|zyxzewski: although in that case S should continue with 3@S (which creates a huge problem for Levenko)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: W opening guarantees 6-card suit|pg||

nt|pjs_ch: and good mornign from Patrick|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: Hi Carl, Venky|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: you can find all the rankings on http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK11/VK11.htm, but the top is 1. Druva 321,5; 2. Rakvere 305,5; 3. Starmen 292; 4. Ekspromt 276|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: NS play a strong club system IIRC, so 1@D is a catch all with no 5 card major to show|pg||
mb|2S|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S are members of the Estonia Open team, a very successful one over the past 4-5 years|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: those 4 teams still have a chances for medals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Making it to the knockout stage at the European Championships|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Strong jump shift - a rarity nowadays|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: so now we have current leaders (Druva) and title holders from last year (Eksprompt) here|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks like easy 11 tricks in spades here|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: here are cc for NS: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/Konv/levenkosester.pdf|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and here for EW: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/Konv/rummel.pdf|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: the format is 8 teams triple round robin, two last will be relegated, and we are playing the 5th match of the final round now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will be starting with boards 31 and 32 in this room, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 17|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: the first un-alerted bid, and the final contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@C probably relay - 4@C shows?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|zyxzewski: Both pairs are playing some version of Estonian Beach Diamond - so 1@C is strong and artificial, 1@D contains most of the opening hands without 5-card major (for NS ALL opening ...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: hands without 5-card major)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: by their cc - 2NT = min, 3@C was relay and 4@C promised either xxxx or Hxx|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: the 2N bid showed a minimum hand, so N must have been looking for something very specific to get a slam out of this|pg||

pc|s8|pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: not much needed - @HK instead of @HQ wud give slam a play|pg||

pc|c3|pc|d8|mc|11|nt|zyxzewski: but i'm not familiar with their methods|pg||

mb|2H|nt|pjs_ch: nice slam to get to here |pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes, they have played together for about 5 years for now and Levenko likes to work with his system|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: not so easy when oppo start the bidding |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Let's see what they can achieve here - minor suit slams sometimes hard to bid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: if Levenko would have stretched and doubled, then maybe, but now i don't believe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Hard for N to evaluate - 3 NT can be a varity of hands|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: the pre-empt will have done its job nicely here; N won't expect a long running suit from S given his holdings|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pjs_ch: but very hard ot investigate|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: well, that may give him a little interest, but probably it's just strong and balanced (about 20), because Levenko can see, Sester has no running suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: good point Lauri|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: nice practical bid by Sester - usual rule is to give partner 7 fairly balanced points after opponents pre and bid accordingly|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 9 top tricks and a 10th when the diamonds behave; not sure what declarer will do in clubs|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: here even less can be enough, if they are in right place (i.e in clubs)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: as the winning play finesses into the danger hand|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: he gets the count|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
