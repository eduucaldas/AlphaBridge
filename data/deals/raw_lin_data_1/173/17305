nt|Walddk7: Hello Sveta and David|pg||
nt|ady: slam to start     6NT by North as good as any|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Marius, greetings to the spectators|pg||
nt|ady: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Roland and David|pg||
nt|vugraphzbk: second half starting now:)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@D  strong 2   usually either balanced  above 2NT opening  or 8+ tricks in any suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N should be happy to know partner has invitational values|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT confirmed balanced type  around 23-24|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can understand S's problem - if partner has @h fit, 7 may be possible, if not - just a small slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: words cannot express how I feel about that 2@H bid|pg||
nt|daman: this is like playing at the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: they get about 1.25 imp per board so there is a difference in playing strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|chick: EW sure have the balance of points, but 4@S may still be hard to set|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: it might be described as frisky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: in sweden we have a national handicap|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: and we add this for all four players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: around 33  34 between them  but KQX hearts minimum to consider grand slam    |pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: but you need to have standards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: then we take the difference between the two teams and we get a handicap|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. why not?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: SOunds interesting - probaby more accurate than accumulated master points|pg||
nt|ady: if south can establish hearts as trumps fit  then rkc can establish quality of norths hearts   and find the queen is missing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now N should know - @h Q is missing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|nt|ady: 6NT  better than 6 hearts|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|daman: good auction to get to 5@C in the CR|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: this lead would have meant 12 tricks on top in 6NT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|ady: best to cash K@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and for GIB - grand is better :) - bridge software always pick such a @h suit right for 5 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  hello Paul|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: the handicap is base on all pairs tournament a player plays. Not optimal but the onlye way wwe got ;)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: if 10 or queen dont appear cross to south and play low heart|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|chick: hi henry|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: nice safety by North|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, an example of safety play to notice |pg||

nt|brobles: This is actually Joaquin Pacareu's first deal of hands of the tournament, right in the final :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: 600 is a huge result|pg||
nt|brobles: The team Caracci won the Round Robin, and had a confortable win in the semifinals over a women team that has played for the Chilean Women team a couple of times|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brobles: Time to start comparing results finally|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: may also get to game here   |pg||
nt|kmb24: another 22 point game|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: The Team Rubio has also played the event mostly 4 handed and had a very tough semifinal match against the RIOS team|pg||
nt|tez: undo pls|pg||
nt|kmb24: they're playing the board backwards|pg||
nt|tez: this is no real|pg||
nt|kmb24: paca did in fact open 1@H|pg||
nt|tez: different hand i thk:)|pg||
nt|brobles: I think NS play 2@d as a constructive weak 2 in a M (8-11 points)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass would be a good choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: East west playing in 2 hearts, not sure who is who and who has what though :)|pg||
nt|tez: check pls vugraph operator|pg||
nt|kmb24: it's the right hand, the board is just rotated |pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|brobles: Vugraph operator tells me that West has east cards, so they put the board the other way round|pg||
nt|tez: not right hand|pg||
nt|brobles: So Paca is playing 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: north is dealer|pg||
nt|brobles: the auction was not like this, they just put the contract|pg||
nt|tez: he cant pass|pg||
nt|brobles: so Joaquin Pacareu is playing 2@h (as WEST)|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|tez: yes means?|pg||
nt|kmb24: the board is right, the hands are all in the opposite spots|pg||
nt|henryb:  thinking as North is an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 1@s pass 1nt 2@h all pass may be|pg||
nt|brobles: so 3@h shows a minimum heart bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: there is in my opinion a big difference between a 3- or 4-card support, so 2@h is enough for me as E on previous board|pg||
nt|chick: or perhaps 3@C showing 3 card support and let pard decide|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cornelia and Friggi|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Everyone :)|pg||
nt|brobles: You can watch this table live through this link: http://www.bridgesantiago.cl/vugcam|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: 3NT  has a play  on a liekly club lead|pg||
nt|friggi: hello|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzwd: well hello Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hej Staffan @H@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We'll get layer names up soon|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Staffan's pc is a bit slow|pg||
nt|brobles: but that will not stop Juan Pablo :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kmb24: most pairs these days do it the other way, 2d a bad weak 2 and 2M a good one.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzja: I'm sorry |pg||
nt|henryb:  np|pg||
nt|henryb:  at all. you have the toughest job in bridge and you are doing very well|pg||
mc|10|nt|henryb:  South is not unhappy with developments|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have thought 120|pg||
nt|henryb:  but it makes no nevermind|pg||
nt|henryb:  he really cannot go down|pg||
pg||

nt|daman: my Mother would open the east hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Shouldn't think he will ...|pg||
nt|daman: 2 1/2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even I would open this one|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Another potential slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Indeed; too little of that world wide|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|paulg:  i think this will be difficult to avoid given South's controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Survived.  Didn't get a 2@d response.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Wanted a 2@H response to give him a shot|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  just a little too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|chick: bad trump suit will kill this|pg||
nt|chick: hi Ed :)|pg||
nt|chick: although that lead didn't help the defense very much|pg||
nt|henryb:  For what its worth, I would either pass over 1@h (remember when you needed 6 points to respond?) or raise to 2@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: I would not pass up the chance to show a 4 card spade suit when I had an A plus something, and backup support for hearts|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  North very unhappy on this lead|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or maybe they had to hit clubs sooner?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|henryb:  I think she has to hope for 3-2 hearts with the K onside and that she can negotiate a club ruff|pg||
nt|chick: however, I'd stop in 3@H in this auction|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
mc|6|nt|sfoxa:  but slam needs very carefull declarer play|pg||
pg||

nt|ralfwil: weak or multi|pg||
nt|brobles: Huge result from the Open Room|pg||
nt|kmb24: went something like pass-1@h-1@s-2@c-p-2@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  or rather should not|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: sorry, my error again|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: most systems have ups and downs|pg||
nt|kmb24: back to normal|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kmb24: i might try 1n in third seat on that|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  7 of either minor is pretty good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south might balance|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room chose to double 1@d.  i really prefer 1N|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt with singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: ok for me.np:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: prefer 1N with singleton over t/o double with one!|pg||
nt|kmb24: the other room's result is huge.  game on every hand!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|friggi: light opening|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C 2@H should end it|pg||
nt|brobles: I would probably bid 1@h at the table, would be a little scared of 1N red white with a PH partner. 1N looks still reasonable to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S from west shows decent hearts|pg||
nt|chick: very light, even by my standards :)|pg||
nt|tez: 20 point game|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kmb24: not sure what's the plan with 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think S should bid 4@h, a splinter and not 4D|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: balance chancy  as west could be shortin spades   possibly singleton and a good defensive hand|pg||
nt|ady: this looks cedrtainly down 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I see it -1 or -2|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to that:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: found a home|pg||
nt|brobles: I don't know what Smith was planning over 2@d but he should definitly pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Very interesting hand to lead from. You sure know one thing - you donÂ´t want to lead :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: unless he had 2@s available to show 4@s and longer minor, nf|pg||
mb|6D|nt|friggi: W signs off with 10 points!?|pg||
nt|chick: He's probably seen his partner's openers :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|friggi: that is the only fair clue to make from this |pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Well, their agreement before was that East may do light openings and bids, while West makes sure he covers up for his partner.. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: not much here.  took a heart lead to let this one slip though.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|friggi: but 3NT would have been super here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chick: I like it, I should make that agreement with some of my partners :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: If declarer finess in @c - 3 rounds of @s, setting up a @d trick and one trick in front for the defence for -2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Its only 5 impsdifference between 1390 and 2140|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: sry @d of course|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brobles: well 2@c certainly worked out very well as 2@h will not have trouble|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|mc|13|nt|henryb:  or 4 rather, 14 vs 18|pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SA875HKDQJT2CQ986,SJ32H954D74CAT754,ST96HAQ2DK986CKJ2,SKQ4HJT8763DA53C3|sv|e|nt|ady: this time 20-20|pg||
nt|ady: south may play 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Then you need some pretty rigid rules to avoid playing those nasty Moysean (4-3) fits.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|paulg:  i'd bid as West|pg||
nt|ady: west may interven showing majors|pg||
nt|henryb:  There, you see, is one of the differences in style. If I responded 1@s I would be likely to end in a 4-3 spade fit instead of a 5-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|chick: what moysean fits?  2@S is always a 4 card suit.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not on my planet|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|henryb:  Not at my table or Ed's|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: 2@C    maybe landy|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  think so, given East's 2@s bid|pg||
nt|chick: then we had better not partner, because if my pard raised to 2@S with only 3, I'd be looking for a new partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this looks as though it will play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Spades do not seem to be getting much support from partner on these deals|pg||
nt|daman: this should be an adventure|pg||
nt|othered1: 'ACtually I define suit quality for a 4-card @S response to 1@H "willing to be raised on Hxx,"  in context of the hand. |pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|chick: then I guess you will play in a lot of Moyseans :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: should be 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  declarer can't complain about bad lie of the cards, yes|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|othered1: Absolutely, and they're about as good a source of matchpoints and small imp swings as you can find.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|nt|chick: I agree completely, I've won a lot of hands when the opps play in 4-3 fits :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|henryb:  In the meantime Hoyland is busy making his game|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SA875HKDQJT2CQ986,SJ32H954D74CAT754,ST96HAQ2DK986CKJ2,SKQ4HJT8763DA53C3|sv|e|nt|chick: another partscore here, but hard to guess who will win it|pg||
nt|kmb24: another great result from robles/caracci coming in making 3N off the first 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|brobles: Goren says that with this quantity of points you can play 3N :)|pg||
nt|brobles: The Open room had a misunderstanding on this hand but stopped safely in 4NT. Smith was denying majors with 3@h but apparently they weren't in the same page|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: Hi|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brobles: Valdes is going to prempt?|pg||
nt|kmb24: here's a nice little trick... open the south hand with multi, and show whichever major partner doesn't like|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: but have to play the bad version of multi for that.|pg||
nt|henryb:  on the other hand, 4 imps is the difference in the match at this point|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: still got the club away   so  down 2 last hand|pg||
nt|friggi: plain 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rick3son:  l have been told that the score is not accurate|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kmb24: dbl!|pg||
nt|brobles: so 2@s is 0-7hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Is there another set in this match?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kmb24: anyone like double on paca's cards?|pg||
nt|kmb24: 3n looks normal to me|pg||
nt|brobles: 4@d is pretty conservative in my opinion|pg||
nt|kmb24: i agree|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca not liking his trick source in 3N with only 1 stopper, but it has to be a winning bid more often.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: well, given that your partner would take a trick in spades this hand in 3n, maybe it's a better stopper than it seems|pg||
nt|brobles: 5@d turns out to be an excellent spot, because he prefered to evaluate his hand as suit playing cards|pg||
nt|brobles: now rafa should definitly blast into slam|pg||
nt|brobles: and take an overtrick :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: Sure a lot of bidding with this piece of junk|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brobles: apparently he bid only 5@d|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brobles: let's see if EW can cash their first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|kmb24: they squealed|pg||
nt|brobles: Nice try by Joaquin but Rafa decided he was missing too many key cards to get involved|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: @hK is a bad honour, so pass on 3@s|pg||
nt|brobles: NS playing 4 card diamonds so I think that a club lead is reasonable. Well done|pg||
nt|kmb24: should lead a club now no problem and the first 5 not hard looking at that dummy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|friggi: good god|pg||
nt|friggi: jacobson has the same illness as Claassen|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: overboard again    unfortuantely  diamond honors wasted |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|brobles: East certainly did the only auction to get to 6@d|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: change the red suits on E and 4@s is clear|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kmb24: great choice by paca to get them looking...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kmb24: though i still hate double|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I think I liked the 1@H opener on the previous deal better than this 12 count|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you can call this a 12 count with qj-.|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 with west|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, especially if you have a meaningful lead in the match.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it was a lock. Given the 1@s bid, West would never have pitched two spades from an origina holding of QJ10x|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: This is more like it|pg||
nt|paulg:  looks dangerous hand for West|pg||
nt|ady: would not play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not a bad responding hand to a strong @c, 12hcp 3 controls...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: I presume 1NT is wide-ranging|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|santyclz: 6@c (or @ss in matchpoints).|pg||
nt|ady: double from south?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: It makes the auction game-forcing, and hopefully West will not worry about too much wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, W is aware now|pg||
nt|paulg:  on hands like this it is better to play multi 2@d as North may overcall 2@h :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  the only good news is that there is a chance that this auction will be duplicated|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, the distribution is awful here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|santyclz: 3nt?  Perhaps 3nt*?|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

nt|othered1: Maybe EW would have been able to be more competitive if east had raised clubs.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|daman: asking for the @S Q'|pg||
mc|10|nt|cuttysark: Response denies the king of hearts so all is well|pg||
nt|daman: 5@H was asking partner if he had the @S Queen    |pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: I'm told 3nt was forcing|pg||
nt|daman: right Joe|pg||

nt|friggi: no but the small numbers add up over time:)|pg||
nt|chick: EW shouldn't have too much trouble getting to this fine slam|pg||
nt|friggi: the question remain will it be play in N in the other room?|pg||
nt|brobles: Well done Rafa and Paca|pg||
nt|brobles: this was THE hand where double could get you to 12 imps :)|pg||
nt|brobles: good result for NS in the Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: they will argue in the comparrison about who gets credit for that one, robles-caracci or paca-rafa|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|tez: do you bid 1@s with rubio hand|pg||
nt|brobles: Smith chose not to double 4@s with his singleton @d and West went for the sacrifice|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzwd: West actually put on his glasses after EastÂ´s 2@C :)|pg||
nt|chick: hahahahahahhaaaa|pg||
nt|kmb24: i wouldn't dream of passing :)  you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: What about @C opening here then reverse @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  good night all, and good luck to everybody|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: Never for me|pg||
nt|chick: There are still about 75 people in the world who open that hand 1@C, but I'm not one of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: I think there are more people Chick, most people that play 1@C 17+... :)|pg||
nt|friggi: I kind of like it more and more:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: strictly speaking not a minimum but close to it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: another strange bid by Juan Pablo Valdes. Maybe he was expecting EW to bid up|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tez: i would bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: so maybe 76 in few weeks|pg||
nt|brobles: I would bid 2@c if 1@s wasn't available :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: when its this close go for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: they open very light when not vul|pg||
nt|brobles: nice lead|pg||
nt|tez: briland:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: too tough to avoid 3n, but they got there from the wrong side it seems|pg||
nt|tez: ne count here|pg||
nt|tez: need|pg||
nt|brobles: maybe declarer tries to sneak a diamond and then play for 7 tricks in the majors|pg||
nt|brobles: it's his best shot really|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room bid a direct 3n over 1S|pg||
nt|brobles: win the club in hand and try a suspicious @dJ :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: seems like a good plan to me|pg||
nt|tez: if duck 8 trick again|pg||
nt|brobles: I really don't see another plan, but I'm guessing that Rubio will pop Ace knowing the layout|pg||
nt|rick3son:  good night Henry|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|espooz: They dont play 2/1 ?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|brobles: @c7 really helps|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: isnÂ´t this maheable?|pg||
nt|kmb24: oops|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: multi in closed room   2@D  from west  2@S   east    showing good hearts   but not good spades    south tht spades good enough to bid at the 3 level   bit missed that could be ...|pg||

nt|ralfwil: makeable...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|tez: @c 7 was very good|pg||
nt|kmb24: looked very likely that 4 spades were possible, and given the clubs i think @h finesse was a better shot|pg||
nt|brobles: Yep|pg||
pc|h4|nt|friggi: but not enough|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brobles: Rubio team picked up 11 imps on board 25 after a terrible club split for NS|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jpvaldes: Now she need @D 3-3 to win this hand.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|kmb24: it's hard to untangle it though|pg||
nt|brobles: so the first 13 imps to the Rubio team|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: the e/w made 8 tricks defending in CR in spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h ruff before playing @dA and an overtrick...|pg||
nt|kmb24: was hoping to creat some action by passing i'm sure.|pg||
nt|beamar: the score at this point is 14 for cuevas|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kmb24: i think you have to run the T@s to leave the Q as a reentry|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kmb24: but if they don't cover maybe you're blocked anyway|pg||

nt|vugraphzxe: 1NT = 15-17 |pg||

nt|ady: team mates will be very gratefull for the unexpected plus|pg||
nt|chick: This would have been much better bid using control cuebids instead of ace asking|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|espooz: I dont think V should bid 4@D so long they play 2/1 "game force"|pg||
nt|friggi: I think Blandat will gain some Imps on this one|pg||
nt|kmb24: JD to the K for a H finesse was a winner|pg||
nt|brobles: yeah, for sure.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brobles: this board likely to be the third push of the segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kmb24: when they cover then you have to play the T@s and you could take enough tricks...|pg||

nt|kmb24: looks like a normal 3n|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|tez: and they will play 3 nt|pg||
nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes as West in the Open room took a lot of tricks after a spade lead|pg||
nt|kmb24: but you never know|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: I agree Espen, splinters are for game hands, slower is better for slam hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|tez: 2@h is not enuf for me:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: you never know...|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: for you?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brobles: you were right, but still a push|pg||
pc|sK|nt|espooz: Exactly|pg||
nt|chick: replying to a couple of private comments .... splinters should be used by the person who knows there is game, but doesn't have a slam force hand.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: in that case, West is the one who knew there was slam, so he should NOT splinter ... his partner doesn't need to know about the @D shortness|pg||

nt|kmb24: i kind of like 2n over 1s|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
mc|10|nt|brobles: So 2 more imps for Rubio|pg||
nt|brobles: Rafa assumed that either hearts or clubs were weak in the line and went directly for the spade game|pg||

nt|santyclz: Would have avoided a violation of imp rule 2 as well:  Go + on part-score hands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  N-S go down in 5@s only if East shifts to a club rather than a heart|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: vul save here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ady: 3NT makes n/s   but has some good fortune|pg||

nt|paulg:  i open 1NT on these hands, but the Italians rarely do (which is a concern to me!)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ady: east has no entry to play spades  and the hearts lay very kindly   and with stiff K@C  should make 10 tricks at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  will be relying on 3-3 hearts and a finesse in a minute|pg||
nt|ady: might have chosen to play hearts immediately as if K@C with east a spade switch might have been bad|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|henryb:  Roland, could you tell people where to find standings?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|ady: now will try and club|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|ady: even if west followed   might be best to try ace of clubs and when the jack does not appear  try the hearts|pg||

pc|c3|pg||

mb|1D|nt|friggi: Blandat (Mixed in English) is kicking back, just 2 imps from its handicap|pg||
nt|brobles: Caracci team leading by 17 so far (7 carryover and 10 more in the segment)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|kmb24: only 3 of the 15 boards this segment were played in partscore at both tables!|pg||
nt|kmb24: 1n overcall in the other room was a little weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: This event has a very nice trophy at the entrance of the main chilean Bridge Club where you can eventually print your team name if you win :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|espooz: standard 1nt here|pg||
nt|kmb24: especially with double so close to describing the hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: finally, a makeable contract :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes that is a bid odd to see that:)|pg||
nt|brobles: Slam is agressive but easily makes on this layout|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes, very odd|pg||
nt|kmb24: i think rafa should bid 1nt over 1s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: only 12 cards on E on board 17, so they play 18 now|pg||
nt|brobles: Yeah, partner could have enough values for game on this auction|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d4|nt|kmb24: for sure, not to mention 1s could be a silly contract with 1nt cold|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|sA|pc|h4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h7|nt|espooz: S have a normal @S lead|pg||
nt|friggi: but N can signal|pg||
nt|espooz: How ?|pg||
nt|friggi: then S will play @D and more|pg||
nt|espooz: Low heart in trick 2 ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|espooz: If they use smith that a big card likes the lead. North should throw a low @H |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|friggi: @H Ace is asking for signal, due to the fact that W has already bid @H|pg||
nt|friggi: he could have made 6|pg||
nt|friggi: discards @D on @S 10|pg||
nt|friggi: then take @C twice and ruff|pg||

nt|ady: played   either way declarer makes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice play David - eliminate @c and @h before playing @s|pg||
nt|chick: EW could end in 3N, and if a heart is led, he won't get to use the diamonds|pg||

nt|ady: 5@D?|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club lead to beat 6  not too difficult|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am corrected: about 300 teams entered, and if you lost close in the first round (or maybe it was random) you got to the second round anyway|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  5@d will get 6@d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd afraid of missing big play with N hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 5@d opening|pg||
nt|ady: goulash|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I suggested, opening a multi 2@d on  4 was a lot more successful as North did overcall 2@h, so the penalty was missed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East must be worried about missing something too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  I play my defence to 1NT over a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I'd have to bid 5@c (or pass)|pg||

pc|s9|nt|espooz: I think E have a easy def to play @S K and more @S|pg||

pc|h5|nt|santyclz: You mean that's not 15?  Sorry, pd.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|othered1: Good test on gettng to 5@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i know it is light but it is classic distribution |pg||

nt|paulg:  4@s is a little aggressive, when the hearts may be over you. 3@d game try probably better|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  if you held four spades and, say, @hAQ then that is not enough to double?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|chick: I don't care for the 2@S bid either|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|othered1: with pushy preempts, this is the type of contract you'll get to, not one you'd plan to bid yourself NV (needing to hold majors to 2 losers)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|paulg:  probably not, especially given the vulnerability|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: declarer might have done better to keep the 4th diamond   if not ruffing the opening lead discard a heart|pg||
nt|paulg:  seems to be down two, losing a heart and two diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H bid on hand 14 was a swing   not bid in OR|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w may lose pts here|pg||
nt|paulg:  clearly right to take your time in this contract, but I'm concerned that thinking can only lead to -800|pg||

mc|9|nt|paulg:  but, no, he is doing the right thing|pg||

nt|tez: realy..if trumps are 4/0|pg||
nt|tez: you must cash ace before|pg||
nt|brobles: Looks like 3N is home in this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: friendly spade and heart layout|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a filthy but mandatory opening bid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|4S|nt|brobles: Yes, he took the safety play (and prayed that they were 4-0 offside also)|pg||
nt|kmb24: another case for making light jump shifts.  i'd play this hand in partscore.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kmb24: 2@c shows the majors, double shows values.  now he's stuck|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: multi landy..very popular in this time|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb:  4@s by S seems excessive: 3@s (or 3@c better) would seem like enough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brobles: Plaut not going to bid 2@d after this start so he just forces to game|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brobles: I would bid 2@d and over 2@h I would try 3@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brobles: Nice bid by Rafa, bulnerable and with good cards|pg||
nt|brobles: vulnerable*|pg||
nt|kmb24: i might just bid 2n on that start   i want to play 3n from my side.|pg||
nt|kmb24: and i want to stop in 2n if pard is broke|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kmb24: 1@h-1@s-2@d-2@h-2nt|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kmb24: interesting choice int eh play here now.  looks like spades are 4-4, so maybe it's right to cash A/K@d and play on clubs if the Q didn't fall.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|brobles: They both took the shot after missing a slam and they will get their prize|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brobles: right, 2N has to be better actually|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kmb24: ah too many losers that way|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|nt|brobles: without a fit I wouldn't want to be at the three level|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|brobles: problem is when pd has something like 4216 weak|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kmb24: except on this hand... with spades not running and the H coming in and the A@d onside.  easy 9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Declarer started one down, maeuvered to down 2, got back to down one, back to 2 down, and ends 1 down|pg||
mc|9|nt|tez: just made|pg||
nt|kmb24: ya, not much left to take overtricks with|pg||
nt|kmb24: over 2n he can bid 3c (you have to have clubs)|pg||
pg||
