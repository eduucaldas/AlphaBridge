nt|ianmcc: except grey hair|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: haha|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is 20-20 game a stretch|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
mb|1S|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|4H|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|s4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|sT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|woozle: Good hand to show off the law - EW make 9 tricks in their nine card fit, NS make8 tricks in their eight card fit. If 4H was making, 4S would be -500|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA what else?|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Hello all|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: and hello from me|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@H?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Style. I use 3@H as single and @S support|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was on my to say: If EW bid after 3@C they'r might down. |pg||
nt|davestern2: Hi all from the venue|pg||
nt|davestern2: Looks like a 4@S 5!/5@D battle here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: every once in a blue moon, a 3-level preempt bears a faint resemblance to the associated poster child|pg||
nt|davestern2: 5@C|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a partscore battle to start with|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|hoffers: Welcome all|pg||
nt|hoffers: This is second set of Seniors final. Brown started with a 16 imp carry over|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW go for game and i think they will be disapointed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: may I come in for a while?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davestern2: Very much so good morning to Ian mcCance|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I thought 5@c stood out|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Welcome all|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: But still a nice layout for NS|pg||
nt|hoffers: and added another 6 in the first set|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|davestern2: One down for the "par" result|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: 2!NT also on as @S support but without singleton|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrdct: definately going down|pg||
nt|hoffers: not if Bill inserts @c10|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe i speak too soon|pg||
nt|mrdct: @C6 surely isn't consistent with holding the J|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hoffers: J96|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: A spec asked me what 4@H from S would mean. Zerro @H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|chilloncan: welcome to this match:)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: At my system. Forgot to say that. Sr|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need 2-2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hoffers: However David would not have ducked in that case|pg||
nt|mrdct: fair enough - but there are a lot more cases where the @c6 can't be with the J|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Klinger had opened the bidding and has only shown diamond K-Q and spade ace ..and had nothing in clubs, so Haughie could be confident that taking @CK would ensure defeat .. North ...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: HAD to have a big heart card|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|davestern2: 5@S of course makes as the club loser goes on the hearts|pg||
nt|davestern2: In fact six on a club lead|pg||

nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||

nt|ianmcc: the vul got him|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||

mb|1D|nt|davestern2: The 16 imps is the carry forward prescribed by tthe finishing order in the Round Robin. As pointed out this is somewhat inequitable as Klinger beat Brown twice in the RR|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Hi Daniel and specs:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A interesting hand NS but a spot to become I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not thhis nice for NS by 21p and @S this time but a normal to come I belive|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=spo&C=1|pg||
nt|davestern2: 3NT NS looks the go here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: odd|pg||
nt|davestern2: Yes morre will be said about the CFwd based on some suggestions|pg||
nt|davestern2: Actually I should argue with a mathematician but 16 is in fact Even|pg||
nt|davestern2: shouldnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Welcome all|pg||
nt|davestern2: Not that they are likely to get there 4@S would make on a good day - such as today|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: First swing to might come?|pg||
nt|mrdct: a loser in each suit here in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Rodal, hello everyone|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: just been informed that the running score incorner is incorrect|pg||
nt|davestern2: A heart lead would be bad|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but 17 would be even...worse|pg||
nt|davestern2: No major will be a disappointment to North of course|pg||
nt|davestern2: :)|pg||
nt|davestern2: This hand is a good cup of coffee hand \_/?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: E limited and after W the same. Any for hold it open by a bid from N?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hi Gary, Rodal|pg||
nt|mrdct: west's potential @c ruff will be with a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@d looks -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|davestern2: But this is likely -1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: a further issue for south to deal with here is his 4th @s|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this contract is certainly no 'lock'|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: hi Steve|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to see:) Loong time ago.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: E hand was really worth a raise to 2 and a half hearts ..sensibly decided on '3'|pg||
nt|hoffers: Both pairs play standard.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think he'll need defensive help such as west ruffing a @c in front of dummy's high honour|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|davestern2: Not often partner overcalls a diamond and you hold KQ109x|pg||
nt|davestern2: the @C9 at trick one made the hand a lot less scary for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hoffers: Lilley Nagy's version is classical|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: dilemme - set up a club and weaken dummy|pg||
nt|davestern2: Ian dont you hat it when they play back your five card suit in NT to establish tricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: indeed|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1304 retur|pg||
nt|davestern2: Spade now will save an overtrick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Hi Andrew and specs.|pg||
nt|rodal f: N fly 2@C or one and a @S for -1 it seems.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|davestern2: Claim time|pg||
nt|hoffers: but Klinger Haughie open light, and play transfer responses to a 1@c opening|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

mb|3H|an| |mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|woozle: EW will win seven imps, but a completely worthwhile vulnerable game has gone begging|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d8|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|woozle: I shouldn't be so harsh - Christie couldn't have known that he had four trumps, a king and a key singleton|pg||
pc|dJ|mc|11|nt|kiwibridge: that is being harsh|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very|pg||
pg||

nt|davestern2: Good morning to our CR operatot Catherine Ritter|pg||
mb|p|nt|davestern2: 3NT looked good till you see no entry for diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Partscore again and best for NS|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I like udc but hate burning 9s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chilloncan: hi bill:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|davestern2: This final represents the two pre-post favourites for the finals|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d makes here if you get @d right|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|chilloncan: many would open that N hand in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mrdct: although a @c ruff mights scuttle it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: can't draw three rounds of trumps to do it, tho ... need to ruf 2 hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|davestern2: Mr Richman sitting behind me is not enamored of the 4@C bid|pg||
nt|davestern2: Prefers a diamond raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h the limit for NS i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: X=3@S|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Nice 4@S for EW here, even with two cards (K@S and A@D) offside|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: comment about running score was on advice from fellow operator... so not sure what's going on..|pg||
nt|davestern2: West will raise|pg||
nt|davestern2: We suspect|pg||
nt|hoffers: Having a stop (especially over 1@c) is going out of fashion|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Two colored by S and a nice end EW |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: +2 next|pg||
nt|davestern2: Double by Christie described his hand rather well|pg||
nt|ianmcc:  I think 4@s was luckily on so 4@h a steal|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|mrdct: this will be OK for klinger if he makes it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Sold at the mol|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: picked up the pass card momentarily :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm .. that's a bit perilous|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: more likely than south raising anyway...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|davestern2: Lead suggestions|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: very conservative pass by Nagy - with bidding suggesting pd is short in hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: N/S win the race to 1NT.  |pg||
nt|mrdct: @d to A and @s back might test declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: And also down if no @D lead but turn|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: aha, got caught by the old "operator undo" trick  :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|davestern2: Oops|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: and*|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On hands like this, it often pays to declare rather than defend.  Defending is so much harder|pg||
nt|mrdct: with east having some holes in his @d suit, north might play him for the @sA for the vul overcall at the 3-level|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: although the counter arguement could be that with @DAQ and @SA he might've made a 2-level overcall|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|rodal f: But first trick can't be right if 4@S ans S to lead.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: try to get as many ruffs in dummy as possible|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Normal lead at 4@S is @H and if S turn @D? 10.     Can be a IMP in EW here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|davestern2: That undo caught me unaware|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct: as happens more often than not, richman gets it right|pg||
nt|mrdct: even when he's dummy!|pg||
nt|mrdct: i assume south is claiming|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|rodal f: C10 Daniel:) Now OK|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: and now the @s10 is going to set up - so an easy 9 tricks i think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chilloncan: green on white in 3rd seat, N has a hand most would regard as suitable for a 1S opener. one hand proves nothing and resulting as a general habit is pernicious to devloping ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: judgment, but empirical results are not meaningless...and here 1S by N  might very well find E as declarer in 2N or maybe even 3N|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: And there you see it.  West probably needed to switch to a spade through|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think he ruffed that|pg||
mc|9|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: another one where we can't see what happened in the CR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||

nt|rodal f: EW. Do they plat 2/1?|pg||

nt|rodal f: From the opening 1@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that it's easy to reach.  West's minor suit 10s are gold|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E is practially ready to go slamming over 2C...wondering if he shouldnt just bid 3S over 2C|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was a ask by biddig tempo.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D from me. WHY?|pg||
nt|hoffers: At last a hand of interest. KH have done well to bid game. Now Ron needs to get clubs right|pg||
pc|c9|nt|davestern2: Need to rise with @DA when played to avoid a heart being pitched on the @SA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||

pc|sA|nt|noodle:  if 3@C showed extras that d be my choice with W hand  5431 pattern|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in my view, E has too much to tell to start with 4th suit forcing. 3S splinter would describe almost he whole hand at once o ver 2C|pg||

nt|chilloncan: wd then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Brightling, on hearing 4@S, realised that his interior spots in the minors make for a good slam|pg||
