mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: hi all - Patrick here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Patrick Shields|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s is a bit aggressive by W and may push EW too high|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  E certainly thinking about it|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S instead of @H|pg||
nt|bg: theres a psych which may make it tough for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: the 2@D in the other room was more constructive than the 3@D here, which is what led to the final double|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: psychs still played in Eastern Europe|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not want to play 4@s here as a loser in each suit sadly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  the S hand certainly looks more like a 3@d bid than 2@d with these vul.|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure they could handle 3 nt either |pg||
nt|patricck: A @D lead beats it for sure, but really quite a reasonable game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pjs_ch: double is lot more expensive where there are two overtricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: yes, 3@D describes it well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well on this lead declarer may get something going in clubs |pg||
nt|patricck: If the K@S was onside would be very odds on to make, and even when the K@S is offside it is possible for the defence to slip up|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kemperg: last wwek in Bulgaria I saw some of those|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|kemperg: 3N was possible, E would start @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  wonder if they play 1@d as all unbalanced hands|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: perhaps N is treating the hand as a weak NT hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: but pass was my bid too:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: if they get the diamond right, NS can make 3@D easily but might be hard to find the suit now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|patricck: yes, but with  a fortunate lie of the cards may well make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  according to Taavi, 1@c was not alerted so maybe this is just N's creativity|pg||

pc|d5|nt|pjs_ch: over the 2N enquiry, rebidding minor with min hand and major with max and correspnding minor is common|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|nt|andyv:  last board of this set|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 2 @S was some form of ghestem|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: seems like a misdefence to allow three hearts to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they were against Niagra on this occasion|pg||
nt|lestergold: Michaels id have assumed|pg||
mb|7D|mb|d|nt|andyv:  j@s lead will net 3@s|pg||

nt|sybarra: cant really guess the @D's can he?|pg||
nt|lestergold: as long as declarer takes simple @d finesse east can ruff with his money |pg||
nt|lestergold: has no option but to guess the @ds only one way|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will assume that 6@s are making otherwise this would be a phantom|pg||
nt|lestergold: iei @ds arfe 4/1|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @D finesse endplays  E |pg||
nt|lestergold: just 5 off on this sensible card play|pg||
nt|lestergold: south was on to a winner simply by assuming as he must that 6@s was cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: a case of keeping your neve when playing in these haevy sacs|pg||
nt|lestergold: whats the delay?|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes no odds now he can play either red suit just the two top trumps to lose|pg||
pc|dK|nt|patricck: playing another @H would be right if they were 1-1|pg||
nt|patricck: but not good if they are 2-0|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: was not playing another heart safe in any case|pg||
