nt|ianmcc: this one is 20-20 game a stretch|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
mb|1S|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|4H|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||

nt|woozle: Good hand to show off the law - EW make 9 tricks in their nine card fit, NS make8 tricks in their eight card fit. If 4H was making, 4S would be -500|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@H?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Style. I use 3@H as single and @S support|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was on my to say: If EW bid after 3@C they'r might down. |pg||
nt|davestern2: Hi all from the venue|pg||
nt|davestern2: Looks like a 4@S 5!/5@D battle here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: every once in a blue moon, a 3-level preempt bears a faint resemblance to the associated poster child|pg||
nt|davestern2: 5@C|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a partscore battle to start with|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|hoffers: Welcome all|pg||
nt|hoffers: This is second set of Seniors final. Brown started with a 16 imp carry over|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW go for game and i think they will be disapointed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: may I come in for a while?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davestern2: Very much so good morning to Ian mcCance|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I thought 5@c stood out|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Welcome all|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: But still a nice layout for NS|pg||
nt|hoffers: and added another 6 in the first set|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|davestern2: One down for the "par" result|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: 2!NT also on as @S support but without singleton|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrdct: definately going down|pg||
nt|hoffers: not if Bill inserts @c10|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe i speak too soon|pg||
nt|mrdct: @C6 surely isn't consistent with holding the J|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hoffers: J96|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: A spec asked me what 4@H from S would mean. Zerro @H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|chilloncan: welcome to this match:)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rodal f: At my system. Forgot to say that. Sr|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need 2-2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hoffers: However David would not have ducked in that case|pg||
nt|mrdct: fair enough - but there are a lot more cases where the @c6 can't be with the J|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Klinger had opened the bidding and has only shown diamond K-Q and spade ace ..and had nothing in clubs, so Haughie could be confident that taking @CK would ensure defeat .. North ...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: HAD to have a big heart card|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|davestern2: 5@S of course makes as the club loser goes on the hearts|pg||

mb|1D|nt|davestern2: The 16 imps is the carry forward prescribed by tthe finishing order in the Round Robin. As pointed out this is somewhat inequitable as Klinger beat Brown twice in the RR|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Hi Daniel and specs:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A interesting hand NS but a spot to become I belive|pg||

nt|davestern2: 3NT NS looks the go here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: odd|pg||
nt|davestern2: Yes morre will be said about the CFwd based on some suggestions|pg||
nt|davestern2: Actually I should argue with a mathematician but 16 is in fact Even|pg||
nt|davestern2: shouldnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Welcome all|pg||
nt|davestern2: Not that they are likely to get there 4@S would make on a good day - such as today|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: First swing to might come?|pg||
nt|mrdct: a loser in each suit here in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Rodal, hello everyone|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: just been informed that the running score incorner is incorrect|pg||
nt|davestern2: A heart lead would be bad|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but 17 would be even...worse|pg||
nt|davestern2: No major will be a disappointment to North of course|pg||
nt|davestern2: :)|pg||
nt|davestern2: This hand is a good cup of coffee hand \_/?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: E limited and after W the same. Any for hold it open by a bid from N?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hi Gary, Rodal|pg||
nt|mrdct: west's potential @c ruff will be with a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@d looks -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|davestern2: But this is likely -1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: a further issue for south to deal with here is his 4th @s|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this contract is certainly no 'lock'|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: hi Steve|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to see:) Loong time ago.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: E hand was really worth a raise to 2 and a half hearts ..sensibly decided on '3'|pg||
nt|hoffers: Both pairs play standard.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think he'll need defensive help such as west ruffing a @c in front of dummy's high honour|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|davestern2: Not often partner overcalls a diamond and you hold KQ109x|pg||
nt|davestern2: the @C9 at trick one made the hand a lot less scary for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hoffers: Lilley Nagy's version is classical|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: dilemme - set up a club and weaken dummy|pg||
nt|davestern2: Ian dont you hat it when they play back your five card suit in NT to establish tricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: indeed|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1304 retur|pg||
nt|davestern2: Spade now will save an overtrick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Hi Andrew and specs.|pg||
nt|rodal f: N fly 2@C or one and a @S for -1 it seems.|pg||

mb|3H|an| |mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||

nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||

nt|ianmcc: I like udc but hate burning 9s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chilloncan: hi bill:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|davestern2: This final represents the two pre-post favourites for the finals|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d makes here if you get @d right|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|chilloncan: many would open that N hand in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mrdct: although a @c ruff mights scuttle it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: can't draw three rounds of trumps to do it, tho ... need to ruf 2 hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|davestern2: Mr Richman sitting behind me is not enamored of the 4@C bid|pg||
nt|davestern2: Prefers a diamond raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h the limit for NS i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: X=3@S|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Nice 4@S for EW here, even with two cards (K@S and A@D) offside|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: comment about running score was on advice from fellow operator... so not sure what's going on..|pg||
nt|davestern2: West will raise|pg||
nt|davestern2: We suspect|pg||
nt|hoffers: Having a stop (especially over 1@c) is going out of fashion|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Two colored by S and a nice end EW |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: +2 next|pg||
nt|davestern2: Double by Christie described his hand rather well|pg||
nt|ianmcc:  I think 4@s was luckily on so 4@h a steal|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|mrdct: this will be OK for klinger if he makes it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Sold at the mol|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: picked up the pass card momentarily :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm .. that's a bit perilous|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: more likely than south raising anyway...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|davestern2: Lead suggestions|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: very conservative pass by Nagy - with bidding suggesting pd is short in hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: N/S win the race to 1NT.  |pg||
nt|mrdct: @d to A and @s back might test declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: And also down if no @D lead but turn|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: aha, got caught by the old "operator undo" trick  :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|davestern2: Oops|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: and*|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On hands like this, it often pays to declare rather than defend.  Defending is so much harder|pg||
nt|mrdct: with east having some holes in his @d suit, north might play him for the @sA for the vul overcall at the 3-level|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: although the counter arguement could be that with @DAQ and @SA he might've made a 2-level overcall|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|rodal f: But first trick can't be right if 4@S ans S to lead.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: try to get as many ruffs in dummy as possible|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Normal lead at 4@S is @H and if S turn @D? 10.     Can be a IMP in EW here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|davestern2: That undo caught me unaware|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct: as happens more often than not, richman gets it right|pg||
nt|mrdct: even when he's dummy!|pg||
nt|mrdct: i assume south is claiming|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|rodal f: C10 Daniel:) Now OK|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: and now the @s10 is going to set up - so an easy 9 tricks i think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chilloncan: green on white in 3rd seat, N has a hand most would regard as suitable for a 1S opener. one hand proves nothing and resulting as a general habit is pernicious to devloping ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: judgment, but empirical results are not meaningless...and here 1S by N  might very well find E as declarer in 2N or maybe even 3N|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: And there you see it.  West probably needed to switch to a spade through|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: another one where we can't see what happened in the CR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||

nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||

nt|rodal f: 1@D from me. WHY?|pg||
nt|hoffers: At last a hand of interest. KH have done well to bid game. Now Ron needs to get clubs right|pg||

nt|bjacobs: But perhaps a better hope was simply that the short clubs were with the 3-card spades|pg||
nt|davestern2: If opps get to five minor NS will have their work cut out needing to pick up @HQ9|pg||
nt|davestern2: to make 5 Spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard, but not impossible, to visualize|pg||
mb|1C|nt|davestern2: Hmmm how often do you have 100 hounrs to six and partner opens that suit|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|bjacobs: Well, this one is easy for everyone.  East has the short hearts, so finesse through him.  What could be simpler?|pg||
nt|hoffers: 18-19, 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: S safing in|pg||

nt|noodle:  S learnes he's off 2 key cards  :P|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The right contract here is 3NT, but it's unlikely to be reached.  No harm will be done in 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West has the short hearts ...|pg||
nt|davestern2: Agree and it is likely.........|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I doubt Smolanko will let them play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So S mean that N at vul 3@C don't have cards? X 100 by 100 times from me.|pg||
nt|davestern2: Agree they will bid 6@D a lot of pressure on Christie|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 9 or 10 tricks. If @S lead 9|pg||

pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Seems as 14-03 is on. I mean it is better then 03-14 by asking asses|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: hi there Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the ACBL "printed defence" is a joke - it makes the Multi look like a major weapon that requires pages of defence, when in reality the Multi 2@d is a popgun that requires 2 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3 lines of defence. |pg||

nt|bjacobs: yeah, that's about it|pg||
nt|davestern2: Thats the real value|pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: there is another thing too....when opps are in mere game and they would have made slam on any lead but club, you for sure dont want to lead a club. and a trump lead is the one that ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: will make them most wistfuyl of all|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rodal f: How to bid this by best control?|pg||

nt|davestern2: Send more chips to table 2 please|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@S  is pretty interesting to play ... |pg||
nt|davestern2: Vwery but should fail on a heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Should it?  Might not a safety play be a good idea in spades?  Cash the ace?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it's much harder on a diamond lead though|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c lead need to beat 2@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like and easy 4@s for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: South shouldnt be condemned too harshly .. he didnt know about the "diamond surprise" awaiting him; and the fact pd held K@S|pg||
nt|petergill: More likely, the bidding really might be Pass Pass 1NT P 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, North will lead a heart and 3NT should make comfortably|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last match of the qualifying rounds. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If if it is played by E (mosty unlikely), declarer can counter a club lead by ducking twice..and the major suit kings are ideally placed for him|pg||

nt|petergill: Four teams qualify for tomorrow's semi-finals, then the Grand Final is on Sunday|pg||

mb|4S|nt|rodal f: I belive Anderson will go for it now. The slam in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: My point being that Multi 2@d is feared in America due to the length (and existence) of the written defence they provide, which does more harm than good, given that the main aim of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: good bridge is to avoid distraction and focus on being "at the table".|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the more psychological hangnails you can get the, picking, the more chance for distraction:)|pg||
nt|davestern2: Well that discussion was all a waste of time|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I agree...if they simply let multi to be played all the time, players would eventually learn how to deal with it...all conventions take some time for the public to accept|pg||
nt|petergill: PO is right in theory, but in practice virtually nobody (except me, who gets laughed at when he does so) ever alerts the Pass that shows 6 spades. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bailey's lead over Neill for 4th spot is down to 7 VPs now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Hoffman can gain 5 imps on board 22, they will win this set|pg||
nt|po-s: I certainly do, particularly against unknown opponents who may never have heard of Mult...|pg||
nt|davestern2: Bill have you spotted a super safety play for this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5? what was X?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The $64 question, that|pg||

nt|petergill: excellent results in recent years, so Neill has good players in their team. |pg||

nt|petergill: As Jamie just pointed out, Bailey has finished play and has taken 4th place. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone - Brown will surely choose to play Bailey (with 16 imp carry-forward)  with Hoffman facing a tough task against Klinger in tomorrow's semis. |pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No amount of safety playing helps this one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nasty hand, but this should come home with the help of a 3-3 break in a black suit|pg||

nt|davestern2: Ah sorry Ian I see support for diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: This contract will not be blessed by success, but it's hard to criticize the auction |pg||
nt|chilloncan: Klinger torn no doubt. between the spadish orientation of the hand, and the 9cc of hearts which argue for NT. some could use 3H as a choice-ofgames cuebid here (Ed Manfield, Bridge ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: World circa 1981)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's very tricky though - if he ducks a club, for example, and a diamond comes through, he has to decide whether to finesse before he knows that clubs are 3-3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: -5 is 1100 so still ok over 6@H 1430|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: wd by Chan|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: So I guess after drawing trumps, he will play on spades|pg||

pc|h8|nt|rodal f: B18 gave 2IMP at 110 over -1(50) at 1NT. |pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like we're skipping past Bd 22 in the meantime :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But still, the 3 small hearts would very strongly have directed him to NT|pg||
nt|davestern2: That would have been my choice 4.5 tricks opposite and opener even at that vul|pg||
nt|mrdct: and the argument of giving more players international experience is largely eroded as there are much more opportunities to play in events like the NEC, Yeh Bros, NABCs, European ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: Opens, etc|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|rodal f: Sr. 3@C seems ok|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Precision from N-S|pg||
nt|petergill: so, right now, Bailey - a team playing as two threesomes: Bailey - Bailey - Howe and Bilski - Afflick - Noble - looks like grabbing 4th place|pg||

mb|1D|nt|petergill: NS Convention Card http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/2011/spo/cards/Januszke-Zollo.pdf|pg||
nt|davestern2: Intrafinessable spade suit for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT probably a little bit easirt than 4@h|pg||
nt|hoffers: Unfortunately, the strongest three pairs may not be in the winning team|pg||
mb|d!|mb|2C|nt|davestern2: is 2@C transfer to diamond?|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe, but the strongest team is|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davestern2: Or simple support|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: cool lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: If diamond Ace offside you will fail in 3NT but not in 4@H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwi_joker: should be a fairly quick claim for ten tricks here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: your comment begs a question, hoffers :)   Who are they?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h looks OK here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: AND here we go by a @D lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even also by a @S lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting 4@H but will they bid it. Belive not.|pg||
nt|hoffers: Transger|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If they do. Will they make it.|pg||
nt|davestern2: Should lose 3 tricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: you maen 1@c showed clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Enterence good enough to make it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, also it ist really clear from hat S hand that NS belong in game facing only an invitation. but one thing is sure -- exactly 8 tricks at NT is not a sensible target. |pg||
nt|davestern2: VG says 2@C not alerted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, it IS the seniors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think we can assume this was natural bidding|pg||
nt|mrdct: goodness me|pg||
nt|hoffers: Only an autocrat can possibly tell (Thats why Italy has been dominant)|pg||
nt|mrdct: italy's generally superior bridge talent might have something to do with also|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: If Ew bid on, 5@DX would cost 500, or 4@SX cost either 800, 500 or 200 depending on how many ruffs NS get. |pg||
nt|davestern2: Now Bill you will be here soonish I suspect|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Well New Zealand has gone down the road this year of Selection (for both international events) by a panel. No trials, nothing.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: right ... there's no long term value in playing 2NT there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On this deal, -50 instead of -100 ... so what|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W unlikely to get D right i think |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is actually a pretty good 6@D ... if you don't look at the N/S cards|pg||
nt|hoffers: Here is an example. South's hand has been upgraded to an 18 count on the 54321 count|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|rodal f: -6? For only 600!!!!|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|davidstern: Amazing place Sydney - This morning most magnificent Autumn day - now could be middle of winter, grey cloudy rain|pg||

nt|hoffers: Still an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: it didn't really get a long enough run to prove the concept though|pg||
mb|p|nt|hoffers: Just what Nagy wanted!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d for EW here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: Previous board: I think Lilley should have doubled 4@S at the other table - not bid 5@H, which cost about 12 imps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the Banzai count is quite good for NT bidding, but the problem is: if partner is looking for a suit contract even if you use it for your NT opening, the whole scheme sort ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: of collapses|pg||
nt|hoffers: Just what Haughie wanted to hear!!|pg||
nt|hoffers: TO with better clubs bu Ron|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a reasonable chance to get doubled in it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: hard to see cards played... they keep their hands over the cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4NT?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i like to play 2@h by south as natural here|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H only -300|pg||
nt|mrdct: and it wasn't so much about moving to a selection basis - but more establishing an internationally competitve squad to contest (and hopefully win) selection trials|pg||
nt|mrdct: stayman and 3NT here iguess|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kiwi_joker: 3Nt shouldnt have any problems here ..duck the first spade, cruise home|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ending one NT I belive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: aggressive 2NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: Previous board: He can then safely (holding @SA) lead his singleton to 4@SX, planning to get ruffs. |pg||
nt|rodal f: An actual bid by -1|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I can only suppose Lilley was driven by that fact that he hadn't shown his extra heart length, by that stage|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what the?|pg||
nt|hoffers: I think Bill has forgotten?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Haughie has splintered|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A spot in NT. Or will the players make som fun for us again?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: aggressive 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, as it's turned out, this works a lot better|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h might be conventional showing the stiff @s 4441|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Dbl asked for it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So kudos for Christie for going plus rather than minus|pg||
nt|po-s: slam now?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the splinter has been rammed into his fingernail|pg||
nt|hoffers: Zolly is delighted|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@H=3card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it's a bit like the earlier hand ... what's the point of playing 2NT?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: most aggressive bid so far here is X|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They are behind screens ... but Ron knows the auction has exploded, because Haughie couldn't bid a non-forcing 4@C then make a grand slam try over 5@C|pg||
nt|hoffers: The open performance in Shanghi in 2007 also proved that a "harmoneous" team that put a lot of effort into preparation could do well|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Not this time:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fortune favours the brave, etc etc|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 8 LTC with miniscule offense to defense ratio|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he's going to have to guess the club suit to make this|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@H looks very academioc on this auction|pg||
nt|mrdct: hmm - i think south should've shown his @h suit somehow here|pg||
nt|davidstern: The discussion of it at least|pg||
nt|davidstern: VG says South did think over 1@H|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry over 2@D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Wrong I was again:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: oh I see - 3 clubs and @hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh this is fun to watch|pg||
nt|hoffers: 1100 will be a good result for NS|pg||
nt|hoffers: 800 in 6NTs|pg||
nt|po-s: spades is best|pg||
nt|hoffers: but hard to stop there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think Klinger is trying to get back to a semblance of a "fit".  If South has club shortage, then maybe he has a little length in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Meanwhile, perhaps Bill Haughie has woken up to the problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In which case he should pass 6@DX|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So West has 4 hearts, East probably has 5 spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2452?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or 2443?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: 2@C Daniel?|pg||
nt|petergill: This board: NS can make 4@S as the cards lie, but it is a fairly lucky make - should they have bid?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would feel I may be being swindled sitting South|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugrapha1: Cannot read the writing, possibly just a checkback-puppet kind of bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, 5@D might be tricky to defeat|pg||
nt|mrdct: as a new partnership south was perhaps a bit worried about how north would've interpreted 2@h at either of his opportuntiies|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the curious thing is that up to now N has bid pretty conservatively....now he comes out of the closet to make a takeout double on a totally defensive hand....|pg||
pc|dT|nt|po-s: maybe our operator can fill in with the faces|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed - i think a conhesive team will generally beat the "best" three individual pairs if there are a princess or two amongst them|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: It's a bit sad that the silly 2@D=majors opening has worked so well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|po-s: no doubt broader in some directions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You've just gotta discuss it before going into the match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They probably did.  But you've also gotta remember it|pg||
nt|hoffers: May get out for 500 on this lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is there some play for 5@d?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chilloncan: and the raise to 3N is also...well, surprising|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder if South would have been better off trying to exit after @CJ won, in order to learn more about the distribution|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: well his swindled himself - he must have had some way to show his @h suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Eg exit with a heart|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s3|nt|rodal f: OK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, suppose the defence starts with a spade, and a switch to @HK|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: My approach is to make natural overcalls of suits where RHO has only shown at least 4 of them|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: Declarer ducks that, say, and the defence exit ... now East is ripe for a squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suspect the defence need to play a club early, and that might not be easy to do|pg||
nt|mrdct: and hard work tends to pay dividends also|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: am fine-tooth-combing N hand for the extras...eye of beholder, we can fairly say|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugrapha1: Ace of club called|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Was a good try|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: But I was also wrong. 1@H=3card+ max 4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c2|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|hoffers: Ron has defences aimed at catching out opponents. On this hand the memory lapse has caught them out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Note that 4@S is a cold contract here ... you do actually have to have a way of declaring in one of opener's suits|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: Still, a simple defence of overcalls are natural, and double = cards, can work just as well in catching the opponents|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I actually think North's bidding was fine.  X was aggressive, but quite typical, with no middle cards in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But he probably should have passed 2NT, I agree|pg||
nt|newart: dummy had a 1255|pg||

nt|hoffers: At last a hand with potential for a swing|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW went to 4@D on 19, making, so REALLY tight match now|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i can live with X also, if consistent with general style. my points were : 1) seeming conflict between this action and previous dossier for N    2) having doubled, N  has no extras|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The swing could certainly go either way on that deal|pg||
nt|hoffers: A pitty since they had gained 25imps before that board|pg||
nt|po-s: Was South really alerted to the meaning of 2@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Did Larrys Law work?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps West claimed only 9 tricks, not 10, on Bd 24, given that he had 4 losers. |pg||
nt|hoffers: 9 playing tricks, but Lilley just wanted to open 2@c again!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: why not?  System cards are distributed prior to the event as well ... there was plenty of preparation available|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@C= a color      2@D=majors      2@H and @S= Color + minor      2NT=minor       THAT is cappaletti|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On 1), you probably don't have enough data.  Haughie is a pretty "normal"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sort of bridge player.  On 2), I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: very likely right about (1), have only these two sets to go on|pg||
nt|hoffers: Just a memory lapse|pg||

pc|cA|nt|vugrapha1: half-way point now|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: needs to pick the @S position to make this|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, that swing was a bit of a gift from the Brown team|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: On Bd 22 , 3NT actually made 10 tricks for 630 to EW, so the score is 41-13. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: all comes down to how declarer plays the diamonds, i guess|pg||
nt|petergill: My source is the official scores from the Bridgemates at http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=spo&E=0&T=S&R=10&U=1|pg||

pc|dK|nt|rodal f: if*|pg||
nt|davidstern: THis is more interesting especially on club and return|pg||
nt|mrdct: in 3NT declarer might need to take a view on which M is breaking 3-3 as he may not be able to combine his chances on a @c lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: A low heart to jack may obviate the 3-3 to simply queen onside|pg||
nt|mrdct: true|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c lead looks indicated|pg||
pc|d2|nt|davidstern: Well that lead is uninspiring|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: Yet another trump lead proving useless|pg||
nt|hoffers: This is optimistic by Lilley (8PTs the way I count)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The hands fit well, but not well enough|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Lilley can't want a slam opposite a passed hand?|pg||

nt|ianmcc: bless that @h10|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: very friendly defence|pg||
nt|hoffers: But a very reasonable switch|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: a couple of top trumps, Q@D, and when E-W follow to all those tricks, easy peasy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|vugrapha1: should make now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: to solve his own subsequent problem|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: But of course, against 3@H, who cares|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|mrdct: so that probably wont happen|pg||
nt|mrdct: conservative 3rd seat pass by south|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: just for you dave :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@d shows @h i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@H, 2@H or 4@H? |pg||
nt|ianmcc: fit-showing?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: @s lead sinks 3NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: anderson sticks his neck out with a mediocre @h suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@H=5card|pg||
nt|rodal f: 20-20 but not a Roland hand. Then 20-20 give a game.|pg||
nt|petergill: With potential for 8 tricks, I like Roger Januszke's choice of 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: South should push to 6@h now, and gain 13 imps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The law of total tricks works well on this hand - with a known 10 card fit, East goes to 4@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And N/S will need to do well to save it with their combined 25 count|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: klinger tried to bid 4@H... brightling said no...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C was explained by Buchen as preemptive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: another system malfunction|pg||
nt|mrdct: and now a practical 3NT bid by south|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Relay|pg||

mb|2N|an|3h|nt|bjacobs: Very tough for Haughie|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or. New ask|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H seems very conservative to me |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just a matter of guessing the hearts, and it doesn|pg||

nt|mrdct: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: wanna predict the number of tricks now ? :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: god no|pg||
nt|mrdct: ok 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d maybe an artificial GF|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: John Zollo must have downgraded his QJ doubleton, which actually are very good assets on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe 3NT makes?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this would be quite a difficult contract if @d weren't breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think @d to the 7 is the correct play|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: I believe so|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I can't see any of the writing|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: spade shift now? Or club?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it has to be a @s for the defence to get their 5 tricks in time|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: 2@S and 3@C ask. 2NT and 3@D tell. But what I can't answer u. Sorry|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Again the best lead against contracts level 2 or/and 3 is? Trumfh.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||

pc|c6|nt|rodal f: It would not been the lead from E at 6@H:) Then @DK|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: the other table has skipped  10|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks like a pretty normal game|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: Assuming no dramatic change in the standings in the next hour, in tomorrow's semi-finals, Brown will choose to play Bailey (not Klinger, Brown can choose between 3rd or 4th)...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Well, Klinger-Haughie are doing their bit for the team effort, in this room, notching up plus score after plus score|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: finally -  10 13 for Brown|pg||
nt|mrdct: might hold it to 10 tricks on @h lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: i'm confused - what was the last board?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||

pc|d3|nt|rodal f: There the bancing came wich I was waiting for.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And was sold to the mol!!|pg||
nt|petergill: and Hoffman will play Klinger tomorrow. The carryforwards will be 16 imps to Brown and about 10 imps to Hoffman.|pg||
nt|mrdct: was it board 13?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: N have bidded his hand nearly full out and risk problems if he bid more but no clouds at the sky there:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Klinger will not get + here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Now S have a clear bid in my eyes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3h=min|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nlu: showing 64 most likely singleton @d but doesn't have much to help|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope:(|pg||

nt|mrdct: meanwhile - brown can pick up a needed swing here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|rodal f: 110 and fin. One @S run at @C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: S had no cards wich could help N by a trick???? Unbelivable. HUM|pg||
nt|mrdct: and with the failed 3NT not looking good for klinger this match could be just about square if this makes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|mrdct: can't really go wrong here|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: 1.5 trick S have and N bid freely alone 3@S. |pg||
nt|nlu: not really :) opps forced him to take the last bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Match? or team?|pg||
nt|nlu: you need @h to split @s to be KJ empty ON, very low probability|pg||
nt|nlu: now he is thinking wich finesse to take - last time on the board|pg||
nt|rodal f: N overbidded a bit liked it, but S had (then) a clear 4@S. If it go down it's Ns foult by bidding to hard. Finito for me:)|pg||

nt|ianmcc: doing well for 140|pg||

nt|petergill: Normal for David Anderson to upgrade to 20 -21 (22) with nice long suit and aces, but at other table David Lusk could not upgrade as his 2Nt would be 21-22|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: last one... restart 45min from now (3.15 AEST)|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 3NT anyone?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: 2@D Multi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrdct: this might play better in @s than NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: 2@S pass or correct|pg||
nt|hoffers: For those who read Ron's column in SMH a few weeks ago, this is an example: continue playing (ie for Q doubleton onside)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: Pass by South = spades - with hearts, South would bid over 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: So 3@S is stopper ask |pg||
nt|mrdct: another word for AKQxxx is "trumps"|pg||
nt|mrdct: smolanko-andersn missed 5@c on brd 26 so a lead change coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3.5 trick seen at defence from W, but nope|pg||
nt|mrdct: east and west might have a competitive auction without NS ever bidding|pg||
nt|hoffers: Passive defence may beat 4H|pg||
nt|mrdct: or NS will get a couple of chances to find the @s ruff as east doesn't have entry to hand to ruff his last @d|pg||
mb|2S|an|help suit|nt|mrdct: on the other hand - does 3NT have play?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not much i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: If clubs broke 2-1, 3NT would be o-so-easy ... but not this time|pg||
nt|petergill: Dutch expert Jan Jansma says that it's better for North to respond 2@H (not 2@S) on a hand like this, so that if East bids 3@C, EW do not find out what NS's major is. Jansma likes ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D P 2@s to be natural and nonforcing with long spades. |pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm! has the multi done its evil work again here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  playing 3-2s requires special skill and temperment|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: oonly game making....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good judgment by North there - not pushing on with a void in his partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Sorry all we are having connectivity problems|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3.5? 3.75|pg||
nt|rodal f: I am wrong by the endings all time. Sorry specs.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thinking: 2@S at vul. S ain't weak so near by opening.|pg||
nt|petergill: George Smolanko, perhaps because he has not often played Multi 2@D himself, got muddled. |pg||
nt|mrdct: @d lead might produce an entry to dummy and a free trick|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Klinger retakes the lead ... it's like the Melbourne Cup, these trials|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Normality prevailed|pg||
nt|mrdct: there it is|pg||
nt|mrdct: still some work to do though|pg||
nt|mrdct: the plan here is to win the @d and lead one straight back and start working on @S|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: could be another lead change soon as Brown have a chance to win 7 imps on 27 if they play in 3NT|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mrdct: if he can set up @d whilst maintaining an entry to dummy he'll be in good shape|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Some top experts disagree with me. I do not believe that every little thing should be alerted - I simply think that after any Pass by a Multi 2@D opener that shows the suit should ...|pg||
nt|petergill: be alerted. Otherwise, those with no familiarity with Multi 2@d (e.g George) are disadvantaged. |pg||
nt|mrdct: so it looks like brown will take a 14 imp lead into the final 16 board stanza to decide Australia's Seniors Team for 2011|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Sr specs. Can't exsplain why the bid went as it did.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rodal f: BUT making the match tighter for shure.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: thanks Catherine for great work on the laptop despite the players trying to hide their cards at every opportunity|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: and thx to the ABF and David Stern for putting this event one|pg||

nt|petergill: I would be happy to play bridge with no other Alerts at all as long as this Pass by a Multi 2@D opener is alerted. In my opinion, it is the single most important Alert in the game ...|pg||
nt|petergill: of bridge, and almost nobody wants it to be alerted. |pg||
nt|andyv:  can't see the harm in that, Peter.  ACBL, when they do allow multi, require printed defenses to it to be given to the opps as well as alerting of all sequences, even when obvious.|pg||
nt|mrdct: now he can setup @d and he's got the @SK entry|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: A spec likes the trump lead to "stop ruffs"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it sounds like N/S have a 4-4 fit ... how are you going to stop ruffs with one measly trump lead?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugrapha1: tx all... back in 30min|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cheers|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|hoffers: Except for memory lapse, this has been a good set for the Klinger team|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Thanks all, the restart is in 30 minutes|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: disaster for EW|pg||
mc|9|nt|andyv:  so 7 imps to Hoffman|pg||
nt|mrdct: huge board for klinger that may well seal the match|pg||
nt|mrdct: thx everyone|pg||
nt|hoffers: Well done to Klinger team|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: problem came from trick 2 - the heart continuation|pg||
nt|mrdct: see you in the open room|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: thx to all specators, This table will close not. Please go to the other room :)|pg||
