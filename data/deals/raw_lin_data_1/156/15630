nt|henryb:  Johnson has great faith in Meckstroth. But this is abid against the LAW. His side must have only eight @s, and the opponents are likely to have only eight @h, so the three level should belong to them|pg||

nt|henryb:  4@s may also go down|pg||

nt|bt: i think norths first double is dubious, no he has to follow up w 4@S since he wasnt happy with 1@Hx going down some|pg||
nt|bt: now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|heyz:  you can make 4@s i think|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the otherhand, A10732 is not the sort of defensive holding you normally want against a one level contract|pg||
nt|heyz:  three diamonds shaking @C then ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: maybe, but tricky single dummy|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|xenya: it doesn't look like declarer can make 11 on a @D lead|pg||

nt|bt: pairs since it is the only pair wc|pg||
nt|bt: we have olympiad and bermuda bowl for teams|pg||
nt|bt: but i am in a minority no doubt, as usual, lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  The World Pairs was the original reason for this tournament, but the Rosenbloom, which began in 1978, seems to be gaining|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the Pairs should be more important|pg||
nt|bt: thx henry, lol|pg||
