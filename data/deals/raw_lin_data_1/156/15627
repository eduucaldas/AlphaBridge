nt|lml: he|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: and good morning|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|stc: Our two teams are 3rd and 4th separated by 1 VP|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up for Lavazza|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: South has quite a hand|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H is flannery...|pg||
nt|barnets: here is a lucky 3N E/w|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they are in the middle of this board...3NT by E|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: will enter the result|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|udo: 3 Nt seems quite high with combined 21 count|pg||
nt|benjy: And we're off!|pg||
nt|zbig1959: lets go ..|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 4M for both sides here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzsv: and an opening |pg||
nt|xenya: after the 1@S overcall by S 3N had very little chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Precision 2@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4414 or (43)15 shape|pg||
nt|iceking: Boyd might check on pds shape and settle for 3nt |pg||
nt|Gerben42: good evening :)|pg||
nt|iceking: if north has 4-5-1-3 shape he would like to be in 3nt i would assume|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3C is limit + in hearts, might start with that.|pg||
nt|barnets: 22hcp but 9 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: hi all|pg||
nt|benjy: But if north opens 3@D will they find their @S fit?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: save 4@S makeable if S play Q@D for finn (in open cards)|pg||
nt|benjy: i find that surprising|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N!|nt|yuval10: nowadays almost everyone will open N's hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: i bet it was different some decades ago|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it was a bad lead though|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting use of rdbl|pg||
nt|benjy: 2NT presumably shows 1 4 card limit raise or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2NT fg @H raise with 4+@H|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|xenya: Moss rightly felt that strong measures were called for|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting to open S hand 2N|pg||
nt|tez: unlucky 6@d|pg||
nt|toral5: back|pg||
nt|xenya: probably support double from N|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes alerted as such|pg||
nt|toral5: heading towards an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya:  aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|xenya: by NS|pg||
nt|caitlin: so 2@H raise of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: transfers after the D, so RD = hearts, 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|phil:  I like "4415" shape....less one|pg||
nt|kjadams: or blast :-)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: almost as simple bidding as in the other room - I guess Boyd felt @SKJ was kinda nice|pg||
nt|iceking: i think its little lazy |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: still talking about last hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes much more to be gained if he was right than to lose|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhere|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cute|pg||
nt|iceking: 10 tricks not much in the play|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C from Paske shows any minimum|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stc: Also an interesting fight between Pepsi and Punch :)|pg||
nt|andersk: Normally a game bid and won at both tables, with players with theese skills|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h shows shortness..@d support|pg||
nt|passell: see if they get to 4spades here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this is quite a thin game|pg||
nt|toral5: seems supp x is mandatory in thr methods.opened with less than 11 and now a supp x|pg||
nt|zbig1959: with passed hand, over 2NT 3@D from N shd be suit + support @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|stc: very tricky, splits not friendly for NS but good finesses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Presumably South knows which by now ... sand has a decision to make|pg||
nt|benjy: The 2NT as opposed to a 2@S bid has pre-empted north|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: but has chances|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy to stay short of high level|pg||
nt|ritong: mysterious bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He goes for the spade game ... rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|delberto:  seems like declarer has to ruff clubs but won't be allowed to|pg||
nt|copeyj: Robertson could have asked for shortage with 3@D, and probably should have done as opposite @C shortage he is interested|pg||
nt|copeyj: but no harm done here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: think 2@d is just artificial game force|pg||
nt|tokay1975: is morgan thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ok its free  :)))|pg||
nt|andyv:  not to his partner:)|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: his pd  has 4 aces with 19  count and still his hand  cannot mnake 5|pg||
nt|tokay1975: even 4 is  problem that  cl ace in onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  worse, the defense knows what to do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@D might well be the "end signal", meaning: "partner, bid 4@H then pass my next bid"|pg||
nt|zbig1959: *support @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: club lead probably best for defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: West playing 5@d|pg||
nt|mamos: one off|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
nt|tez: unlucky..@d's3/1|pg||
nt|benjy: i agree and i would never pass over 2NT, not would I pass in 1st position. For me that is a normal 3@D opener|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: if, for some reason, NS reach 6@H, E will have to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  right conclusion|pg||
nt|tez: makebl 6@d with open cards..but...|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't see any scenario where finessing in spades is the right play|pg||
nt|stc: but to make 6@d you need all finesses !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will just count on diamonds 3-2.. ruffing one spade and discarding one, intending to give up the K of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: ah ok|pg||
nt|zbig1959: rt now boring deal., 10 tricks, |pg||
pc|s3|nt|stc: op, undo pls|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably|pg||
nt|andersk: South need to cover a 9 loosers hand, and he opened 1 @D, Impossible to be slam here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to play 4 16board sessions  in a  day with high concentration|pg||
nt|toral5: an expected push|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S was down2 |pg||
nt|dburn: same number in four diamonds, if South can find the defence|pg||
nt|warrens:  I guess it didn't occur to Rosenberg to bid 3nt on Jxx of @S:)|pg||
nt|dburn: ace of spades, three rounds of hearts...|pg||
nt|barnets: yes @HA|pg||
nt|tlc: this is making unless hearts are led very early|pg||
nt|barnets: or @SA and heart switch|pg||
nt|barnets: south will score his @D|pg||
nt|barnets: on a ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: HH use upside-down Attitude, standard Count|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: 5@C was one off too|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is questionable perhaps but hard to resist|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A common technique in the relay community|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so good|pg||
nt|barnets: I think he will find this defense|pg||
nt|dburn: and the rest of it is not even particularly far-fetched|pg||
nt|tlc: i do too...levin wishes he had a higher spade spot im sure|pg||
nt|phil: expect a low trump|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stc: sure, this is the normal line|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: the board came very quickly back to South...lol|pg||
nt|tez: pelle bid good IMO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now some more thinking|pg||
nt|tez: 5@D= i have nothing|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure what south is considering.. grand out of the question at this point and passing 5d is unthinkable|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. maybe not unthinkable.. his pd could have kqjxxx kqxx in hearts and clubs i suppose|pg||
nt|tez: we are sure camberos will try 7|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore 4@h/@s would be encouraging|pg||
nt|phil:  but South should play this and put the hand everyone knows about on the table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: perhaps, depends on their methods.  It's quite a cool concept which can be used in any system where one player is in control of the auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: w thinking|pg||
pc|s8|nt|warrens:  Levin's card will be suit preference, but I think Weinstein will read the 4, especially given the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so -- the pairs i introduced at the beginning are both at the other table|pg||
nt|phil: if a spade loser was present, declarer would have tried to pitch it earlier|pg||
nt|delberto:  lol|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: declarer could have made but double dummy i think|pg||
nt|lml: Solani is sort of endplayed but he can get out a spade|pg||
nt|petepunt: evn all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry |pg||
nt|blum1956: now making|pg||
nt|xenya: i take it back -- the double was obligatory on the auction|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|tez: 4@s very good because @s's are 3/3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: well,  that didn't seem to be much trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if a strip and endplay is the best line|pg||
nt|tez: nice bid|pg||
nt|stc: on non trump lead the @s finesse looks ok, why not|pg||
nt|bessi2: perhaps a 4@c bid from camberos would have been a better bid instead of 4@d.. gives his pd a chance to bid 4@d|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stc: on this lead some chances|pg||
nt|stc: but you have to choose the right side|pg||
nt|tez: @c lead auto|pg||
nt|phil: the trump return implies Tor has @d's stopped as well|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tlc: well done|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Philadelphia Vugraph Archives at  http://www.bridgefederation.ch/2010/wtc/index.html  courtesy of Yvan Calame|pg||
nt|tez: he cant lead singleton trump in this squence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: amazing -- it appears N got the distribution completely wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blum1956: he even needed no guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||
nt|stc: I think he will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|blum1956: surely|pg||
nt|mamos: double not looking so good right now|pg||
nt|barnets: so this is a good result n/s|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|lml: bathurst is going down with the diamond offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry these guys are fast. |pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@D seems a good result here|pg||
nt|funtay: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores for all groups running scores|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to get @Hs right now|pg||
nt|barnets: but they will gain only 3 imps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: declarer needed Hearts to make the contract so needed to use @SJ as entry  defence gave chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now North must pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am only seeing one side of the screen, so bidding may be delayed until the board comes back to this side.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would East lead from @dKx holding @HQxxx?|pg||
nt|xenya: possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, any alerts are only explained as per the West South discussions. |pg||
nt|xenya: the bidding seems to indicate N has strength in clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT is comfy|pg||
nt|xenya: so diamonds is simply the unbid suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not much to do here, except go down|pg||
nt|barnets: with n/s playinng 2@H down 1|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andersk: If @H is 2-2 it will be ok to play @S after 2 rounds of @H  The problem is: What to do with the 100% @D switch, wont help to run it, so only 1 line left: @C A onside|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|lml: he played for both red cards onside|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|Jacki: Welcome our commentator Mike Amos everyone |pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: Here we go... |pg||
nt|xenya: nasty...|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Lars Andersson|pg||

nt|bt: thx and hi|pg||
nt|bt: good 2 be in philly|pg||
nt|bt: i have not followed this board so i refrain from commenting|pg||
nt|bessi2: same for me :)|pg||
nt|bt: though i notice a shuffle of partnerships in mahaffey team?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: slow ply here|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|dagold: I hope we are not in 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: i fear we may be|pg||
nt|dagold: Usually double is values without 4@s|pg||
nt|dagold: so south should perhaps try 4N|pg||
nt|dagold: not down yet|pg||
nt|dagold: of course south doubled 2@h|pg||
pc|d7|mc|10|nt|dagold: well he made it|pg||
nt|copeyj: whatever happened|pg||
nt|copeyj: happy to chalk up 620|pg||

nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|lml: it could be made if declarer tried to set up hearts and used all entries to do so|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|stc: yes, no reason to finesse in NT and not much play in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=863&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is a match between 1st and 2nd in group J|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4 first team qualify for the KO stage, i believe|pg||
nt|toral5: part score battle coming up|pg||
nt|phil:  even if onside|pg||
nt|dburn: never mind - if they win 3 IMPs on every board from now on, they will win the match|pg||
nt|barnets: better to push that thin game than the one they tried|pg||
nt|barnets: it often happens that way|pg||
nt|tlc: an interesting subtlety in the auction...rosenberg bid 2@d, instead of 2@c, because he had enough values to want to compete if the oppoenents bid more....this allowed a cheaper 3@c ...|pg||
nt|tlc: rebid...with a terrible hand he would have likely bid 2@c immediately|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps a little impatient there with the club|pg||
nt|zbig1959: slam @D for NS here|pg||
nt|dburn: did well to make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|bt: i was wrong hi ruff then pull trumphs was good enough|pg||
nt|dburn: well, apart from the spade ruff, there is a diamond slam|pg||
nt|benjy: 4@S was an unusal contract and as David says, they did well to make it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: monster hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is a RR match in the Rosenblum Cup (open world champs)|pg||
nt|lml: good morning from Canada|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|lml: I am quite happy to walk in and see Canada is leading|pg||
nt|andyv:  did I miss something?|pg||
nt|andersk: Can East have 5332 with @C A and pass opening hand, and W not bid with AQJxxx in @C?  I doubt it, so E need to have a @C honor, then surely a low honor|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mamos: sorry specs we do appear to have tech problems here|pg||
nt|mamos: we are tryong to find out what is happening onsite   sorry for delay all|pg||
nt|Jacki: Herve is on his way to this match folks, he'll get it fixed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: herve's speaking  I will catch up bidding and play here|pg||
nt|mamos: and from England|pg||
nt|gulyas: also from Hungary|pg||
nt|mamos: yes this is Group F  (of 16)|pg||
nt|blum1956: weak NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: link to the running scores, as brought to me by Barry Goren|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda, welcome back. |pg||
nt|bt: not a classic 2bid but effective here|pg||
nt|tez: a chance for zimmerman to pick up, if other room gets it right|pg||
nt|tez: 5 daimond there to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usally 5+  [but 1@H often 4]|pg||
nt|benjy: In the open room east started off with a 2@H opener so north south were immediately under pressue|pg||
nt|dburn: but finding a spade ruff with South declarer may not be so easy|pg||
nt|dburn: still, finding a diamond slam may not be so easy either|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: accepted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's see. North is on lead to 3NT and will probably lead a spade|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: we have the live scores at www.brdiegblogging.com too ... just push the big button|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: decent 3N here for n-s but unmakeable with the club ace in the east hand|pg||
nt|phil:  (undo)|pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|iceking: most pairs cant bid 1nt here with Nickells hand|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d |pg||
nt|delberto:  maybe..because East was marked with long clubs I think|pg||
nt|benjy: how many cards did 1@D promise? Was it two?|pg||
nt|dburn: but at least on this bidding there is no chance that North-South will play 4@s|pg||
mb|p!|nt|lml: sorry www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|andyv:  guessing time for S|pg||
nt|iceking: either it shows 3 card support or its transfer, for them it looks like semi forcing |pg||
nt|udo: thisd looks more like a game:)))  4@H |pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@C (i thk) is natural, weak NT or 18+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
nt|lml: interesting deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: reluctant pass by Nickell|pg||
nt|tez: dbl pls|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi all - you can watch Live Vidéo from this room at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  Credit to Mila Antonova|pg||
nt|phil: he was - and he can only count 4@h + 1@s + 3@d....|pg||
nt|dburn: four, I imagine|pg||
nt|dburn: if they play Polish Club|pg||
nt|benjy: If it did then why didn't north show support? That seems odd to me|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 1@D from S - at least 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: boring hand now|pg||
nt|iceking: Nickell might bal with 2@S but pass is fair also|pg||
nt|iceking: everything breaks well, declerar will end up with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: so we start with 3 rather dull hands, lets hope things will spice up a little|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C is actually the best contract east-west I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Deutsch 152, Canada 142, Pinot Noir 139  - I must say the third-place team sounds interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will pull this without too much thought |pg||
nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
nt|andyv:  even less thought for E:)|pg||
nt|andersk: If you find your hand wurth an opening, and your pard penalty doubles, with a unlimitedhand, why do you take out?|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2S would gain/save a couple imps as 7 tricks probable.|pg||
nt|delberto:  yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: far left is Tor Helness   to the right of screen is Geir Helgemo   ---   i don't know the Israeli players :(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
nt|lml: you may have some chances on a bad heart break|pg||
nt|xenya: a pass missing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That gets declarer up to 8 tricks, but I can't see a 9th|pg||
nt|zbig1959: is it true?? 4@H played??|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4d is one heck of a bid in that spot in my opinion|pg||
nt|tez: q of @h|pg||
nt|xenya: this might have issues...|pg||
nt|xenya: but makes perhaps if declarer plays on clubs|pg||
nt|toral5: duboin will start with his natural @H q|pg||
nt|udo: 3 Nt also fine|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D likely setting up a game-forcing auction|pg||
nt|tez: i mean for gitelman hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  if we believe names from vugraph   on left of screen is Pachtman and out of view right now is Ginnossar|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  does E have enough to raise?|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @D has to be forceing|pg||
nt|bt: its a little aggressive imho|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I like the dbl either.. prefer 2N even with those lousy heart spots|pg||
nt|bt: 2n is a slight underbid, so i understand the double|pg||
nt|bessi2: but with only +50 or 100 defending 3h on the menu.. -100 in 5d surely nothing to be concerned about|pg||
nt|bt: this is heading for one down unless west gets stuck with the @C J in some variations|pg||
nt|bt: @S A, @HA @H ruff, diamond, @H ruff diamond, @S, @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n asking question of e|pg||
nt|tlc: im not sure i follow this auction...|pg||
nt|barnets: suggested that 1n was clubs|pg||
nt|tlc: ok..comes the dawn |pg||
nt|barnets: that would make sense|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|tez: perfect distrubition for dbl..takeout|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Right Al|pg||
nt|benjy: It looks as though south thought his pass was forcing and north did not agree with that|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 2nd deal, 2nd swing for Lions|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
nt|andersk: if not he would pass 2 sp|pg||
nt|andersk: omg|pg||
nt|andyv:  congrats to EW... great spot to stop at|pg||
nt|andersk: How can this action be non force|pg||
nt|phil:  lost a valuable tempo|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One tempo gone - there better be a spade switch coming!|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N shows either clubs or exactly 2533|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what this bidding was - maybe 1NT was "clubs or balanced", some sort of transfer rebid structure where West had to lie somehow|pg||
nt|barnets: cards lie very nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe West was just telling the truth and East hoped for hearts and clubs or to survive the actual shape|pg||
nt|udo: west has for sure some slaminterest,,but east is very minimum:)|pg||
nt|phil: yes thats right |pg||
nt|delberto:  3NT would have been straigthtforward as it happens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- but who's supposed to bid what?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have blogged about them.  They are from 3 countries all wine producers I believe.  France Argentina and I think Brazil|pg||
nt|mamos: looks pretty dull|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: yes it was a option |pg||
nt|dburn: don't blame him - I would not have thought pass was forcing either|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: sorry commentator sleepy.  Yes 5@C has 3 losers... maybe wishful thinking|pg||
nt|bt: then on @C to king west can unblock|pg||
nt|tez: ty:)|pg||
nt|phil: strange - 6@d might be easier to make than 5...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose Helgemo choices of 2@S/2N   then in this auction maybe over 3@D  3@H=noise|pg||
nt|copeyj: so 4@H looks cold off with 2@S 1@H 1@C to lose - but funnier things have happened|pg||
nt|benjy: Well, board 17 was flat, but this won't be|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
nt|toral5: @D q10 falling are also gud news for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes -- i missed that|pg||
nt|othered1: Does the 1N rebid with @Hxx rather than rebidding the 6-card @C suit have some non-apparant inferences to  it? |pg||
nt|benjy: Nor would I|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no 5 card suit in S, but 3S|pg||
nt|petepunt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: or 11, depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|blum1956: both 3NT and 4@s easy |pg||
nt|zbig1959: opps, missed, the same 4@H at other room , bd 17|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: only one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: and even then...|pg||
nt|lml: yes there is seeding|pg||
nt|delberto:  now on the queen of hearts lead, declarer will have to guess to play on clubs or to guess the spades|pg||
nt|phil: so often 3@d rebids create problems for finding 3N, because the club stop gets buried|pg||
nt|delberto:  over 3D ...3NT shows a cllub stop but is ambiguous about a heart stop maybe ?|pg||
nt|phil: I know that play that|pg||
pc|d4|nt|toral5: looks like a comfortable make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: greco asks about count signals|pg||
nt|phil: (some)|pg||
nt|delberto:  certainly, you can see why he chse 4D|pg||
nt|copeyj: Should be 4 imps to England, but we shall see|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|udo: i agree 1NT,,,,because of the bad quality of the clubsuit|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 4@H -1, cheap save against cold vuln 5@D (even +1)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|lml: I dont know the rules for seeding within a group.  Does anybody know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps because he didn't bid 2@d over the dbl?|pg||
nt|andersk: Ok people|pg||
nt|andersk: listen|pg||
nt|phil:  430 or 400?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect a catchall 2@S rebid contributes to difficult auctions Phil|pg||
pc|sA|nt|stc: 17 a push after identical play in both rooms|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Pellegrini in the tank|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness|pg||
nt|bessi2: a diamond now and a heart back might bother declarer|pg||
nt|iceking: on low @S return declerar needs to ruff high in dummy 2 rounds of @C pich spade home |pg||
nt|phil: Ive also seen 3@h 'asking'|pg||
nt|pitiful:  especially if simon defending|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|stc: @s looks best|pg||
nt|dburn: cards may not lie quite well enough though, even if declarer goes right in trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: spades are best now|pg||
nt|barnets: then north can get  promotion|pg||
nt|barnets: for his trump 10|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vicky888:  difficult to go down, and Jitubhai is the Master :)|pg||
nt|delberto:  still have to cash out now|pg||
nt|phil: personally I think with any kind of excuse responder should really try to bid 2N on many different types of hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if things same as 2008   EW  standard count & attitude    with 1st discard odd/even|pg||
nt|delberto:  king of hearts...then a spade seems safe enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difficult to confirm or deny based on this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they haven't turned the cards over yet...W is staring intently at them|pg||
nt|phil: Pachtman will get it right from his side - he is looking a very vulnerable @cQ - Helness would not duck the spade holding @s9 singleton I do not think|pg||
nt|delberto:  I htink Ginnossar should do it for him...|pg||
nt|phil: I'll assume the @s3 was a count card too|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: he might misguess diamonds to avoid the south hand I suppose|pg||
nt|andersk: When you take out 1 NT X, you have already shown 6@S and a weak opening, why do partner bid 3 @D if not force?  I|pg||
nt|delberto:  i was wrong !|pg||
nt|phil: no, you were right :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: uh oh    not winning tactic to give Tor Helness a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|phil: what does a trump accomplish? |pg||
pc|h4|nt|tez: if helgemo give @s J ..|pg||
nt|tez: GAVE|pg||
nt|toral5: ruff @H and 2 high trumps;so 8 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|delberto:  I didn't see it coming I must admit...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|toral5: his worry should be an @H over ruff|pg||
nt|tlc: another heart may be best|pg||
nt|barnets: south also threatems a promotion|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: in a way its the sort of result  both sides can feel quite pleased with  -- no big minus score|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: or was .....  commentators curse|pg||
nt|gulyas: knowing S has 6@Hs, among others, makes it less likely he has @DQxx as well|pg||
nt|tez: seems like down 1 by simple defence|pg||
nt|tez: @h ruff coming if finesse|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: wow I think that a@C was unwise after 5@C|pg||
nt|mamos: but ery difficult looking at two Clubs and six Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: specs talk to me :)|pg||
nt|mamos: at least let me know you are breathing - wierd talking to myself|pg||
nt|petepunt: presume pepsi is the polish player ?|pg||
nt|tez: he belived @s's are 3/3 now|pg||
nt|bessi2: it sure looked that way|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh disaster for lavazza in the other room|pg||
nt|toral5: so losing 12 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he had out the @H9 then switched to the @C3|pg||
nt|caitlin: to see other room www.bbotv.com/vugraph|pg||
nt|copeyj: If I were defending they would have a chance to make 12|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: south has promotion now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: The pass was alerted on one side of the screen but not the other|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stc: yes|pg||
nt|stc: here @h was better, puting some pressure on dec|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: will do my best|pg||
nt|phil: Im going out on a limb and he iddnt play a heart here|pg||
nt|delberto:  confused ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe we've entered the twilight zone|pg||
nt|delberto:  I am|pg||
nt|delberto:  hehehe|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: I think you are seeded if you are a bit good|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toral5: match will be tied now|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think @H 9 guranteed 8 tricks, so he decided to increase his chances in case @CA is with W |pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: greco apologized for taking solong|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tlc: yes..club 10 can be promoted as well|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|barnets: with 3 trump tricks n/s|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 3@S seems dn2, 3@D 1@C 1H one trump (if yu play 4 times @D's -promo)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: Pepsi should be Jacek Pszczola, the World Champion|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bessi2: but the legitimate way to make the contract is for declarer to play west for ax in clubs|pg||
nt|bt: north forgot to unblock @D9, beer card not important in china?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: or that kids game     hot potato|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mamos: ok  safely done|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to allow for 4-1 break in both black suits|pg||
nt|lml: the rules are probably somewhere on the wbf site or maybe easier to find on ecatsbridge.com|pg||
nt|dburn: mayeb down three, if East pitches now in an attempt to make it somehow|pg||
nt|tlc: mb 3 now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|bessi2: anyways.. 99.9% certain Lev will unblock club Jack if it comes to that|pg||
nt|bt: now north knows 55 in east|pg||
nt|bt: if theyre in rd of 32 they know|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|bessi2: if declarer tries to go for the misdefense here then he doesn't know Lev well I should think|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gulyas: a double squeeze?|pg||
nt|lml: no double squeeze|pg||
nt|vicky888:  no communication|pg||
nt|lml: south cant be squeeed |pg||
nt|lml: he has no winners|pg||
nt|toral5: @H ruff is the 8th trick.cos if @H over ruff he doesnt ve the entry to enjoy @C king,EVEN if ace is right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gulyas: needed to cash the @CK for that, and that kills the communication|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bt: if u want them to forget to unblock u should play faster|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|toral5: nice scores to watch:)|pg||
nt|phil: he'll run his trumps in case there is a black suit sqz on W|pg||
nt|zbig1959: misunderstanding in pair NS.. |pg||

mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|copeyj: just 1?|pg||

nt|dagold: any other postion or vul I would open 3|pg||
nt|dagold: not 4|pg||
nt|dagold: ever|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dagold: but 1 is ok|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dagold: surprised at wests oass of 1@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: needs two rounds of spades|pg||
nt|dagold: to beat this |pg||
nt|dagold: as a 3rd spade aloows a trump promotion|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes - but not tht likely is it?|pg||
nt|dagold: but I suspect it will make|pg||
nt|dagold: this is the problem with 1@h with no defence|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|copeyj: England are playing 4@H nv undoubled on 18 next door|pg||

nt|andersk: Andy..pls|pg||
nt|bt: true|pg||
nt|toral5: we do have a super match|pg||
nt|barnets: down by 23\|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Trevor|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 24 imps for Ples, remaining 14 bds..|pg||
nt|benjy: Not the kind of result you want when you are 35 up in a world championship final. It will be interesting to see if they can steady themselves|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: =64|pg||
nt|iceking: 15-17 nt John or|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: N could have been squeezed had he held the @SQ as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 4-card majors|pg||
nt|lml: I think the finishing is important because you get to play the weaker half of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: In this phase each bracket has 9 teams and 4 will qualify|pg||
nt|xenya: Open room is in 6@DX on the previous hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: as I said at the beginning|pg||
nt|toral5: i missed tht:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whichever, it's a colossal disaster|pg||
nt|phil:  hard to see the spade disappearing but ok|pg||
nt|barnets: chance here n/s|pg||
nt|dburn: they seem to have cranked up the dealing program|pg||
nt|dburn: not a good time to bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|dburn: at least, not unless West decides to come to the rescue|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzsv: 1 s shows 5|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@c for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Board 17: in the other room, the Japanese EW got doubled in 4@S -- no overtrick, so 2 imps to Diamond -- somewhat amusing|pg||
nt|andersk: would you rather bid 2 @D than penalty double 1 NT?|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh.another 500 in the other room|pg||
nt|warrens:  strange XX imho|pg||
nt|warrens:  but it depends on their agreement|pg||
nt|barnets: may show a long suit|pg||
nt|ady: routine 3NT   n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: not very exciting in a team match, I have to admit|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a disappointment for North   |pg||
nt|bt: so north played to respect the opps as opposed to the more likely lie and a misplay|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can make 3 different games|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: also alerted by E|pg||
nt|delberto:  is 3H a fit bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have 2 guesses for meaning of 3@H -- the 2008 convention card doesn't help|pg||
nt|phil: 3@h looks like a fit jump, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/World_Championship/World_Bridge_game-2010_Philadelphia/World_Bridge_Series_2010.html|pg||
nt|andersk: Im told: EW play xfers at this point to show a weak hand or 12+...rdbl is always limited to 10-11|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: though at least he wont be too high which might have happened|pg||
nt|tokay1975:   walid knows for sure  this is forcing he just took the risk with weak hand  .both opp showed some values|pg||
nt|tez: seems 5 card @s..bidding|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt np|pg||
nt|delberto:  with the intention of going to game subsequently|pg||
pc|c5|nt|toral5: but thts against 620 i guess|pg||
nt|phil:  Hampson taking delayed auction with that awkward hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you told South he could make 5@C, he wouldn't believe you|pg||
nt|phil:  think 2@c is natural in this context?|pg||
nt|iceking: is this correct didnt Katz bal with dbl?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: wow, nice score from Open Room, 750|pg||
nt|benjy: In the OR e/w made 5@D Xbld after a 1@H opening from south|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: its clear he thought @h6 was singleton but this was misguided|pg||
nt|bessi2: this will be an easy +620 for Lev|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greco/Hampson great pair and aggressive but Duboin and Sementa have far more international experience|pg||
nt|iceking: thats just 2 passive i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: this is correct|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i guess he had respect for the strong NT - still, a bit passive|pg||
nt|iceking: way to passive |pg||
nt|iceking: for me and most i would assume this would just be standard bal dbl even vul vs not|pg||
nt|barnets: likely sttle in 3N|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal 4@S here - may have difficulties with 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|copeyj: @C lead normal imo|pg||
nt|pitiful:  would you bid 3@c or double|pg||
nt|copeyj: same contract and lead next door|pg||
nt|copeyj: i would have bid 3@C too, but I don't like to agree with you too much|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lml: this hand will play quite well for north|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d wenz down in OR on the same @h lead !|pg||
nt|xenya: as Ellin said, NS are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S?  Beam me up, Scotty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many use 1-under as purely artificial raise, so we'll need Trevor to clarify if 3@H actually showed @H|pg||
nt|zbig1959: few imps come back to Poland|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vicky888:  helpful lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c checkback, but I believe not GF|pg||
nt|toral5: more imps for @D team|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well if you double and it goes 3@s back to you then what?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzsv: fire alarm just went off!!|pg||
nt|iceking: so just making and good result for Robinson|pg||
nt|copeyj: VG operator - this is Tom Paske playing, not Ben Paske, pls correct when you have a moment|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: S seem to upgrade his hand|pg||
nt|andersk: next time 3 NT is cold:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d gf..so 2nt forcing|pg||
nt|tez: a little tricky here though, a hand that needs a lot of consideration|pg||
nt|tez: @h's are friendly|pg||
nt|tez: if he plays to @h|pg||
nt|tez: plays on @H|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6@h making but not a sort of perfect contract|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s does make on the previous board of course|pg||
nt|stc: @s now|pg||
nt|phil:  and they land in a Burns fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 1@S seems panicky|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: ruling stands on appeal|pg||
nt|phil:  since double is takeout of hearts, why cant 2@c be natch?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's as if he is unaware of E/W's system, where 1@C can easily be a 2-card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: well judged pass by south|pg||
nt|tlc: a likely +11 for fleisher...|pg||
nt|dburn: this may be OK also - Levin perhaps thought Weinstein would have a less solid spade holding than this|pg||
nt|warrens:  Rosenberg's X=2 @S's and a desire to compete, usually 7+|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petepunt: playing small @H on board 18 seemes strange|pg||
nt|lml: apparently crazy things are happening in the OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx, however, doesn't|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, rather, shouldn't|pg||
nt|lml: the OR is in 7@C in the other room but they aren't finished yet|pg||
nt|lml: they are all on steroids|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: www.bridgeblogging.com has the scores. |pg||
nt|bessi2: club ace.. cash 2 spade tricks and revert back to clubs only way to bother declarer it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: still and all, he hasn't make it yet... maybe if West can somehow find a club lead...|pg||
nt|warrens:  needs to ruff 2@S in dummy, but with East having only 2 @D's, should be ok|pg||
nt|barnets: dec needs 2 ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|tez: if @d 3-3 or Jx J single... he should not play for @h|pg||
nt|phil: since I was asked - a fit bid shows a side suit and support for partner's. four card support will do at the 3 level|pg||
nt|benjy: which needed a 1S lead to defeat it|pg||
nt|zbig1959: dn1, and 12 imps to Poland|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  this contract appears to be super safe...CR in 3@s making|pg||

nt|bt: i am a big fan of preempting in spades, but i am not sure if it is correct on this eau de cologine hand|pg||
nt|tez: do you overcall with helgemo's hand?|pg||
nt|stc: what about a 3rd @s round ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: or a 3rd spade even|pg||
nt|phil:  you have a q of 2@h on the offchance South has a hand|pg||
nt|barnets: it is helpfull that the @D 10 falls|pg||
nt|barnets: doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: but he could have survived without it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|iceking: declerar will lose 3 @S tricks and 2 @C tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if you bid 3@c then i would double 3@s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: I would prefeer to trust my partner instead of my opponents|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: done|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tokay1975:   this is true he just took the risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow I think that EW have played a few times and pretty much know their system:)|pg||
nt|barnets: by drawing a second trump before ruffing a second spade|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lml: they have doubled 7@C in the OR so we should have a pickup for Canada|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, i retract -- W didn't double 6@D -- he bid 7@C instead|pg||
nt|bt: cologne|pg||
nt|caitlin: no X is big plus for Diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fortunately, with the very friendly position, 2@S may scrape home|pg||
nt|phil:  lead advertises clubs as 2-2 (or 4-0)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's funny - E/W are playing trumps to stop South from getting ruffs.   Little do they know!!|pg||
nt|warrens:  a club to dummy and a small @D now?|pg||
nt|warrens:  best if ducked by West|pg||
nt|barnets: then he could cash his @D A and claim if trumps 3-2 and clubs come in|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'll bet a coke he'll make it, but it will take a while.|pg||
nt|benjy: Would you bid 4@S David? Do you consider it close?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|delberto:  declarer will feel secure in this contract :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|tokay1975: they have been playing together for years|pg||
nt|toral5: we have a new leader now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gulyas: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, N is on the wrong wavelength|pg||
nt|bessi2: but now it will make comfortably|pg||
nt|stc: small defense error(@c before 2nd @s)....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Camberos thinking|pg||
nt|tez: bi-color hands are very valuable after finding a fit|pg||
nt|stc: here the fit is "moderate"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: still thinking|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: I know East-West and they are pretty sensible |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt certainly helped their cause here -- in a sense|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tez: in this sequence, there is no fit|pg||
nt|tez: down 1 now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bt: and now i wait for the questions? lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: claim early, claim often|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: we shouldnt see too much mischief from them|pg||
nt|mamos: on Bd 17 the most interesting answer refers to North not having any clear alternative action|pg||
nt|dburn: I don;t think this will work - West can play either minor now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: well, 7@cx is a bit on the naughty side |pg||
nt|toral5: turning out to be a first few gr8 brds for @D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: "No spades partner?" asks North|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stc: not the percentage trump handling here|pg||
nt|andersk: Im getting mixed comments from specs regarding auction on the previous hand, however IMO 3 @D looks forceing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: they won cavendish  i thk 2times and lots of success in usa nationals|pg||
nt|andersk: I beleve East too a gut shot by passing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: and also best pair of  egypt they are very experienced players|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: did not bat an eye|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Impressive.  But internally, he's going "what the ..."|pg||
nt|warrens:  may not have enough communication|pg||
nt|dburn: and I don't see how he's supposed to avoid losing to West's @d7 one way or another|pg||
nt|barnets: to make the hand I think he had to led the @DQ from hand at trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: now e/w are helpless|pg||
nt|barnets: but if East had the @DK that would not look good|pg||
nt|barnets: after the @DQ he had communication to ruff two spades and get back to hand|pg||
nt|barnets: twice|pg||
nt|tlc: right|pg||
nt|barnets: it was not an impossible play to find but difficult|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petepunt: again protecting v 4-1 breaks may cost an imp or 2|pg||
nt|xenya: same 3 down but an 8-imp gain|pg||
nt|dburn: I would bid 4@s for sure, and I don't consider it particularly close|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: down now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|pg||
mc|9|nt|blum1956: strange play  in trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: first he doubled, then apparently asked for undo|pg||
nt|zbig1959: dn1, 2 imos back to Pland|pg||

nt|copeyj: i dont know their methods|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe this is a shape relay|pg||
nt|dagold: or maybe he did bid 3@s?|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|nt|dagold: most interesting for specs is a spade lead of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: and Jaseem will lead a SpaDE?|pg||

nt|gulyas: I doubt it|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op?  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|lml: so Canada starts off with a nice lead|pg||
nt|lml: and if you think I am impartial just look at my flag|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  we saw what happened in the last round...  |pg||
nt|xenya: S clearly meant the double as penalty|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think when you have specific agreements it's much easier to make decisions...E felt his Kings were not located well, hence the pass on a very marginal game.|pg||
nt|andersk: Reda is telling me RD is unlimited and Elahmady took a chanse passing, I trust reda, he knowes these players better than all of us together:)|pg||
nt|tez: he played hopeless|pg||
nt|phil:  3N might have been fun|pg||
nt|Gerben42: turn it off again then|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess if we see nothing happen - everyone has gone outside|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if yout told him he had just won 3 IMPs on the board he would be a greatly relieved man|pg||
nt|phil: I doubt this table will get into time trouble :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: they are not being helpful here. |pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3dia is  for sure  forcing  no need to discuss  about tthgat|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@S here for ew |pg||
nt|barnets: another big chance n/s|pg||
nt|delberto:  lol|pg||
nt|benjy: Polish lead back up to 36|pg||
nt|zbig1959: maybe 4@S in silence wld be played by EW,|pg||
mb|1N|nt|iceking: only problem is bidding it |pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: but he needed the 1st round finess then|pg||
nt|toral5: 5@C coming up now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@C = 16+|pg||
mb|2C|nt|petepunt: need good wriggle after a weak nt|pg||
nt|petepunt: often 4! and 4 card suot |pg||
nt|lml: yes the momentum can certainly change but this is a very steady east-west pair|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3@S was not a good spot|pg||
nt|andyv:  meantime back to board 20....|pg||
nt|tokay1975: %100 forcing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1 - 2 - 4 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  9 as per the movie|pg||
nt|lml: I have never ever seen them get rattled|pg||
nt|iceking: yes if you use drury here 2@S is fine|pg||
nt|barnets: this time I think they will take it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bt: ns is precision style clubbers?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ok  so specs we are just catching up here   no biddiing ust results|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: we are suffering a technical problem im fixing it|pg||
nt|mamos: the only swing so far was on Board 18   a real monster  - East at this table made a real error in defence of 6@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@C and 4 higher|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 5@C|pg||
nt|toral5: greco will probably bid 3@D|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 3@H still on, 9 tricks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|stc: weak NT produces interesting situations|pg||
nt|lml: this is a good vul game and it will make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly mmisfit|pg||
nt|udo: cards are wellpaced for EW , esp. @H 3-3|pg||
nt|udo: wellplaced|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead likely against 3NT    so with hearts behaving  9 tricks not difficult|pg||
nt|udo: bidding is the matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: with no particular fits this hand is headed to 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: better|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry corrected now|pg||
nt|andersk: 2 NT good/bad now?|pg||
nt|xenya: S needs little from N for 5@C to be a good contract|pg||
nt|phil:  4@s has problems on a heart lead - otherwise skates home|pg||
nt|ady: yes   might stop short|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+  [they open lowest 4 card suit, so not 4@D & 4@C]|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in game next door|pg||
nt|zbig1959: slam @H from N seat (well placed) - makeable|pg||
nt|benjy: another potential swing board, north south could make 6@H but would have to guess the position in a @S lead|pg||
nt|benjy: on a @S lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|blum1956: anyway 2@h looks like a standard contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42: drury is one of those conventions a modern player can hardly do without it seems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: that's how you get to 4S|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is rock solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT again|pg||
nt|lml: maybe they will try for more|pg||
nt|stc: last spot to go +|pg||
nt|andersk: I like this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: problm for north.if he dutifully bids 3nt,@S suit is exposed|pg||
nt|xenya: just 4 cards in clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Studied understatement Phil - on a heart lead it looks doomed|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|iceking: true good convention|pg||
nt|ady: this could be 800|pg||
nt|udo: 3@C much better than 2 @S|pg||
nt|othered1: improving the contract.  2@S could have been bloody|pg||
nt|tez: big brother says down 1 but we will see:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so this will be 6 imps to Poland|pg||
nt|zbig1959: reasonable stop on level partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: nope|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S would have been down 2 on best defence|pg||
nt|toral5: same contract in other room?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I like your caution - good commentary technique|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure I would lead a spade if both opponents appear to be balanced|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|mamos: just not many tricks |pg||
nt|tokay1975: just made 2nt |pg||
nt|caitlin: yes same contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: not very exciting again|pg||
nt|lml: this is a coffee break hand for sure|pg||
nt|stc: 6,7 @s are good cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Cunning lead. I believe Drijver did a similar thing against Bocchi some years ago in an Olympiad - Bocchi got the suit wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid|pg||
nt|barnets: i think|pg||
nt|dburn: but South is just relaying|pg||
nt|zbig1959: seems S asked opener about his cards - 51H.. 4@C - cue bid, lack of @S cue bid|pg||
nt|benjy: in the OR east led a trump against slam|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure I would double 4@d either - whose lead is it going to be, after all?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: Teatime in England :)|pg||
nt|lml: Results from this event are at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm|pg||
nt|bt: west will lead a club and declarer will play on diamonds after running it to the 9|pg||
nt|bessi2: it sure looks like a strong club auction to me|pg||
nt|barnets: souths hearts are better than north thinks|pg||
nt|dburn: again, though, Levin may think he is supposed to bid on after 3NT - should partner really have all this in hearts?|pg||
nt|udo: 5@D works too for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: but still, reasonable to stop in partscore|pg||
nt|delberto:  south's 2C was forcing to game  I presume ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
nt|delberto:  and so NOrth's 3NT was weak|pg||
nt|benjy: there is no point, you are only helping the opps, and besides you don't necessarily want a @D lead|pg||
mb|5C|nt|yuval10: declarer wasn't fooled by the lead|pg||
nt|tez: i mean..he played without any hope|pg||
nt|toral5: should 3@D on 3@C be treated as forcing?or ONLY 6-5 better hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: not forcing|pg||
nt|kjadams: must be tempting to try a third D, but that allows overtrick.|pg||
nt|barnets: and norths spades are better than south thinks|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he should and spades was what he was really worried about|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have come out of this well|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, if I double 4@d and then lead a spade, declarer may well go wrong|pg||
mb|5D|nt|phil:  Bill I have said so many wrong things in VG that I couch everything  (except what I just said :))|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer will reach dummy with a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: short break|pg||
nt|barnets: as west has to duck the first round|pg||
nt|barnets: the question is if the defense can come to 1 heart 1 diamond 1 spade and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|tlc: dbl dummy i think this can be beat..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken out of the room|pg||
nt|dburn: at double dummy, I guess West can win the first spade - and on the bidding and after the first trick, that's not impossible at all|pg||
nt|barnets: it will be helpful to west when east cant beat dummys @H10 |pg||
nt|dburn: declarer will, after all, be marked with a singleton spade when East does not play an honor on the first round of hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: he will give count|pg||
nt|tlc: then return heart..duck first club and then lead diamond when in with club..win D, shift back to hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: but he still does not know south has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now we are ready agaibn|pg||
nt|barnets: remeber jhe opened 1@D not 1@C|pg||
nt|udo: 5@D down with @S ruff of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 3@H cue is stronger bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H was almost GF|pg||
nt|xenya: at least N had no difficulty bidding 5|pg||
nt|toral5: @S ace not known yet.declarer does have problems|pg||
nt|xenya: if N happened to have an ace, he would have cuebid, then S bids 6 i think|pg||
nt|toral5: may be if he leads @S now,@D finesse will be marked|pg||
nt|toral5: in lieu of sementas 1@H opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: though with 3rd seat opening, no guarantees|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: my friend points out:if 3@H is near gf,wt is 4@D suppose to be on 3@C?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: might be key card for some pairs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, ditto|pg||
nt|phil:  out of the blue double? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I doubt this contract is actually doubled ... so am expecting a flat board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no it is x|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but|pg||
nt|zbig1959: wow, 6@H at other room|pg||
mb|6C|nt|phil:  well they did walk it into 4@s...|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@D, after @S, @S?|pg||
nt|delberto:  no problems here|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|toral5: 6-3@D fit can be easily missed playing auto keys in the form of 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: i think 2@s GOES 1 OFF BUT would age them 10 years in def!|pg||
nt|tez: he is very good player|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Gold must have seen the DVDi|pg||
nt|lml: Thurston and Willis in the OR are also very steady players.  Not spectacular but few errors|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see how declarer can get to 10 tricks here -- well, maybe with a little help from the opposition...|pg||
nt|xenya: N's @H9 may be a big card|pg||
nt|mamos: no may about it  :)  it's a BIG card|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm talking double-dummy though -- down 2 is not out of the question|pg||
nt|zbig1959: only @S lead create some problem here|pg||
nt|benjy: he won't lead a @C or a @D in my opinion|pg||
nt|benjy: its between a @S and a trump|pg||
nt|zbig1959: lights on Paul ...|pg||
nt|benjy: I would lead a trump personally|pg||
nt|zbig1959: N showed one ace by 5@C - must be A@S , thast why passive lead (trump) ??|pg||
nt|benjy: but i hope he leads a @S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|zbig1959: trump lead from me wld be.. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|copeyj: Declarer has gone down, if Paske crosses with @S now for Robertson to play @DQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: :)|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|mamos: its just not obvious how declarer should even set about trying to make cards|pg||
nt|iceking: cant blame Steve it looked like best shot |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|caitlin: 4@D is bidding shape imho|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||

nt|yuval10: will be interesting to see if S will open in 3rd hand here|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd!!|pg||
nt|kjadams: I suspect the table tempo told steve it would not work, and he properly ignored it.|pg||
nt|dburn: pumice stone solid, maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Pachtman showed it to Helgemo|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3@S on this deal next door|pg||
nt|zbig1959: the same contract, the same play and result, no SWING, next deal|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: that must be the only interesting thing about this hand|pg||
nt|lml: well he didnt get a chance!|pg||
nt|bt: i would bid 5@C here, and pay the prics|pg||
nt|bt: price|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4@c from Cohler I expect|pg||
nt|bessi2: or 5@c maybe|pg||
nt|tlc: a very hard earned push|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 20/20|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|lml: is this the right board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Two missing passes?|pg||
nt|xenya: we are missing two passes i think|pg||
nt|caitlin: easy 4@S|pg||
nt|toral5: another push coming up|pg||
nt|iceking: yes good point Boyd took some time before he played @D Q in trick 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@S alerted suggests its intermediate|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@S looks like sound 2 could be 10-13hcp but iam just guessing|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: Bapat has a tough bid here|pg||
nt|mamos: West probably feels he doesnt want to pass|pg||
nt|vicky888:  yess,  maybe 1n|pg||
nt|lml: he wont pass|pg||
nt|lml: he can always raise diamonds|pg||
nt|blum1956: beautiful 6@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: surely the only 2 options I should think|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2s = 10-12, could have side 4 card heart suit.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10-13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: can't see alerts...sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was that really +2  or just +1?|pg||
nt|phil: if he pitched the spade it was +2|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 1NT seems possible...yep|pg||
nt|andersk: This should be an easy 4@H  If they bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 20 a moral victory this set for Bramley squad|pg||
nt|phil:  sorry - flaky wifi|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3D = hearts|pg||
nt|iceking: with takout dbl from east iam not sure Boyd should be bidding here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i doubt that he should - dont think Nickell was going to sit but now...|pg||
nt|iceking: but its fair maybe he didnt want to defend vs 3@C or 3@D|pg||
nt|delberto:  a spade was discarded I think... |pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks a reasonable stop|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: no one seems able to get hold of this match  chance for EW to bid a slam here|pg||
nt|bt: 4@C is more succesful here but i am stubborn :-)|pg||
nt|bessi2: this will make unless they manage to cash the ace of @h in time|pg||
nt|ritong: i wondered, phil  what is a swim meet?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh thx - i missed the @S discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they claimed for 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: I entered only final contrqct qnd score we will catch uo soon|pg||
nt|mamos: to explain for new specs e have had problems  ust catching up   normal service soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  by W|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 4tricks for defence by top, 2trump, 2@D |pg||
nt|copeyj: West might have tried a double here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petepunt: tough to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: pass here could be played in few ways, iam not sure how they play it|pg||
nt|passell: will Willenken let him off the hook here is the question|pg||
nt|tlc: would everyone else DBL with levin's hand..or rebid 1NT instead?|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N for me|pg||
nt|passell: 1nt is very dangerous|pg||
nt|othered1: north looks like a h and to Stayman and pass response|pg||
nt|delberto:  looks like EW will bid to a slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: he'll wish hed supported Diamonds now|pg||
nt|vicky888:  i m not sure 2d in place of 1n would show the strength he holds|pg||
nt|lml: a surprise lead|pg||
nt|lml: but actually diamonds is the better spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably Lev was too conservative|pg||
nt|stc: note that 3@dX may bring 800|pg||
nt|andersk: 3@C is my choise|pg||
nt|passell: passed partner couldnt bid over 1d|pg||
nt|udo: north will pass now|pg||
nt|copeyj: which they have made|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzsv: asked from 4 Y|pg||
nt|lml: he chose to open a lead directing club rather than his 5 card heart suit|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand was nightmarish for EW -- think we can expect a minus from the other room as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should bid 4@h now|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 4@H is righthanded now|pg||
nt|stc: camberos runing out of boards|pg||
nt|bg: Hi all|pg||
nt|phil:  sounds like a singles event, i know :)|pg||
nt|ritong: naah:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2S P 3H would have been game forcing with 6+ hearts.|pg||
nt|iceking: can he make this on @C lead |pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this can be defeated and probably will|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will get to 4@S|pg||
nt|andersk: only 9 tricks if played in W with a @C lead|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk this is not easy after trump lead 4h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if they lead it|pg||
nt|andyv:  close decision because W has forced and doesn't know the quality of the E's hand...3@h could be on anything including Jxxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: pass denied 2 hearts|pg||
nt|iceking: best is duck this and hope they play 3 rounds of diamond|pg||
nt|kjadams: Pass also denied really good spades.   The transfer is not 100% forced.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Katz will try to avoid declarer shortening his trumps|pg||
nt|iceking: then he can ruff home, enter @C ace finesse @H and play 3 rounds of @S ruff home and exit in @C|pg||
nt|iceking: first he has to duck this |pg||
nt|othered1: Nice lead.  This can still go down a couple|pg||
nt|copeyj: and there we go|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 6 imps to England|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry about that |pg||
nt|andersk: Jxxx can be enuff|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you need luck|pg||
nt|tez: very hard to beat|pg||
nt|warrens:  especially at unfav|pg||
nt|benjy: after the 2@C relay west will probably lead a @D which will makes declarer's task rather easy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: excellent slam for EW now, with all their honours working|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, finally a good pick up for Bramley|pg||
nt|passell: between pass and dbl for me|pg||
nt|benjy: a @H lead would make life far more interesting but will he won't find that, why should he?|pg||
nt|zbig1959:   @D lead..   yet|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: np|pg||
nt|Gerben42: there are some interesting options on different retunrs from Katz|pg||
nt|warrens:  this lead will make much easier for declarer|pg||
nt|warrens:  it |pg||
nt|barnets: well he had to bid to save the board|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: sensible facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|stc: just cash the first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: seems to me as a serious 3nt;seeking a minor cue from sementa|pg||
nt|udo: 2 down possible,,4 @D and 2 aces|pg||
nt|tez: if they bid 5@d very hard for EW..dbl or 5@d|pg||
nt|tez: 5@h i mean|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 4@S Xed, -1, 8 imps for England|pg||
nt|benjy: J@D then a low @S looks best|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andersk: I would not risk pass here|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Bruce|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: short break|pg||
nt|tez: 20/0 this section|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we are back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: bathroom|pg||
nt|zbig1959: seems the best line for declarer is play by @s's.. , small @S ducked...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tez: sry..i mean to 3@c|pg||
nt|barnets: otherwise he would lose a swing|pg||
pc|c8|nt|stc: same answer, cash the first 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: lol|pg||
nt|iceking: now he has wrong timing|pg||
nt|ady: north intending to pass any response to 2@C   2@D  a decent spot    likely donw 1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: cute he ducked the doubleton @DK confident he would get it anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: waiting for the photographer to finish before he does anything.|pg||
nt|bg: HI Vlad|pg||
nt|delberto:  7 hearts 3 side-suit aces and two diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if the difference is maintained, the teams are tied|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 147 apiece|pg||
nt|tez: what do you lead to 3@c from N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S RKC @H??   or  maybe some other ask|pg||
nt|delberto:  play will be brief Iimagine :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  have to trust partner|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|mamos: we would have expected them to bid that|pg||
nt|bg: note that Hampson doesnt bother with a bad suit vul preempt|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: on the previous board, EW in the other room reached 3N -- also 3 down|pg||
nt|copeyj: painless down 1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andersk: what would partner bid with: xx, 10xxxxx, xx,xxx?|pg||
nt|bt: so the cautious 4@C was a winner, i predict a few imps for mahaffey here|pg||
nt|udo: where is his 7th trick ?|pg||
nt|ady: yes   down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: Neutral defense will give ew 7 tricks.  @C shift would cost a trick, as cards lie|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: not an easy lead for Levin at all - was trying to give nothing away, because the opponents seemed to have bid and supported diamonds and @dA was likely to be in dummy|pg||
nt|ady: duck this  and defence  has to be careful to get it down 2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: North has to sort out that they can cash clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: North might have done better to cash top Club at trick One before playing Heart|pg||
nt|vicky888:  it is inevitable now but to cash two top clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores in all groups|pg||
nt|lml: actually it is a link to swan bridge|pg||
nt|lml: which has the running scores... either place will do|pg||
nt|petepunt: lev only has worjking 9 count and east cant really mve over 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i believe the safety play in trumps here is !K, then small to the 9|pg||
nt|yuval10: will likely play K@d and @s to the Ace, following the opening by S|pg||
nt|yuval10: K@s of course, as Vladimir suggested|pg||
nt|udo: yes @D or @S needed now for down 2|pg||
nt|copeyj: the English North next door contented himself with a game try|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andersk: then 4@H is @H2-2 or a @S hook or QJ stiffed in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on agreements but in this same auction, 4@h without blinking... I'm not sure why E didn't bid 4 with present hand|pg||
nt|xenya: only at these colours i bet :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: why??|pg||
nt|kjadams: win club, 3 rounds of spades ruffing, exit diamond would work.|pg||
nt|tlc: DBL is not entirely safe either...if the opps RDBL, you can still go for a number|pg||
nt|udo: wd|pg||
nt|othered1: ni, it's -2 against almost anything but high @S from west|pg||
nt|ady: east may be squeezed in the end position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Greco asking lots of questions about opp's carding|pg||
nt|zbig1959: claim time|pg||
pc|s2|nt|toral5: nice finesse:)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: declarer try take 4@D 3@H 1@C 1@S, buit some communication problem here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|benjy: interesting line, if the @C lost and a @H came back, he would then play a @D towards dummy, but if that was ducked he could run out of tricks, it would come down to the @Cs i guess|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|othered1: How squeeze?|pg||
nt|udo: no squeeze|pg||
pc|cA|nt|udo: eas can discard 2 @C and 1 @S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andersk: Im sure they will discuss this board later today|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @h?or @d ace?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: missed swing by McIntosh, instead shift @CQ, @S and cut of comm line for declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: sorry   no squeeze|pg||
pc|cT|nt|passell: yes as much as I love to bid passing is certainly a possibility|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|iceking: no east can just cash his winners and leave Boyd with trumps in hand|pg||
nt|kjadams: need heart 9 strangely is entry if defense shifts to trumps.|pg||
nt|iceking: aha there is that @H 9 in dummy correct|pg||
nt|warrens:  this will be 5 very valuable imps for Wolfson|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but you can't just sit there and pass with 18 Miltons|pg||
nt|barnets: well put|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: well the defence made it hard on themselves but they got there|pg||
nt|tokay1975: east doesnot know his pd has 22 with 6quick  . still  he has a minumum  not  worst one but still minumum so i agree 3h|pg||

nt|mamos: We are approaching halfway in this set  England supporters are looking for a swing or two   some momentum is needed |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe there's a chance here|pg||

nt|tejjyid: can only bid 6 with mirrors|pg||
nt|andersk: I also agree 3 @h, but I will never risk pass witW hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, if his pd had simply an invite hand, he'd bid 3@h... his 3@d says he has an even bigger hand... now QJ10xx is a great suit|pg||
nt|bt: cashing @DA would have been costly if east holding was T97 ...|pg||
nt|stc: I have 7 red cards and 6 black ones, an omen to lead a red :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: risky doesnt need that finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: my fault -- no practice finesse|pg||
nt|iceking: anyway Boyd should have done better here in the play|pg||
nt|passell: slows down the opponents and gives away ards|pg||
nt|udo: boards much more quiet as in last session so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: Poland in 5@D on this deal next door|pg||
mb|1N|nt|stc: next slam for EW|pg||
nt|andersk: every day partner have 5  card+@H a game is huge favourite to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, 7 imps to Bramley as they break into the scoring column|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3h is exactly shows 4 card heart. 3dia maybe less then this  with 3|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate slam for n.s|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: Yes a @S shift would have defeated 3NT|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|bt: some systems must open nt w 2254s ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|petepunt: 6@H by west is good|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gulyas: game is comfortable, yes|pg||
nt|stc: after 1@s by S good from any hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  last point... I'm sure they play lebensohl, so E hand is already limited to less than 8 hcp |pg||
nt|ritong: lots=8, but with his "hand", is not that bad|pg||
nt|phil:  2@c alerted?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
nt|tez: other table called director after 4@H is made, score may change|pg||
nt|phil: Tor has a great hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: one philosophy is to find the right suit as opposed to the right level|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: now these don't fit as well|pg||
nt|andersk: We are not talking about what 3 @D showes, IMO it is just general force, and 3 H is nothing more to say, still 4 @h is makeable from W point of view, so IMO I would bid 4@H|pg||
nt|tez: i love support dbl:)|pg||
nt|phil:  @c + higher perhaps?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: xx alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: hide, Roland, hide|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1¬C shows 11-16 on this auction (1516 )|pg||
nt|lml: this will be quite a challenge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thin 4@H EW  - diamond lead gives a few problems|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you would be right:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Geir does not|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Even by East - it doesn't matter after the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|lml: I cant see a way to make this but lets see|pg||
nt|lml: ducking this might be a start|pg||
nt|lml: the longer he thinkgs the more likely he is to get a diamond shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: often during the bidding alerts consist of pointing to the card.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS play standard count |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: typically an explaination isnt provided until end of auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they just point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: and write notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and king demands count|pg||
nt|bessi2: 5@d is a very good contract but will fail unless declarer has x-ray vision |pg||
nt|caitlin: 1@D could be 2+|pg||
nt|bg: 2 H good treatment shows 5-4 weak in majors|pg||
nt|caitlin: hold on|pg||
nt|tez: why?no idea|pg||
nt|tez: i have no idea|pg||
nt|zbig1959: wow, McIntosh make game try ?? |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: we'll be awash with coffee |pg||
nt|bjacobs: tough call for East|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vicky888:  :)|pg||
nt|phil:  sotm x? |pg||
nt|ritong: in good company, pointing means " it s artificial", displaying the alert card means " beware it s highly artif"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and he finds a choice that no one will understand, possibly including himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless defense fails to lead trump OR  Helness guesses @H10|pg||
nt|benjy: 30 down and ther chance of a vul game, of course one should make a try|pg||
nt|zbig1959: they must be really motivated for agressive play |pg||
pc|h3|nt|toral5: helping lead for hampson.trump lead wd have been interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can just imagine Sadek thinking: "what the hell am I meant to do now?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he wrote a note|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|udo: @D to jack or @D to nine ?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Board 23 actually in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ended in 5@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EAst should bid more here; 3@H was conservative;4@H was extremely conservative|pg||
nt|petepunt: east is very good for auction,  i assume he would bid 2@S with a 16_+ 1@C hand|pg||
nt|mamos: can anyone see a way of making 12?  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they are going to reach 6 here|pg||
nt|bt: so the lead will tell south who has @SAK, then a club finesse and the !K is placed, what is east doubling on??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: thinking is good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: picked up cards and looked again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: looking at your cards is good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they did not change|pg||
nt|barnets: with the lie of the @S suit east has to cover the @S9 with the 10 to promote the 6|pg||
nt|othered1: video wasn't up last set|pg||
nt|zbig1959: opps, disaster at other room.. defence didnt take 2 @H tricks,|pg||
nt|zbig1959: so, 10 imps back to Young Lions :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|blum1956: 3@h showing 15+ 5@c4@h|pg||
nt|mamos: i expect them to bid slam|pg||
nt|tlc: flannery worked out well on this hand...north never could know that South had anything and didn'd overbid..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess since it falls 3rd -- Helness always loses just 1@H|pg||
nt|delberto:  and a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [i try not to look at opp cards while planning declarer play]|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: best to be on the safe side|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  with 6 tricks off the top, declarer should make his contract, thus another swing for Lavazza team|pg||
nt|caitlin: I gather Pietro Forquet is in spec......pls join us commentating|pg||
nt|toral5: queens are co-operating wel here|pg||
nt|bg: if he happens to cash AK Dia and Ak spades he will make 4|pg||
nt|toral5: wlcm to the legend pietro forquet;and my favourite bridge player:)|pg||
nt|toral5: dont think he can make 4.1@S,1@C and 3@H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|zbig1959: if WE try play 4@S, defence need play 3x @H, 3rd @H ruffed by J@S, dn1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tez: if there were just one right, we would all play that|pg||
nt|tlc: in fact, south might not have even had 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w still have 2 trump tricks and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Rosenberg thinking, motionless|pg||
nt|barnets: it looks like they will make exactly 2 for 5 imps|pg||
nt|barnets: and bring the margin down to 20|pg||
nt|delberto:  now the trump switch is required|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: as the cards lie declarer can arranger to ruff a Diamond in dummy but requires perfect timing and a rather fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: Michael Rosenberg points out the winnin line: dummy reversal on a non-diamond lead. If a @D is led, you can engineer a @D ruff in dummy...|pg||
nt|xenya: because 4 clubs are 3 trumps are in the same hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 1-4 halfway -- very tight match|pg||
nt|bt: maybe a @D after 2 trumps ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: but still.... extremely tough to do I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: that's why bridge is great|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: his hand is better than that though, all honours concentrated|pg||
nt|tez: 26 imp..its hard but not posible|pg||
nt|delberto:  well defended|pg||
nt|zbig1959: claim is coming..|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: so, E described his hand...|pg||
nt|andyv:  options are pretty limited as to how to play the hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: When North did not (strangely) overcall 1@S on the previous board they did not get to the spade game|pg||
nt|stc: HH are putting pressure on each board, very hard to play against them|pg||
nt|barnets: the fleisher team won the US team trials and will represent them in next years bermuda bowl|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: now it remains to make it|pg||
nt|mamos: ok this will be interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: but not quick I guess|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I wonder about north's 4N bid.. could surely be a big winner but with 2 aces including a singleton ace on lead...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 12 imps to Poles|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vicky888:  so the only action brd till now is the first brd tht i missed ..yawn |pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, pretty much boring hands so far|pg||
nt|bg: gets two discards on club Q Dia J and throws 3 rd heat while W ruffs|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tejjyid: no, only if you think HCP describe a hand|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: in holland|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|petepunt: not so easy for polish club methods here|pg||
nt|barnets: will be 4 imps not 5|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: actualy, playing strength is more important|pg||
nt|xenya: looks right to start with the @C finesse|pg||
nt|toral5: ya cos duboin dint shift to @S at trick 2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: for 160|pg||
pc|s9|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|toral5: now ll make only 2|pg||

nt|bg: making two lost two tricks by not drawing trump after dia AK|pg||
nt|iceking: rule of 15 Steve |pg||
nt|iceking: hcp plus spades if 15 or more you should open |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: on last hand Robinson put the double card on the tray!!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice controlled auction, nice defense|pg||
nt|zbig1959: ty Operator|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 28 imps , and 10 remaining bds.. |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|andyv:  W has almost a perfect hand for E|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: maybe more at stake here|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3NT looks close|pg||
nt|iceking: with 5 spades to defend his action his hand was ugly|pg||
nt|kjadams: They open some really really bad 11's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bad dummy|pg||
nt|zbig1959: @C = polish club, usually weak nt.. |pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: and 6@S failed at the other table|pg||
nt|toral5: here comes a slam|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Things are getting awkwardf for Italio/Egyptians|pg||
nt|iceking: ok so he knew they could never make much|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i guess if partner can be trusted to open most hands - you can take a laid-back view in 4th|pg||
nt|udo: freaks for North and east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: computer pointer is jumping all over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry|pg||
nt|copeyj: Paske may choose to double to show 5m4M|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: it does  but maybe a trick too far|pg||
nt|bt: well it is alot easier seeing all hands |pg||
nt|toral5: trump q missing,dont think ll be bid|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hey John.  Want to find a pard and play against me and my pard?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But they could recover 10 here by bidding the ok vul game|pg||
nt|caitlin: Herve is our contact for that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  after this 3d difficult to go for 3nt|pg||
nt|gulyas: looks like 8 tricks from top, and maybe a slow @S winner, but he may not get there|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S??|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody forgot their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry for the delay, I can only see 1 side of the screen.|pg||
nt|vicky888:  definitely getting penalized heavily|pg||
nt|petepunt: another 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: weak no shape or strong|pg||
nt|xenya: intermediate 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S shows a good opening bid. |pg||
nt|lml: fair enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pinot Noir are leadong Apteker 30-0 and are in second place |pg||
nt|bjacobs: tough call for West|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: i d vent 3@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: asking for a stopper - has merit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: spreading and closing hnad|pg||
nt|bjacobs: another possibility is 4NT, committing to 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: each one of these plyer do something diff|pg||
nt|iceking: is 3@H invitational John|pg||
nt|kjadams: no forcing|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H would be non forcing free bid.|pg||
nt|kjadams: and a negative double maxes at 5 hearts.|pg||
nt|zbig1959: on reopen, X the same 5+m4M?|pg||
nt|copeyj: This should go 3 down one would think - @H lead and declarer will make 4@h and then the defence shld be able to work out what to do|pg||
nt|zbig1959: defence has 9 tricks by top|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|mamos: are they about to be rescued|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some discussion, i cant hear|pg||
nt|vicky888:  North also thinking on similar lines... to rescue|pg||
nt|mamos: North has no business rescuing|pg||
nt|mamos: no one has doubled yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: can we get a director in the room |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S makes no sense from a passed partner - North does best to pass quickly and pray|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: got one thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this may be messy|pg||
nt|mamos: we dont have Convention cards so it's difficult to be sure but it seems likely North's 2@H showed both majors and that he forgot |pg||
nt|tez: very diciplined 3@h opening:)|pg||
nt|iceking: aha so 3@H gf|pg||
nt|barnets: now it was very dangerous for east to bid|pg||
nt|barnets: thus his pass|pg||
nt|tlc: conservative pass by rosenberg..|pg||
nt|othered1: How was that played to only 5?|pg||
nt|udo: 6 or 7 @SD here ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petepunt: presume rdb shows a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|stc: standard weak NT methods here|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is in trouble - he does not like to defend 1NT redoubled with that sort of hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: good thing screen up|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but he goes with a more cautious alternative ... 3@D is probably a constructive bid (using Lebensohl for the weak hands), but is it enough?|pg||
nt|barnets: over 1@S|pg||
nt|warrens:  I thought he would double|pg||
nt|zbig1959: rt now Mroczkowski tries his declarers skilss|pg||
nt|benjy: another chance for a swing|pg||
nt|benjy: even if declarer guesses the diamonds he is still down|pg||
nt|benjy: he needs the diamonds to come in and the @C hook|pg||
nt|zbig1959: done.. even if declarer guess @D, he has only 8 tricks, dn1 at least|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vicky888:  lucky to get passed|pg||
nt|tez: i would open 2@h in this vuln|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 6N|pg||
nt|toral5: kibs saying 6nt in the other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: just open www.bbotv.com/vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: 6N is superiour to 6@S|pg||
nt|iceking: Nickell with poor def and 6-4 shape should bid on after pd support him on 3rd level |pg||
nt|ady: grand for n/s   especially east unable to lead a trump|pg||
nt|caitlin: vul Helness in waiting|pg||
nt|tez: interesting pass to 3@h|pg||
nt|tez: dbl was not for penaty|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 6@D2@C1@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: West may still want to talk to the director -- it may depend on what the correct partnership agreement is|pg||
nt|stc: No, XX is automatic|pg||
nt|xenya: but then E's pass is too timid?|pg||
nt|lml: East pass is very strange to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: may have been discribed as intermediate on the other side of the screen.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C sure looks tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described sorry|pg||
nt|lml: it was a momentary lapse no doubt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT has reasonable play, but the hands fit well |pg||
nt|lml: these guys have played together forever so they probably do no what it means|pg||
nt|iceking: but he was very right not doing so|pg||
nt|iceking: but i still dont like it|pg||
nt|kjadams: yes.  I'd have been wrong too.|pg||
nt|tlc: but certainly reasonable|pg||
nt|udo: 4@D helgemo?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: once we get 4@H from Helness instead   operator will be able to make opening lead|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: yes suit not strong, hard to read writing|pg||
nt|stc: Nunes passed but he also landed in 4@h !|pg||
nt|tez: fantonies dont play weak 2|pg||
nt|bg: looks good to us but how to play at table?|pg||
nt|toral5: both 6@S and 6nt is dependent on guessing @S queen|pg||
nt|xenya: or not -- sorry|pg||
nt|benjy: this will be at least another 6 to England|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stc: N thinking about Christmas|pg||
nt|bt: this is a bordeline balancing 3@C i think|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: 4@s from E is very easy if W showed opening values|pg||
nt|caitlin: South African transfer|pg||
nt|toral5: how superior?|pg||
nt|caitlin: pd has 7|pg||
nt|tez: EW playing udca=up side down count attitude|pg||
nt|tez: if small goes down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: standard count|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I think|pg||
nt|tez: spec says  u/d attitude, standard count |pg||
nt|tez: very nice hand for match..|pg||
nt|tez: if they make...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Moss taking his time with this play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: has put his cards down and is staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|zbig1959: if declarer guess @D's, will be dn2, bcoz he must finn @C..|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  this auction gives W a much better view of E's hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and the opportunity goes begging.  Mind you, game does need a finesse through the weak two bidder|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 8 imps to England....:(|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: and 6+ @s's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 6n might go down a lot if things go badly|pg||
nt|toral5: ouch.13 away;unless open room misguesses the @S suit|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  picking up the cards so far|pg||
nt|othered1: In NS's Precision style, 1@S response is stronger than in standard Precision -- an omnibus 1@H bid handles hands with 8-11 poinnts, I think.|pg||
nt|udo: ruff 3 @C  s now ?  |pg||
nt|caitlin: has to take one of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
nt|udo: or play @C finesse ?|pg||
nt|othered1: why?|pg||
nt|tez: @h's are 2/2..1 way ticked for down|pg||
nt|zbig1959: opps, |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: EW  are likely to make a fair gain in any case|pg||
nt|stc: and eastern in the same time|pg||
nt|blum1956: Weak NT working!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Should've been thinking about his lead instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: looking like 800|pg||
nt|blum1956: The innocent 1@d opening with the North hand would have costed NS a lot |pg||
nt|blum1956: as compared to the weak NT|pg||
nt|stc: Weak NT is war :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: punch thinking about the whole hand, not just this play|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe k@S or 8@S is the choice|pg||
nt|stc: not best lead|pg||
nt|iceking: it looks like 2 down |pg||
nt|copeyj: well done by Paske|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  and still couldn't get to game|pg||
nt|benjy: did he really play that?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: we are ok now live now|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer in the OR didn't appear to have a real plan|pg||
nt|barnets: def need 4 spade tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: or @H|pg||
nt|othered1: coiunt your trikcs'|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|warrens:  W can get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|delberto:  on board 18 it looks like NS bid to 5S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense gets 2 tricks or 1   that's the entire drama|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: got it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: they may make five spade tricks now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: ok   live now :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|petepunt: if x is penalty then k@S is right|pg||
nt|stc: 500 most likely|pg||
nt|bt: wouldve pushed s to 3@C|pg||
nt|udo: can also ruff 3 clubs and hope for king coming down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petepunt: 800 on @C lead only|pg||
nt|tlc: down 2 now, as long as they get their ruffs|pg||
nt|zbig1959: Poles have 3 teamates in this deal on this table|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: two hearts, one spade and some number of trumps|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would have overcalled 2@c for sure.. but can be dangerous|pg||
nt|delberto:  and went one down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: wd|pg||
nt|zbig1959: E made a winning decision by pass , better dn2/3 in red than own play .. |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|zbig1959: seems, 5 imps to England, (if 1nt -3)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petepunt: 2@S 1!G 2@C and a rick in the wash for e/w|pg||
pc|cT|nt|udo: so 3 @C ruffs,,,no finesse needed|pg||

nt|bt: youre icelandic, a country not know for timidity in bidding :-)|pg||
nt|bt: or elsewhere|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
nt|iceking: this could be a big swing for Nickell|pg||
pc|dT|nt|toral5: diamond is on a roll|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S is a close affair, you can solve @S but both @Cs are offside|pg||
nt|iceking: score in this set after 7 boards is 6-3 |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|zbig1959: from dn3 to dn4 rt now|pg||
nt|benjy: incredible|pg||
nt|zbig1959: from -8 imps to +10 imps, swing worths 18 imps|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

pc|d8|nt|barnets: 2 imps e/w|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mamos: well card slie well here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes can beat it 4 if Robertson wins this, cashes @CK and plays @C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|caitlin: Bruce good point about last hand|pg||
nt|zbig1959: maybe McIntosh tired , i cant find another words..|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzsv: pause here a real one |pg||
nt|bessi2: I think were better bidders than bankers though.. close maybe :)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: Robertson defence in open cards, 1nt = 15-17, so S must have KQ@S J@C|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: campbell says he may have played it differently in 4.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 3 player went to wash room  lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they get to go but not me|pg||
nt|bessi2: but a passed hand 2@c overcall must be an option with such a pure hand|pg||

nt|bt: eventhough i am a chicken swede|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|nt|mamos: EW have defended ruthlessly|pg||

qx|c24|st||md|2SJ93HT952DK43CKJ3,S85HK743DAQ8CQT85,SAKT64HAQ6DT9CA72,SQ72HJ8DJ7652C964|sv|o|nt|mamos: Board 18 corrected I see|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: yes it was 6@d|pg||
nt|mamos: it was the same|pg||
nt|mamos: NS need to regroup|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Im not sure that was the right result. they said 6. |pg||
nt|vicky888:  it has to be down 6|pg||
nt|gulyas: it looked like -6, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thx|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know that letting opps play comfortable 2 level partscores is winning bridge at any form of scoring|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: all back now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess Sadek hated his doubleton heart, which was rather likely to be opposite a doubleton|pg||
nt|Gerben42: compared to 6-3, 7 IMPs is a big swing indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: yes:)|pg||
nt|iceking: not much has really happened this session|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: playing pretty crisply|pg||
nt|dburn: he didn't have to have @s10, though - maybe Paske should have played a higher spade|pg||
nt|zbig1959: w.o @H lead 6@C for EW|pg||
nt|benjy: It's good to take a break, compose oneself and then get back into it|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: it did seem unlikely that East had tried to casg the wrong Black Ace|pg||
nt|blum1956: 35!|pg||
nt|stc: 14 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend says whole different ball game. both agreed cant make 4|pg||
nt|lml: dont think you can make 4@S but 3NT was good if you could get there|pg||
nt|mamos: suddenly the Diamond team has a 30 imp lead|pg||
nt|xenya: more imps to Diamond here, who all of suuden have moved into a commanding lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this doesnt look very exciting either|pg||
nt|caitlin: if Helness doesnt cover......|pg||
mb|d|nt|kjadams: I have to ask if opponents allowed to play 4S undoubled after the 3H call.   Not sure.|pg||
nt|copeyj: the dreaded raptor 1N overcall|pg||
nt|copeyj: showing 4@h and a longer minor|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bt: 1@D-1@H; 2@D-3N???|pg||
nt|bjacobs: as indeed it was, but ...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT likely a transfer again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: nobody's asking|pg||
nt|iceking: last time they bid 1nt it was just natural|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i actuallt think you should play transfer defence|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: the cards are still big|pg||
nt|andyv:  neg. dlbl by W anyone?|pg||
nt|bt: yes ns in 3N i presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 5 EW high card points not working as both finesses stay|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  there's one:)|pg||
nt|stc: 5 matches are close or very close|pg||
nt|iceking: so i assume its just semi forcing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  dbl=@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: lol  spec suggests 7NT +2|pg||
nt|bessi2: a very reasonable prediction imo :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Trevor...would you rather Fulvio and Nunes play it?:)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  pass and double=values without support|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Richie Reisig|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He has been in all rooms soon :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: My fault|pg||
nt|reisig: Thx ...hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Roland has chased me all over|pg||
nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: you arrive as EW have a bidding challenge|pg||
nt|reisig: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Richie would just bid the cold 7NT|pg||
nt|reisig: shld be easy to reach 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical 3NT. Gold won't worry about his club void  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is not easy by any means|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: upside down count and attitude. reverse smith echos. lead low from 3 or 4 with or without an honor. |pg||
nt|yuval10: won't be so easy to beat this one|pg||
nt|mamos: im having connection probs   sorry everyone|pg||
nt|stc: see http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes - board 18|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Finals   Diamond 52 vs Nickell 39   only 40 boards left to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our playoff match ends with board 32|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: who likes 3N??/|pg||
nt|reisig: HATE IT|pg||
nt|mamos: not me|pg||
nt|reisig: But --- Huston will bid more|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C is 16+ so S looking ofr possible grand here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asking about leads and carding|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty contract|pg||
nt|caitlin: they won Spingold, 4 of them on Buffet Cup for U.S which won......so in good spirits I would think|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed if you check board 18 it seems they dont play transfers here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that lead sure struck gold|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||
nt|tlc: this is the only close match still going on..although Nickel proved you don't need to be real close, just within theoretical striking distance|pg||
nt|udo: 3@C now ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 10 trumps 3 Aces yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: certainly Fantoni|pg||
nt|caitlin: 10 trumps 2 Aces:)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@h=good raise|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 5@D , dn2, cheap save agaisnt cold 5@C, and again EW can play 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: grand not so good|pg||
nt|blum1956: the correct bidding leads to 6@s or 6NT - NS will undertand they are off the @sQ|pg||
nt|stc: 6NT much better|pg||
nt|tejjyid: CUrious decision not to cuebid 4@D by North|pg||
nt|lml: a heart shigt maybe|pg||
nt|lml: shift|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Although spades play for five tricks - @SK first. Entries are a bit of a problem thouh |pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it's contradicts Bird's law|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@H asking for @SQ |pg||
nt|ady: 2 NT  wont be a major success   may run to 3@C|pg||
nt|delberto:  looks like the defence will take the first 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|reisig: See?  :) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What do you call AKJ98542?|pg||
nt|mamos: welcome richie|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c, and it seem logical for S to play @s to the J and try to "hide" the K, then play @h from dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't know that @s's are 5-0 of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays J@c and K@s, it will make it a lot easier for E to switch to @d after K@h|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it's hard to see how 3N can be made -- assuming E shifts to a diamond when in with the @HK|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer will need to guess spades for his contract|pg||
nt|iceking: this will make 12 tricks |pg||
nt|pitiful:  i hope 4@c is F|pg||
nt|benjy: at both tables both souths bounced to 4@S, I would at least take a look at NT|pg||
nt|zbig1959: why x on 1@C from N, w.o X bidding cld be .. 1c 1@S p 2@S,p . 2NT (if) p 3@S and finally 2 or 3 @S |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: lots|pg||
nt|reisig: TRUMPS|pg||
nt|mamos: solid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yess!!!  RR|pg||
nt|mamos: im told NS like the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Trumps for sure at IMPs|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven|pg||
nt|blum1956: very strange indeed|pg||
nt|lml: East can build a club trick eventually|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South hasn't got it, but he thinks @SJ10xx is enough?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: i would not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S7 re-enforcing   i don't have @S card|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: 3@H a make   if getting diamonds right|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: the entries are tricky for Towsend|pg||
nt|mamos: scratching towards 3NT here|pg||
nt|toral5: no game makes here|pg||
nt|barnets: west want east to declarer 3N|pg||
nt|delberto:  yes...making things clear for partner|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not the best matchpoint spot but ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: south giving this lots of thought|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toral5: 2@H was invitational|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards are 2@H also has a lot of play|pg||
nt|Gerben42: commentator curse|pg||
nt|iceking: yes but he should play trumps in trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: nice bid transfers the contract|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gulyas: cannot go wrong in @Cs, so 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bt: and west will lead a club, given east did not overcal 1@S hence no 5-suit there|pg||
nt|ritong: no key missing, pard enthusiastic  let s go|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sadek is not happy|pg||
nt|barnets: east wants west to dec 3n that should be|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ritong: stiff trump Q|pg||
nt|ritong: bleh|pg||
nt|iceking: this is just misplay|pg||
nt|zbig1959: ok, the same 11 tricks, claim coming|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice play by S nontheless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East doesn;t know now who has the @SK - so it might be hard for him to play a diamond if South (say) leads a low heart now|pg||
nt|lml: it works in some games|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and he will be inclined to place West with the @C10 - if South hand KJ109, then the long think at trick two was a bit dubious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asked if they play Michaels over 1S, <yes|pg||
nt|tez: helness didnt like q of @d|pg||
nt|benjy: I would be happy bidding 1@S too|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|blum1956: Maaybe North preferes to show a minimum hand first|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe worried about quality of @C reason for no 4@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What minimum? 3@C only promised 16...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good 16+|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes but Jx and Qxxxx are not the best|pg||
nt|stc: On bad day you find Q10xx@s behind|pg||
nt|tez: big brother says he can make..but we will see:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: the @H 8 and @C8 are good stopper cards for declarer|pg||
nt|tez: ANOTHER good hand for NS|pg||
nt|dburn: he might have bid a bot more than 2@h at his first turn, given his apparent fit for both partner's suits|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: Sadek's majors are death to him|pg||
nt|ritong: he opens the bidding, gets a grand in his er...face, and knows everything goes well for opps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gotta say, this was highly speculative by North ... how could he know that his losers in diamonds and hearts would all be covered|pg||
nt|ritong: pard said " i like my hand", and he has no reason to hate his|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But should grand slams be bid on the basis of "I have a nice hand"?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: as any other spot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vicky888:  the openeing 2@d is weak?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|reisig: I can just see Michael S's face :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk5: A claim would be accepted|pg||
nt|isp: "Bid as you like , make as you can |pg||
nt|gulyas: looks strong to me:)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  but that opening has caused this non-sacrifice|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iceking: then Steve needed to find to cash his @S ace and that was not going to happen|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, it doesn't mater how you bid making slams, so long as you do|pg||
nt|lml: tough defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: making now, the nice play of @s to the J paid off in the end, even when it virtually costs a trick at the beginning|pg||
pc|hT|nt|warrens:  after 3 rounds of @d|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|petepunt: but more good days than bad days here :)|pg||
nt|benjy: i think he can make this nopw|pg||
nt|benjy: three rounds of trumps will squeeze west in 3 suits|pg||
nt|dburn: he has a chance, at any rate - if he plays all his spades...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: looks like declarer won't have the time to get to 9 tricks before EW take 5 |pg||
nt|mamos: i agree   Diamond lead has defeated contract|pg||
nt|caitlin: will go down|pg||
nt|bg: nice to see Diamond, Gittleman and co on a roll Fred was an imp league teammate a few years ago In Toronto before he and Sheri moved to Vegas|pg||
nt|warrens:  's, the defense can't do enough|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: 5@H dbl was a good score for EW in the OR|pg||
nt|ritong: besides....go fred!:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: s sweating|pg||
nt|ritong: won t last|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: no even if north held the @H 7|pg||
nt|barnets: it would not be enough |pg||
nt|warrens:  he can duck this @h and duck a second one, the North is endplayed into giving him his 9th trick.  of course, he doesn't know the club 9 is falling|pg||
nt|warrens:  then North|pg||
nt|barnets: with heart length north will always be endplayed|pg||
nt|zbig1959: yes, rarely throw in to W|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|tlc: if he ducks..best for south to lead club back..he must rise Queen to make then|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|nt|stc: make ? two ? can make 3 !|pg||
pc|h5|nt|toral5: he will make now|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|tez: 23 point flat hand..9 trump|pg||
nt|zbig1959: declarer seems on rt track |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  low @d now|pg||
nt|dburn: but no longer|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andersk: doesnt matter North will ruff regardless|pg||
nt|zbig1959: dn1|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 2 imps |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|ritong: gling|pg||
nt|bjacobs: game set and match|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tlc: can still endplay north, but ducking 2nd heart would have been 100%|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|xenya: bad news in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not really - East should have covered that diamond|pg||
nt|benjy: this is incredible|pg||
nt|dburn: now, he will make - in fact, he will make an overtrick|pg||
mc|11|nt|toral5: so finally a pick up for lavazza in the 2nd set|pg||
nt|zbig1959: geez, again makeable|pg||

nt|xenya: i must confess i don't understand this defence |pg||
nt|andersk: I agree with that statement!|pg||
nt|bt: but 5@C is a posility|pg||
nt|bt: possibility|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 4 boards to go...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: more than 10 imps per board...big ask|pg||
nt|Gerben42: of course you are right - but they do everything to prove us wrong :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: he'd probably underlead diamond and hope for spade through.|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now finally the dealer woke up|pg||
nt|ady: Hapson going nicely so far|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer probably ducked one club then let the jack of @s run.. looks like the best line to me|pg||
nt|bg: s/b a routine spade partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: best defense was to lead trump and play trump...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: action here|pg||
nt|tez: what do you open with S'S HAND|pg||
nt|tez: not 5..4@h made..pls change score|pg||
nt|zbig1959: half of last segment... 8 bds remaing, 51 imps diff|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: I have had a number of messages saying that a diamod switch cannot cost - probably not |pg||
nt|xenya: E could duck a heart -- but if he wins he should try to find a few quick tricks, not to set up the clubs with no entry|pg||
nt|ady: a hand for e/w |pg||
nt|ahollan1: our Open Room is just starting to bid the slam hand    in the Final 6@H was pushed after both tables opened limited 1@H|pg||
nt|delberto:  on board 19, Wolfson got 13 back with EW trying 6S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=game force, 4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I'd open that East hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you lose a club you still make 6@C  .... and go down in 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: 6-4 is very strong (w 2 aces)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks in Hearts|pg||
nt|lml: so like in the previous match a good start and then the mo switched|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c = natural or 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he would have done better to cash clubs first, hoping for an error |pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to restrain himself with this hand|pg||
nt|bt: multi 2@D saving east from a pemaly D in 3@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: wonder if south had a penalty dbl available... either way I would pass|pg||
nt|bt: say 2@S-3@H-D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: h shows s|pg||
nt|iceking: yes but it will end here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D opening killed the slam|pg||
nt|delberto:  Ginnossarhas taken advantage of the 2NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: indeed but i still like his opening even it didnt work this time|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no good deed ever goes unpunished|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with 1-1 in majors it was a good shot|pg||
nt|phil: Eldad wants to compete but the colors are wrong - and he'd like the safety of 3 of a minor|pg||
nt|delberto:  it is realtively safe to double on light hands with good shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: recent article by Mike Lawrence recommends bidding over that artificial 2N -- but at this vul?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: makeable 4@h (EW)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: Lev wondering about all this :)|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if Canada can get it back|pg||
nt|mamos: a normal result i'd expect|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. yet again multi saves the day :)|pg||
nt|bt: or even more juicy 3@S-4@H-D ...|pg||
nt|tez: 1@C or 1@d?|pg||
nt|bg: unless S rightfully gets carried away with an apparent undiscplined preempt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they told me 4,,,that's what I have to enter|pg||
nt|delberto:  very brave !!!|pg||
nt|benjy: I am surprised that west passed here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|reisig: Won't matter - however|pg||
nt|petepunt: upgraded is 14 to a 15-17 rebid here|pg||
nt|blum1956: Lev sitting with @h@s 55 and 14 HCP and listening for 1@h-1@s))|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 1d|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: just kidding |pg||
nt|udo: diff hand to bid,,,even grands are possible if @D would be 3-2|pg||
nt|phil: the @hxxxx is a great holding|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C now from Paske (Drury) showing 9-11 with 3+ cards in @H|pg||
nt|dburn: mot makeable 6@h, or at least so one would have thought|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 6@H from Open Room??|pg||
nt|copeyj: A@D and another|pg||
nt|copeyj: was led|pg||
nt|copeyj: Robertson might try 3@D now or 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: but North started with @dA, which was fine, then continued diamonds, which was less fine (unless you happened to be declarer)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: boring deal, fast claim coming|pg||
pc|dA|nt|stc: EW may cash the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: slim chance though|pg||
nt|mamos: wow that double is some call|pg||
nt|mamos: what is North supposed to do|pg||
nt|phil: 4@s "on the way" to 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but to what purpose is DBL?   it doesn't help partner lead, it doesn't take up any room, at this vul gives opp extra options|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tez: N SRY|pg||
nt|ritong: waleed is wondering " are there so many hands with which we make 3NT and not 5 or more @cs"|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is the answer is "no"|pg||
nt|iceking: thx for dummy pd |pg||
nt|ady: 6NT    should make|pg||
nt|delberto:  these twohave no fear !!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  if bidding, i'd want to show @S or @S & another|pg||
nt|phil: will have to lead well to get 500 from 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course they also knew they need a big set to win the match|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h an overbid as N has already denied 4 @hs|pg||
nt|bg: some pairs use 2 sia openings to show a really bad major and save the 2H/S openings for reasonable suits|pg||
nt|bg: Dia|pg||
nt|zbig1959: youth bridge, |pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: no   4@h seems completely normal|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, but I would prefer to look for a 4-4 spade fit first|pg||
nt|ady: will certainly be in 6    just a matter of 7 or noy|pg||
nt|tez: duck..but very hard|pg||
nt|delberto:  yes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk5: Smolen auction perhaps|pg||

nt|Walddk5: If you don't have a spade fit, you can get to hearts later|pg||
nt|tez: pass 1@c 1@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks uppish|pg||

nt|lml: they have 25 hcp so 2nt vul might not the favorite|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. many aggressive players would open 3@s with this hand, though I am not one of them|pg||
nt|bessi2: Cohler at this point delighted to be playing only 2@h|pg||
nt|bt: the flaw for a weak 2 is the void and playability in 3 suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but he goes for it|pg||
nt|udo: yes. some red jacks would make 7 a fine contract|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andersk: will lead @S now|pg||
nt|bt: and the flaw of the multi w @S is they have a comfortable 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|othered1: simple point count 6N.  But they'll poke around looking for best contract at 6 or 7 level, rather than bashing 33 point 6N|pg||
nt|tez: we are talking with open cards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: as long as they are not forcing declarer a lot in @Ds, he can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NOW|pg||
nt|andyv:  read map has been given to opps|pg||
nt|andersk: Sadek will use the J to get the picture|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone agree with N's 1NT bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it does help to know your partnership style with these borderline hands|pg||
nt|barnets: and west had an easy pass|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|nt|gulyas: 4-1 trumps could be a problem otherwise|pg||
nt|ady: kibs suggesting 7NT or 7@D    need to look through the cards   especially 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's RKC, west might venture 7@D|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should play |pg||
nt|andersk: I agree with 1 NT, however I would bid 3@h instead of 2 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s|pg||
nt|andersk: sometimes partner have 5@D 4@h and sometimes 6@d 5@H|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe they can overcall 2 NT with 65 in red's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead would have let them score trump separately -- but was there a reason to find that lead?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 49 diff, as one kibs corrected me..|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  yes, because they play a weak nt, so it shows 15-17 balanced or less but unbalanced|pg||
nt|othered1: Here NT is wrong-sided, given @C position|pg||
nt|udo: i guess 5 @S 2 keys +queen|pg||
nt|zbig1959: smallest @D from S, shd show interest in @C shift|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: played the 10|pg||
nt|zbig1959: T@D as counting signal?? did 3@D alerted as shortness??|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petepunt: @H more likey than a low @S here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: low @S should be automatic|pg||
nt|blum1956: Probably East should have discarded clubs in the reversed order|pg||
nt|stc: can you beat on @hs ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: showing the spade values|pg||
nt|stc: at IMP @s looks better to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: aagree easts @C should enc in @S if poss|pg||
nt|tlc: i confess i would have bid 3@s|pg||
nt|barnets: it is hard to criticise either east or west here|pg||
nt|phil: maybe - the vulnerable opponents sound prepared for a heart, but who knows for sure? |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: he has a good chance of making this I think|pg||
nt|mr murray: bet they get to grandola|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness staring at ceiling!!|pg||
nt|ady: not surprising in grand   l would do very well to make   especcially 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: i dont think grand will make,,, |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S had a simple 2@d rebid... he has a decent hand, a very broken @d suit and needs a lot of help from partner for any game|pg||
nt|caitlin: he can't pass:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|delberto:  has declarer definitely got 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: ok, claim tim,e 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: brb|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bessi2: well that was a very good counter-move from south|pg||
nt|udo: have to play for @D jack single|pg||
nt|udo: but ....|pg||
nt|ady: if not picking up diamonds would have to make 8 major suit tricks  and club finesse   a tall order|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|blum1956: but it must be easy for West to work out the underlead anyway|pg||
nt|andersk: I totally agree|pg||
nt|andersk: 2@h is an overbid, but that was not the discussion:)|pg||
nt|udo: of course u can finesse north @D 10,,but than u u go down against B10x or B10 in south|pg||
pc|d2|nt|phil: I think so|pg||
nt|delberto:  he has now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dK|nt|caitlin: finessing the 9|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead|pg||
nt|udo: i bet against|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|caitlin: me too:)|pg||
nt|udo: normal pay|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|udo: play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stc: 1@c shows the length but you have no bid on 1@s, 1@d lies but let you bid 2@c afterwards|pg||
nt|othered1: This is not a restricted choice situation, and west is down at trick 2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bg: same auction in other room:) so what do I know:)|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk5: You could even have a 5-4 spade fit, and 6-2 in hearts, as I assume they open 1NT with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|reisig: He didn't even try for @ss|pg||
nt|bessi2: I dislike 1@c most of all... think pass is best start,|pg||

nt|bt: gutsy and thoughtful play that|pg||
nt|Gerben42: has to decide between 3N and 4@H|pg||

nt|andyv:  2@d here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n e passintg notes|pg||
nt|stc: I think that at non vul against vul you must open, you may need to sac on a @s from ops|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  4s makes on all leads rt|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl as responsive here|pg||
nt|bessi2: he had even more information after a Majors overcall from west and a voluntary 4@s raise from him aswell and also easts dbl of 5d|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2nd opening 4Major of the set for Pachtman|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Walddk5: Operator, please click on MOVIE on your toolbar, hold your mouse over board 25 and overwrite  4HW+1|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd Pass over 1@s|pg||
nt|reisig: I hate partner getting more involved|pg||
nt|stc: and the down side of weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: n/s not in bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: And Fantoni is out this set, so the normal reason for other room's snail pace isn't operative|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Board 25 corrected, thanks|pg||
nt|yuval10: will S XX this?|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt he wants to play here|pg||
nt|lml: who knows what happens to 5@H|pg||
nt|dburn: East may bid anyway|pg||
nt|lml: well we do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will bid that, probably|pg||
nt|dburn: he does have four decent hearts, after all|pg||
nt|lml: so if north passes and East bids 5@H what then|pg||
nt|andyv:  or simple 3@d:)|pg||
nt|iceking: North could think about slam in @D if pd is short in @C|pg||
nt|iceking: AJxx AKxxx xxx x exs |pg||
nt|Gerben42: they must like 2@H p 4@H auction|pg||
nt|kjadams: to quote steve "partner never has the perfect hand"|pg||
nt|iceking: another lazy bid as i see it|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|bt: ew might take first 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|ady: anything highrt than game  risky for e/w|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: but Helness is thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: staring intently at bidding trat|pg||
nt|ady: why should he think   ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: maybe he wants an undo:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: tray|pg||
nt|udo: dont know what 4 @C was|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know what 4@C is?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@D|pg||
nt|udo: helness has the @S controll|pg||
nt|ady: I would think some sort of rkc|pg||
nt|caitlin: transfer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok most would have opened both at 1-level, but still|pg||
nt|dburn: back at the bridge, this may be a few more to Poland|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|stc: however hard for E to put the K@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  styles matter.. in OR, N bid 1@d and S was able to show his values.  Both rooms reached same contract|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like a solid 3nt, just take the double finesse in @S's twice for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|zbig1959: over 3@H an easy 4@H or cue bid??|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
nt|gulyas: they cannot open up both @Cs and @Hs for the defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W's X is quite dangerous, given the fact his Partner is the only limited hand in the table, when he already passed|pg||
nt|andyv:  with Q|pg||
nt|bt: 3nt 600 ...|pg||
nt|tez: it is highly popular to open 1 nt with a solid color these days|pg||
nt|tez: from 3rd seat with little points|pg||
nt|bessi2: a nice little semi-bluff|pg||
nt|phil: yes, both on heavy hands|pg||
nt|zbig1959: wow, agressive @C cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well sorry I think NS got to the contract they deserved here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Trump lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk5: On this auction dummy rates to be short in spades'|pg||
nt|mamos: it probably won't turn out too badly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 14 imps on  24 - 4@Cx made EW next door|pg||
nt|lml: this is no fun if you are for Canada ... where is the match I came to watch|pg||
nt|lml: think I am going to get a beverage, I need something... brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "Hope I've got enough" |pg||
nt|yuval10: they started well, until Deutsch responded|pg||
nt|ady: they will be relieved to come out of this unscathed|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: if @s played from dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: 75 percent|pg||
nt|zbig1959: slam @H is ON, without @D lead, but W on lead keep KQ@D ..|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yuval10: will -1190 be a good result since NS has 1430?  i think not, it isn't so easy to discover the 6@s |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: short break|pg||
nt|barnets: the best line to make 3N is to cash @DK and ace|pg||
nt|barnets: when diamonds are 3-2 |pg||
nt|barnets: then cash the @CA|pg||
nt|barnets: and take 2 spade finesses|pg||
nt|barnets: if diamonds split - 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: then you need to play clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe also start with @DK @D Q|pg||
nt|tlc: yes..need to retain enough entries to take 2 @S finesses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we are back|pg||
nt|barnets: can pick @D 10 or J sing in east|pg||
nt|othered1: It's suggested 4@c is asking bid in @C and 4@D a no control response|pg||
nt|copeyj: will be for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I guess this isn't one of those ...draw trump and claim hands|pg||
nt|toral5: @C are placed very badly for sementa|pg||
nt|iceking: might play @S now|pg||
nt|iceking: score in this set 6-6 after 8 boards |pg||
nt|Gerben42: so the big swing didnt materialize|pg||
nt|iceking: i was wrong again was just another push|pg||
nt|iceking: he will either continue @D or play @S iam not even sure what is the correct line |pg||
nt|kjadams: seems like letting the rough a diamond helps control.|pg||
nt|kjadams: them..|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see he could take 12 tricks but he will not playf or Jx in @H|pg||
nt|iceking: i think he will play @S it looks right|pg||
nt|zbig1959: seems 2 partscores to Poles|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 5@H makeable, but if they bid 6@H, 13 imps to England|pg||
nt|benjy: is it so agressive? opposite x AKxxxx Ax AJx slam is cold |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he needs a thirteenth card, and if that were a heart, he might have opened 1@c|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|stc: looks like .2|pg||
nt|andyv:  with Q@D dropping N should make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  if @ds aren't 2-2, this hand is not making so finesse for Q should not be an option.|pg||
nt|ady: dangerous waters    45 level could well have been too high|pg||
nt|udo: looks like a cuebid-sequence and hellness thought ha had to show his @S controll|pg||
nt|caitlin: if RKC why 4@S?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: opening bid 1@H is limited (polish @C)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|xenya: too early to worry, Linda -- this will lose to 6@S if bid in the other room :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes just got to 6@H on 21|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: you hardly have any trumps to draw|pg||
nt|reisig: EW|pg||
nt|reisig: @h is a standout ..now|pg||
nt|stc: -2|pg||
nt|tez: if the spade finesse worked, 3nt would be fine|pg||
nt|barnets: first is find out if diamonds are 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: you mean 5@S?|pg||
nt|othered1: He does have to pick up trumps.  Book play, finesse, will do so|pg||
nt|caitlin: sounds good to me|pg||
nt|othered1: now, with this lead . . . |pg||
nt|udo: wow, what alead|pg||
nt|udo: may go wrong now|pg||
nt|zbig1959: it worth close 6 imps..|pg||
nt|dburn: seven, I think, but that is close to six|pg||
nt|zbig1959: yes, if +1, = 7imps|pg||
nt|zbig1959: but.. number 6 is close 7, am i rt?? ;)|pg||
nt|benjy: ok sorry x AKxxxx axx AJX |pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, North is likely to bid a slam now|pg||
mb|6H|nt|stc: even with @s finess 3NT may go 4-5 down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Camberos in the tank|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: may esc with -1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: woooooooooooow|pg||
nt|stc: wow !|pg||
nt|warrens:  in either hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: if helgamo had bid 3nt, the lead would be @D|pg||
nt|tez: we can say 3 nt cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Some would rebid the chunky spade suit, but 2@H could have been right|pg||
nt|dburn: well, assuming that East did not really win the first trick with @s7, declarer has ten tricks, but that's still "only" 7 IMPs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|zbig1959: again lights on McIntosh..|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 13 imps to England|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 23/24 bd mistakes made by W created swings, rt now He took his 13 imps |pg||
pc|d3|nt|bg: good stop 4 might make but takes a few good guesses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: on last, Greco said he could have invited -- Hamp said he could have passed|pg||
nt|toral5: should be a comfortable make though|pg||
nt|tez: @h lead goes down..but..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: now he can cash the @Ca before the second @S finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: very well read|pg||
nt|udo: of course with no Ace in east lead cannot cost, still good try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: everybody laughing and playing fast|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: not entirely sure -- play waas very fast|pg||
nt|iceking: and we hve a slam |pg||
nt|barnets: south would have been embarrased |pg||
nt|barnets: had the spade been wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: and the club K fell singleton|pg||
nt|ady: yes    srt damonds up|pg||
nt|ady: 6 was right|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is NOT an advertisement.....I have nothing t do with the site:)|pg||
nt|delberto:  speeds up the bidding !|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: last board was 170|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|reisig: maybe should change that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: alerted, but no explaination|pg||
nt|bt: 2n was aggressive but unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: fun fact from bd 25 (where EW were 4@H+2 both room here):|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike this 1@h bid though|pg||
nt|stc: and go to bed ! good night everybody, thanks all including specs and of course players !|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: the boards have not been as spectacular by and large as yesterday 3NT looks ver straightforward here|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary plays Hampton|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary down 800 in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|bessi2: a clear 4@h bid imo, |pg||
nt|tez: 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @D   a totally new concept|pg||
nt|zbig1959: slam time|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: awkward for South|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting to see how NS will handle this|pg||
nt|bt: if it is permitted in their system its fine, other options are worse|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N open|pg||
nt|toral5: i doubt.i m sure he wd ve ruffed with 10.|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably forcing one round|pg||
nt|iceking: what should Nickell bid here 3@H splinter |pg||
nt|iceking: many dont like splinter bids with stiff Ace|pg||
nt|ady: poor dummy  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: 1nT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hampton down 1400 in 5@Dx...|pg||
nt|blum1956: the club slam is makeable here but neither easy to bid nor to play|pg||
nt|bg: 3nt or 5 clubs s/b no swings here|pg||
nt|barnets: north chose to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: i like 1@H in a perverted way|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps at the state of the match he could have gambled|pg||
nt|barnets: he has not picked up enough imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice -- now 3N|pg||
nt|delberto:  will theyretreat to 3NT ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|reisig: 1N seems "normal|pg||
nt|mamos: oww|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S doesnt  seem ormal|pg||
nt|mamos: normal|pg||
nt|blum1956: the heart slam is clearly down|pg||
nt|stc: yes, you can't discard loosing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N is lebensohlish no doubt|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
nt|bt: you dont want to open 2/3/4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@C i dont know if its keycard asking or just setting asking for que-bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Maybe ...they are getting warmed up|pg||
nt|mamos: practising 4-3 fits obviously|pg||
nt|gulyas: just trying to come up with something interesting:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: According to the NS CC, South could have doubled 2@c to show three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: 4441 likes balanced hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42: could still be both|pg||
nt|kittyc: their convention card is here http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010nonJuniorPhiladelphia/Katz-Nickell.pdf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: key cards I think|pg||
nt|iceking: well i still dont know as 4@S could either be resond to ace asking or Que bid hehe|pg||
nt|delberto:  Ginnossar will not know that his partner has bid a 3-card suit|pg||
nt|delberto:  but he will know that he might have|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Ginnossar thinking hard...has put his cards down|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 6@D (lack of Q@D) or 6nt?|pg||
nt|copeyj: a good time from the English perspective to bid a ropey grand slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: perhaps it isnt the boards its the players :)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  now, thts the action table|pg||
nt|bt: but u want to open|pg||
nt|toral5: defence can restrict 3nt to 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|barnets: they have gone down in 2 marginal games|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: typical acol auction here,  11 tricks looks likely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e asking question|pg||
nt|phil: 9 tricks are cheaper than 10|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 3@D = gf|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  fine contract and result in OR for NS|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is surely tempting but Cohler cant do more than 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does any literature talk about this auction?   is there any way for Pachtman to say  i have 4@H AND @D stop ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never seen it|pg||
nt|phil: me neither - these continuations after doubles of preempts are vague|pg||
nt|delberto:  I don't know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and take away all of East's honors -- then what does he do over 3@D?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: gr8 score wld be at MP , 11 tricks, from OR, |pg||
nt|benjy: 4@S should have been beaten in the OR. SOuth led a @C and declarer won and played a @D, south won and switched to a low @H and declarer played the King which was ducked,|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 3 running aces, and delcarer took 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: incidentally, if South could have doubled to show 3@h, is his pass alertable? I don't know|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 25 - EW in the other room made 3NT , quite unclear how from the movie, it looked like a sure -1|pg||
nt|toral5: not a gud brd to watch from the kibitzing point of view|pg||
nt|barnets: only 3 boards left but you never know what they might bring|pg||
nt|delberto:  but Ginnossar's decision makes sense|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bt: north should have a yarborough on the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bt: he is suprised|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we thank all the spectators for watching|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing from wrong side|pg||
nt|tez: but same|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Vugraphzsv: tomorrow we have KO RD16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sementaç  "good clubs, bad spades"|pg||
nt|toral5: last board coming up after this.whn is the 3rd set?|pg||
nt|barnets: would anyone x ?|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to go.  Thanks everyone and bye|pg||
nt|delberto:  3Nt is likely to be sensible is it not?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with this hand -- Pachtman choices easy -- not as much for Ginnossar|pg||
nt|phil: 3@h is the usual answer with any bust|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm saying change East hand -- and everybody guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Phil -- 3@H = bust, but what length     the literature doesn't discuss|pg||
pc|dA|nt|reisig: We all have different overcall styles|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about 3NT - seems a trifle wet with four diamonds, @hKx and a bunch of controls|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stc: 6@c make in dd, but the percentage play is to take the @h hook and go down|pg||
nt|toral5: 1 imp at stake here:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: usually quite soon after|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks as well to WBF and BBO for these amazing oportunities to see the greatest players|pg||
nt|tez: congrats to zimmermann teams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: please check the vugraph schedule for tomorrow broadcasts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness thinking hard... he does not know it does not matter|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|bg: 5c-3d-1h=9 push next|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 3rd set 55 min from now|pg||
nt|ady: east needs to switch to a diamond if in with a club|pg||
nt|delberto:  good play in hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice|pg||
nt|zbig1959: my bid over 3@D wld be 3@S (@D agreed) w.o @H support|pg||
nt|pitiful:  might that not be AKQx Kx Kxx xxxx?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: so, missed swing in OR by England..|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzsv: 15:30 local time|pg||
nt|toral5: presumming they attack @S which is quiet obvious or dont duck @H|pg||
nt|bg: good play to continue now makes 4 maybe 5 if Greco does not cash spade Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: one hour|pg||
nt|toral5: thts y i said 1 imp at stake:)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: E rt now knows, lack of @D, (rather 3 card @D support)|pg||
nt|benjy: this looks like a guess in this room too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: I am told the 3NT score IS wrong so things are better than they look|pg||
nt|kittyc: looks like RKC from the card but not clear|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: you could do, but you'd worry that they might run to three diamonds and you would get a minus instead of a plus|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bt: thoughtful lead by n, didnt matter here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i lost play sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i will cliam at the end|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: claim|pg||
nt|toral5: so 1 imp now for lavazza ATLEAST|pg||
nt|zbig1959: thats why small slam @D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|reisig: As long as we both on the same page ..it's OK|pg||
nt|isp: 140|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hampton still leading the match (and the group) tho|pg||
nt|tez: boss calling.i must go(wife)..ty all..enjoyed..bye:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|isp: 170 was wrong|pg||
nt|reisig: They are GREAT at claiming|pg||
nt|ritong: needs @d H9 on or KQx|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: if you are trying to check the scores on the scoring site, it is full but it usually does come back after a while... link at www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|iceking: been told it was keycard askign|pg||
nt|iceking: asking|pg||
pc|h9|nt|zbig1959: den|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: still cant get on|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H by Moss looks an off-the-wall bid to me|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still i dont think that will be a big swing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry...Boyd played A of diamonds|pg||
nt|iceking: not much in this one @S Q is onside and its needed|pg||
nt|kittyc: although the spade hook is on, if he plays to squeeze (HK and SQ in same hand) he goes down|pg||
nt|Gerben42: squeezes for show, finesses for dough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: then played heart and declarer ruffed|pg||
nt|iceking: yes true me might play for the squeeze|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe you already won the board, if parter was off-center for his weak two bid and had driven them into a bad contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|zbig1959: wil declarer play by top, or finn @D|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: Poddar leading this group|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: Fredin in 4th with two strong US teams inbetween|pg||
nt|ritong: not today|pg||
nt|ady: yes  assuming south plays low|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: that is a 17 imp difference .. loss of 10 to win of 7|pg||
nt|mamos: well EW have stolen the hand|pg||
nt|toral5: 11 resulted in 9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: and would put this at 4|pg||
nt|lml: 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|lml: with the bad result for Canada on 26 to come|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry on the names i asked and they gave them to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF  assume @D6-1   can endplay Helness to eliminate guess in @C|pg||
nt|zbig1959: next dela, pls|pg||
nt|zbig1959: *deal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: looks like 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|iceking: i need to go thx everyone |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tez: must go sry..very important call|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: wife calling:)|pg||
nt|REISIG: OK Tez :) |pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42: bye and thanks|pg||
nt|kjadams: thanks Magnus!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kittyc: knowing where the HK is makes the sqz tempting, he will play many winners before deciding|pg||
nt|REISIG: Not much "real" choice|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least in this room North appears to have guessed that the ace beats the king|pg||
nt|zbig1959: sry, sth wrong with my keypad|pg||
mc|8|nt|delberto:  declarer is nicely placed and if he is brave he will play for the end-play|pg||
nt|benjy: 11 imps to Poland|pg||
nt|zbig1959: seems, match is over..|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: they have done terifically but when you get to world ch'ship finals you have to try and profit from them as much as possible!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|mamos: of course |pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: but bare in mind that they only received a late invite to this ch'ships so to get a Silver medal does represent a great effort, just a shame we couldnt go one step further|pg||

nt|petepunt: agree 6@C amy make but tough to reach|pg||
nt|mamos: last hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, perhaps he was trying to disrupt NS's bidding -- but it seems he chose the wrong time |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: did notknow 1st was last|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: last board nowù|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now|pg||
nt|toral5: last brd now.tnk u all.we did have a nice entertaining set.see u in an hrs.tnk u bruce,caitlin,xenya|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: was concerned clubs were 4-0 on last|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: guessed the spade|pg||
nt|kittyc: good job|pg||
nt|dburn: still, you could also quite reasonably decide that you need to get a penalty here - might be that everything is normal and you need the points|pg||
nt|zbig1959: Lions need 5 swings .. |pg||
nt|benjy: I am afraid it does look that way|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: "Service Unavailable" -  the web site must be getting a bit of a hammering|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now only 4 boards ahead of the other room|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: NS wont be able to bid this hand   they dont have a 4-3 fit available|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|5D|nt|reisig: I bet - 1N won't end the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@H all pass?|pg||
nt|kjadams: that a restricted choice situation?   assuming aggressive lead... might have led spade with Q vs Heart with King?|pg||
nt|tlc: a routine 3NT or 4@H hand is not what Fleisher needs at this point...|pg||
nt|barnets: dont think so|pg||
nt|dburn: Martel chose not to look for a heart fit facing a weak no trump|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think west passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: ns will make 4@H unless ew cash 3@S |pg||
nt|caitlin: ty to our operator Joe and to specs!|pg||
nt|toral5: if @C 4-0 he can always test 1 high @C aftr @H duck,and revert back to @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: :)  thanks commentators and specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 2N anyone?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: overbided, 5@D -1|pg||
mb|d|nt|reisig: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No way to stop 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW playing precision I assume|pg||
nt|mamos: south pass|pg||
nt|kittyc: yes good point, might well have|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: "cold" game :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s on 26. 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: yes ... the server does do that at the end of the round|pg||
nt|mamos: of this set -- two more stanzas today each of 14 boards   lots of excitement this week|pg||
nt|bessi2: VERY nice bid from Lev given that Cohler would never have defeated 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You just have the entry, @SK, to advance @HJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing a spade, a heart and a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: not surprising really|pg||
nt|lml: I am told that they did make 3NT but the operator input the play incorrectly|pg||
nt|delberto:  is 2D a forcing to game relay ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: likely 9 now|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to vugraph op  and to USBF and WBF and BBO|pg||
nt|mamos: great ti see Fred here|pg||
nt|udo: freindly @S break|pg||
nt|ady: 19-0 for diamond  this set  so far|pg||
nt|udo: friendly|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blum1956: at least nine tricks |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Nickell apologized for taking so long to play 6C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: :)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: X with meaning, 2@H promised 7-9 hcp, "i have max" |pg||
nt|zbig1959: hmm, did N bid @S or @H??|pg||
nt|benjy: despite the friendly lead he can't make this, he can't set up the clubs and enjoy them|pg||
pc|s8|nt|reisig: Lucky game|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now he can play 1NT faster|pg||
nt|kjadams: T shows jack or shortness.    Shortness for them could be 3.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H would have been easier |pg||
nt|reisig: 3N = I don't have to play it!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzsv: standard carding signals|pg||
nt|bt: after bidding 4@H i think south has a double, though depending on agrrement|pg||
nt|tlc: 2@D being game forcing checkback..|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: very|pg||
nt|udo: and the grand bid bei NS here and the grand doen 1 from EW here still coming|pg||
nt|phil: good time to get some more coffee...|pg||
nt|delberto:  haha|pg||
nt|delberto:  the contract is in no danger|pg||
nt|zbig1959: hardly 3nt after @S lead, i can see only 8 tricks... |pg||
nt|zbig1959: the only declarer hope, blocked @S;s at Opps hands|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: this will be too much|pg||
nt|mamos: and thanks for the comments  -- worth coming for Board 17|pg||
nt|caitlin: not sure who is on next|pg||
nt|udo: perfect round for diamond so far|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: with all @Ss wrong, he will be down|pg||
nt|delberto:  maybe not the sort of hand that Ginnossar and Pachtman want|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya:  nothing is lost for the Japanese team yet|pg||
nt|barnets: north can get a ruff |pg||
nt|barnets: but|pg||
nt|barnets: thats only 3 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: could be a very bad set for Zimmerman   a grand down 1   and a grand made by Diamond|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gulyas: he can get 2-2 red tricks, and 4@Cs|pg||
nt|mamos: was always struggling even with a favourabl lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bt: ns carding not efficient|pg||
nt|caitlin: suspect Cayne for sure|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|toral5: he will play @D to the king and low @C incase greco has both kj|pg||
nt|caitlin: go to www.e-catsbridge.com   to Philly 2010.......and there is a click here for results|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but @CA was a good start|pg||
nt|dburn: and he got 430 for his efforts instead of 420, which would have been a top - fortunately, this is the teams not the pairs|pg||
nt|delberto:  given the state of the match|pg||
nt|zbig1959: Poles lead, 2/4 from top. for sure 9 form T9xxx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|reisig: For me - @ds would be 4-1 and have to lose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SA onside (good chance), West with Kx in hearts and diamonds 3-2|pg||
nt|xenya: operator showed the ideal defence  |pg||
nt|lml: too bad they didnt show it to the players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wish we could do that at the table|pg||
nt|bg: good a continuation of this well olayed match is on again|pg||
nt|kittyc: not best continuation though but an awkward contract to be in|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|ady: is the final 4 sets of 15 hands anyone know?|pg||
nt|Walddk10: 4 x 16 in the final|pg||
nt|Walddk10: tomorrow|pg||
nt|ady: thx Roland|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: but we started with 17 here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|toral5: 3 great matches coming up|pg||
nt|barnets: south may try a club|pg||
nt|barnets: which would work|pg||
nt|barnets: when partner has the ace|pg||
nt|barnets: and then they wuld each get a ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk10: yes, but only 15 today|pg||
nt|Walddk10: The women play 16|pg||
nt|ady: women stronger than the men|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: so why did we start with Bd 17?|pg||
nt|Walddk10: I am not the Oracle of Delphi :)|pg||
nt|ady: idi we not miss a board initially   late start?|pg||
nt|ady: did|pg||
nt|ady: maybe hand 16 was played?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: the board we missed was 17|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I missed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Greco in the tank|pg||
nt|Walddk10: They let the women play 1 board more because they can play 16 boards in 2½ hours whereas the men only manage 11 or some such|pg||
nt|ady: so is to-day 15 hands or 16?|pg||
nt|Walddk10: 15|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: me too :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: next session at 430|pg||

nt|bt: thanks bbo and wbf for the excellent presentation|pg||

nt|udo: @D to king , club , hellnes must take ace and exit @D|pg||

nt|yuval10: Deutsch scored 54 almost unanswered points after giving away 2 big swings to open the match|pg||
nt|lml: The India site has the results up to the last round and they are not on the same server.  This is their own.  Good to know|pg||
nt|yuval10: that shows some very good mental toughness by both pairs who had 1 bad board each|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mamos: this looks like some sort of intermediate 2@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in other seats  EW play 2@D=weak @H/@S   wonder what it is in 4th seat|pg||
mb|2D|nt|reisig: Might reach the automatic 4@h here|pg||
nt|toral5: how come 29 started?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes http:/www.ecatsbridge.com/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i have no idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think this is the last  board|pg||
nt|delberto:  Ginnosssar was scared of opening and letting NS into the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that PASS should generate a swing|pg||
nt|delberto:  despite his good hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i wondered about 4th seat 2@D|pg||
nt|delberto:  that looks like a sensible action if its available|pg||
mb|d!|nt|Gerben42: playing a non-penalty X, Nickell has a tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still might have gone for 1-suiter|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in hearts e/w|pg||
nt|ady: no opening from east|pg||
nt|ady: maybe suit quality against their system?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness thinking hard|pg||
nt|zbig1959: format is 4 rounds x 16 boards,, |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 2@C natural?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@s is making while NS have nine tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2@C for sure here|pg||
nt|blum1956: even ten tricks probably|pg||
nt|blum1956: maybe there are some computer problems again?|pg||
nt|xenya: funny|pg||
nt|zbig1959: x = 3cards support @S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|reisig: The real test ...comes later --- in claiming|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe 8-13 like the Italians?:)|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  so i m not caught|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|ady: £@S  must show this type of hand   long hearts|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S|pg||
nt|zbig1959: responce 2@H means weak nt and 4@H at N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: might and automatic dont seem to belong in the same sentence :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is touch and go, but as long as u don't put up that @DK too early, you can make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: not that time, just thought a long time.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i mean those @H look like 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2NT presumably some kind of relay|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 2NT - gf - operating bid, ask about shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: pass??!|pg||
nt|tlc: Well, thx to trevor and all the commentators...and of course the spectators for keeping us all honest .....|pg||
nt|udo: 5@H a lucky make|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: HOLY ...something|pg||
nt|mamos: might was the right word|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h probably a relay to show stronger NT|pg||
nt|xenya: Canada need to reach 3N here|pg||
nt|reisig: Slam seems likely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: clubs?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: flat deal... |pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: first board was 16|pg||
nt|ady: apparently kibd say it just shows short spades   but does not show any suit    that seems impossible in vire of 4NT?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now Helgemo in the tank|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: motionless|pg||
nt|ady: nice   pick between 2 or 3 card suit with 7@H?|pg||
nt|ady: this appears a mix  up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Hekgemo staring into space|pg||
pc|dA|nt|reisig: Played ace?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT stright would've been lower range, i suspect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This could be Cambridge Precision from the late 70's|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|reisig: Only 6@c works|pg||
nt|zbig1959: guess, 3nt, boring 3433 :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: greco has a bad hand|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|reisig: This is like a comedy act|pg||
nt|mamos: EW seem rattled|pg||
nt|reisig: They should be|pg||
nt|Walddk4: +5 is not correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, when you claim you have the option of claiming less tricks than the remaining. Please choose that option when declarer does not have the rest|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To the left in the window you can claim less tricks than the rest|pg||
nt|reisig: "break" = we NEED a drink!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It reads Less on the button|pg||
nt|ritong: no real fit, known wasted cards|pg||
nt|ady: I cant think why east has any ambition other than game in hearts  |pg||
nt|benjy: win the @D heart to the ace and lead a club up|pg||
pc|h2|nt|toral5: dummy is dead at trick 1:(|pg||
nt|bg: maybe they play 16 board sets|pg||
nt|toral5: no no|pg||
nt|toral5: 1st set was 14 brds|pg||
nt|cicus: no, 14 board a set|pg||
nt|caitlin: 14|pg||
nt|bg: then why no 29 Practice board?|pg||
nt|toral5: 5 top losers.so has to b a push|pg||
nt|caitlin: Joe how many boards?|pg||
nt|cicus: 29-16+1=14|pg||
nt|toral5: a kib points out,brd 15 is missing in the score card.so this has to be 15|pg||
nt|xenya: well if S plays back a @H now...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 14 and this is our 14th -- not suire why we started with 16|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: 2@H should make 9-10 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: probably more if you are trying for less @@  )|pg||
nt|gulyas: will probably draw trumps and settle for 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: right|pg||
nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
nt|barnets: various comments from specs on the last board|pg||
nt|reisig: Not often ..partner reverses and you have KJ and K in their suits|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|lml: you pretty well have to punt it with the East hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some day <i will learn how to spell..  |pg||
nt|xenya: well, yes -- but still|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pitiful:  passing 3NT looks normal to me|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|gulyas: well, cannot really ruff both @Cs in hand|pg||
nt|ady: lucky not too lose more on this hand    hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|kittyc: and an ouside AK|pg||
nt|zbig1959: well judged by Smieszkol :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pitiful:  lucky in my opinion, surely north might only have 1 queen?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: it was well done|pg||
nt|lml: worth a single pip|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: lucky pass on 5@H, ?? lack of Q@H and one key value..|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|toral5: no comments if south plays @H:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: anyonedo math here:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: anyone|pg||
nt|caitlin: how many sets a day Joe?|pg||
nt|toral5: we have about 20,800 people on bbo at the moment.thts a huge number|pg||
nt|bg: 4 sets|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 4 X 14 each day|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: allegedly, all no 15 boards have been taken away for repainting the vulnerability marks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: no re-entry to hand|pg||
nt|reisig: This match is OVER|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|copeyj: lucky that 5@H is safe|pg||
pc|s4|nt|copeyj: is Peter's point|pg||
nt|pitiful:  he is lucky 5@h does not go off|pg||
pc|h9|nt|zbig1959: maybe 2@S +1.. |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: can make an extra @D trick tho:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kittyc: congrats to the Diamond team!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|toral5: guess the set has ended now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no one seems to know why we started with 16 instead of 15|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty folks see you in hour!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: interesting that the open plays 56 bd matches.   the women play 60|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: women are in a later stage of the event so maybe that is why|pg||
nt|caitlin: and I sure hope we get finals of women's on vugraph!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: come back in 35 minutes for more action|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's always depressing for a defender - when declarer plays the suit you've led straight back at you|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm sure many believe west should have bid something (or DBLd)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kittyc: thanks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42: well gotta go now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks all!|pg||
nt|kjadams: hmm.. which black ace did he cash?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: spade, in fact|pg||
nt|kittyc: hmm that was not best for declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: maybe that's why I got it wrong |pg||
nt|kittyc: maybe :)|pg||
nt|kittyc: easy when you can see all the hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Robinson in deep thought now|pg||
nt|barnets: if north knew when to return a club ten a spade is always best|pg||
nt|tlc: i admit to counting myself amongst the passers|pg||
nt|pitiful:  north would b id same way without @s queen?|pg||
nt|zbig1959: but S as yu pointed earlier shd pass on 3nt|pg||
nt|pitiful:  low @s instead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is what i mean|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - even with the actual North hand, declarer still needs one of two finesses (and no ruffs)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: maybe x means something else|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: and wolfson has prevailed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|reisig: 1@s or 2@s?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't like W's pass, even though it might turn successful here if E finds a X|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mamos: 2@S|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@c coming|pg||
nt|mamos: richie dont go to casino|pg||
nt|stc: Low scoring match with two compensating swings coming from the weak NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3NT makes via a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: bad 4 @d's and 4-3-3-3 , the optimal for a double is when you're short in Partner's suit and have at least 5 of them|pg||
nt|ady: this  the 2nd time this set  they have been at the 5 level  in dangerous waters   and been lucky each time    this session  could have been a landslide for Diamond  if things had ...|pg||
nt|ady: gone wrong with those hends|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes 2@D opener is 10-13 so they'll be in the auction|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: maybe 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: for leaving a double, that is|pg||
nt|barnets: a great performance by a brand new team|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I go ...either way|pg||
nt|reisig: Now ..that's a heavy 2@s|pg||
nt|lml: how to get caught up|pg||
nt|xenya: they will land on their feet though|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3H walking the dog perhaps.|pg||
nt|kittyc: how many diamonfs will north bid?|pg||
nt|delberto:  an interesting double by Helness |pg||
nt|phil: yes, was thinking the same thing|pg||
nt|zbig1959: X by S, = 3 cards @H support|pg||
nt|zbig1959: again, lucky 6@S (S) ... on @D break 3-3|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: I thought it was over anyway, but they seem to have found a fifteenth board|pg||
nt|udo: everybodys 2 @h bid ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tejjyid: 3@S a nice bid by West - maybe a bit of a D/D fantasy though|pg||
nt|kittyc: surprised East passed, looks like all his cards are working|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: long thought by Nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: long, long thought|pg||
nt|kjadams: with lucky clubs, 5H is makeable.   Seems like pard must fit the clubs on this auction.|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, they might as well not have bothered|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 3@S now|pg||
nt|barnets: there will be 4 great teams in the semi finals|pg||
nt|reisig: I'll bet against a @s lead :)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: with no wasting values in @S - this contract wld have some perspectives, rt now losers are 3@C 1@S = dn1|pg||
nt|benjy: It looks as though they had a misunderstanding in the OR as 3NT clearly wasn't to play|pg||
mb|4S|nt|blum1956: Pszczola carefully avoids bidding with @dKx and a void in partner's suit|pg||
nt|stc: smart :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, East's hand just got worse thoughout|pg||
nt|lml: but to normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I better stop predicting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 29 flat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and this should make nine easily enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college we'd explain the DBL  as  "showing the values for DBL in this sequence"    lots of people hated us when we were in college|pg||
nt|delberto:  looks like declarer really should lose a trump a diamond and three hearts|pg||
nt|phil: I think the defense will be very straightforward|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the 10 is a nice card for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: duck the first @d is best for def. then S has some difficulties of discards over 4 @s's|pg||
nt|zbig1959: no double no trouble.... (dn 1 still good bridge)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west's card is likely to be SP here|pg||
nt|zbig1959: opps, missed one loser in trump, dn2|pg||
nt|zbig1959: seems, they are tired, must be misunderstanding,. 3nt for play (??)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|zbig1959: fast clim coming, 12 trciks, |pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: well bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if he makes it|pg||
nt|gulyas: fun fact from my ppl again:):|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: bapat asked he could have 4S, DZ 1000 to 1 against it.|pg||
nt|gulyas: bd 28, where 3nt was down 2 here|pg||
nt|gulyas: both rooms in 3NT, Dumbovich making...|pg||
nt|gulyas: doubled in the other, down 1 on the requested @S lead! the match tied|pg||
nt|zbig1959: *claim|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gulyas: with the @Cs right, he can ruff some @Hs, but he has communication problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 10 is 0 or 2 higher|pg||
nt|delberto:  a trump switch being indicated now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though it looks like declarer is safe for 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|lml: if South ducks the heart finesse is 9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: which is quite safe -- even with the @HK in the N hand|pg||

nt|ady: is it 1 more after this?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|reisig: going down ..anyway|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|zbig1959: kibitzers corrected me, thx, shd be dn2.. i need new glasses |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|gulyas: interesting enough, 3NT can be made, with @Cs taking 4 tricks, 2 red aces, and @Ss also giving you 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: lots of thinking going on|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets take stock|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|udo: pltnick also n 7@D,also @D lead|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: good switch by Greco|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|gulyas: @HA+2ruffs, @DA+ruff, 2 top @Cs|pg||
nt|udo: bord 25|pg||
nt|ady: get the clubs going  |pg||
nt|ady: so both grand slams  flat|pg||
pc|d8|nt|reisig: Defense ...defense|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West is suddenly hoping the heart king is onside|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: pretty safe to duck|pg||
nt|lml: now the heart finesse can lose|pg||
nt|lml: or win|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, a club lead now and he can duck again|pg||
nt|lml: he could|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, good play |pg||
nt|lml: would be okay|pg||
nt|lml: then ninth trick in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: it is dead silent in this room|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: and very still...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no kibbitzers are allowed in the viewgraph room.  <just me and the players here. |pg||
nt|lml: I would just want the match to be over so I could have an adult beverage|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mamos: well 2 @H ruffs gone|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs only 3 more trump tricks -not gonna happen|pg||
nt|gulyas: now ruff a @H, and play on @Cs|pg||
nt|mamos: seems likely to play Diamonds now|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will lose a @D and a trump from now|pg||
nt|gulyas: *@H and trump, sorry|pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as @Cs behave, he is fine|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know whaat they play in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 25 min. warning|pg||
nt|gulyas: the Hungarian declarer made this one:)...|pg||
nt|gulyas: same contract in OR I hear|pg||

nt|blum1956: for som reason Lev echoed in trumps hence Pszczola playing him for etra trump|pg||
nt|blum1956: *extra|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2 more boards|pg||
nt|delberto:  quite difficult for NS to goplus on that hand|pg||
nt|zbig1959: wow, nice score from OR for England, over strong 1NT NS reached game, 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|reisig: 2@h - all Pass|pg||
nt|ady: this must be last of the session?|pg||
nt|delberto:  have to stop in 3D|pg||
nt|phil: or pass 3@h :)|pg||
nt|delberto:  yes ok|pg||
nt|delberto:  :)|pg||
nt|zbig1959: wow, cold 5m here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW can make 3@C, NS can make 3@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: last board|pg||
nt|copeyj: 6m|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: YEAH ...I guessed one right|pg||
nt|ady: I make this 15th|pg||
nt|copeyj: difficult to bid|pg||
nt|zbig1959: swing for Lions|pg||
nt|benjy: Normal to bid with the north cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: EW will find it difficult to find 3@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: not exactly my choice of 1NT and also not for the 2@Ds:)|pg||
nt|stc: Pepsi will balance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ahh, Acol :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S now from North, surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S - that's a surprise|pg||
nt|xenya: well he had to bid something i guess|pg||
nt|lml: he has too much to pass I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: usually you can expect that a played who bids a new suit in the 2 level after passed once already will have at least a tollerance in P's suit|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt want to push out his 6 to the 9|pg||
nt|lml: bye ... see you ... tired here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Linda|pg||
nt|xenya: bye Linda -- thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: bye, have one for me.. :)|pg||
nt|lml: sad too... but enjoy it you Brits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North probably reckoning that all this marks South with not very much |pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't 3@D just lose a different 5 tricks?|pg||
nt|phil: 6@d excellent here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if reduction bids allowed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=minor suit stayman|pg||
nt|copeyj: over 4@S from Paske|pg||
nt|copeyj: North has nothing further to say|pg||
nt|zbig1959: strange, why N didnt bid his 2 suiter?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s may go down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm amazed|pg||
nt|phil: only 4 that I can see|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|blum1956: I would preferred immediate 2@s with North's hand|pg||
nt|stc: they must know each other|pg||
nt|benjy: and normal to get to game if north shows @Ss south will always raise|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzsv: I think everyone is getting a little tired... |pg||
nt|delberto:  :)|pg||
nt|delberto:  NS seem tohave located their diamond fit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: assuming EW are genuine - not 100% at this vulnerabiilty |pg||
nt|ady: 3 of a red suit looked over the top for e.w|pg||
nt|zbig1959: needed another X by N, and 4nt = minors by S on way for 5/6 m|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: this maybe only 1 off|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|zbig1959: as yu noticed, in our room, it wasnt normal.. N passed ..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|udo: risky X from Helgemo in my opinion|pg||
nt|delberto:  it's a question of how high they go|pg||
pc|s2|nt|delberto:  not in doubt any more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helness must have ruled out 7 opposite passed hand|pg||
nt|delberto:  how to play this ?|pg||
nt|phil: carefully|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't duck more than 1 trick|pg||
nt|delberto:  if declarer draws all the trumps...nad then pitches a spade on the heart...he won't be able to set up the clubs and enjoy them|pg||
nt|phil: good catch|pg||
nt|delberto:  if he pitches a spade before drawing trumps....EAst will ruff the third heart|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petepunt: 1@S is a 4 card suit in acol and 2@H is only 8+ jere|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gulyas: bd 30, Poddar down in 4@S, and the match is almost tied!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: curious lead|pg||
nt|delberto:  so he ight have to time this pretty well|pg||
nt|copeyj: a second x by north|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|copeyj: would have been deranged|pg||
nt|ewj: colours put him off maybe but 6-5...|pg||
nt|copeyj: he was right to pass - just an unlucky dist|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|copeyj: for him|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|stc: good start for defense|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2@s will never go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: just crossruff|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: imaginative|pg||
nt|yuval10: why not lead a @s ? |pg||
nt|ady: club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pull 2 rounds of trump then play !AH|pg||
nt|delberto:  yes|pg||
nt|phil: so like the 3 bears - is two round of trump 'just right' (on this layout)?|pg||
nt|delberto:  :)|pg||
nt|delberto:  in truth I think it is...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sK|nt|stc: I mean the start to beat 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only time pulling all trumps works is when @CK onside|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: Peter Crouch suggests 2@S showed clubs, which would certainly explain the lead|pg||
nt|ady: can make if dropping Q@H   when ruffing|pg||
nt|ady: might have done better to unblock the dimaond honors|pg||
nt|udo: maybe he willplay ruffing finesse in @H after Helgemos x?|pg||
nt|ady: draw 2 trumps  and ruf a low heart   can make 4|pg||
nt|phil: slightly evil @d10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this line needs 3rd @D with 4+@H  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: who's got a sliderule?|pg||
nt|delberto:  he is a tricky customer !!! |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|udo: easy to make all missing tricks with open cards|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: should not try ruffing finess   cant ruff them all   just ruff the low heart  and come back with club ruff    draw and give a heart|pg||
pc|h7|nt|phil: well done|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: why not @h discard here ?|pg||
nt|delberto:  he's done it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep he's got it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: still 1 off is inevitable -- but 3 imps lost|pg||
nt|ady: going well|pg||
nt|zbig1959: so , standing ovation for Poles, Golden Medal for them :) klap klap klap |pg||
pc|d6|nt|gulyas: negotiating the @D ruff now|pg||
nt|gulyas: for down 1|pg||

mb|p|nt|reisig: NS to play 1NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last board for our table|pg||
nt|zbig1959: last board in this segment|pg||
nt|zbig1959: another possible swing ..|pg||
nt|benjy: Yes, well played to Poland and well done to England too, worthy Silver medalists|pg||
nt|zbig1959: btw, w this segment we saw at least 7 swings, and possible 3 another..|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: thanks to our operator  Trevor|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: and great thanks to the players!|pg||
nt|delberto:  another big hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|ewj: for starters opps not necessarily going to do the right thing over it|pg||
nt|ewj: even if it is right to double you|pg||
nt|zbig1959: but NS were in red,, with nothing S shd bid??|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|zbig1959: ty our incredible Operator, and Commentators, and of cours our kibitzers :)|pg||
nt|benjy: Yes it has been an exciting final set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Not as exciting as some of us would have liked, but congratulations to Poland - worthy winners|pg||
mb|d|nt|copeyj: its true they may guess wrong, but you do have nothing at unfavourable, i dont think passing unreasonable|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mamos: our last board  -- a slow start   but an interesting finish|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, some interesting hands in the end|pg||
nt|ewj: and too much of a chance that 5m is making even opposite a minimum double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Boy ...I never get em right|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to all those responsible for bringing us the bridge  WBF ACBL and BBO|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some use 3@S as ANY splinter, others specifically short @S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: its 4-3   yeah|pg||
nt|mamos: you should have known Richie|pg||
nt|zbig1959: thx Alan for your excelent job as Operator |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: 2@h is looking for a miracle|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to our commentators |pg||
nt|delberto:  6D is the top spot |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6N is better|pg||
nt|zbig1959: we must remeber they play , over 7 days, the can be tired.,|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: Fredin in the lead after beating 4@H bd31|pg||

nt|zbig1959: Winner is........................... POLAND TEAM :) |pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: thanks all!! see you later!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7@D a good contract|pg||
nt|delberto:  well both are virtually 100 %...6NT IS 100 %|pg||
nt|delberto:  and 7D has good play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 6@D gets 100 honors|pg||
nt|delberto:  but 6H could fail....on a bad day...|pg||
nt|phil: 6N would at pairs - maybe teams too|pg||
nt|delberto:  do honours count in the Rosenblum ?  lol|pg||
nt|zbig1959: thx all for your time, for watching this final, bye all|pg||
pc|cT|nt|stc: BIG POINT NOW|pg||
nt|blum1956: This must go down as opposite to the 5@c but South has to find the diamond switch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is tough|pg||
nt|blum1956: I bet he will|pg||
nt|blum1956: East MUST have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Punch asked range 12 to 14explained|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sure, the logic seems ironclad...double dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: Q@D looks right yes|pg||
nt|stc: at MP much more tough, here he has to try @d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Jxxx @H, @DA is not impossible|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2NT and then 3NT by West - ton a kind of Jxxx bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a kind|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: no, true|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: she found it|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|delberto:  ahhh|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: Thanks to the many specs, Punch is a lady, and returned a brillinat @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: thx all and well done to the scotts lady|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thinking again|pg||
nt|stc: they may cash up to 6 tricks|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now the defence is safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy    7N actually better contract than 7@H|pg||
nt|delberto:  not even Geir canmake this one|pg||
nt|zbig1959: depends on agreements, if they use lite X??? |pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: double dummy, declarer could take 12 tricks, more likely to be satisfied with 10|pg||
nt|mamos: I stand corrected it is of course the USBF  not the ACBL who are the responsible body|pg||
nt|mamos: these two teams have fought a hard battle and are both still favourites to start the Round of 64|pg||
nt|mamos: and thanks for the help from you specs   keepng us right :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: one off  or two off or even three off|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|delberto:  Iguess he misinterpreted the 6D bid|pg||
nt|phil: so Geir thought 6@d was a try for 7 and Tor thought it was a choice of slams? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 4N was Key Card  and no ask for trump Q -- then 7@H seems huge error|pg||
nt|delberto:  I htink so|pg||
nt|phil: I dont understand 6@h to be honest - why not ask about the @hQ? |pg||
nt|phil: 6@d |pg||
nt|delberto:  yes it's interesting|pg||
nt|phil: oh well - good run for these guys and WD in the playoff - can't take anything away from that|pg||
nt|delberto:  maybe he felt thatthe only way to suggest 6D (natural) was to bid it at that point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF  4N bidder held @HQ -- then would make clearer try for Grand  [usually 5N]|pg||
nt|phil: dunno - 6@d seems unilateral to me|pg||
nt|phil: thanks guys|pg||
nt|delberto:  well cetainly they got their wires crossed|pg||
nt|phil: WD Trevor|pg||
nt|delberto:  yes thanks very much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm with Phil -- seems strange not to ask for @HQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most other rooms still in play -- but meckwell table won't be around much longer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh -- and now they're showing the Juniors on vugraph|pg||
nt|delberto:  good|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stc: not enough comm for -3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petepunt: lacjk of 2@H overcall was key here.  ie he han;t hot 6-10 with 6@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: u dont necc need points from partner, just suitable minimum|pg||
pc|s6|nt|reisig: Isn't there a "law" ..that says ...lead trumps on these auctions?|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes |pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: cashing out rapid|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry, I got something wrong on this one.  they are playing cards very quickly... |pg||
nt|xenya: so a convincing win for Deutsch -- but both teams get to the KO stage|pg||
mc|11|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This translates to 24-6 in vp. Canada in third.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: see you all later.  |pg||
