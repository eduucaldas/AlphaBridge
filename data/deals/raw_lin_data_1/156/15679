nt|vugraphzau: of this board|pg||
nt|psridhar: that overstated 2s ( with KJ of dia under 1d opener) leads to curtain raiser game that is hopeless|pg||
nt|psridhar: even a response of 1N may hv been a better idea, planning to compete 2s if reqd later|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rv: E-W will reach 4@h after this start|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Dave|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrdct: NS stole the @s suit here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rv: not easy to make 10 tricks on this layout|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrdct: north can safely set up his @d suit whilst he still has @SA entry to his hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: suspect 3@h and 1 @s for defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: a good start for the wales|pg||
pc|c2|nt|suketbombi: yes and the lead has given nothing away|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|suketbombi: oops|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|suketbombi: cannot belive she playes the ace of @HS|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: going up with @HA was not such a good idea by Shashi with 2 more 1h tricks ensured by just covering East's card|pg||
nt|suketbombi: believe that she played the @HA|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes @h was played|pg||
nt|suketbombi: must be a misclick by buddy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzat: mahesh here|pg||
nt|rv: still declarer doesn't have 10 tricks, will take @c finesse and go 1 down|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :):) I know|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|cT|nt|rv: North will be squeezed on last @h and declarer should make 9 here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s likely to fail also so not likely to be a swing|pg||
mc|8|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: www.hcl-bridge.com|pg||
nt|mrdct: gos has a good hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct: too much outside to open a gambling 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS take the 1st 8 tricks vs 3NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will sense a lack of stoppers in the red suits despite his 9 top tricks - but will surely compete to 3@c|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: URL for commonwealth tourney http://www.hcl-bridge.com/jspCWB2010index.jsp|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct: 4th best of longest and strongest|pg||
nt|mrdct: works more often than not|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|rv: declarer should still get home confortably since @hs 4-4, @SJ falling and @CK well placed, any civilized line works|pg||
nt|rv: comfortably|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|mc|6|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Next Match is Australia vs Wales on BBO|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wales didn't quite get their signals right there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: 6@s is a decent contract and does have play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: lucky layout in @h for NS here|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: zero losers here for NS but only 10 winners|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: perhaps 11 if a long @ccan be developed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: if @s 2-2 it is cold, even if @s are 3-1, other chances to score (@dk coming down in 3 rounds, cross-ruff)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|rv: as cards are, it is a bit tricky to make this since East can over-ruff 4th @d and @ss are not 2-2|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @S A and looking at J from W he should find a winning line|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|h6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: I suppose he can ruff 3@ds with trump still remaining in dummy, either he can cross-ruff for 12 or enjoy 5th @d|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mrdct: north still to receive the good news in trumps but is using his entries well do delevop the @c suit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|hA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|rv: Raju, I presume @DA and ruff at trick 2 is better line |pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes !K three times @S 2-2 @HKJX as u said|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
mc|10|nt|mrdct: good line there|pg||

nt|mrdct: this will be an interesting competive auction|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i predict the @s suit will win|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: Guersnsey Is located in the areas adjoining The English Channel and France. The population consists Of British, Norman,descent,Portugese,Latvian and South African|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rv: Tanzania is in Africa|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: support dbl by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: open room connection problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: board 26 3@c by east +1|pg||
nt|mrdct: a great convention|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: on 1@s-1n-2@c, some play BART convention with South hand, 2@d shows 3 types of Inv hands a) 4@c 10-11, b)5@h 9-11 c) 5@c 9-11|pg||
nt|rv: by corollary 1@s-1n-2@c-3@c shows 6-9, 5+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: result of board 26 open room 3@c by east +1|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: yes but not all play Bart Chote|pg||
nt|mrdct: west's dbl simple says that he has exactly 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: it doesn't show any extra values|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: board 27 open room result 4@h+1|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: yes, in my opinion useful convention to have in your arsenal by sacrificing NF 2@D (trade-off)|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mrdct: support dbls is fairly simple. only opener does it and will always and only dbl (or rdbl) with 3-card support other wise will raise with 4+ or just pass or bid something else with ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: 0-2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|suketbombi: this one is dn 2 |pg||

pc|dT|nt|mrdct: i believe it was invented or at least attributed to meckstoff-rodewell|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s3|nt|rv: still declarer might get it wrong by finessing @dJ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: dont cash ur @H J and get ur 5 tricks chote|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|rv: he might finesse @DJ here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sometimes it pays not be imaganative|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|rv: East's second @h return should have told West whether he had 3 or 4 of them|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: welcome Shirley|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|mrdct: NS had a good save in 4@s here but hard to get into the auction|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|rv: I am not sure if East realised that his partner's 2@d is NF after 1N O/C by opps, it is not same as bidding 2@d on any other O/C|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rv: E-W pair don't seem to be very experienced partnership|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome to Serhat |pg||

nt|suketbombi: 2@DS a @C ruff and 2 major aces|pg||

pc|d6|nt|suketbombi: bhosale is lead ur doubleton reverse Bhosale is to find pd's Doubleton:):)|pg||
nt|mrdct: the "save" is predicated on the general aversion to not lead from AQxx|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|dT|pg||

nt|rv: essentially remove North's entry for giving South a @C ruff|pg||
nt|serhat: do you agree with small H there? instead of 10?|pg||
nt|mrdct: west has a nice hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 hts, 7 nt  7 sp |pg||
nt|sybarra: almost anything but 7 clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm just taking my shoes off now to count his points|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mrdct: 2@d is probably a trash weak 2 in a M|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: from a spec with a calculator:  7@H = 36% , 7@s = 77% 7NT = 85%|pg||

nt|mrdct: 3@d must show some sort of @s hand and 4NT keycard in @s i  presume|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 7 @D =69% |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we have all contracts covered |pg||
mb|p|mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 5@h some sort of ongoing ask (i.e. do you have @s Q)|pg||
nt|serhat: 7nt best as it has extra play|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: would 6 clubs show q of spades and k of clubs do you think?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the skipped steps probably showed @CK and no @DK|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
nt|serhat: I think so. but he doesnt know the Q@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think 7@s best as the 13th might be a @c ruff|pg||
nt|serhat: if he knew 7nt shuld be bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzat: north telling east ...suit bid at 7 level:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ask how the hts break and claim |pg||
mc|13|nt|mrdct: if they are playing full rolling keycard responses, gill could've bid 6@d or 6@h to ask more - but he thought he had enough|pg||
