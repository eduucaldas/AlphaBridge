nt|swanson: took|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so they started brd 17|pg||
nt|toral5: another dull push coming up|pg||
nt|ady: so declarr played a trump|pg||
nt|tlc: hi karen and alan :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are off|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fasten your seatbelts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I live 3 mins from Stamford Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director came in the room and said GO|pg||
nt|norby: very similar system grco ham and meckwelll|pg||
nt|pelu: here we go and start with a potensional slam|pg||
nt|me argent: tasty for the def|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance for israel here|pg||
nt|dburn: but these have been two pretty impressive effort by Fay and Chiu|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: north south discuss under the screen before it is lowered|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010YouthPhiladelphia/Damiani%20Cup/Poland/mroczkowski_smieszkol.pdf|pg||
nt|blum1956: reasonable 4@s here - will Israeli pair bid it&|pg||
nt|blum1956: ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: all our life we're waiting our wives..........|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
nt|yvesj49: gooooooooooo|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: Fasten your seatbelts...showtime!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|toral5: spectators are expecting some early fireworks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is the action man|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|algraves: NS on @S Guess for 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: streaming from pairs: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|blum1956: hardly now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Traian and last he made an error was in 1987|pg||
nt|algraves: no this is the well known meckwell and the great young Israeli pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 2n with East hand showing @C+@h split range?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3nt probably|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: i guess it's the sixth heart that stopped him, rather than being so weak|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth|pg||
nt|algraves: EW have 8 tricks in  @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell-Meck in 6@s|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 6@h on 16 was a particularly good contract, any more than it is here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: now north needs a support re-redouble :)|pg||
nt|norby: i prefere 1 hearts with 6 heart, if 6 diamond and 5 heart better bid 2 suiter|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstroth certainly chose winning bid especially with Rodwell having other 2 suits:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in fran,ce it's shows balanced hand with good support|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but all the ways go to 4@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
nt|athene: not so useful when south has denied five spades though|pg||
nt|norby: sorry 6 club and 5 heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no one steals from West|pg||
nt|algraves: we are finding out what system they play|pg||
nt|athene: east's choice of rebid suggests it was indeed the sixth heart he was thinking about when he bid 1@H rather than 2nt|pg||
nt|rv: does 1@s substitute for supp X with north hand?|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to get that sixth heart into it - he might bid clubs later maybe if it seems like a good idea i suppose|pg||
nt|norby: stron hand only|pg||
nt|norby: strong|pg||
nt|algraves: he is 4333 and doesnt want to encourage anything|pg||
nt|algraves: A lot of bidding around Rodwell|pg||
nt|algraves: with the best hand at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod thinking now|pg||
nt|athene: he might raise hearts now|pg||
nt|algraves: I think XX showed exactly 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: is Greco's 2@s conventional if Hampson didn''t show 3@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: was not alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you want to be in slam 6@D is better than 6@S because of the lesser risk of a ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D with 5@S is new animal for me|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I don't like that...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry i saw 5332|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: North opened 2@D (multi) in CR, almost forced EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 22 hcp 3NT  CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yuval Yener and David Burn|pg||
nt|athene: well, 2@S says he wants to compete but he is known to have only four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so logically he must be prepared for north to pull to 3minor|pg||
nt|athene: i expected 3@H from west but he doesn't mess about :)|pg||
nt|rv: normally Rodwell gives allowance for Meckstorth's aggressive bids, this time he doesn't|pg||
nt|pelu: no EW bidding - lead @d|pg||
nt|algraves: well it is just standard 2 over 1, not a diamond raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess the 3@C bid will make you guess the spades|pg||
nt|peachy: N might make one try|pg||
nt|me argent: south took control in the CR to disaterous effect|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is considering now|pg||
nt|peachy: Other room had a GF 3H rebid (assume GF) which made South overextend|pg||
nt|me argent: if north takes control they should avoid slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovski in the tank at the moment|pg||
nt|dburn: in the other room, declarer got what appeared to be a friendly @d10 lead to the jack, queen and king|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: more imps now for nickel|pg||
nt|dburn: except perhaps East, who thinks his partner might have something|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW plays 2/1 with transfers in responses over 1@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|mildredb: best start, for sure|pg||
mb|3N|an|alerted|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: so this plays well with the friendly hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing too fancy|pg||
nt|kareno: David, you know my feelings on the subject - you must get in the auction when it is appropriate and this time \i feel it is definitely appropriate :)|pg||
nt|tlc: and the friendly clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: probably 9 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asking about leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably too much action|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks like quite a lot of bidding|pg||
nt|algraves: yes exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodwell didn't open the Greco hand|pg||
nt|algraves: no reason particularly to guess spades in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Nickell seems to thrive if they are 40 behind. So maybe a slam swing here will be useful :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D better that 6@S - risk in 6@s a @D-ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: so, he played @sA and ruffed a spade - overruffed, and West cashed his ace|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no more than 4........|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: for sure 8|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: this is where you are supposed to run the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play israeli standard souped up no doubt which is a straight forward natural approach |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
nt|algraves: undoubtedly very good card players and fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks that 5d was prefered in the closed as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco doubled in a flash|pg||
nt|pelu: but also a @S ruff could be setup with 3 @s and @DA on same hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but a lesser risk|pg||
nt|dburn: now, was that [a] bad luck or [b] bad play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he can make it if they don't lead a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
nt|yvesj49: on @s lead|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Nice. Now +1 for the coach, please :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: this is 2 down on accurate defense even after this lead|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is definitely better|pg||
nt|peachy: Once teo keys are missing, should not be in slam|pg||
nt|peachy: two |pg||
nt|yvesj49: lol marc what else than @s lead.........|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lool|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: did have 2 hearts  1 spade   and K@D on 3rd heart   but not now|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead, Israel has a chance here|pg||
nt|me argent: north was Q bidding in a situation that KCBW would have worked better|pg||
nt|me argent: declarer aint making this hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: but maybe the auction indicated a club lead - not sure exactly what the later rounds meant, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance for a swing from the word go|pg||
nt|rv: defense should get 3@cs and 2@h if they can shift to @h in time|pg||
nt|algraves: So Meck is playing with a lot of information but it wont help him much|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell making a comment about the tray being slow coming back|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Rodwell played Meck for more since he didn't bid 2@h or 2n in first round|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows the spades and the diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think unhappy with something|pg||
nt|algraves: so they stop off a key card and the trump q very disciplined|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
nt|norby: strange double of greco, probabily understimate rodwell?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just impressed they knew what was trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|blum1956: That is the best NS could achieve - 3NT defence against the 4@s game|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hA|nt|dburn: or, of course, not play on hearts at all - although I am not quite sure why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell thinking north took a long time to pass 4@H and that influenced the double?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think so|pg||
nt|norby: i think also with 5 hearts and 8 club:-))) |pg||
nt|pelu: S know rhey are missing 1Ace and @SQ|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rv: yes he needed to judge between under-estimating Rodwell to over-estimating Meckstorth:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost impossible to over-estimate meckstroth's aggression|pg||
nt|norby: sorry for my italenglish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only my Spanish/Italian was half as good as your English|pg||
nt|rv: np Norby, message (bridge language) is very clear:)|pg||
nt|norby: ty:-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco in the tank now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: have to say 3NT   ambitious  in CR    but came home|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he won't make it|pg||
nt|algraves: well he wont make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: may be ducking the spade was wiser|pg||
nt|rv: now @s back best|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
mc|10|nt|peachy: since he took the diamond with ace, he might need to finesse for the club jack. just as long as he does not give trick to HK|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|me argent: north sees 26 cards he aint making this|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the system card of NS|pg||
nt|peachy: even no finesse, J club drops|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still studying the system card of NS|pg||

nt|yuval10: yes, a lot of time to go|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: East alerted the 4 @H bid, however west did not :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: 3@c was minimum|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h was asking for singelton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here they had a nice 4@S save|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h denied|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||
nt|dburn: ducking the spade would have been a bad idea if South held the king of hearts, which was what Pachtman was playing for|pg||
nt|algraves: well yes but then heshould have just played on hearts at trick two|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he was going to do that, he might as well have played on hearts earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we start final 16 boards with a double digit swing -- but in which direction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: inresting in this matchwe have Norway NS at both tables - in CR: Brogeland-Sælensminde|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: match tied|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s down|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vieuxtroll: OK. +4 on the 48th...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: 10-16 this vul|pg||
nt|algraves: you want the other guys to know that you are prepared to back your judgement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, extra boards and we have them ready|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   Meck misguessed @S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I guess if you bid every hand to 6@h you will make it some of the time|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves: oh well , easy when you see them all as they say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|algraves: kudo to Brad Moss for not overcalling the big club opener in other room and tipping off the @S shortness|pg||
nt|algraves: Passing is under rated these days|pg||
nt|peachy: let me correct, two were in 4H, two were in 6H, all four made 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: effectively 47 brd shootout|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: 1@h by E would've been 3 cards support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  0-2 hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 2@c denies|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: West thinking now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell Pachtman discussing system the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|me argent: seemed to me a @C should have been played at trick2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@h optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@d is forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL someone was complaining to me yesterday about the transfer responses - I had to explain that they are almost standard in some quarters of the expert community\|pg||
nt|yuval10: says nothing about @s|pg||
nt|dburn: this one is only mildly awful|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: @d sry|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: both sides of the screen writting explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i can see none of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Hamman asks about the bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c and 2@s after @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: a question is written|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  standard signals  [if Hamman gives any]|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can afford to misguess clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010YouthPhiladelphia/Ortiz%20Patino/USA%201/fay-chiu.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D just shows 5+@ds GF or is it conventional?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 more to Diamond|pg||
nt|me argent: south cannot be blamed for pushing on this auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS : http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010YouthPhiladelphia/Ortiz%20Patino/Israel/lotan-Bar1.pdf|pg||
nt|yvesj49: boum|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: If he doesn't bid 4@h, we can't win|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blum1956: The East's hand id a typical headache - nobody passes nowdays, too weak for the 1@h and too much outside hearts for the 2@h|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: clear bid with 5 trumps, i think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vieuxtroll: S has a real trash and 4@d would win with K of @h in E|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 5332........|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 4@h|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzta: 2h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman gave him 2 fingers|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play a standard start with a very modern approach after that with transfers and information requesting waiting bids etc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's actually 'natural' after he already denied as many as three|pg||
nt|algraves: anad more to come no doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck did not know he is on lead lool|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and HH landed in 3d|pg||
nt|algraves: the future will be to bid games giving away as little as possible|pg||
nt|algraves: and try and position NT contracts  if possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asked him do you know you are on lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: webcam: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|me argent: doubt south will stop short of slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: with what sounds like the commentary from the Rama|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this does not seem like a junior match...they are usualy superfast|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and Q@d........|pg||
pc|sK|nt|toral5: nice 2nd dbl from helgemo|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking now|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: East thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: thinking what to discard from dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks normal to pitch a diamond and play @HAx hoping for another trick somewhere|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|ady: but there will be a 2nd discard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me remind specs that the Nickell team came back from 40 IMPs down with 8 boards to go the other day, so nothing is decided|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DJ lead and small from East the safeplay is to finess in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They won the last 8 boards 47-0!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jkotor: with blocking @c@c|pg||
nt|peachy: Israel might get couple IMPs if they get 11 tricks instead of ten|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher in the tank now|pg||
nt|peachy: heart lead would have virtually guaranteed 2 down|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lets see now|pg||
nt|pelu: prob need to finess @D9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice support dummy has|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Q of @d in place of Q of @s, of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|jkotor: yap, very good 3nt by Chechs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aww....|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate position in hearts    though always a good chance if 10@H is with west|pg||
nt|athene: i like 3@D over 3@H - when opps have spades, all other suits rank the same|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010nonJuniorPhiladelphia/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf   for Meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: i mean 3@D rather than 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H decent sac vs making 5@s|pg||
nt|me argent: fay might have been better off showing what he has rather that what he hasnt|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is surely looking for a 4@D bid from his pd|pg||
nt|me argent: good to have partner involved|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm not fond of 3H, apparent LR spades.|pg||
nt|blum1956: will West find a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably forcing NTR|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NT*|pg||
mb|4S|nt|toral5: 2nt by east will be natural here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: incase he decides to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
nt|athene: from a lead point of view, a diamond lead is less likely to cost than a heart too|pg||
nt|me argent: q bid shmoo bid at this vul show your 2nd suit get your oxe involved|pg||
nt|peachy: should have better trumps, four for starters|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a X in East - but only if pd has a 5 card suit :)|pg||
nt|norby: forgive me but i comment both bad and good think of players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H may bypass equal/longer @D in 1-bid hand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good for french team !|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: So far the deals have been good for the leading team - little chance of a swing|pg||
nt|algraves: he can guess the clubs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar asked : normal stayman auction, answer yes|pg||
nt|algraves: but only two will still see him home 3 in each red , 2 clubs and a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of that may be obvious but i think it is good to reenforce inferences for many of the spectators|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: good new from closed room !|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 5 imps|pg||
nt|yvesj49: at least........|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at least|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lead @d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: he might have 2NT available to show a raise with four spades|pg||
nt|yvesj49: as usually, the double gave the solution to declarer|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but bessis was very careful |pg||
pc|dA|nt|udo: 3 NT looks quite normal,,but i cant see 9 trciks|pg||
nt|udo: after @S lead|pg||
nt|udo: a,i see, @H  come in|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, a @d to the Ace then @hs|pg||
nt|ritong: i wonder what 1@s 2@h double means|pg||
nt|hedyg: what would you bid Raija?|pg||
nt|dburn: it shows the minors and denies spades, would be my guess|pg||
nt|peachy: instead of 3H, either Dbl or 2S|pg||
nt|ritong: or any hand without a good bid available|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: Lucky @d break in an odd way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well if he finds the diamond position he just plays on hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as usual I am last of 3 at typing|pg||
nt|udo: this @D break has its advantage,,u see  first round there is no future|pg||
nt|mildredb: takes @D lead to hold to 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: South alerted the 2 nt bid, however north did not|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jkotor: 5@c seems OK|pg||
nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
nt|algraves: some how it is always hard for the defense to hold these to 9 tricks |pg||
pc|c2|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|algraves: well they the full 20 for their slam try auction|pg||
nt|rv: I am told that it used to that each player needs to play 33% of boards in finals till recently, of late rules have changed and it is 33% of cumulative boards across all k/o matches|pg||
nt|dburn: if 3@h is a three-card limit raise in spades, then 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: agree David, denies @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is gf so not really necessary to alert 2NT i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: once you are gf you stay gf|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly David, they may have another bid on card to show 4-card limit raise|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i lefy CR after a club lead- Rosenberg was in deep thought|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact he may get home even if @ds are 4-2|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|algraves: so he guessses clubs straight away|pg||
nt|tlc: he still has to guess whether to drop the doubleton K or to pin the 9 tho|pg||
nt|algraves: so no he has 9 with spades still to be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes last set... and the table was slow...this set looks like flying|pg||
nt|algraves: well, he wont go wrong there east could have Q9xx|pg||
nt|tlc: for 3 club tricks anyway..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/ronpa-gino.pdf  for E-W's convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably knows i said the table is flying|pg||
nt|figo: great|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 1 imp match at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east stil in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asked for the screen to come down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking rodwell stuff...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now screen back up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ron Pachtman is the faster of the two. Ginossar has his tanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: having a drink now....does not look in a hurry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Live video streaming in this set is from the closed room of the playoff match|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like pass over 5@H is taken as forcing here|pg||
nt|dburn: these days everyone has, as Paul Simon might have put it, fifty ways to raise your partner|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: That is certainly part of our job, being educational|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: You don't know if N-S have a fit|pg||
nt|toral5: yes and almost as gud as 0-3/4 hcps|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Roland - absolut normal to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C better than 5@D as 2nd spade ruff with 10@C holds|pg||
nt|rmb1: This has play, take two ruffs and draw trumps|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: the Rosenblum and McConnell teams are playing the same boards, ostensibly at the same time, but the Rosenblum Teams play 15 boards a session and the McConnell 16 boards|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|algraves: i mean the opps have 27 - 29 hcp , everything is breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: McConnell = women's event|pg||
nt|jtr: As long as they cant cash the @d and a @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 6@s looks like the least Fay could bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: The diamond lead could cause a problem for the declarer giving the significant weight tj the plan: cash two spades and try for hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|mildredb: @D shift now might prevent S from taking @S finesse before taking pitches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he'll go down.......|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: not easy to ruff a club and loosing only one trump and win @h finesse...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|jtr: and the @hs behave of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now the surprise|pg||
pc|s4|nt|algraves: now meckstroth wants to play the next club from hand in case west has K9x|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jkotor: IMO he can double for T/O, @h jump will correct to NT|pg||
nt|dburn: this is presumably because the women have time for 16 boards in two and a half hours, while the men can manage only about 11|pg||
nt|algraves: so Zia is down now, he had to guess the @C to make|pg||
nt|me argent: that east hand looks like a 2@S bid to me albeit a little heavy my partners are not shy about bidding vul games|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Live VG theatre with Live comments on http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  Credit to Mila Antonova :)|pg||
nt|dburn: if pass was forcing, then East should have doubled 5@h (in fact, East should probably have doubled 5@h anyway)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: not plain sailing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness-Helgemo vs Pachtman-Ginossar|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|algraves: so an imp riding on Rodwells play of trumps|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they will can loose imp's on board 64 marc lol but not a lot|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|swanson: Pass is possible because 1@C is forcing, but that is far from a guarantee that North will find it easier to describe his hand later.|pg||
nt|ady: needs care|pg||
nt|me argent: west was always bidding slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: well 4@c must have been slammish so pass over 5@H surely forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: (whether he meant it as such or not)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||

nt|udo: didnt even test @D:)=|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: They will let the men play 16 boards per set in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|algraves: he was worried about qT8x with east|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: west better to duck diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: if W had just wanted to play game he would have bid 4@s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jtr: Hmmm I rather think he wanted his cake and to eat it|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jkotor: W is mostly weak nt, so no singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and meckstroth going down in 3@D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: Hoping to test the @hs bfore @ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's questionable whether Zia played the clubs with the odds|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|me argent: west couldnt trust his partner to make an informed decesion because he never informed him|pg||
nt|dburn: this must be a record|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c was information|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, slam after slam|pg||
nt|dburn: for the numner of consecutive boards on which 6@h has been the final contract at one table or another|pg||
nt|hedyg: i didnt see the danger in the @s finesse|pg||
nt|blum1956: is this one also OK for 2@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 12 to france...|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: willHamman open 1NT|pg||

nt|algraves: nS 3NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: no|pg||
nt|mildredb: for not me|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Double at 4@s in other room is a bid of a guy having 49 imps more... may be a good occasion for France hope !|pg||
mb|1H|nt|norby: like 3 diamonds and not 3 hearts because hearts 5-0?????lol|pg||
nt|algraves: he judged that south more likely to have singleton Honour than North to have KQX, if 2-2 didint matter what he did|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@Cs was noise not information of any great consequence|pg||
mb|2C|nt|toral5: we are having a very flat session til now,this brd no exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thought for a while and dbled|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nickell piling it on on every board|pg||
nt|ady: was not straaight forward    |pg||
nt|algraves: and it is now increasingly ancient history|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east writing an explanation while south whispers with west|pg||
nt|hedyg: X= @s + another|pg||
nt|mildredb: what is the convention name, Hedy?|pg||
nt|blum1956: According to the CoC NE are right, SW wrong|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: 6@s only -3|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c was an attempt to get his partner to cuebid diamonds, so it wasn't that stupid|pg||
nt|hedyg: no idea :(|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Quentin and Lhuissier are now 20 centimeters up !|pg||
mb|3C|nt|odysseus69: may be end|pg||
nt|jkotor: just have to jump|pg||
nt|udo: some specs point out ,hamman hates @D s,,,:)) so maybe therefore @h-play|pg||
nt|dburn: it didn't work very well, because he forgot to shoot North at the same time as he bid 4@c|pg||
nt|mildredb: I've never played vs that before|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: now 3@h - 3NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh sorry  they're still playing  19    i should have checked my source :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: i hate to disagree with you Joey, but i am sure he was fishing for a @d cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL David|pg||
nt|dburn: this 6@h is far from awful, though|pg||
nt|me argent: did he think at the prevailing vul he wasgoing to have a quiet auction with no interference?|pg||
nt|peachy: A new suit by opener prob should be cue with hearts, I would have like a cue better than 4H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chiu took 4s card out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but put it back|pg||
nt|peachy: Well he does have two side suits controlled, awith known 9-card trump fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Game is iffy to bid here after 1NT.  Hamman can show a good spade hand by bidding at the three level over Zia's xfer, but will Zia go on?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some might have passed with Zia's hand - Hamman will smile|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe 3@d :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think North will stop below game whatever South does|pg||
nt|swanson: How big can his smile be, though?|pg||
nt|jkotor: "i d like, but i m affraid"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|toral5: simple straight bidding in the other room cos north passed|pg||
nt|algraves: and he guessed wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least Joey will approve of 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: messages from specs coming in :) "Granovetter" "Lionel"|pg||
nt|blum1956: What is 3@d? Could it be NF?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C was 100% game force|pg||
nt|pelu: opening 1D and the D from N very informativ - for decl - again pass works best :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he would have bid 5@D over 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: zia-hamman started very well this set|pg||

nt|yuval10: big result to Wolfson in the CR|pg||

nt|yvesj49: w're going to loose imp's|pg||
nt|yvesj49: except if declarer play @s Ace 2nd in east|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 1NT with 5 cards in @h and 14 HCP... please, come back on earth, nicolas...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: impossible with short @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jkotor: seems like second transfer|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@H is a retransfer.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H may be re-transfer|pg||
nt|tlc: well done to get to the cold (albeit lucky) 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: this game is cold even if N would find the very inspired K@c lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't|pg||
nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what Ginossar intended to do if Pachtman had actually bid 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: after N opened 2@s, it seem illogical to finesse to the T in that suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: in @h rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: good players tend not to open weak 2's with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asked earlier for the session times to be changed and it seems the wish was granted|pg||
nt|algraves: well it seems he wants to get on @H straight away and if they are good for 5 tricks, then just give up a @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play Lebensohl by a passed hand then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing much to think about here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: can i tell him?|pg||
nt|algraves: anything but hearts from the top is illogical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you must tell him in Hebrew, Traian. Is that a challenge?|pg||
nt|algraves: my Hebrew is weak but I can call a lifeline|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: huge for me....i do speak the language|pg||
nt|rv: 2@C is fourth suit game force (FSGF)|pg||
nt|mildredb: this is what Israel needed, tho|pg||
nt|blum1956: If 3@d were NF, I would have passed North's hand immediately|pg||
nt|davidb: i JUST ENTERED .was playing mixed  teams /|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: cant Zia ruff a 2nd spade with 10C   and draw trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking now|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry S bid 3@D over 3@C and down 1 -50|pg||
nt|me argent: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow Joey!|pg||
nt|dburn: correct play for one lose with this trump suit is ace and another, not two finesses|pg||
nt|dburn: but if you're going to take two finesses, for pity's sake don't lead the queen for the first one|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: Not sure.  We knew where @CJ was|pg||
nt|blum1956: hello David. How are you doing in the mixed teams?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi David|pg||
nt|davidb: hi  micael. ok  so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: north appears emotionless, but his eyes are darting rapidly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves: Greco keeping alternate contracts open|pg||
nt|norby: routine wash.-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't blame him -- slam just depends on finding trump Q  or underlead @DQ    maybe some squeeze possibilities|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Norway/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From when H&H last played internationally for Norway, and won the gold medal|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards stil on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand|pg||
nt|toral5: helness thinking of a possibility of trump promotion|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks no problems here with friendly oppo|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson 100% for NT|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rmb1: But he ended up playing for @CJ with West (or guessing to drop @CJx with East)|pg||
nt|algraves: well good practical shot by hamman, he knows he is stuck|pg||
nt|algraves: cowardly not to bid it really and he is anything if not fearless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if misguess @HQ   does @S return kill a double squeeze?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he has to try @d 1st|pg||
pc|h7|nt|toral5: incase helgemo raised with aq|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL I have about six words of Hebrew|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, at this point it looks like a final between Diamond and Nickell, but still time for their opponents to come back|pg||
pc|hT|nt|algraves: not comletely cold form Greco point of view and moreover an imp here or there can decide match|pg||
nt|algraves: so he wants 9 and then more than 9|pg||
nt|norby: the bidding 3nt is 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|norby: in this case 4-2-5-2|pg||
nt|norby: 2nt is relais with stop in club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no 100% line. He doesn't know that diamonds come in|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the cameraman trying to film greco's card..but they are folded under the table lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: greco's cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, he would just set up the missing tricks in spades|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Greco will start with @SK and if ducked will shift his attention to @h suit?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: specs have answered full spectrum    no, yes, maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|algraves: well there is always Q lies over the J|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves: that is an old rubber bridge saying as when the cards are scooped up sometimes the tricks stay in the old order for the next deal|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|odysseus69: Jim types faster as well as commentating better|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: too fast for me :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hand shown|pg||
nt|rv: so much for my prediction:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: You can call Yuval, he is nearby|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|swanson: A heart lead would have defeated 4@H because the discard must be taken immediatly - the East can ruff the third round.|pg||
nt|rmb1: East must play a diamond now as the defence's only source of tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: aie|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rmb1: Enough for five tricks?  I am asked.  Declarer has entry problems, may not get to enjoy the spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: can transfer any message via juniors' friends, which are also playing at the same time the world championship for juniors' teams|pg||
nt|algraves: so Rodwell will switch to clubs and hold this to three|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i missed the NOT...i do not speak the language|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then I am not sure you qualify as our operator :)|pg||
nt|algraves: this may be a long set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck said sorry.. and he is taking his ahare of the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manual for Vugraph Operators, page 17, paragraph 5, lines 8 and 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: share|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps west will help meck out and just claim ...|pg||
nt|algraves: I have thought that some variation of the chess clock principle but where it applies to total team time at all 4 seats|pg||
nt|algraves: not including system explanantions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: funny enough the director kept last set the exact time of each pair|pg||
nt|algraves: so you have a total team time of say 2hrs|pg||
nt|tlc: If Joey were the Operator, could he just yell NEXT at the appropriate time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now..who want to know the result?|pg||
nt|algraves: so that takes into account that NS and EW may have much different problems|pg||
nt|algraves: and if you have a very fast pair , well that helps if you have a very slow pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes and greco-hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: and vice versa|pg||
nt|algraves: so after you play you hit the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess you could only do it during the play|pg||
nt|algraves: but that would be a big help|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@c discard looks logical|pg||
nt|kareno: Many years ago, when he was sstill a student at MIT, I asked Mark Feldman what he was thinking about on every bid and play.  He told me he was reviewing every hand he had ever ...|pg||
nt|kareno: played for solutions.  And he was serious!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he will play spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tlc: will be surprised if the @C queen isnt played as well|pg||
nt|peachy: oh dear|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is exactly the type of board you want when sitting on a lead|pg||
nt|norby: i like diamond and diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: now off if he doesnt get the @cs right|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should have listened to David|pg||
nt|blum1956: North should have ducked the first spade to avoid a huge defeat|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves: yes best not to make predictions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No danger any more as @HA is an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all laughing now....|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is exactly why he said NOT to play Q@H if you want to doublefinesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director at the table|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: lot of talk from specks   about hand 19     Zia played high trump early from hand  -  maybe better to not touch trumps early   A@S   and ruff a spade  and then diamond finesse   ...|pg||
nt|ady: and if tghe play goes the same way   diamond back   ruff another spade with 10C    then has ace and another club to draw trumps  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Rosenberg made 3NT on 19 - |pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves: so his sequence of cards suggests 6 to QJ98|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzta: Helness said TOUGH TO BEAT and all laughed|pg||
nt|algraves: and percentage is low to King for singleton Q|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Live streaming video will be back for the final tomorrow. 4 segments of 16 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland   newer ACBL CC available from 2010 Team Trials under  www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|algraves: Zia may not have to play them at all with this line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss in 7@H!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to John Stewart|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: 30 imps in not many boards|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Nickell led @SK at trick  so Diamond knew to hold on to all his spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trick 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he claim before testing @c Traian?|pg||

nt|mildredb: well played|pg||
nt|yvesj49: this board NS play 4@h x.......|pg||
nt|yvesj49: EW sry|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: well done... he would have win with AJx of @s in O |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: For various reasons, H&H have not played for Norway since 2007, and it's not because they don't qualify|pg||
nt|pelu: in all 4 matches the total IMP-swing is 20!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||
nt|toral5: i think fireworks are reserved for the last 2 sets|pg||
nt|algraves: so 3 rounds of @D , if no J then switch to @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's there and I think he can|pg||
mb|2S|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: odds are lengthening against Nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: this hand does not play well for NS in anything and they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|hedyg: so director declared -1?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: would cost a lot|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rmb1: Reminiscent of the closing boards yesterday when Nickell score 47IMPs in 7 boards to win by approx. 5|pg||
nt|dburn: the point about not playing the queen if you intend to finesse twice is that if the next hand shows out, you will reflect that you should perhaps have run the six or the seven ...|pg||
nt|dburn: instead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: do HH play 2@H here as natural or @S raise?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT rebid suggesting more than an opening NT, 18-19|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok pls let us know his decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Chiu protested|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: another good board for leaders|pg||
mb|d|nt|swanson: That was a big blow - 4@S is far from certain to be bid even if North opens 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia writes a maximum with 3 spades|pg||
nt|jkotor: Max, with HHx@s?|pg||
nt|algraves: now Pachtman has a decision about wether to re open|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2@H would be a good spade raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Redouble is 9+ hcp|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness said aha nice |pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  aggressive   partner balancing|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not the South is interested|pg||
nt|yuval10: X over NT for EW means @s and suit, as we learned yesterday, and W would never dream of bidding it with such a horrible suits|pg||
nt|kareno: Lucky Rodwell \:)|pg||
nt|algraves: best defense is 500 against 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Pachtman thinking THESE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM US|pg||
nt|algraves: but west may remove double to 2!|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S |pg||
nt|tlc: same auction to this point in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves: so practically speaking best to collect undertricks at 100 per|pg||
nt|rv: playing std 2/1, Rodwell's hand would be considered too strong for splinter (10-12 is preferred range), playing precision 13-15 makes more sense|pg||
nt|rv: Meck's 4@s is kickback asking for keys|pg||
nt|rv: they play suit above agreed suit as RKC at 4 level:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: anyone balance out there with double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: nope discretion the better part of valour|pg||
nt|tlc: at MPs maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously Rodwell intended to pass any response but this is the one he really hoped to hear I would guess|pg||
nt|yvesj49: big board for france|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: We need boards like this|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Volcker dbled|pg||
nt|yvesj49: imp's begin to dance.......|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@d ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|swanson: 2NT probably shows a maximum spade hand with two honor and three cards in spades.|pg||
nt|toral5: should he hook @H here?|pg||
nt|stewball: here's trick 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  carding  upside-down count & attitude   Smith not mentioned|pg||
pc|d6|nt|robinswr: rod could have KQJx/Jxxx/K/KQJx|pg||
nt|rv: 5@d must be asking for specific kings, 5@C would be trump queen ask which Meck has  in any case|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least no one was in 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said i will be back|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: right on Karen|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jtr: Routine here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 easy tricks - no options for anything else|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is routine hand . on the Last hand our world champion suggest 3 rounds @D then 4th @D if no Jack as the 8 of @C a strong card|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's jump to 6@h shows no kings|pg||
nt|norby: good bidding , easy and effective|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck saying TOO MANY KINGS|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5dia asks 0 or 3|pg||
nt|algraves: then you can wait with many options|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rd was asking for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 5d|pg||
nt|algraves: imp riding on the lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|norby: probabily 4 spades is ask for aces.......|pg||
nt|algraves: no only 6 always|pg||
nt|norby: and 4nt is 3 aces|pg||
nt|algraves: so no further problems here to make at least 3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1st time of my life i found a lead lol|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkotor: why 3@h now if anyway 3nt?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you have to say, this is a bit of a silly contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: needs to guess the red finesse|pg||
nt|stewball: and @s will be 9|pg||
nt|blum1956: It seems South thinks North has a strong hand. |pg||
nt|mildredb: south was aggressive w/ the 2NT call as was north w/ the 3NT call|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: st looks at his opps convention card before leading|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: south looks :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: can come by 7 tricks, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I meant Oshri looks at south's convention card|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: noone can explain what happened here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, North has implied majors too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rodwell could have been 4450, no reason to re-open|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell went to the bathroom|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|algraves: well sometimes they are in big trouble and you have more high cards than they do. so you might get a penalty or a partscore swing|pg||
nt|robinswr: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|norby: of course 0 or 3|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|norby: but meck think or hope 3:-))|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would think 5sp asks for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: mack : i am making six ...just looking for the other trick|pg||
nt|norby: better when trumps is hearts play rkcb at 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: request for link to video please|pg||

nt|stewball: kind of an odd lead..i could see it if he had an entry|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mildredb: @S to T now?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|swanson: This sequence would seem to offer a choice of games with emphasis on spades (rather than a direct 3NT over 2NT).|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess down the middle is to pass it out|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Doubleton may be good with a very weak hand and a double of partner|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: the North hand isn't strong enough for 3N=slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia is impassive|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer has to guess which red suit finesse to take.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|algraves: Moss in 7@H in closed room and their is a line of play that makes |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it appears Brad Moss is executing the double squeeze in 7@H|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jkotor: friend is telling me J@h, if no K, then kill it take @s, and finesse @d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: jack of hearts to test was usual Zia style - if no king then play diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|toral5: that can be costly if @H q off.|pg||
nt|toral5: presuming defence wont allow @D ruff,helness does have a problm here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: south mistakenly called for a heart from the dummy and when told he was in his hand, he finessed the @S 10|pg||
nt|yvesj49: christmas for volcker lol|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson: I don't think 3NT should be a slam try over 2NT on this auction.  North could always cue bid.|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: specs saying only 1 way to play @c, and only 1 way to play @H and he didnt?|pg||
nt|dburn: the Director may well take the view that anyone who took the danger play of running the queen of hearts would not take the safety play of  cashing the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he claimed 11|pg||
nt|me argent: declarer dont count so good|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Even 2@S was too high I think|pg||
nt|norby: kickback is convention at 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now even 47-0 isn't enough, on the other hand, they have more boards to get the missing IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: According to the Rule of 15, Helness has an opener. HCP + spades must add up to at least 15 if you go by Pesrson's Rule|pg||

nt|udo: yes, with all finesses wrong looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: The try looks dubious facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the good old days this would have been a passout. 12 aceless 4333 was no opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1892|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia waiting for hamman to lead|pg||
nt|jtr: @c lead may help a little|pg||

nt|udo: hello|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On a serious note, it is no crime to pass the East hand in 1st vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|udo: maybe that lead helps in @c, but still down , imo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i lost the play... i had to close the screen|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think they lead the 10 from this holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Ginossar went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and i had to protect the screen|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Only -3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: -3 ??|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yuval10: might've played @d to the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky zia claimed quickly 2 down|pg||
nt|udo: since the round of last 16,,when u go to restroom, u get an bodyguard:))|pg||
nt|jtr: A couple of singles passed the slips for Wolfson|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all of those weaned on weak nt would not consider a move over 2 spades- |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west is back now|pg||
nt|udo: playing weak NT it goes prob. 1NT pass pass pass|pg||
nt|rv: here Hampson's X shows primary @c+@hs possibly, 2n would have primary @cs+@ds|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rmb1: Back now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the surface e-w cards look good for 4 hearts - but the 4-1 trump break means curtains - kind of game everyone is bidding|pg||
pc|h5|nt|algraves: Yes I guess it is possible to misquess diamonds if west plays low and you put in ten|pg||
nt|kareno: Only way I can see making only five is with Ace and a diamond led.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 probably the right card though|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps..actually the percentage play|pg||
nt|algraves: 9|pg||
nt|rv: good stop though even this might be too high on trump shift now|pg||
nt|algraves: so even with a trump switch Hampson can guess @H for three tricks and down one losing trick in each suit|pg||
nt|athene: trump shift is very good, kills two possible tricks in dummy (ruff, @DK)|pg||
nt|norby: somepeople prefere 3 club at double over 2 spades, but double is perfect bidding for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck in the tank now|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding is revealing - they know north has something like 7411|pg||
nt|algraves: a " bad buy " as they say for Hampson|pg||
nt|rv: I like X to show @c+@hs and 2n to show @cs+@ds|pg||
nt|algraves: picture Greco with @C K and @H Q|pg||
nt|athene: if the double shows hearts and clubs, maybe south should bid 2nt, saying "i am not sure if we want to play clubs or diamonds"|pg||
nt|athene: i am just looking for ways to play 3@C rather than forcing yourself unnecessarily to 4@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: well i have a feeling they have discussed this and that 3@D is the bid that is in compliance with the partnership agreement|pg||
nt|norby: club is the best come back|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table...stil thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: while we are waiting. a lot of messages on the auction. Hampson was prepared to show a strong @C overcall|pg||
nt|stewball: it seems fred bid 7 knowing he was missing the trump Q|pg||
nt|stewball: maybe he was expecting a trump lead or hamman/zia to bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly right John -- with big lead, try to maintain parity    or so they say|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fred had a great first board when Meckwell went down in slam, so it seems a little strange that he bid the grand slam if he knew they were off @HQ|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2 down after the heart switch|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|toral5: cd easily have been an ALL PASS brd:)|pg||

nt|yvesj49: imp's*|pg||
pc|d9|nt|toral5: helness did wel to open here as the cards lie|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||

nt|vieuxtroll: keep quiet, boys... the road is long...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: what is your call after 1@h from E?|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see how many @d's will E bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess 4|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Mecksroth took zero time to play that a guess is a guess , lets get on to the next board|pg||

nt|vieuxtroll: Now, we know Israel can loose some points... |pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: I m also for X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@h = 5+@s or 11-13 bal, game force|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't think 3@d will confuse NS much|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably best to start with simple 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|mildredb: not that they will bid it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bt: an interesting hand coming up, , can ns make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H opening is creative; not sure how many would do that|pg||
nt|udo: dont think 2@D will be passed out,,,after this start|pg||
nt|davidb: nice imaginative bid|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3 down with good defence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: 2NT = @D ?|pg||
nt|kareno: Does 3@d break up their relays if anyone knows?|pg||
nt|udo: but when u have this 2 NT, thats perfect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT likely and that will go down with clubs 3-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad -- wanted to see if Hampson was going to bid 2@S or lebensohl 2N|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what else?|pg||
nt|stoffers: Looks like 9 tricks in either @h or @s here, even only 8 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they make 3?|pg||
nt|bt: helgemo has a tough choice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||
nt|stoffers: he had to bid like he did i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: problm for helgemo here|pg||
nt|yuval10: then S can cuebid and show his great hand against @s suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell writing a book for pachtman |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that Rodwell erred when he covered @C10. That is not correct, it does not matter. The error came when Meck tried to cash @SA|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: No so easy to play @d|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: His opener was not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|mildredb: can't make it even, if they lead singleton @C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bt: some wouldnt open the south hand, i hear :-)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble is that he might bid 2NT here with shape and little values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, AKQxxx you can show when asked after a weak 2. It's a rare bird but here it is|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tlc: surprised no 4@d cue|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass might've already showed some good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@d voidwood|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's the only reason|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 is not a bad contract without a @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and more writing...i can see 3-4 pages until now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H  2NT  ;  3NT   solid suit|pg||

nt|algraves: yes he had to exit with @D|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 8 losers, KQ doubleton, vulnerable. Call me a chicken, but I pass|pg||
nt|toral5: 200 looks bad here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lets see what Helness will say when dummy will come down|pg||
nt|udo: nite all, wish u a great last hands,,,,,,|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine contract, roughly 73.45%, but no luck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all roads were going to lead to 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I ubstracted a little from the 78% because Zia pre-empted|pg||
nt|pelu: but prob same contract in CR - so the % dont count :)|pg||

nt|yvesj49: ........|pg||

nt|yvesj49: he can wait|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Not so easy for W, too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jkotor: some people bid 2@h|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks if it is his lead and then plays the heart king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT 2 keycards outside diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@c now asks non @d kings, but 6@d would ask for @c help specifically|pg||
nt|algraves: east cant lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
nt|udo: work in 5 hours:)|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said SOLID OPENER|pg||
nt|blum1956: For me the North's hand is worth 2NT response|pg||
nt|mildredb: i agree|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear - what did 1@c mean?|pg||
nt|mildredb: perhaps 1NTY shows this in strong @C system, tho|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west asked for an explanation of the 1 nt bid ::)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or  Hvor er din åbningshånd, makker?|pg||
nt|bt: there is a subtle squeeze on east in pointed suit but thats after going one down already|pg||
nt|stoffers: I am surprised that one of the world's best players gets it for his light opening. I think he has played more hands than us together and have an idea of whats best in the long run. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the one you had when you opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nope... english plain|pg||
nt|stoffers: I wouldnt open, but its a border hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now...thinking|pg||
nt|bt: sorry, but i didnt hear anyone critizising|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness I mean|pg||
nt|bt: its a fact that players like meckwell make a good living on light openers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and a lot of sighs|pg||
nt|stoffers: Just 15 specs and some coments that looked like it :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|passell: no problem without trump lead|pg||

nt|yuval10: N figure up he've heared enough|pg||

pc|s2|nt|yuval10: after E will fail to lead trump ( from his void ) , 3 @c ruffs will make the contract easily|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rmb1: I guess declarer loses two hearts and a diamond, but losing spade goes on a heart|pg||

nt|yvesj49: he can count dclarer's tricks|pg||

nt|yvesj49: expensive board|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: AK impossible : with Q76 in E, he plays the 6|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3 off 5 for france|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: West in the tank|pg||
nt|yvesj49: just made 5 for israel|pg||
nt|yvesj49: when south didn't put the J @h on lead......|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: and 6@s in the CR, so new leaders|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Only AK, but does he remember the first trick and 7 in E ?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is surely much better than the rest of us, but that should not mean that we can't question the opening. No-one critizised him|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It works for him, fine|pg||
nt|toral5: i m sure MOST would pass souths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: dont care about the spect - they are spect and Helgemo the player :)|pg||
nt|toral5: no question of criticizing at all|pg||
nt|bt: now the other question is how to get away with light openers like this in a natural framework and no conventions, thats a mystery to me|pg||
nt|toral5: meckwell will SURELY open|pg||
nt|toral5: and so will versace:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because they judge so well and are great card players, Lars|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he gave a distinct look to the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|toral5: ya i agree they are super card players|pg||
nt|pelu: opening is the best attack - and u dont have a 2@D overcall later on 5 cards suit and vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in hand now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: grrrrrrrr|pg||

nt|swanson: The problem is they won't be able to improve on the result.|pg||
nt|bt: i would think ns at the other table would bid similarily|pg||

nt|athene: one point worth a mention is hampson's choice of 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are gathering speed here|pg||
nt|rv: this is not Buffett Cup scoring still 1 IMP may just be crucial in final analysis:)|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a GF balanced hand it can work much better to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thats wonderful|pg||
nt|algraves: I will hire John as my lawyer and sue the rules committee|pg||

nt|blum1956: thx Mildred|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow 6@s|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: aie|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this has to be a good board for israel|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: psychic cue 4@h in other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jkotor: 4@d and what after 4@s?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: desperate measures- but even then 7 spades is so much|pg||
nt|algraves: you know edgar Kaplan did an exhaustive study and found that big club pairs slam bidding was better if the opponents got into your auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- rather than guessing  how's our game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 1@H-D-2H-2S maybe|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4 to zimmerman on 22, where i think 2@h is a much better bid than 1NT. Quite deserved then..:)|pg||
nt|algraves: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: in R-M precision it just shows clubs or balanced, might be only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: it is hard enough as it is|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: we can all see 7@S makes, but it is going to be very difficult even to get to six|pg||
nt|swanson: It is possible that N-S will push to a grand, knowing they are behind big time.  But the bidding is starting at a high level.  |pg||
nt|bt: 1@H-D-2@H-2@S i mean lol|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@S/5@D save in picture;but 5@H also making|pg||
nt|stoffers: will Helgemo bid 2@s?|pg||
nt|bt: well i would think so|pg||
nt|stewball: would surely corrupt the endgame|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: he just did|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: 6 at least now|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d X 4@d X at other table|pg||
nt|algraves: its like the shootout in hockey who needs it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it offers too much shooting, but maybe it is just another form of competition  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 7 card fit in all of West's suits|pg||
nt|odysseus69: laydown game on minimal values|pg||
nt|stewball: any 4@s bidders as S?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@h ?|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|jkotor: both tables at least in 6|pg||
nt|stoffers: Note Helness double here, if he is gonna pull a 2@c bid for Geir to 2@d, it wouldnt show extras|pg||
nt|blum1956: Is East disciplined enough to pass 2@d?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: down 2 = 300/450|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You were wrong re 23, Lars. Brogeland passed the South cards|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a game force you should never bid 1spade over 1 heart with only four spades|pg||
mb|3D|nt|swanson: A big bid by Zia.  He was evidently planning to bid 4@S over 4@H.  But would that show another place to play or would it be a strong had with spades?|pg||
nt|swanson: hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double showed spades|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell 1n shows 11-13 here?|pg||
nt|stewball: i mean any other 4@s bidders:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: may be a namyat 4@C would have shut out north from entering|pg||
nt|yvesj49: boards are not flat.......|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: very good show|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: If 4@d is a Splinter, I think Nicolas could lead his Ace of heart |pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: If @c and @s are full in EO, there is nothing to do|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jkotor: both tables in 5@d NS now :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will they know what 4NT means - time for spades now|pg||
nt|kareno: \i didn't know that.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in game now|pg||
nt|blum1956: Oshri preferes not to check|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: If they are not, you must lead your Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: but strul did wel to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes N opening is light in hcps|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it sure looks like an opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: 6@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: both|pg||
nt|swanson: This would be uncharted waters for most partnerships.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if South bids 5@S now, North may well bid 7 - no, 6@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: not finished|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was more positive than pass- enough for Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman looking for action...asking questions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment hamman writing stuff for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|norby: yes 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|pelu: why 4@C from Zia - just to be sure that S will play the @Ss correct?|pg||
nt|dburn: getting closer, these matches - England within 17 IMPs of the Netherlands and have acquired a 1700 penalty on some as-yet-unscored deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East checks out his scorecard while waiting for the lead from south|pg||
pc|hK|nt|swanson: Now 6@S and then 7@S?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: time for spaes now|pg||
nt|bt: aha ... lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he passed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only hopr for defence is if Zia decides to play anti-odds for K doubleton club with West - no chance really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is too flat to act|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves: game bidding harder|pg||
nt|rv: now defense can cash 8 black suit tricks|pg||
nt|norby: club now or never...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: cold segment lol|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: surely this must be a 2-suiter  |pg||
nt|jtr: He will eliminate first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forgetting he was going to be on lead ??|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stewball: he likely assumed a 5 level decision was coming|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jkotor: for a push|pg||
nt|rv: Greco's @d3 would be some form of smith echo?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: 7@S not super after the 3@D bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can establish a third club trick but no entries|pg||
nt|jtr: So losing to Kx wont matter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Jack for spade switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not yet|pg||
nt|stewball: and wanted some help|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|algraves: nice lead by greco as he reads the auction well|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: An Israelian champion said to me : 4@h was not psychic but "last train". |pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Please, Yves, translate...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: last pass from Hamman was very quick- should have at least given it a thought|pg||
nt|swanson: Evidently Hamman knew how little Zia might have for the auction.  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: not good at all except that it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia unwrapped another cough drop before the dummyhit the table|pg||
nt|jkotor: what if Zia have: QJxx xxx x AQTxx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East and West get some water while Zia contemplates the hand|pg||
nt|swanson: But maybe he could hold: xxxx, Qx, x, AQJxxx?  Nothing is clear after the 3@D opening.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||
nt|swanson: He had something to say about Philadelphia also.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: contrary to popular belief in constructive auctions Zia usually has his bid - he embarks on some psychological adventures but they are the exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wouldn't W.C. Fields rather be here in Philadelphia?|pg||
nt|pelu: EW in 4@S over 4@H in CR|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S fine for me - @HK = no value opp partners singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck did bid 4@S over similar auction  [Gitelman 3@D instead of 3@H]|pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: this a more solid 1@D ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: you have been there, done that|pg||
nt|rv: Greco|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|pelu: that 4@C from Zia looks desperat :)|pg||

nt|algraves: and led Ace of @C to keep the ruffing option open in case declarer void in @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N or make mild slam try with @D?|pg||

nt|stewball: they should have the tools to 6@d here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: south sits back in his chair to consider the double on his right|pg||

nt|dburn: spades and another, I am told by someone who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Or KQ doubleton of hearts west |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slam even without @HQ, so Hampson will investigate|pg||

nt|toral5: after a long time we have a slam|pg||
nt|pelu: can Greco give super-accept?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is|pg||
nt|pelu: yes a normal accept - 2NR could be weak or strong|pg||
nt|algraves: this is not the sort of hand to play NT as you want to either ruff a @H if dummy has doubleton |pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play that 2N can also include weak 5@C & 5@D  so 3@C says  i don't like @D  3@D says I like|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|algraves: or use you trumps to ruff out black suit or suits for 12 th trick or to set up squeeze|pg||
nt|algraves: once you find the @D fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: great 7nt here  4-1 diamonds still might make on lie of the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H probably RKC @D    hmmm   4N Quant??|pg||
nt|dburn: but South was seemingly unprepared for this, and just bid what he hoped would make|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: 2@D mini-roman, 4441 opening values (with @D).  |pg||
nt|pelu: I would have a problem now - we play that 3 in major now is a short suit :(|pg||
nt|algraves: of course 6NT makes as the percentage play in @H is low to Q and if it loses finesse the ten next time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D: good for diamonds - 3@c would be less fit/hand|pg||
nt|algraves: but 6@D laydown for one of the 3 good reasons to prefer the suit contract|pg||

nt|norby: absoluty dont like 1 nt with 5-4 majors and 2 ace second........for me is terrible but........i undestand 2 king second|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: all laughing about Helness diamond suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Meck|pg||
nt|tlc: a kibitzer mentioned that Helness played this in 5@h and got a @H lead!  still guessed it right|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: reckon they will have cause to regret board 21  |pg||
nt|toral5: lucky i wd say|pg||
nt|algraves: he would have eventully switched to @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: He never gets to play in his solid suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's better than 50%|pg||
nt|bt: minor suit slams are not the strength of standard systems imho|pg||
nt|rv: possibly @DT as well|pg||
mb|2D|an|hearts|nt|Walddk4: Why is that lucky?|pg||
nt|toral5: very thin 1@H here|pg||

nt|norby: play king of hearts, make 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@hD = 800 :)|pg||
nt|bt: 4@H cue stands out, and is strangely symmetric|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: West could D = extra vaues - and East could pass|pg||
nt|ady: North happy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for sure|pg||
nt|tlc: bd 26|pg||
nt|kareno: Ira Rubin used to call notrumps, "grabbits,"  first to bid them grabs them :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzta: Zia waggled the one spade bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with very different sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 4@H = i have extras, hearts controlled and am interested in higher, could that be wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room is being broadcasted in the VG theatre|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so we have a lot of cameras around us|pg||
nt|stoffers: I think most top pairs wil reach 6@c on this hand. So many points and trumps together. Hard to find out its on a finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Certain symmetry.  East has AQ... in South's suit, so bids the suit that North has AQ.... and noone can bid any more|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzta: south has passed and west is thinking|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: A very good 6@d...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: and 2 cameramans|pg||
nt|blum1956: is Mroczkowski in fact thinking?|pg||
nt|besbes: 5 5|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: And 7 wins with @d 2-2...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or Q alone|pg||
nt|besbes: hoping for seven|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: In these circumstances (?), may be they can try 7...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bt: problem w 3@S is that it is ambigious|pg||
nt|toral5: most pairs will surely land in 6@C|pg||
nt|toral5: atleast the top ones|pg||
nt|stoffers: går an å spille på ja|pg||
nt|rv: 1@C is strong @c, double by Meckstorth shows 5-8 in classical precision|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a full house - maybe he is thinking of raising the pot|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bids are not entered until the board is passed underneath the screen, so that the players cannot hear the clicking of the mouse to give them an idea of the tempo of the bidding ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Sry, that was private, meaning he COULD go down playing N for K@h and Q@s|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H by west wd have made life easy for becker i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I assume 2@H agrees clubs without 4 spades, so 3@S is not natural, is it?|pg||
nt|toral5: 6@C does have a play.he might play for a vienna coup on north|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i did not notice an alert|pg||
nt|toral5: and as the cards are the roof will fall|pg||
nt|toral5: with @S q IN|pg||
nt|bt: thats a good point, the devious 1@H may lead him wrong|pg||
nt|bt: when south has @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, a losing option|pg||
nt|toral5: and full chances to go wrong cos of THAT super thin 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: after the bidding is best chance the sueeeze when S show @DA - but will Strul play for that?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker still thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy for us to see what's right because we have all 52 cards to look at|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and stil thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hear that Kit Woolsey got it wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He played for the squeeze|pg||
nt|toral5: did kit recieve a 1@H oc?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|robinswr: 2nt opening is 19-20|pg||
nt|algraves: no big deal but note that the overcall by Hampson did not hurt their bidding gave away information|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|rv: folks who themselves play precision generally don't like to Intefere with artificial methods like CRASH/Suction against others who play precision, possibly some sympathy for ...|pg||
nt|rv: comrades:)|pg||
nt|norby: more easy after 1 heart overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: does greco have singleton heart honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell stil thinking|pg||
nt|norby: i dont understand why greco dont bidding 2 diamond.......|pg||
nt|rv: I believe Greco-Hampson play Mathe against strong @c, Hampson could have doubled to show majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Discard a @H and play @H|pg||
nt|stewball: note that N didnt dbl 2@d|pg||
nt|algraves: he played Meckstroth to have 4@H and not throw the third one when dummy had only one left. he made an error|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hedyg: Fay seems to think there is a real @H fit in E|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fay in the tank|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty unlikely after the 2@c bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: ouch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: EW had it all to themselves in that room|pg||
nt|bt: winning imps against robinson, lol|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 25 only 4 out of 8 pairs bid the fine 6@c - not top-standard :(|pg||
nt|rv: he chose to bid 1@h and hide his @s suit|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 5NT and 7@d with K of @h ?|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mdgraham: this will need some play|pg||
nt|jkotor: I think Cayne 14 imps behind after board 25, other Polish (Balicki-Zmudzinski) with Lauria-Versace trying hard|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are way too high - but there was little chance of stopping in time.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant make 4 spades whatever defence does|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia explaining that he can bid 1 NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is why he wiggled or waggled the 1 @S bid|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|bt: some suffer after 1@D-(1@S) when 2@C is not forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul did not play but Helgemo already preapred diamond ace for play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Woolsey opened a Precision 2@C and then North was out of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: prepared|pg||
nt|bt: what was explanation of 4NT?|pg||
nt|davidb: entry problem for finessing twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The lack of spade spots meant there was little play and with unfavorable diamond situation this will be down several.|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: This wont look easy from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|pelu: I would X - and then play against 2@DX - making|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the open room, with all of the cameras and machinery, is much noisier than the closed room.  In the closed room, the clicking of the mouse is loud|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: do not know|pg||
nt|toral5: 4nt alerted as?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: it was alerted|pg||
nt|norby: with the cards of hampson i prefere bid heart and spades , like 2 club or double against club strong or PASS|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: needs 6  trump tricks but  not quite possible|pg||
nt|norby: is strange that me and the pair american play so different:-))))|pg||
nt|stewball: no trumps to lead and not many quick tricks|pg||
nt|blum1956: NS will hardly miss their diamond ruff, hence 3 off|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|rmb1: There are 15 boards per segment, 60 in each match.  This final segment ends with board 30|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: we had a bathroom break here|pg||
nt|algraves: so it seems the club finesse was safe at that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: very difficult for VG when in the middle of play this happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set now|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board now Traian?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to our excellent operator in Philadelphia ,Traian , great job!; great job!to my talented fellow commentators Raija Davis, David Burn and Joey Silver for donating their ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to guide us through this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will be back in 50mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well to the WBF for allowing BBO to broadcast from this prestigious event, especially to Hervé Lustman who has been instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
nt|peachy: The isreal tem has dominated this set|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all for joining and for your helpful comments and messages.we hope you enjoyed the show. |pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Hedy and Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board :) Thx for watching!|pg||
nt|dburn: thanks for operating, and well done Poland - remains to be seen who their opponents will be tomorrow|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 4@d is often a better suort|pg||
nt|yvesj49: support*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 5 cards.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: they say, lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: back in play now|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Not really because Michel said 3@d is 5-5 in their system|pg||
mb|1N|nt|swanson: Zia should have cashed the heart early - guess he can make then.|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@H EW|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 boards - now Nickell need more that 1 miracle :)|pg||
nt|besbes: with 5 cards he bids 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: So Poles make it comfortably enough. What is the score in England-Netherlands, David?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzta: Zia talking about the last hand and coughing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you kibitzers, you are the sole reason we have vugraphs!!!|pg||
nt|copeyj: England are 10 down|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there seems to have been an adjustment in the third set|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a +1700 to score and 4 deals left to play|pg||
nt|dburn: so England are 9.5 IMPs behind|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Osshri pulls down the screen.  Earlier he looked at the ops convention card|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: first trick, J@c-Q@c-K@c. then 2 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think we can congratulate Nickell team|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we start 30 minutes later than the BBO schedule|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: 4@s NS?|pg||
nt|jkotor: NS can put EW into 5@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: W cannot pas 4@s :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem apparently explaining about possible hands for Martens|pg||
nt|bt: unless decl goes up ace off course|pg||
nt|bt: dont know why he would though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 3nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will Zia find another bisd?|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Greco did not reopen double with lightish values and a void. ONe needs to avoid re opening with voids as your defense is really limited|pg||
nt|hedyg: geez Raija and i thought it was for the commentators!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Will Hamman?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: of course|pg||
nt|rv: Traian you are doing a terrific job|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jkotor: or 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, 6@c plays quite well for EW, too |pg||
nt|stoffers: I am soooo glad noone ever taught me jack denies...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but that 1700 will (one hopes) put them ahead, and the last three results are solid enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: NS make 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 2@H guarantees 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks like a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: the cards are going too fast for me and he claims|pg||
nt|swanson: This might be another ten for Nickell - it is easy to imagine that N-S would double a 'save' of 5@C against 4@S.|pg||
nt|rmb1: This should be quick|pg||
nt|kareno: Competing for the partscore. and happy to push e/w up a level.|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this was very fast at the table|pg||
nt|tlc: the balance has now secured a plus position for NS|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell reluctant to lead A of @S of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell thinking now|pg||
nt|algraves: but wont lead a red suit|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: and with 5 trumps, W would bid 5@s |pg||
nt|yvesj49: lot of work......|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably too|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzta: Zia says that they can make 4 @S lol|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is consdiering a Tref|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: of course lol|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heart lead into heart bidder - often best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are bidding like juniors... they are in heat 1 and they know it|pg||
nt|dburn: still, as the great Fats Waller was wont to say, one never knows, do one?|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 5@s is 2 and the Q of trump... or 10 trumps|pg||
nt|yvesj49: better......|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: my grandmother would turn in her grave  3NT with 22 points|pg||
nt|jtr: Great lead though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C checkback  2@D  2-5-3-3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bt: sometimes too much knowledge is bad, i agree|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|algraves: finally goes with partners suit|pg||
nt|jtr: But West has a lot of discards to make|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but not yet in the pocket........|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Not yet at home...|pg||
nt|besbes: going to play @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @c would be better for france|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: But @c are in E (2@d without @d)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East thinking|pg||
nt|yvesj49: east should be 4333|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 4@d|pg||
nt|besbes: he knows at least 3@c in east|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: And South lead @d with bad suit and 4 @ss ? Hum|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
pc|s2|nt|stoffers: i am just a wizard..shal i tka the next 10 tricks also, lool|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Greco-Hampson bid a 3NT on a combined 20 count earlier. It was cold|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yvesj49: let me believe !|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: try 1 @D first, just 1!|pg||
nt|peachy: This will be another swing for Israel team|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then claim :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I srael had a very good set|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jtr: I would have thought this was rather dangerous by Hamman  Could neasily run into a double if @ds arent behaving|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway, congratulations to the Polish team and good luck tomorrow. Thanks to the players, vugraph operators, colleagues and spectators|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I think we can beat these guys only in bidding... |pg||
nt|yvesj49: i'm am french.....|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: Still, Zia could have more|pg||
pc|dK|nt|algraves: and is pleased|pg||
nt|jtr: Much prefer 3@d to 2NT with the offsuit holdings|pg||
pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: West has no problem finding 5 discards so this must be 1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D7 lead is Zia -- not systemic|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: With 49 imps off...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and 36 boards|pg||
nt|besbes: if they play 4th tom knows |pg||
nt|besbes: south 5 5|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|algraves: he want to signal diamond thru|pg||
nt|tlc: there's always the saying that "it's hard to lose the post-mortem by leading partner's suit"|pg||
nt|algraves: rather than a trump promotion|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes the J @C was called for|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stoffers: wasn't it zia that mentioned that convention in 'bridge my way' ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rmb1: +1 when @SQ appears|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks     some will play in 4@H   which will also make   in spite of  a ruff in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia claiming |pg||
nt|algraves: this guarantees his 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|norby: yes|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|algraves: although it doesnt matter what meck does|pg||
nt|algraves: so he takes safe course|pg||
nt|besbes: ok|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice trick|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Winning this contract would be nice !|pg||
nt|besbes: good discard|pg||
nt|yvesj49: tom is triyng to go only 1 off|pg||
nt|besbes: tom needs @h queen 2nd in south|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: But I can't see the 9th trick...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or just made with Q @h 2nd in south|pg||
pc|hA|nt|toral5: heading for 4 losers in trump suit now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|norby: 100 %|pg||
nt|algraves: he can force re entry to his hand via @C QJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: seems they announced next set in 20 minutes in the VG theater|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|algraves: no reason not to finesse that I can see|pg||
nt|jtr: He seems to have a problem already|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no just planning all 5|pg||
nt|algraves: always start with 9 in mind in 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|nt|stoffers: wich is the best book out there (exept the menagerie ofcource)|pg||
nt|algraves: then go from there|pg||
pc|s9|nt|davidb: the  bidding was ok. the lead  was not friendly-spade|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 off|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||

nt|yuval10: still no call regarding the 6@s hand?|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||
nt|yuval10: weird @c return from N - he knows his partner has 5 cards as he played lowest ( odd ) , and E denied 4 by 2@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the players are still listening to the blurred talking in the other room, but trying to concentrate on this hand, except for Argelazi who reads the bulletin|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Argelazi did alert his screenmate to the 4 @H bid, but there was no alert by Birman|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not quite have timing to pick up the clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since he also needs a diamond trick|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Birman and Lhussier are screenmates, while Argelazzi and Robert are together :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: and the director is still talking and talking|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: in past sessions, the director waits until the end of the match before giving a ruling, so there are still 4 more boards to go|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d9|mc|8|nt|yuval10: that was the K, i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Robert and Argelazi go together to the restroom|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: he played the diamond king and then lead the 10 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Birman pulls out Robert's hand and looks at Robert's cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Lhuissier and Birman discuss the last hand|pg||

nt|mdgraham: that will be an interesting result to wait for|pg||
nt|bt: i would rate killing defence by kelsey as aust also|pg||
nt|bt: must|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 2 imps match now|pg||
nt|toral5: bridge with the blue team:)|pg||
nt|bt: i was coming to that, lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this will be a match to watch|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|bt: 1@S or 1!N?|pg||
nt|bt: 1N i mean|pg||
nt|rmb1: Zia has had some awful hands this segment|pg||
nt|algraves: so technically excellent all around|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fred misguessed hearts on 26 but still made 3NT. He guessed the endplay|pg||
nt|besbes: better to play the third !|pg||
nt|besbes: @d|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably when north unblocked|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yvesj49: 6 1 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2 tens spoil a perfect hand for Zia|pg||
nt|tlc: anyone open 2@h with E's hand?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jkotor: seems to be close finish|pg||
nt|stoffers: Who uses penalty doubles in the passout seat anymore? Noone i know|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 1NT that is|pg||
nt|bt: the west hand used to be a automatic double, i dont know what the world is coming to|pg||
nt|ady: might be in dummy trick 1|pg||
nt|algraves: note Hampson staying awake to play K of @s which made it too danerous for Rodwell not to cash out|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzta: Helness asking Becker about leads|pg||
nt|toral5: north has 9 tricks if he BOLDLY guesses @C,else hapy with 8|pg||
nt|pelu: down 4 or winning - all on the @S-layout |pg||
nt|toral5: he will surely hook @S for 120|pg||
nt|rmb1: He will be please to put it down as dummy and find something to read|pg||
nt|ady: could have been a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman: Thank you partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: This match looked absolutely hopeless for Nickell then boards ago and yet it is down to the wire.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Polite as ever|pg||
nt|ady: thank you very much indeed partner|pg||
nt|kareno: Not I.  3 at a different vulnerability perhaps.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if ns don't play slam i eat my hat lol|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: A bad slam...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|algraves: it is critical to find a relaxed attention at the table. awake but not uptight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you stop short of game here? The answer is probably that you don't|pg||
nt|algraves: and then ride that energy , like a horse|pg||
nt|norby: 2 hearts??|pg||
nt|athene: nice 3@H, taking lots of important bidding room away from west|pg||
nt|norby: vulnerable?|pg||
nt|rv: what would panel bid with Rodwell's hand in this one? he may bid 4@h on way to 5@d?|pg||
nt|norby: 5 cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep... that was the bid|pg||
nt|norby: no good hearts?|pg||
nt|norby: no points?|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|norby: other bridge sorry|pg||
nt|robinswr: you have to mid against meckwell or they'll steal you blind|pg||
nt|rv: Hampson's 2@h was definitely risky at these colors|pg||
nt|norby: great distribution, i forgot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so they even get to decide which 3 card suit to open!|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: ten boards|pg||
nt|jtr: 6@c|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: I they bid it they deserve to be world champs|pg||
nt|davidb: 6NT  can be made from N |pg||
nt|algraves: welll  I wonder if they can get out in 4@D|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Nobody knows an African guru..? We need help !|pg||
nt|yvesj49: please specs stop ' bon appetit ' lollllllll|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: for sure he will win - but if @s-finess lose then 9 red winners for EW|pg||
nt|jtr: if|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 1@D - 2@D is a position where EW are stealing though|pg||
nt|algraves: apparently not|pg||
nt|stewball: aside from the results in the other room,Greco/Hampson have given up nothing here|pg||
nt|stewball: very strong set|pg||
nt|algraves: Hamman just looking to create something different.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|toral5: yes:):(|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D will pretty much always have sound values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  systemic agreement is 1@C with 3@C & 3@D   so blame state of match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or what Allan said :)|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows his team is in trouble one way or another|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: he just decided he had the most he could have for a passed hand|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if 6NT East has to avoid diamond lead|pg||
nt|davidb: good  bidding |pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right John -- Greco-Hampson spot on this set|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzta: convention cards are exchanged|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia says oh, it is one of those|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 28 EW are not vulnerable - so if Meckstroth-Rodwell bid game, it is only 6 imps|pg||
nt|swanson: Hamman has shown four spades with this auction and could have held only four hearts, so Zia corrects.|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia just said 6 clubs is the spot probably|pg||
nt|jtr: now i do|pg||
nt|athene: (north decided)|pg||
nt|algraves: I think that is why he put in the J of @H in 3NT to be honest|pg||
pc|h5|nt|algraves: well against Meckwell in particular you do need to get your good suits in as they really like to bid the pushy 3NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: 9 of hearts suit preferance for spades|pg||
nt|athene: if east is going to bid 2nt, north wants to get a heart lead, i guess|pg||
nt|algraves: so you try and help partner with the lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately bridge scoring doesn't give a rebate for vul doubled undertricks if you are passed hand:)|pg||
nt|algraves: and Hampson does not want to wake up tomorrow wishing he had bid 2@H|pg||
nt|algraves: he would sleep OK if he went for 800|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the way he plays|pg||
nt|robinswr: amazing how often it works out that when in doubt bid|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he would just wake up tomorrow thinking " i wish partner had had better heart support for my overcall" :)|pg||
nt|algraves: or just bad luck|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: Cash AKQ to establish another winner - for defence|pg||
nt|algraves: ten of @H I mean|pg||
nt|algraves: they have been very tough from the word go|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: so it looks like they need to bid six |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oosmanb: 5@CX next door!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i missed the play sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i will score it in the end|pg||
nt|pelu: no problem Traian - u do a great job - and a long day|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzta: very long day|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jkotor: 5@cx other room, so likely Zia has done it|pg||
nt|pelu: that hand proce whu I dont like to pen 1NT with a 5 vard major :)|pg||
nt|ady: might come to a spade|pg||
nt|rmb1: North will take any further tricks he is given!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asked me about the other matches.. lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i can not say that his level of concentration is ...lets say HIGH|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow -that would do |pg||
nt|odysseus69: stupidly I said "all over" and immediately the roof fell in for Martens|pg||
nt|jkotor: or rather Polish/Czech team gave it away|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzta: cards are being tossed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: salad should be tossed. Cards should be played.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia says what are you doing to me guys?|pg||
nt|swanson: It is amazing how often this type of situation happens - you have to play hard until they director refuses to give you any more hands to play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: according to north and south, Zia has taken all of the tricks, but Zia just asks if he has 5 tricks andamman confirms :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might get this right - low from doubleton on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asked about the lead and was told that his opponents lead low from doubletons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2nd/4th against suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I think it is low from a singleton, but I might be wrong on that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia is playing a diamond through Jassem|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@h other room, may be very important guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem ruffs with the king of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently they are in 2@H next door|pg||
nt|toral5: zimmerman did bid and make 6c for an 11 imp pik up|pg||
nt|pelu: new keyboard, pl, :):)|pg||
nt|kittyc: I really dislike the 1NT opener with such a suit oriented hand but almost all the players did it so what do I know|pg||
nt|toral5: and he got a @Slead in to AJ:(|pg||
nt|stoffers: He got a spadelead, and had no loosing option in play either|pg||
nt|kittyc: playing BART it is less necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking what card to play|pg||
nt|pelu: NS told him that @SQ was in S - S X a 3@S-bid - so easy win|pg||
nt|jtr: Even a @s switch beats 6NT on a non@d lead|pg||
nt|jtr: Although i am very tired|pg||
mc|11|nt|odysseus69: thx all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all off to the other room - thanks Ala|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all good night from Philly :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia: you can cah the 9 of clubs later|pg||
nt|rmb1: Wolfson by 17, Zimmermann by 55, other match already over|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: last board of the match|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: tx all for watching and see you tomorrow for the semifinals|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: woow... the speed is now fantastic|pg||
nt|algraves: well the ten of clubs shy of a decent contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: some fireworks for sure on this last brd|pg||
nt|stoffers: this may be a swingy board yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the players are in a hurry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to play   6 to score|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bt: opening east hand? anyone?|pg||
nt|ady: last board of the match    well won by Nickell|pg||
nt|kareno: Lastt hand of the set, yes?  Many thanks to our spectacular operator!!  And to the specs for keeping us honest and laughing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another catchall 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Thanks to David, Traian (op), WBF and USBF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: we started with 17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 31 must be the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 15 brd rounds|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahhh for the comparisons.  So we have two to go.|pg||
nt|algraves: this is a bad hand type for precision so meckstroth upgrades to a club rather than open a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: women last brd 32 our is 31|pg||
nt|norby: i appreciate hampson and greco but sometime in the bidding they have completely difference of the italian style, i understand aggressive bridge but 2 hearts is bridge poker|pg||
mb|1H|nt|stoffers: i would|pg||
nt|bt: and meckwell|pg||
mb|1S|nt|toral5: and versace|pg||
nt|robinswr: on board 27 not opening 3diamonds could have cost 10 imps|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I agree |pg||
mb|d|an|3 hearts|nt|kittyc: east was opened a weak NT by those who could, katz passed it|pg||
nt|kareno: How silly |pg||
nt|algraves: Ew can make something |pg||
nt|algraves: so they have to compete for the partscore|pg||
nt|jtr: Gibe Zia 10 hypothetical imps please Traian:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Give|pg||
mb|2S|nt|norby: and i am gentelman,normaly i say crazy bridge:-)))|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzta: where are the fireworks ???? lol|pg||
nt|toral5: LOL:(|pg||
nt|stoffers: Well, not much happened here, as it was tough for HH to find the @d fit|pg||
nt|kittyc: good 4H bid - kep t the oppo out|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@s 1 off|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Double : not french style|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@h 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 4@H can make - u can pick up the @C-suit: B to K and A, 9 to 10 and Q and @C5 to finess @c&!|pg||
nt|pelu: @c6|pg||
nt|kittyc: in oher rooms south showed both suits (eg if East bids 2S then South can bid 3D)|pg||
nt|bt: thats to make 5 isnt it|pg||
nt|kareno: 64 is a better number of boards to include all the dealer and vulnerability possibilities|pg||
nt|tlc: dbl T/O|pg||
nt|rv: 1n in this position and seat is 11-13?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: around 30 hcp for e/w   but not fitting to well|pg||
nt|athene: no, 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  27 taking different turn in other room    P-1@D-1@S-3@D[gitelman]//P-P-DBL-P   now Meck in the tank|pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: yes, 4 is cold|pg||
nt|rmb1: tomorrow for the semifinals ... that's today for those us in Europe (00:53 am)|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I am down the midde Canadian|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a singleton its usually right to bid over 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: heart suit worth more than 6|pg||
nt|algraves: from an earlier time|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 4@s on @h lead... may be more than one off, I think|pg||
nt|yvesj49: double by west would be a good idea......|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tlc: usually showing a maximum 1@d bid|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I agree Karen seems silly of WBF to play only 60 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ok i will|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Sometimes, N can win more easily when W double (if AQ9xxx in @h, for example).|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: and 27 ends in 3@DX |pg||
nt|pelu: he passed - and making/-1 very close - I exp down 1|pg||
nt|algraves: They have 9 top tricks 2@H, 1@D 2@C and 4 @S|pg||
nt|algraves: so defense has to be careful not to let 10th one through|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dummy @S cards look awfully good -- are you sure Greco can't ensure 10 tricks since @DA onside?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has a lot of commucation-problems - but take @HK and play @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking attack @C before @D|pg||
nt|pelu: bit that from vrong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe same after @HK pitch @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play to ruff @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe i'm biased from seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco still thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: u can only ruff 1 @C - East can overruff @H and play @S 2x|pg||
nt|stewball: looks like a hard make if the @d A is off|pg||
nt|algraves: Hamman may have had to lead a trump to beat this|pg||
nt|stewball: perhaps the @h J had suit pref implications|pg||
nt|algraves: sort of counter intuitive with K 5th , it seems right to try for force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems that it should, doesn't it John?|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see: @HK (@D) and @D will give decl 10 tricks - but - as normal - not sure :)|pg||
nt|pelu: still in trick 1 in 3@DX|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Remember board 19|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: tak Bjørn :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell went quietly|pg||
nt|stewball: hmm,,this is unexpected..to me anyway|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzta: this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|kareno: In the ACBL we have seen the numbers of boards degraded so swiss matches are now only 6, not a good thing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: from tom we have 16 i think|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is one down at least|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H shortage - maybe both minors- |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: can be no great swing in for this hand    so Woolfson should be through  17 imps ahead|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think East thinks that an overtrick or two here is going to win the match |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well he is thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: 3@C would have made undoubtedly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i mean tomorrow we will have 16...last day|pg||
nt|kareno: But session fees have gone UP to compensate for fewer boards :(|pg||
nt|algraves: so east is playing with the houses money as they say|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Strange Q of @s with clubs...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes...........|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: sorry that for 11 tricks - but still a nice finess: @c5 , @c6, @c8 to setup @c4!|pg||
nt|bt: so if u get a 2suited overcall makng 5 is easy i guess|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: now Hamman can prevent @C ruffs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|algraves: so the young israelis played well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kittyc: yes Woolsey made 5 in 5 after 2 suited bid|pg||
nt|toral5: i think 11 makes if he runs @C jack|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: but gives it back??|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|algraves: and this match is a toss up at the half|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|tlc: will be an exciting final 30 bds|pg||
nt|kareno: They surely have.  |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Israel came 3rd at the European Championships this summer after Italy and Poland. Israel is a strong bridge nation|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can see 8 tricks but where is ninth?- nfound it|pg||
nt|stewball: hamman may think declarer wouldnt play like this without the @c 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the @S spots mean declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|algraves: what if he pitches the club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if  Hamman    pitch !JC, then @DK  @C9 and what does Hamman do?   if @D, then @DK, @CA, @C|pg||
nt|algraves: sort of a long term promotion possible|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|davidb: wow|pg||
nt|jtr: Odd play by Zia|pg||
pc|s9|nt|algraves: declarer has lost his way a bit on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pachtman-Ginossar were in the team|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he asks hamman why he lied in clubs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: at last a ray of hope|pg||
nt|jtr: ah|pg||
nt|jtr: He actually is telling us Hamman lied in @cs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loooooooooool|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pelu: @CA euff over ruff - @D-ruff with @S2 and @C to @Sj|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it did need to be @CA before @C9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|algraves: he gambled to make rather that play safe for down a couplle|pg||
nt|algraves: ducking the club saved a trick|pg||
nt|algraves: meck better not to have cashed first diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck played...but pachtman did not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so i have the 6 and the 7 of clubs on the table|pg||
pc|c5|nt|toral5: whn is the next set?in an hours time?|pg||
nt|rmb1: It looks like Zimmermann v Diamond and Wolfson v Nickell.  The live score site is having a rest at the moment|pg||

nt|besbes: yes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: enough*|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: right|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Not vulnerable against vuln, W could bid 4@s but I don't think S pass !|pg||
nt|besbes: the problem will be over 5@s|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: But his first pass is a strange idea|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment, east in the tank|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and after, south|pg||
mb|4C|nt|algraves: 3@H has some equity as they say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2 to play here  --  but still 6 to score|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Difficult for N thinking 6@d wins !|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: push them up|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 5@s x not bad for france.......|pg||
mb|4S|nt|algraves: spades and diamonds break do it seems a make when the smoke clears|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks for all your hard work today Traian|pg||
nt|norby: many 6 for overcall at level 1 hearts...|pg||
nt|athene: now after 3@C from south, he still isn't certain to have four diamonds, is he? e.g. 3-2-3-5 with a 12 count and no spade cards|pg||
nt|rv: good 6@d here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: will hampson commit to diamonds or notrumps or try to offer a choice?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Experts do not concede partscores without a fight.|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Greco shook his head|pg||
nt|algraves: is this even Blackwood ?|pg||
nt|algraves: you know there is always something undiscussed |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|algraves: you need to have your agreements clear and based ideally on principles|pg||
nt|norby: bad contract 6 diamond|pg||
nt|algraves: the comments are cascading in |pg||
nt|rv: 6@d is not a good contract, but can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all of them drinking water|pg||
nt|rv: even on a @s lead, declarer can draw 2 rounds of @d, take @s pitch on @h and play on @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol... in the same time both pparts of the screen|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: And 4@s made ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: pass is ok lothan|pg||
nt|yvesj49: (lol)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fisher asking about 4c bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think volcker said undiscussed|pg||
mb|4N|nt|tlc: Thx Roland..and to Karen  and Alan..great job Traian!|pg||
nt|algraves: he is entitled to a @C and 1@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: 5Trumps in hand|pg||
nt|algraves: and a ruff in dummy, that comes to 9|pg||
nt|passell: club lead woulda made this tougher|pg||
nt|algraves: yes so now with a @C switch|pg||
nt|algraves: things will get complicated|pg||
nt|robinswr: i wonder if greco's 3clubs showed both minors |pg||
nt|algraves: this "should " be Quantitave in my view |pg||
nt|algraves: well done Eric Greco|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@s west in closed room.......|pg||
mb|5C|nt|passell: looks like an overtrick now|pg||
nt|algraves: this was not best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wrong game|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: 6 boards to score... so 28 imps not enough to congratulate Nickell|pg||
mb|5S|nt|vugraphzta: now Hampson said I AM MAKING THIS|pg||
nt|algraves: it is not easy to " stay in the saddle" in a vague situation with so much at stake|pg||
nt|yvesj49: K @h lead ? lol|pg||
mb|d|nt|norby: make only if after lead spade beat 2 round of diamond 3 round hearts and ace of club and club.....so make|pg||
nt|robinswr: king of spades was the power lead unblock or give count |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but Hampson needed to lead @D to beat 3N|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: We can't win points by cards, we can't win points by bidding... what can we do, my god ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i've to go to buy some hats|pg||

mb|2C|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set. Next in 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|yvesj49: 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Traian, our terrific operator in Philadelphia!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our many excellent commentators|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 2@H strongish balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-13 balanced|pg||
nt|algraves: 6NT has 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: just a second: will haman make if he duck @D10 - I belive - spects tells me - :):)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N  = forcing 1 round|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: 6 @D, and 2 in every other suit|pg||
nt|athene: you can make 7nt can't you? backward finesse in clubs and then heart-club squeeze :)|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: But if W bids 4@s immediatly, may be S can bid 4NT now...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@s ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yvesj49: i don't understand west's bid|pg||
nt|besbes: 2@d is just a relat|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 3@H = transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia : we are runing out of boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S forced -- i think 3N is COG [choice of game] with 2@S, not 3@S|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@D + 1 @H = -1|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I think 4@s means an opening of 4@s and 2 aces more... or somthing like that|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2@H : 12-14 without a 5 cards suit|pg||
nt|robinswr: 6hearts is a bad contract since you could go down if hearts 4-1|pg||
nt|norby: i say goodbye at all the kibbitzer , and only small goodbye at my friends commentator ........|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: thanks all|pg||
nt|algraves: but it is more normal it seems to play in the safety of the strong @D since cannot verify @S situation|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|norby: better 6 diamonds but not easy|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Michel ?|pg||
mc|12|nt|yvesj49: if east has J@h more slam 100%|pg||
nt|yvesj49: restart at ?|pg||
nt|besbes: no 2@c is game forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: see you all in 25 minutes or so|pg||
nt|yvesj49: so why 4@s ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: see you all in 30 mins or so|pg||

nt|yuval10: probably can partly explain S's silence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bergen is a two edged sword|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the players pulled out board 30, and I only noticed when they giggled|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here it allowed south a freebie|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|vugraphztb: alert cards are still being waved in the air :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|vugraphztb: now Birman points instead of waving lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@S presumably solid suit, asking ace cue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or not|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then why pass 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Birman saying what, it shows the king|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is only right if birman has specifically club king and not much else|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s from E should be absoulute nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: spades are being run and the director enters the room and the spades are running|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the last hand anyway, so no need to worry|pg||
mc|12|nt|fabsayc: 5s in open room|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks all, see you in 30 minutes i persume?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 31|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the director says that the hand has been given to other directors and a ruling will be made later :)|pg||
