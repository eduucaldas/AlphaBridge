nt|psridhar: precision|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sunit: yes but 2h/4h??|pg||
nt|psridhar: only that 2H is confusing-constructive or sign off we dunno|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psridhar: Computer dealt deals- misfit is rare, it pays to bid on the assumption ur side has a fit |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: particularly when one side has a fit the other side is certain to have one-so it is a question of who has values to make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||

nt|Walddk4: We may need it|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Crouch is pitiful on BBO and one of our regular commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 14-16 in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Kath   David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Hi all. Welcome to Solihull|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Good evening all|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|daman: I would have passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|pelu: I know - but u are not italiean :9|pg||
nt|daman: I like lasagna    does that count?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S can take 11 tricks|pg||

nt|newmoon: Website Commonwealth Games:  http://www.hcl-bridge.com/jspCWB2010index.jsp|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2NT = superfit, 3 trumps, max|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lots of transfer responses on a strong club base|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|stc: 3@d probably a sort of Bergen|pg||
nt|sybarra: this likely to be a tight match,  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: retransfer|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: anyone know the results?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did they keep it up?|pg||
nt|lestergold: all strong players here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: david are there any results online?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: FEGARTY beat ROBERTS 25-5; PRYOR beat BIRD 25-5; COOPER beat SHILLITOE 23-7; DHONDY beat COPE 18-11 (Cope was penalised 1 VP for slow play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Players seem very chipper for such an early hour|pg||
nt|dslee: and 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||
nt|sybarra: most of us know all the names on the screen |pg||
nt|tomi2: have just one question to the local experts from France... is Zaleski playing with a team in this competition?|pg||
nt|newmoon: simpler was just to go Texas 4@D first time|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: 1 nt or 2 @S not much further |pg||
nt|josj: 2@S seems too high already|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: zaleski doesnt play|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h are 3-3 and a @s discard. @d are 3-3 and also a finess after the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: this lead can help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You got the results before you asked, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's very impressive yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: another double fit in the Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: West doing a lot of bidding |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again ralf :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: (or S.A. Texas 4@C)|pg||
nt|dslee: will anyone suggest that N opens 2@S with the hand :) unconventional but effective|pg||
pc|d5|nt|josj: but it also looks very much a normal contract|pg||
nt|stc: as you can see 4@s by S has good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the results : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Bonjour Laure, Constantin|pg||
nt|Walddk8: and Jos|pg||
nt|josj: Bonjour Laure, Roland, Constantin|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: just for remin you : 1 match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
nt|dslee: will be a simple push I guess for both the tables|pg||
nt|newmoon: perhaps later in the match, depending on swings|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: can make 6 now|pg||
nt|newmoon: this is board 1, and Asoka wants to retain morale with pd    hehe|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: predictable lead which stes up 3 heart tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqvist - McIntosh are members of the England open team, and Crouch-Patterson have won the Camrose Trophy for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: both very good pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqcist originally from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|sybarra: that saved a trick |pg||
nt|tomi2: but Nunes - Fantoni play regulary in the Zimmermann team, yes? they were not available because of playing in Italy?|pg||
nt|dslee: welcome al viewers from Ghaziabad...from the northern part of India in the State of Uttar Pradesh in the vicinity of greater delhi|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: spade loser soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 after 20 boards: Teltscher +19 IMPs v Rosen, Senior +7 IMPs v Small, Crouch +8 IMPs v Hinden, Hackett P +3 IMPs v DeBotton|pg||
nt|josj: the 2nd @D loser likely to disappear but the @H ruff not...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzqj: remind|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: Michelle must have been having kittens with that awful south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w could be candidates for one of the strongest mixed pairs on the planet|pg||
nt|daman: that's a pretty broad statement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: Cooper +36 v Dhondy, Cope +27 v Pryor, Roberts +19 v Bird, Fegarty +1 v Shillitoe|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: I have to say I don't agree|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: wisely |pg||
nt|dslee: me debgiri and sid welcome you to watch this & enjoy the fun under |pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Constantin Stancescu|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: yes easier to play the ace and finesse |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but he sin't  doing that |pg||
nt|garnetts: Must admit I cannot see much wrong with 1@H and if I had managed to bid 2@H --then 3@D wouldn't have been on my mind |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: In the balancing position here 2@H should be say a decent six card suit and a reasonable hand --what used to be called intermediate |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: the ace of clubs wont run away|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Constantin|pg||
nt|josj: hi Constantin|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks with a correct play in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: zimmermann team : Quantin-Bompis, Fantoni-Nunes and Zimm-Multon|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes it will |pg||
nt|dslee: for all the viewers, I have the pleasure of welcoming Manas-da(manas555) a top player from India who is watching with us|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: 10 9 of spades and the good @D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@c, 2@h, 2@s and 1@d = 9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also welcome to our operator, Nicky|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: This line is scary. It's not a good idea to shorten the long hand when you also have fit in a side suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should hold his cards up lol  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing bad will happen here, but on a different layout ....|pg||
nt|haans: tme for a clubs ruff|pg||
nt|haans: time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  has to make 4@C tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 'double dummy' @d lead would probably be only lead to put declarer undr serious pressure here|pg||
nt|ady: may only make 9 obvious tricks|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mwigor: funeral just finished|pg||
nt|yo_yo: your son is in the OR Mike|pg||
nt|dslee: asoka needs to work on the swings from deal 1 :) some lost some gained - but the opponents will be under pressure, isnt it :)?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|mwigor: oops sorry that was meant to be private|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: It's often a good idea to set up your side suit first|pg||
nt|ralfwil: declarer wil have a good count now for playing @c the right way|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C to J now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and cross fingers|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N with 4@s, 4@h, 3@d and 2@c.....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's going to be a long night ralf :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Raif Roland Kath and all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: does osborne have a complete count here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and of course also hej Rolkand:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry Roland....|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume hes in a massive tank|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yés N with 4432|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: He certainly is|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this event is over 3 weekends  and the winner gets to play in the Camrose |pg||
nt|yo_yo: (partially self - funded)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is he considering the possibiolity that North has qx @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E is thinking about playing N with @cQx|pg||
nt|mwigor: if he has a complete count (i havent been watching then @hK @d9 is best|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|hT|nt|ady: west will get a count after north shows with 3 trumps   but with singleton Q@D cannot go wrong  in any event|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mwigor: sorry no one loser too many|pg||

nt|lestergold: but should be suspicious that is exactly what to expect from a player opf King's ability|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anopther way was to play the remaining |pg||
nt|yo_yo: has he forsaken tom townsend?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i haD NOTICED EVEN THO AT THIS HOUR IM NORMALLY HAL;F ASLEEP|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry capslock|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D    3NT   likely staert|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg of course a legend and Ms.Senior one of the world's leading lady players|pg||
nt|lestergold: against the long standing partnerhsip of cooke and garvey|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from rainy central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: My second session - will try harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: so uneventful at end of the day |pg||
nt|josj: I cannot help thinking they just missed game on  1|pg||
nt|stc: I expect 4@h -1 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: strange push, same lead with same overcall in other room |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2nd match England vs India 1 on bbo|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
nt|daman: I have never heard of the legend and I subscribed to IPBM for years|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ffbridge.asso.fr/   the bracket sheet |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: fo the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|tomi2: then Fantunes can become French champions soon after missing the Italian some hours ago :) those top pros now seem to play everywhere :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Luare even better |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: classement : Payen, Cronier Laffineur, Doussot, Zimmerman|pg||
nt|newmoon: Debgiri - other room opened 1@C in East, previous hand.   Are they weak NT?|pg||
nt|dslee: yes|pg||
nt|dslee: looks like they play precision|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Mahesh (operator)  :)|pg||
nt|dslee: i was been told that all the pairs are playing 2/1|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Hi Sid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey a great bit slightly wild talent|pg||
nt|daman: I have heard of Nevena|pg||
nt|stc: or even 4@s by EW|pg||
nt|stc: in fact 4@s is a making save !|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: x from North - converted to 2@H by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg is a world class player|pg||
nt|daman: you said legend    he is not a legend|pg||
nt|daman: and I have a plethora of specs who agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a matter of opinion |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h are in, not easy to find|pg||
nt|newmoon: cautious 1@H overcall, vul           (many would 2@H)|pg||
nt|dslee: with 5-4 in black suits, i would imagine, N to -ve x|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
nt|daman: he might be a legend in GB|pg||
nt|josj: yes, 5@D should go down by ducking @HA once|pg||
nt|josj: and defeating 5@C is even easier|pg||
nt|stc: and 5@d a phantom save !|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Le classement after 2 matches: Payen 45, Doussot 44, Cronier 42, Laffineur 40, Piganeau 33|pg||
nt|dslee: some might end up budding 2@S from N|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||

nt|othered1: Anyone make sense of this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might find 4 @H if W bids @H now |pg||
nt|josj: but how would you play 4@H on a @S lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they play 4 card majors and had to confirm 5th ht first |pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that comment,  I thougnt N had opened |pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 4 @C now?  I am sure that is what N is thinking about  |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Standings after 3 matches: 1. Payen (64) - 2. Cronier (62) - 3. Laffineur (60) - 4. Doussot (58) - 5. Zimmermann (48) - 6. Chemla (45) - 7. Piganeau (43) - 8. Vinay (36) - 9. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Delfour (35) - 10. Hirchwald (35) - 11. Vives (25) - 12. Salliere (24)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: Sure I have|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C looks like a decent spot to me |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
nt|daman: sctoll up|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bonjour à tous  and hello all |pg||
nt|dslee: surely IMP from EW gained here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead would let it thru|pg||
nt|daman: r*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you said you had not|pg||
nt|sybarra: true, probably not as easy it looks from here|pg||
nt|josj: well, in 3nt you just need to steal 1 @H trick :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, heard, sorry|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: can't remember her maiden name|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bill |pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tomi2: do I remember correctly that France missed to qualify for European Champions Cup this year? think they finished 11th or so?|pg||
nt|athene: I suppose you might bid 6@C on these cards if you really waned imps but it looks a bit much to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then again a helpful lead |pg||
nt|athene: @DA off, @CQ lurking around, lots of work to do to get those hearts up and running.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: Demtinev or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Delova|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrrmmmmm|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
pc|s9|nt|garnetts: but it works well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call me naive, but I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|blum1956: no way to go down in 4@s (almost)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C lead in other room|pg||
nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6-card or player ))))|pg||
nt|garnetts: They do--and in my view their card play rarely live up to their expectations--a triumph of hope over experience |pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: Might there have been a pass by east to start this?|pg||

nt|sybarra: and hello to our operator Laure|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: I suppose John wanted to protect K@D|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: with the opening on left,  you are pretty sure where the k of @H is |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dslee: as I said, EW gains here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: same contract in the other room |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: now -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dop u agree with Townsend'spass david?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure, the ruffing finesse in hearts is a good bet, but you still have to ruff another one |pg||
nt|athene: unless the ten comes down|pg||
nt|athene: it's not a ridiculous slam but you don't mind not being in it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: Best play from E is to discard @s6 on next @c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: maybe Townsend tht 3@D likley if east had anything   that +300 would not be a great loss  and if partner had nothing would gain |pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: a very odd view imo|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N is of course a normal and goo contract very unlucky that apart form spades all other 3  Qs badly placed for dclarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3nt will go down now. N has not enough of entries to finess in all suits|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East will be in trouble soon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: declarer cashing out and maybe hoping for a mistake|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: and that´s why E should discard @s6 on @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes discarding on clubs but Small has to read the position not easy|pg||
nt|josj: unlikely to happen|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes east has six diamonds too and it goes @DA, ruff right off|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good start for N-S|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: another 'fit' deal-10 card dia for NS and 9 card spd for EW-some of these comp deals are typical of fit auctions|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|psridhar: 11 card dia rather|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sunit: 6sp needs accurate defense, otherwise declarer can make it on a correct club guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: my grouse over long has been the 'trend' is visible on deal patterns with the program showing itself up and a shrewd player can study it and use|pg||
nt|sunit: when in with the dia ace he needs to give a club ruff|pg||
nt|sunit: difficult to be in 6sp unless opponents push u there|pg||
nt|psridhar: however , many international experts have assured me i am mistaken ...and i look for evidence to support that always|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunit: i think your point has a lot of merit, sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: the two passes by W over 4d and 5d are encouraging pd to bid more...sensible|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|psridhar: many views on how the auction should have been -but EW hv landed on the 'par' 5s-as sunit stated slam can be beaten|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|psridhar: one interesting psychological point to note is - players are reluctant to save over 5 level bids- for eg here NS might hv saved 7d over 6s -but not 6d over 5s :)|pg||
pc|h3|mc|11|nt|sunit: my other observation of computer dealt hands are that the number of imps exchanged goes up drastically compared to hand dealt deals|pg||

nt|neobas: Hey all :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Bas :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi Bas|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: I actually thought the imp "swing" would go the other way when he started playing it |pg||
nt|neobas: 4@S NS here|pg||
nt|newmoon: Ashok Samjee (East) is also Chairman of Gauteng Bridge Union and Vice President of SABF|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: some work to do to make 4@S in EW, it might well go down|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s doomed because of the bad split in @H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: Both sides deserved to suffer for getting to 3NT--life is never fair lol|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the dreaded multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: weak only version|pg||
nt|sharkey: merci Laure|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: de rien :) |pg||
nt|capercliff: N/S may do well not to push them into this slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C is suited as alerted |pg||
nt|sybarra: does E realize how good his hand it for W?|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS has a @H or @C sacrifice|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: the 1st board : 1nt-p-2@s (4@h and no @s)-x-3nt ...|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 11-15 at least  0  diamonds|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we call it precised Michael in France|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ady: sorry  seeing things  I tht diamonds 4-4 last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but once again... if E had discarded @s6 he is discarding behind declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellselway may take him seriously here and go too far|pg||
nt|sharkey: i like 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes sets them on the right path (Hopefully) |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they should reach the @d slam now|pg||
nt|athene: Always 11 here because if the defence take their clubs, declarer gets a pitch for his heart|pg||
nt|dslee: this is aggressive|pg||
nt|newmoon: equal lev el correction if South bids 2@C|pg||
nt|dslee: last hand no negative x, now chop with this hand :)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Li Jie bid 5@D on his own next door|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surpised N didnt bid over 3@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: either x or 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 4 @H works also?|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2NT = truscott, 10+, with @Ss|pg||
nt|dslee: south has to come in with a bid here  - keeping up the spirit of N's x|pg||
nt|dslee: white position, 3@D is not bad, show your values what you have|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT is good raise to 3@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Amazing auction really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: operator  can you explain the alerts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hopwever  6@d is on ice|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Mike!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GM all, sorry i am a bit late, computer very slow booting up today|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as pd undertsnads....|pg||
nt|sybarra: now he can cue @H's |pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud bid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good  potential save in 7 @c   par contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure N should bid at all, 7@c is a good save but who is to say they will bid slam?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: he choosed  the lowest cue bid I think  Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes makes sense, |pg||
nt|sybarra: (lowest cue first) |pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead would hold it, sorry|pg||
nt|neobas: Pretty straightforward board, really|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 1@D   3@D   5@D  he bid. Partner was silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: i guess you have to open that dog (4333)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Ed & Mike|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at leats 5 @c by N now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|haans: will Gui give them 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: well E/W do have 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it worked they kept them out of the laydown slam |pg||
nt|daman: good stuff to reach game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Ed and Marshall|pg||
nt|sharkey: W knows a @H cue shos 1. round control - no purpose showing 2. control knowing pd is 55|pg||
nt|stc: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: but things may happen ....|pg||
nt|dslee: dangerous bid by North - do this before :) over call and later on show 4 card @H if it can be done|pg||
mb|5H|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any reason to make 4@S  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denies 6 in a minor unless a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D can have 6 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Scores from first stanza|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup not a good 13 count but an opening within the meaning of the Act|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Teltscher 86 Hackett 29, Senior 13 Rosen 49, Hinden 35 Small 41, Crouch 40 de Botton 52|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the multi does seem to work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 combined but work to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: but E didnt|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: may happen ....|pg||
nt|josj: q.e.d.|pg||
nt|athene: objectively you prefer to be playing transfer responses, then the hearts can't be attacked |pg||
nt|neobas: 2@D artificial Gameforce "Checkback Stayman" I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: do u think, E will bid 6 @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: difficult for south to give his partner void after 1@s x|pg||
mb|5S|nt|yo_yo: 2@D presumably asks for the better major|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time 3NT looks slightly better|pg||
nt|garnetts: East sees no reason to do anything other than bid 3NT--things are well placed for 4@H--best lead from North though |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 4@H not 3NT sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: with W do you lead low ht or q? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small should have good 6 to bad 8|pg||
nt|daman: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 top losers and 2 out  of 3 black losers in Hallberg's hand which need to be disposed of one way or the other|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike and Marshall|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: bid  South you have no defensive trick at all|pg||
nt|capercliff: some would play a X bu N now says "I would like to bid 7@c"|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not this pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: hello everybody we are here for the fench national championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well a good club view would help the cause of n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: might on a club lead even then not certain |pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: Q in pards bid suit i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours there is a lot of equity in messing up the u]auction as n/s have done|pg||
nt|capercliff: that way he includes partner in deciding whether to bid or not|pg||
nt|newmoon: Krishna should just 5@S (or pass) with his minimum.  He thinks 5@H is perhaps a 4-4 fit (better than 5-3 @S), but Ashok was cuing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this pickles you pard |pg||
nt|josj: game was not missed on  1 in CR...|pg||
nt|neobas: Not sure why Cronier did that, 4@S is really the contract you want to be in regardless of what partner responds to 2@D|pg||
nt|dslee: nice def will be to lead @D low by N to get a @C ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: we can talk about that :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@C = fit to @D and values in @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stc: even Xed|pg||
nt|athene: On a heart lead declarer has a slight decision to make|pg||
nt|dslee: does not make a difference but a nice play|pg||
nt|newmoon: same contract in OR.  There it went 1@S - (2@D) - 3@D...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: a trump attack was needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry first time at this|pg||
nt|daman: he is gin for game|pg||
nt|daman: can make 5 really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he is lucky here can ruff 2 losers in dummy and just about negotiate |pg||
nt|daman: yes   maybe only makes 4    not enough soldiers for an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful when returning to hand ruffing the third@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: however has no choice as @da drops|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DK he can discard the last @S-loser - so give up 2 @Hs - but has to take @HA|pg||
nt|athene: ducking might look really silly if the lead were a singleton|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting metaphor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you guess hearts (you don't), it's 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: I lead the Q but who am I ?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont beligve 12 - but 10!|pg||
nt|daman:     not 680|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus 1 i was expecting plus 2 imposs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Soryy result not right|pg||
nt|daman: maybe 620|pg||
nt|lestergold: 650 my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 impossible|pg||
nt|daman: I think he has to lose a @S in the wash|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant place 3 black losers om two @Hs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: hi ralf & scores of specs....it's not just the players that have scores:)|pg||
nt|dslee: 1S-2@D, south will bid 5@D :) sid :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: Well Sandqvist ?Tosh a relatively newish partnership|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lebridgeur: 13 tricks on this lead|pg||
nt|athene: but west would be likely to bid over 1@C with all the hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S guess now?|pg||
nt|dslee: EW has to gamble in 5@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: South bid 4@D...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: shirley. shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: suit pref?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small has left the table to put on a jumper|pg||
pc|s6|nt|neobas: This also works for +1 :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: in the other room teammates de botton and malinowski the latter a world class player de botton a world class sponsor and enthusiast of the game|pg||
nt|sybarra: except Thomas didnt take the K |pg||
nt|tomi2: I think this is relatively randomly... two hands of equal strenght so I don't think on the long run you win/lose something by playing from the opening hand...|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably "negotiating" the 8 tricks|pg||
nt|dslee: 4 is nothing, white position bid 5 :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: and 3 rounds of @c will set E under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sandqvist a brilliant but slightly wild card  of a player has a world silver medal to his credit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: best defence in my view tap declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can now see 6 of the 6 to bad 8 points on N|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
nt|neobas: Now it's +2 even|pg||
pc|sA|nt|neobas: @HK coming down|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|josj: low @C now...|pg||
nt|stc: strange play, I would have play @c before so many trump rounds|pg||
nt|josj: so would I|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: good swing for Hackett|pg||
nt|roswolf: has he really blocked the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: he has the ace of @H to get back unless patterson leads one |pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart now will block them for good|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I don't think the Clubs are blocked, didn't see what card was played|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah, ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah my faith in tosh is restored |pg||
nt|stc: no he must guess @c|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzqj: Lacroix is extremely nervous on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: at|pg||
nt|stc: In fact many things happened, oops, reoops and normal score !|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: A heart to the King and North will do well to duck |pg||
nt|sybarra: argh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this was a mistake as I see it - for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but Cronier likely to take the @H hook isnt he\|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|nt|neobas: Probably|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: Holland and Brunner partnership in real life Holland a fin player used to partner the late Arnstrong qell respected player |pg||
nt|neobas: Playing @Ds first won't give him count either... I think|pg||
nt|athene: at the table you have a much better chance of getting it right|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|garnetts: cannot really cost that much can it --this might now end play South |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that club switch ever going to happen?|pg||

nt|lestergold: Small is having a field day at the wheel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you a weak 2 would have worked equally well |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its no0t a victory for the multi as such merely a victory for the barrage that took place|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe a lowly trump promoted in south |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW? |pg||
nt|daman: being aggressive?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Michelle Brunner a frequent member of English distaff international team|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow usually plays with hackett senior very experienced senior player i dont know much about Levy|pg||
nt|josj: this time, 4@H does look easy...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|josj: but NS have a good vul. save|pg||
nt|sybarra: and blackwood should help them stay out of stam |pg||
nt|josj: he who makes the last mistake loses the pot...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: yes we are screen|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3 players in this room whose names start with "As"|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: North is Dr. Asoka Thenuwara|pg||
nt|newmoon: and 3 end with "A", Larry says|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: South Asanka Amarasinghe|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: SZ thinking about digging graves|pg||
nt|ady: part score here    likley 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: now the hand is scored as -1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: -1 is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: which hand? the last?|pg||
nt|pelu: how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is this david levy?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it was clear that North had nothing except @c support for passing 3 @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont know if EW can bid 5@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: one match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@H!? What a strange choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This mountain that SZ had to climb is suddenly taking on the appearance of Everest|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot think how West declared 5@H next door |pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that with the TOD west thought east had four |pg||
nt|daman: I think you might look at their card Nicky|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Yang psyched a pass over the Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1,  e/w lost an imp here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|daman: ask them the result|pg||
nt|josj: 13 boards seems an odd number...any reason for that?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: no it 's a match of 26 boards divided by 2 :)|pg||
nt|stc: A lack of concentration from declarer, I see no other explanation|pg||
nt|josj: this time, 6@C seems the best slam but it won't make whereas 6@S will|pg||
nt|athene: interesting silence from east|pg||
nt|newmoon: East:  Ashok Samjee,  West : Krishna Malani|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: agressive non bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: No auction given in the movie|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: again the 3NT-4 Major choice|pg||
nt|othered1: Why alert the double,  Standard to double 1N for takout of @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to get to I think |pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: a somewhat heavy 3@D preempt|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: sorry for undo :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: diamond lead beats this|pg||
nt|dslee: how did this bid appear:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s. time enough to find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the rosen team fresh from having given the senior team a serious pasting|pg||
nt|ady: wrong red suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i predict|pg||
nt|daman: would we all have bid 3NT with 3334 9 count?|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told that -1 was claimed at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg still has his workl cut out for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: from someone who is at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are two tens i think normal to bid vul game at ips with west's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North can't really sit this,  since his double wasn't based on defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was wondering about the alert on Michelle's pass over 1C last time. maybe she alerts all her bids|pg||
nt|othered1: his redouble, rather|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure he cant sit this. he has good defence, knows he is facing spade shortness and five hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N makes on the cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Goes down if NS get their @S trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 Nt is alright too|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 3 nt  with  j987 |pg||
nt|josj: I have to admit this makes sense...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: but i can ask if you want|pg||
nt|josj: probably it's the time schedule|pg||
nt|josj: 52 boards a day, this way, not 56 which might be too long|pg||
nt|josj: half an hour extra|pg||
nt|josj: nd use iof screens always slowing down the proceedings|pg||
nt|stc: 5@h will win 4 IMP|pg||
nt|josj: and|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H can be stronger... but was purely a balancing bid this time|pg||
nt|dslee: W can open 1@D , I would do so and keep re-bidding @D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: maybe she was swayed by her two 10's|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, slam is just against the odds|pg||
nt|newmoon: This should be defeated 2 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: perhaps with such a pure pre-empt he doesn't want to bid 3@C because it might just help opps too much|pg||
nt|newmoon: the 3@D opener certainly "worked" this time|pg||
nt|dslee: no no no no - no one will bid 3NT with N hand|pg||
nt|dslee: nothing worked, just that this is an extreme chance|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: yes a spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: E's @h spots are just good enough to deny the defence 4 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT down on @H lead & @S switch?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - misread|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being if you bid 3@C people will finesse your partner for all the queens and you know that will work|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: from the frying pan.... into ,,,, the fire....|pg||
nt|othered1: The double, in practice, tends to deny a fit at all, but north's @S suit doesn't need a lot of support.  |pg||
nt|sharkey: placed @SK behind @SQ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a bit nerve wracking  however |pg||
nt|capercliff: no Carl, declarer gets his @d trick before defence sets up a @s|pg||
nt|josj: this  is going to be a real push|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok, i am told 3@C would be Ghestem|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: bakhshi has to alert  as he could have a longer @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H    needs club lead  to definately beat it|pg||
nt|josj: on  2 in CR NS took the final phantom save: 5@H v. 5@D|pg||
nt|josj: but 4@S on this oe looks a coffee hand so that's what I will do...|pg||
nt|josj: one|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: 4@H also made in the other room on board 1, with an overtrick even|pg||
nt|othered1: Not at all -- isn't 2@H makable?|pg||
nt|athene: well, so you have to bid 2@C or 4@C then :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: this might beat it too|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: SZ scores :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the bidding in CR is so strange, that the operator dont wont to give it :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has two trumps and above all, EW are vul & 2D X is not game so even if they make it there is a limit to how bad it can be. N has shown a good hand so if S doesnt want to move ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: towards game I think it is reasonable for N to pass the double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 2@h is not so far away|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hm as i expected Sandqvist is worried about the defensive potential of his con tribution|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @h now and small return|pg||
nt|capercliff: but E knows who has the K now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|newmoon: What should South bid after 3@D - P - P - ?   with  AJx, AJ10xxx, x, KQx      |pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: @d switch good enuf?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the teltscher team seemed to be way in front  yesterday|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: this will be a quick match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Halberg will make it with the help from the lead now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: high @h would be  encouraging for this pair the 6  is not clear the 10 would be best hoping for AK9  in South|pg||
nt|neobas: Red neither looks attractive|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: has time to try the club as well|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: would not affect the result here|pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all, sorry, I hadn't seen the broadcast already started :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bas :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Bas|pg||
nt|neobas: Heya Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT CR as well|pg||
nt|neobas: Hej Carl|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good afternoon Bas|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, plse?|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H with the hand you gave sid|pg||
nt|dslee: not with the hand he has now|pg||
nt|newmoon: then North can make 3NT!|pg||
nt|newmoon: North was justified, I reckon|pg||
nt|dslee: not with singleton in ptr suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: spade lead also enough    only one discard of a club  so down 1|pg||
nt|josj: discard @H is best|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: A spade was led to the ace and one returned. Curtains|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have taken some deep trump finesses there|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: he almost has to fall into it now    no?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: was so much easier to beat the hand from this vantage point |pg||
nt|josj: declarer will then need a trump finesse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: I am told that the contract was 6@C and not 5@H|pg||
nt|stc: 10:00 is VERY EARLY for most bridge players|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: oups +2|pg||
nt|dslee: anyways, NS bidding is jinxed - apologies if this is a strong word, but for the sake of the viewers, players will handle this in a different way|pg||
nt|newmoon: but... partner can have   AJx, AKQJxx, x, xxx     and 3NT cold again|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: but after the great lead the follow-up was disappointing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room, Whittaker reasonably played partner for a singleton spade rather than @CA after West bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't fault him|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, something went 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: I think 2@S was a good decision, likely going plus instead of minus if east had taken the right view|pg||
nt|athene: but that might go very badly wrong if (for example) east is holding up with @HKxx or something|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: a push|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am suprised to hear that :)  |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Whittaker also from Scotland originally|pg||
nt|othered1: and 670 is an especially ugly minus|pg||
nt|athene: you might run into diamond ruffs trying to get to dummy, or just get cut off from dummy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: making now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But EW can still defeat 4@h with @d continustion|pg||
nt|ralfwil: continuation....|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h hasa fair potential as cards lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is different to pass the doubl;e of 2H. first off, if they make it NS will have a huge loss, and secondly N has a much better hand for defense against Ds than Hs. as against ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that, S probably has five hearts. here prudence wins the day|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|daman: he will take the money and run|pg||
nt|josj: seesm automatic for declarer, wd|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: north was never stabding a double into game at the 2 level|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Scotland "exported" many strong players, most notably Michael Rosenberg and Barnet Shenkin to USA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Victor Silverstone, Irving Gordon, and a few others|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Was 1 off, not making|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder Scotland does not have a strong team today|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: close to making|pg||
nt|lestergold: his redouble was bad on offensive potential of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: based not bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h8|pc|s2|nt|newmoon: anyways, swing = 200 less 90 = 110  =  3 IMPs|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and even if 2H would fail, it probably wouldnt go down more than one, so as long as N thinks he has a good shot at 110, the IMP odds support bidding. the real question is can he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: count on going plus, knowing there is a big spade stack behind him. i think so, because he will be able to make his small trumps via ruffs as long as S has entries|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: unfortunate discard by East|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|josj: W known to be 6-5-1-1 or 6-5-2-0|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: This seems to go in line with the old adage --return partner's suit |pg||
pc|s7|nt|blum1956: NS needed to ruff a spade before switching to clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: The Q@C seems a very flash play to me |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|othered1: or a trump endplay, as here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzdb: Last entered trick no right|pg||

nt|lestergold: at this rate|pg||
nt|daman: this has the potential to be passed out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also the clubs rate to be well placed for declarer on this auction, and a better source of tricks for offense than defence|pg||
nt|capercliff: hard to stay out of game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT going down here|pg||
nt|sharkey: East may lead a @S though...|pg||
nt|stc: If N opens NS will play game and go down|pg||
nt|tomi2: at least the guys know they play ghestem. In Germany most of TD and AC cases are because people look at KQJxxxx@C and forget about Ghestem or partner raises your real Ghestem with ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: ATxx in clubs etc. :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha, yes "the Ghestem Ghost"|pg||
nt|neobas: Always haunting|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in england at most EBU tournaments we have a "ghestem box" - anyone who forgets has to put £1 in, and at the end of the day, all the tournament directors go out for a meal ...|pg||
nt|athene: with the money from the box :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, ok, we don't actually but it's a nice idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a great idea |pg||
nt|neobas: Might have to suggest that to my dad :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks and easy 4 @H here for e/w |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C vul now?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|garnetts: Well they got off to a very good lead and then made a fatal switch |pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: that makes 8 tricks....|pg||
nt|sybarra: every card is wrong for decarer actually |pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like an endplay possibility|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, if S opens, NS will play game and go down as well :)  :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: is that a transfer or multi-type defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Holland likes to bid diamonds, then hearts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: and vugraph ...|pg||
nt|newmoon: Krishna is saddled with a huge problem now|pg||

mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: no, not clear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if that's a weak 2 ...|pg||
nt|daman: nope  The Garve saved us from that|pg||
nt|lestergold: with garvey around you cant be sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: now the @H lead from E |pg||
nt|neobas: Who here believes North should pass 1@H to allow partner to X?|pg||
nt|dslee: if ptr shows values and he sees his hand with a quick trump trik, the simple bidd is pass|pg||
nt|dslee: and when opponents are red|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: No--but the Q@C seemed a very rapid play |pg||
nt|blum1956: not an easy decision for North spade lead probably made from J10|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: apparently david gold still contemplating the @SA|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view too fast to work out options |pg||
nt|lestergold: must show one of the majors or tyransfer?|pg||
nt|stc: indeed|pg||
nt|josj: the X should warn Chemla|pg||
nt|sybarra: the qj, and the kq  holding may also slow them down |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT here. Impressed?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card drury?|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think makeable with @H lead|pg||
nt|neobas: It is something every regular partnership should've discussed in my opinion|pg||
nt|stc: some play here XX showing support|pg||
nt|josj: I would XX here...|pg||
nt|stc: W endplayed on the lead !|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a third in hand opening but 1nt looks bold at these colours and with a sketchy stop|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is the wildness of garvey at unfavouravle vul he makes a bid that many of us wouldnt even do at favourable|pg||
nt|neobas: Strong 2@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up being enough only to buy the TD each a pint |pg||
nt|neobas: Especially if West can bid 4@H with three card support, an Ace and out|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S for n/s if they could get in |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@Cx is only -1 tho...|pg||
nt|dslee: yes what does EW makes?|pg||
nt|dslee: take the money back home :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@D safer, at this early stage of the match|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: no :)|pg||
nt|josj: it depends: most of the participants here stayed in nearby-hotels overnight, I assume|pg||

nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: jst for remind : 1 match = 2 segments of13 boards|pg||
nt|stc: W will suffer at each card|pg||
nt|josj: and poor E never gets in with his established @C|pg||
nt|tomi2: finaly thats the 2nd time in my young life I see strong twos in action :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: kept n/s out completely |pg||
nt|athene: many people would open 1@C on that north hand|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT says "partner I forgot my bifocals... I think I haved 2 more aces"|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: once you have a reputation...it is difficult to deviate|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will get a plus score on this occasion for his efforts|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very tamely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h will go down after 4 rounds óf @c, otherwise makeable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you can if playing support XX |pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: You can't sit still with a 17 count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a quick one down?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push i expect|pg||
nt|ady: this should go ddown on the lay    3NT  may have mad with Q@D right though a an unlikely club lead would beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the weak No trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tosh backing in with a Q and a QJ i think very dangerous|pg||
nt|capercliff: hold up the @h twice and play 3 rounds of @c's, what does E pitch?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   no distribution for an action but 1 NT is possible  1 @s  would weak with dsitribution|pg||
nt|neobas: W on lead won't make a difference, I think|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no a quick 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: a passive lead mind you would let it thru but unlikely|pg||
nt|neobas: Same lead CR|pg||
nt|capercliff: double dummy can get out for -1 i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: pitch @D - limited communications after 4 times @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has to get the unblock in also |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: work to do but the lead has created a trick and the spades are playabel for one loser|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: yes Roland - and I can make 6 on a non-@c-lead :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have been more impressed if you could have made 6@C on the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dangerous weak 2 with 6 solid tricks in ones hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|capercliff: declarer knows E is 4-3 in the majors now|pg||
nt|neobas: South in the CR ducked the lead twice, played a @C to hand and a @D to the K, after which defence could cash 3@Hs and 3@Ds|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose it is not clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT asked East to choose a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Crouch knows that diamonds 5-0 now after the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will play the hand accordingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry what amn i talking about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Qx a particularly doubtful value|pg||
nt|capercliff: and after 4 rounds of @c's will have full outlay|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: hard for partner to read this|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can only make on a spade lead which is likely|pg||
nt|josj: Chemla not interested...|pg||
nt|sybarra: aceless wonder hand|pg||
nt|josj: 10 tricks seem far away but 9 should be there|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: yes and the side suit is @h!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a @d trick may be created  as they lie|pg||
nt|sharkey: actually East pitches after dummy so wont make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: two yes for one no :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch knows that Tosh has nothing. Otherwise North has no double|pg||
nt|sybarra: except with no @D lead, maybe shows S has none?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north cant be faulted but south will be ashamed|pg||
nt|othered1: Good pint, Shirley|pg||
nt|othered1: point|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is on the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pint sounds OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe the pint is better at this hour for us|pg||
nt|sybarra: 940 am here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may need a heart switch now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed someone eill need a blood transfusion after this|pg||
nt|stc: And quantin let W do the work for him|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S lead would have beaten this |pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooops  Gold did return a low @S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: @D goes on a @C|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what their methods were over 1NT  ---tempting to bid if you get both suits in |pg||
nt|newmoon: Ashok hoping six running diamonds opposite, and punts 3NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lebridgeur: most   declarer can get is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: that cant be right|pg||
nt|capercliff: E did not switch to a @c?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and declarer did not play a @h voluntarily?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be huge,  they are playing 4 @S at the other table I am told |pg||
nt|neobas: With 5@Ds and 4@Cs I would, but I wouldn't feel too good rebidding 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind 1@C - 1Major; 1NT|pg||
nt|neobas: On the other hand, this might not be your hand and if you want to get a lead-directing bid in now is your chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: even vul,  couldnt S have ventured 2 @S here?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is a textbook error of course|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe a double psychology play :)|pg||
nt|athene: i trust my partner to supply a good stop in the other major|pg||
nt|athene: if he can't even do that little thing, i will find a new partner|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stc: @s now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: another 13 imps to Teltscher|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think 3N is a likely spot here|pg||
nt|daman: Mike    I have noticed a marked imrpovement with your spelling    are you dating a Grammar teacher?    or are you just typing slower?    lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: at unfave vul i cant see the point of the bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, and especially with a double. what if W redoubles? now you may get hurt in a variety of ways|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: E has to NOT play trumps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts and 3 clubs, or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is certain re diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 12 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you are very kind Mike!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i never heard of a weak 2  8-12|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: assuming the 5-0 trump split playing clubs which is the natural thing to do will make the positiom clear|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|daman: not at all like the old days|pg||
nt|newmoon: OR stopped in sensible 3@D, but for -1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: well practice|pg||
nt|daman: hehehe|pg||
nt|sybarra: stranger and stanger |pg||
nt|josj: @S looks better as W will not easily be thrown in again then|pg||
nt|stc: sqzd on the last @s|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: maybe getting ready to put E in somehow |pg||
nt|capercliff: if declarer had the @s instead of the 8 he would make this|pg||
nt|capercliff: 9@s|pg||
nt|capercliff: a @c now and what will E pitch?|pg||
nt|neobas: A small @S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: He would have a chance but that would be the case  on any defense|pg||
nt|capercliff: then he would make|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may not be good enough|pg||
nt|newmoon: OR = Open Room|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|garnetts: On the last hand I really like the pass of 2@D --an intelligent psych |pg||
nt|lestergold: this doesnt make sense|pg||
nt|daman: tell us a bit about the 4some at the other table Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely that club wasnt ducked by the defence|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Now it is again|pg||
nt|roswolf: but that was a clear error by north|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace and a @H now?|pg||
nt|othered1: south did echo in @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: does that help?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or a diamond to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will be endplayed twice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it is also easy|pg||
nt|othered1: And east's double of 2@S had to be on more than just the @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: in either red suit - declarer's choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is to try to go plus instead of minus, but i agree that with that collection of rubbish he is aiming at an extremely narrow target|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer didnt want to squeeze dummy on the last @c|pg||
nt|neobas: Has to play @Ss now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well spotted|pg||
nt|sybarra: and has to be low spade doesnt it? |pg||
nt|neobas: Yes|pg||
nt|neobas: He might take the @DA for -1 in Teams but I think he has the lay of the hand at this point|pg||
nt|capercliff: he should get this right|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I think any @s  do|pg||
nt|capercliff: he knows S has 3 more @d's without the Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually you might be right on JP |pg||
nt|neobas: Correct, because, as Cliff said, Declarer does not have the @ST|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hope everyone noted how long North spent working out the options in the OR--it is a real lesson of using your brain in crucial situations |pg||
nt|sharkey: Playing @C squeezed E; but also destroyed communications for declarer |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|mc|8|nt|sybarra: I think E has the count on declarers hand |pg||
nt|newmoon: so a push, and some practice gained|pg||

nt|ady: grand slam time|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Brian senior and sandra penfold another formidable mixed partnership King a very respected player Small always appears in premier league and trials but would not rank him as ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: top ten in Uk|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Both  sides played well|pg||
nt|neobas: Strange play on the hand but 3 IMPs to Delfour|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done |pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a coffee break hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we start a "new match" so to speak |pg||
nt|sybarra: losing an imp |pg||
nt|sybarra: hope not to costly in the end |pg||
nt|josj: as will W in CR...|pg||
nt|stc: not MP|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: god slam here|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect grand - will they find it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and for me - never both majors|pg||
nt|daman: I think the score will sort itself out in the fullness of time|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: we need to cut Nicky some slack    this is her first time as a vugraph operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: Brian mainly known for his supremacy as a match point player world class|pg||
nt|daman: he is very good|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a very good player altogether|pg||
nt|daman: all pass?|pg||
nt|daman: or would you bid 2NT with the North hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: senior of  course a very fine bridge journalist produces all the world championshiop reports excellent|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: 5@D was a fine save against 6@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 2@H shows this then it might take a very short time to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: and great thinking as declarer,  didnt panic |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed was my teammate in my Camrose match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive always foujhnd Small to be an undisciplined player at this level which ismperhaps why altho he is up there competing ion the premier league every year rarely m,akes it into the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: top 4 if ever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well  it was a weak @H suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h e/w looks normal|pg||
nt|neobas: Let's hope for NS North doesn't get pushy|pg||
nt|neobas: Might just open 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 small hts by N not exactly appetizing for going beyond 4 @S |pg||
nt|stc: if w open 3@h NS may end in 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: Board 3 was a push because N made the best lead, a trump|pg||
nt|neobas: If you're lucky - and play Walsh like I do - p might be 4M5@D and bid 2-way 2@C :)|pg||
nt|neobas: lol Bill|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|garnetts: tough to get to 6@C but maybe not after that opening |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16 opp  7   difficult|pg||
nt|blum1956: using the negative free style North should bid 2@h and then the life becomes easy|pg||
nt|ady: only 23 hcp   but great fit  and source of tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: splinter  or fit jump  or voidwood  which?|pg||
nt|blum1956: but NS probably do not use it|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is hoping to buy a contract for his side))|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does the X show @S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if they do go to 3H you cant rate your chances of beating iot very highly. and if they do go down 50, what have you won? risk-reward ratio very dicey|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes --almost certainly spades with @D toleranace |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: It is a n 11 match round robin on 3 week end so victory points are at stake|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's mad to open 1@C on this south hand and not on the previous north hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: surely the dbl means more than "not penalty"!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they must have some more meaning than "not penalty"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will show off the strong club system|pg||
nt|neobas: 2@D a Game Forcing opening, it seems|pg||
nt|neobas: As for the subsequent bids, I am at a loss :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: or multi not sure|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, I am not sure what is going on here|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like "any 11" |pg||
nt|neobas: I'm with you on this one Bill|pg||
nt|sybarra: these aren't jrs |pg||
nt|tomi2: having AKQJxxx@H I would not want to let my opps play 4@S vuln undoubled... either I think they are too high, then I try a double or I take insurance in 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: might just bid 6@C and hope for the best |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|haans: or jump to 4@C GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did North double over 2@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not double I mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another tough call for Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|garnetts: When people used to play monet doubles --there were many times a psychic penaltry double was used--good time for it here for example :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tradegy too as its frigid|pg||
nt|daman: it is gin|pg||
nt|capercliff: does anyone know their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: game   forcing ace  of @d  shown by 3 @d bid|pg||
nt|josj: nearly :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: interestingly, in OR West opens 1NT, then East bids 3@H = 5-5 majors.  They got to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Does that not show both red suits?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe better cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: like everyone else I have no idea what to do with hands like west--so might as well gamble|pg||
nt|othered1: There are 7's and there are 7's.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT 17-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly marshall|pg||
nt|athene: well south does have two aces and no bad points (unsupported or short queens or jacks)|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the worst 11 ever|pg||
nt|dslee: we welcome Kista (R Krishnan) to this room - welcome Kista|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: west saying @d support :)|pg||
nt|dslee: not going|pg||
nt|dslee: not going|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: as alerted to south|pg||
nt|dslee: sry private intended|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: this is not plain sailing|pg||
nt|lestergold: here we see Towsned can bid aggressively when he wants to|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im trying to work out can this be made double dummy even?|pg||
nt|lestergold: answer is i dont think that makes ten tricks as cardsw lie here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult when the @S dont break|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i think tiownsend overbid herec partner didnt even have tio have 4 reasonable,hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bakhshi knows the @S dont break from the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 3@c expresses his values after the double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most would bid 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: why?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19 points? |pg||
nt|lestergold: west'shand is full of holes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 points opposie a pssoble yarborough maybe with a 3 card suit is not mandatory game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in either major|pg||
nt|neobas: According to kibs 2@D is GF, 3@D shows @DA and 3@Ss|pg||
nt|neobas: In which case I wonder what 4@D is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4-2 spade split gives this an excellent play    would Bakhshi except an invitation ?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure NS play Michael 5+/4+ - S has absolut minimum, but very friendly steup for N|pg||
nt|othered1: dicey is a very kind way to put it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|haans: now they know nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Especially with the state of the match - harking back to the debate earlier about tactics|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not hard since North choose to bid 3@H--5NT will do it now |pg||
nt|blum1956: either exclusion Blackwood  (if NS use one) or just RKCB and hope for  the @dA with EW|pg||
nt|ady: disappointing|pg||
nt|josj: @S split very nicely here so np for declarer|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reached the par contract now, 6@DX|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not yet Roland |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very polite David |pg||
nt|newmoon: ouch - misunderstanding|pg||
nt|dslee: well-|pg||
nt|dslee: this is undesired by EW I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 4@d was alerted as @d support by west|pg||
nt|newmoon: be wary of conventions that only occur once each 2 years...|pg||
nt|dslee: 6@D now then :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: A huge swing to Sri Lanka - system error|pg||
mb|5N|nt|mcarroll: He surely is not contemplating 6NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is considering what to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: length is the paramountg consideration|pg||
nt|athene: and the hearts are better than @HA432|pg||
nt|neobas: @SQJx  makes it iffy|pg||
nt|sybarra: note that on previous hand, N opened |pg||
nt|dslee: both the teams are swinging - Mahesh, can we have Kista also commentry here :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@D?  Puppet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so yes, Ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: Last year Cooke and Garvey were in the winning Camrose team which was I expect a culmination of their drwam for years|pg||
nt|daman: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh comes from the "Scots wha' hae wi' Wallace bled" school|pg||
nt|othered1: Your line here?  Cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: im askwed if 2@h is forcing here i would say it was forcing in most partnerships ithese days|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously must be in theirs|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they play 2@c multi and 2@d  Gf ace showing answers|pg||
nt|capercliff: flat board-next|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: North can likely infer that @S are 3-3 at most in EW  hands|pg||
nt|stc: 3@h makes, so 3@s is not bad, could make|pg||
nt|stc: probably not|pg||
nt|newmoon: logical was to transfer to @Ss, then bid @H.   Now no-one misunderstands|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 5 small @H and a bust and it has a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a moot point borderline my point is that Towsend sholuld have consulted|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes pls|pg||
nt|dslee: welcome Kista:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: with an outside entry, Asoka should lead a @C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Lucky that hearts are 3-3. He can test if @CJ10 doubleton first by cashing one of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has always believed that he was the world's number one not noted for his modesty but to be fair i have always felt that he had a great talent for then game but in sufficent ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: discipline to sustain a position at the top table|pg||
nt|neobas: To a junior like me that seems like a rather old-fashioned system. Obviously I don't know it in-depth but Ace-showing answers are something of the past in my book :)|pg||
nt|josj: @C is best now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: but would he get the right result with a 4-2 spade split  if just consulting|pg||
nt|neobas: It got them to the right spot though|pg||
nt|stc: A@s and @d was the double dummy defense|pg||
nt|josj: but not easy to find|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: trump next I imagine |pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CJ to indicate values in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: @cJ for @S|pg||
nt|garnetts: trump is best--the spade can wait |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter and I must have been partners|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite normal these days not to lead a singleton in partner's suit against notrumps|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: a double followed by a 3 level cue bid tells pard that he doesnt need much to bid game posession ofa 5 CARD SUIT WOULD THEN BE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT|pg||
nt|ady: I agree if east had just 3 small hearts and a bust then 4 hearts could cost a big number|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ssorry butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|daman: we have our share of those on this side of the pond as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry slight exaggeration but we are allowed to tease garvey|pg||
nt|neobas: Be right back|pg||
nt|dslee: ahhhhhhhhhh haaaaaaaa - this is the most unfavourable contract EW can reach|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: a club away on that spade wouldnt hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think selway should have played a club here a spade should have helped declarer|pg||
nt|daman: The Garve is not timid   he criticizes easily    lol|pg||
nt|athene: but still leading a diamond on this auction was quite a view|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the winner of the 3 weekends gets to represent England in the Camrose |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: if clubs 3/3,  this rolls |pg||
nt|josj: decl. has no good way to come to his hand|pg||
nt|josj: but def. can do little harm as N can ruff @DA with his @SA...|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but now the A@d is a trick again|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: but oh well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is very good play|pg||
nt|stc: ruff, Q@H, trump|pg||
nt|josj: putting up the @DA also works :)|pg||
nt|josj: but does not seem a logical line|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he doesn't know|pg||
nt|josj: he did not know to put up @SJ either...|pg||
nt|stc: he already played S for AK@s|pg||
nt|josj: yes but the chinese finesse looked a bit odd|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blum1956: extremely strange bid for the player of Brunner's level|pg||
nt|lestergold: better not continue these!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: top diamond or even a trump by south would do|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think bakhshi can set up a long dim and enjoy without losing trump comntrol|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it matters  if Townsend pulls 1 trumpt    can discard a club on K@S   and has time to ruff a spade and a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: hovering over a @h|pg||
nt|stc: was good against AK alone in S|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Henry!  Why  the distinction?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a bidding test here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H CR|pg||
nt|sybarra: should never make 5 |pg||
nt|josj: I can see 3 top losers :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too |pg||
nt|josj: even without glasses on|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defense can get their act together|pg||
nt|stc: end a swing, EW did not enter at all in CR|pg||
nt|newmoon: but still a loss of 13 IMPs and not 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 6@h is the top spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer has certainly been friendly to slams |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on  previous deal four @d  showed   @s acceptance with no other thing to cue|pg||
nt|josj: unlikely to disappear|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: first weekend of 3|pg||
nt|othered1: here south passedthe ugly 12-ount|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after clubs can use 2D as art 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@d makes as well of course|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contracts rely on @h being 3-2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope pard knows you use rock crusing 3 level bids|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand    n/s  in spades best|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lebridgeur: he is vulnberable  and only 6 cards  sensible in first position|pg||
nt|neobas: 6@D it is, it seems|pg||
nt|newmoon: guess which hand these 2 will be discussing during the smoke break ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 15 opp 15 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean slam for these boys?|pg||
nt|neobas: I wonder what 1@S is|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S t/o without spades; now west wants to compete to 3@C without actually saying he has any values|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: SZ coming|pg||
nt|garnetts: Tough hand for North --|pg||
nt|yo_yo: redouble is for blood i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double now look fine |pg||
nt|blum1956: EW probably catched up|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes xx was punitive|pg||
nt|sybarra: singleton honors worth ?  (zip)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike Bell also passed 3@D in the OR on 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  because after 1@c ... you have 2@d available as an artificial force|pg||
nt|othered1: Sounds reasonable, but I don't think I've seen that in action.  Don't get around much any more, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had probably played on establish the @d suit by winning the first @c by @cQ and played a @d to @dA and ruffed a @d another @c to K ruffed another @d and discarded @sJ on @cA and ...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that played @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  which you don't after 1@d and 3@c as an artificial force uses up a lot of room|pg||
nt|neobas: Second as well, in my opinion Meyer|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is vul,  so make can expect a "good" hand |pg||
nt|sharkey: W opened 1@D CR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Yes bas of course|pg||
nt|josj: now the NS @S tend to disappear|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like Gan's choice of 1NT in the closed room, rather than double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Anyone for 1NT on the West cards raher then dbl? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jxx often a nice holding|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to see the @H-stop in 3Nt - in CR West reopen 1NT - so......|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there something wrong with X byt N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that the absence of a 7th club does not deter the Garve from a vul 3 level pre=empt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not sure of their sys here but i assume 1C is some sort of artificial bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like 3N doesn'thave much play at all on @H lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S raising @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i understood this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam looks well below 59%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2¬@h doesnt mke|pg||
nt|ady: North decided to keep out of bidding     not unreasonable|pg||
nt|daman: I have an appointment in 10 minutes    so I will have to flee this match at that point|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 or 7? - as long as the suit is QJ109xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: however his cheeky opening has pushed e/w into  a pretty hpel;ess 3n|pg||
nt|pelu: woprked foine here - no chance in 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: matter of style/agreements|pg||
nt|athene: it's tricky if you are going to bid 3@C on that hand and on 15 counts as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west considering 3@C   not an immediate success|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect lead!|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done|pg||
nt|stc: looking for trouble|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: only 2@D on 14 HCP???????????????|pg||
nt|sybarra: Simon Cope says:  no - relay shape ask I am pretty sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 60%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50% i mean|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S?|pg||
nt|neobas: I think I'd open 1@D and 3@D equally as frequent|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and stopped in 5    not satisfactory test :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: It may be difficult to get to slam unless W opens 3@D|pg||
nt|capercliff: the only downside to opening 3@d is that you are 3-3 in the majors|pg||
nt|stc: -2 even with friendly breaks in trump|pg||
nt|newmoon: kista says " A live vugraph broadcast has just started. Polish Premiere League Round 7 of 15 SEGMENT 1/2."|pg||
pc|d8|nt|neobas: I feel W has used the brakes too much in CR|pg||
nt|josj: yes E left the gate open but NS did not exploit it |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|josj: nicely done|pg||
nt|josj: the agreements are OK|pg||
nt|newmoon: kista says "words will be hotter than the smoke"|pg||
nt|newmoon: sorry|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree, especially when you see where double leads to|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers unavoidable|pg||
nt|tomi2: but maybe he could speculate on his father having 6-4, he did not open any kind of weak two (I guess they play Multi) and overcalled 1@H vulnerable on not many points - so he ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: should have some shape|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I said it before and I will say it again. The EBU must require that all convention cards are submitted and then put on display on the website. It is unreasonable that commentators ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: must guess what certain bids mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll have a word with Max Bavin|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I agree with both of you  !|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: I would rather have passed the double than bid 2@D |pg||
nt|haans: original bid|pg||
nt|neobas: So then Doubling instead of 1@S would've been 4+@Ss?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: I have found that the cc's typically posted are only part of the story,  but would be nice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead for King|pg||
nt|henryb:  you only think that because he rebid 1N and not 2, Mike|pg||
nt|stc: first swing of the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 cards suits "up the line"  but with both,  I think X might be right |pg||
nt|josj: looks like playing mp|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit i would not have preotected with halberg's hand altho h ewas influnced by holding 9 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: close his eyes and play the top tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: hope for the best |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so I prefer to open 3 @d|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: (also in little tiny print) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that I have the EW card. I have because Crouch sent it to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Most don't get terribly deep into relay development|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took me 5 minutes to download the comprehensive version of the EW CC|pg||
nt|sybarra: the cc's hardly give the details for relays,  agree ED |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a shorter version I have on hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect Precision, with 2S inviting game in NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the1N rebid must show 18-1i9 points to explain the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2N looks safe enuf|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Couldn't see a card there|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it is reasonable to assume that  Henry |pg||
nt|lestergold: playing natural club south would rebid 2N|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes me too|pg||
nt|sharkey: W felt "guilty" due to his light opener in CR I think|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: i would have tried 3@D :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or even open 1@d maybe?|pg||
nt|capercliff: in 2nd seat|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|blum1956: ruff out, play trumps and then a spade|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes of course Haans :) rofl |pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have tried 2@H with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland explained to me that out operators are new to this and it is very tought job--in my view Darren is doing brilliantly so far --may not be able to note all alerts this first ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: time |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Cheers, I am new but Roger is an old hand, you'll have David and Ant later who are both experts!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: making 5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: Roland and I would have been in 3NT because we would have bid 1NT as west --so there |pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of going for a number would have detered me|pg||
nt|pelu: but some would pass the X - if pd strong then 500-800 |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 imps about to appear for the Teltscher team|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt favorite|pg||
nt|sybarra: take no finesses|pg||
nt|sybarra: at yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: *at least yet |pg||
nt|lestergold: every time garvey gets away with one of his wild bids he is encouraged to continue forgets any disasters|pg||
nt|lestergold: has led a charmed life rcently to|pg||
nt|reisig: Somehow - I get partners that remind me!!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: Would you open 3@D if Non Vul?|pg||
nt|stc: sure, I don't think that N was really happy when bidding 2@s !|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: long dim takes care of one club loser but that is still 1 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: no devils coup available|pg||
nt|ady: this may be down 2    but definately 1  so nothing much lost for n/s being kept out of the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldnt be 2 off just needs to get the timing right for one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult for players of this calibre|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am askedf how old is garvey|pg||
nt|athene: as many specs have pointed out, lots of pairs would use 2nt by west over 2@H to show a weaker hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: of course X in S should show @s|pg||
nt|josj: yes, only way to show them in this auction|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pelu: to all spects: pl. a name in your profil - most commentators dont chat with "John Do's"|pg||
nt|neobas: He brought six tricks and three card support to the table, I'd say I have nothing to be guilty about|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@d doesn't tell pard anything about his hand really|pg||
nt|newmoon: easy now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: looks like 800|pg||
nt|athene: of course there are textbooks which would frown on that 3@C opener, but having the texture in the suit is worth a lot|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well i guess mid late forties but always looked about 25 to me|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@C is a real hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|garnetts: taken the max --well done |pg||
nt|newmoon: the elusive 9th trick has been found, and +2 now|pg||
nt|newmoon: oh... @HQ ducked (safe hand) for +1 only|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: claim?|pg||
nt|athene: @CQJ109xx is going to be a 2-loser suit mostly even if partner hasn't got a fit|pg||
nt|athene: better than e.g. @CK97432 which might indeed get really killed|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes the average junior look like an old age pensioner|pg||
nt|neobas: @H pitch looks scary|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: but a pair who play strong twos aren't going to go in for any funny business like that!|pg||
nt|tomi2: but playing this way you are not able to show a hand with 5+clubs and 4 dias, incase partners fit is in @D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blum1956: a swing for Hackett this time probably|pg||
nt|stc: But, on the bidding, EW may have even 4@h to play|pg||

nt|josj: oh yes...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|athene: here, i would say, east should have support for both minors almost all the time so you are probably better-off using it as lebensohl - you don't need to bid 2nt with 4@D5@C because ...|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C should be ok most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: just for remind you : 1 match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
nt|dslee: last deal here now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: well to be fair the weak NT didnt help earlier|pg||
nt|ady: e/w need to keep out of game|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s frigidaire?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C or 1@D opening on last hand in anatural system is strictly a matter of style|pg||
nt|stc: part score battle now|pg||
nt|athene: but just change the auction even slightly and you might argue that scrambling is better, so it need a lot of discussion|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: The Complete Book of Balasncing Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: SZ rapidly approaching a target of 10 imps per board to win.|pg||

mb|2S|nt|lestergold: and not actually a bad contract|pg||
nt|pelu: ok slam - but I dont exp that NS will come even close to bid slam|pg||
nt|athene: south might just respond 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cooke is the perfect partner for garvey he is a thoughtful disciplined highly intelligent player around whom Garvey can dance his dance of death|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe 4@d in that case|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps 3 NT may be an option...|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to play them all as scramble unless specifically agreed otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  5+ hearts  9+ hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|neobas: 3@H by South?|pg||
nt|neobas: Four, even!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps again here|pg||
nt|newmoon: 8-board matches are tight... like BAM and MPs.  Each trick is crucial, and any misunderstanding become a calamity|pg||
nt|dslee: both white with @S suit - shd be chopped|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S for n/s|pg||

nt|pelu: I would hate to open 1@D on the N-hand :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Garvey deals out quite a lot of death against anyone but the toughest opposition|pg||

nt|capercliff: no problem now I think, only a @h lead would give declarer problems|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it makes on a cross-ruff?|pg||
nt|sybarra: its close to making,  sometimes pard has some clubs to add to mine |pg||
nt|capercliff: i think 4@h is pretty standard|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - just use @HA first trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: at last a penalty double bid as penalty taken as penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: transfer weak twos --interesting |pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
nt|pelu: I know it the system - but still :)|pg||
nt|athene: they play strong club, 5-card majors, multi 2@D, so 1@D is very loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s wants to be played by south asltho here as A@h is right doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I'm sorry, we have to restart this room|pg||
nt|stc: see N in CR passing 3@c|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||
nt|lestergold: why show hearts when they have alre4ady located spade fit|pg||
nt|stc: in fact in both rooms|pg||
nt|tomi2: if you open 1@D and are in the same situation later and bid 2NT as "good bad" then north can preempt one level higher, then responder does not know if opener has a shapely hand ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: with both minors or @D only. seen that often enough|pg||
nt|newmoon: another swing to Sri Lanka.  Well done, Sri Lanka!|pg||
nt|psridhar: look at the disparity in hand evaluation- other room W valued his hand as opg bid; here W did not even consider raising 2s !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: dont worry Nicky anyoje takes on vugraph is very brave|pg||
nt|neobas: Hmm, on second thought maybe not|pg||
nt|capercliff: that might not be good enough, because declarer will eventually have to go out to a @d|pg||
nt|stc: Quantin-Bompis open very light and as a consequence do not X part scores - same as Meckwell|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: he has a simple bid to show a good raise in spade4s|pg||
nt|henryb:  West is close to too strong for a 2N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this decision to open 2N here is going to lead to game and i dont think can make|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is a pro-am bid, in my eyes.  Partner has no idea of trick potential in @D contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I think 2N would be fine if the hand were different:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: Holland 3@C  for major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see the point of a transfer weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Francis Hinden made 4@H  well done to her|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Frances|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s deny a @h cue?|pg||
nt|pelu: Sorry - I was weong they are "close" now|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluckly west's hand is better than some 20 counts but has hit an unfortunate misfit minimum opposite|pg||
nt|sybarra: East decided to just raise in the known 8 card fit,  not looking for anything more than game |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: doesnt it just give opps an extra bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gained 12 imps for her team on 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt venture into this auction with that pile of festering horse manure with a gun to my head|pg||
nt|capercliff: and a second trump comes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: specs want to undertsand teh system|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone explain it|pg||
nt|lestergold: heavily artificial of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 21H must show spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n support 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d cue i assum|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key is the nebulous 1D opening and the 2@h response|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think most of would would bid the same even with constructive raises |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there a reason they opened 1 @S in both rooms? not 1 @H?|pg||
nt|josj: yes, higher from 5-5 |pg||
nt|stc: other type of pairs will be in 3 or even 4@h which may be in on a sunny day|pg||
nt|josj: no matter how many they go down...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Roland, but in 20/20 10 per over is eminently achievable - especially if an inform Gilchrist is batting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah by South  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n good support im toldthe rest is fairly starightforward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually 2N is OK if pd is a passed hand. but facing an unlimited partner you are just begging to miss a slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that question |pg||
pc|s4|nt|capercliff: now he can afford to go out to a @d and retain trump control|pg||
nt|neobas: Only a @H will set it now|pg||
nt|sybarra: testing  E now|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think it can be beat now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: 5@S asking for @H-control?|pg||
nt|henryb:  mainly unlucky that the diamond suit doesn't run|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the point I was dancing around|pg||
nt|lestergold: Holland too good in the majors to pass 2N|pg||
nt|neobas: Well done|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: old fashioned forcing nt might have solved this problem ending in 2 @D's or so |pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately i think with Towsned's minimum 12 count and awful spade suit his 3@d bid which is effectivbely a game try was an overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case 3NT is the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@H|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe im wrong|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the  @d   duck was fatal should have  cross ruffed|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|sybarra: here comes another sp |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: i would think it must be by impication|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|newmoon: playing precision helped.  This was opened 1@D with West (a'la Meckwell)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|neobas: I think that would've led to only nine tricks Meyer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: 1NT would have been 5-11  NF|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: also you do not really need to ask for ther Q@H as you know North is not queen high for his actions |pg||
nt|garnetts: He is almost certain to have the ace |pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed very unlucky not an unreasonable bidding sequence|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe I am wrong as well :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was agood auction |pg||
nt|dslee: EW would had gained someIMP here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: This can go 2 down of Shi finds the diamond shift|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: east needs to count here --North has played it very well so far |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i know, Ed, but i felt more like kick-boxing than dancing:)|pg||
nt|josj: 3@D should go down as well...if def. take their 4 tops and play @C from E|pg||
nt|neobas: Declarer trying to set up @Ds in hand rather than @Hs in dummy for a lack of entries to the long suit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Not easy|pg||
nt|dslee: had they heard me :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: coujld easily be duplicated |pg||
nt|newmoon: and yes, West could have raised later|pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: N had to lose a diamond at some point, so put the defense to test fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: ty all...next session in 10 minxs|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: mins|pg||
nt|dslee: or your T Nagar club weekly|pg||
