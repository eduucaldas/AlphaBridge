nt|fabsayc: perhaps you have to balance with east hand once you pass, although it looks terrifying|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|kittyc: sensible to sell when it comes back to you with 6 hcp in their suit ... but|pg||

mb|p|nt|kittyc: I agree|pg||
mb|3S|nt|larrymori: but it does not matter, now rkc in @s and 7nt is reasonable, but certainly a grand|pg||
nt|kittyc: its the @HJ that is hard to showinthe bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: RKC time.|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting last board other team on vugraph reached 5@S with N opening 1@C|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|caitlin: board prior was 5@S!!|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: agreeing spades actually simplifies this hand|pg||
nt|kittyc: now RKC? 0-3 response?|pg||
nt|larrymori: looks that way|pg||
nt|caitlin: time for 7|pg||
nt|kittyc: also the 2NT bid suggested a balhand so 2 hearts|pg||
nt|larrymori: with the cue before it has to be 3 and 2nt rates to have 2@h so 7nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 7S or 7NT hmmmm....|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: or 7N|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kittyc: wonder what 5H is|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|caitlin: thinking 0 controls???|pg||
nt|larrymori: not after the earlier cue|pg||
nt|caitlin: true|pg||
mb|6S|nt|caitlin: but 5@H odd|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: zero controls with a 2 over 1 bid???|pg||
nt|kittyc: for us, asking in Hs, cannot go past 5@S w/o 2nd rnd so now nostiff @H|pg||
nt|larrymori: this is tortuous|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: just count the tricks!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kittyc: oh well|pg||

mc|13|nt|debrose: surely you can ruff a heart if that was the hand|pg||
nt|debrose: perhaps East's decision is anti-percentage, but I assure you she knows how to count tricks|pg||
nt|larrymori: might have bid 3@c with 2155|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes she does|pg||
nt|debrose: no, would not have bid 3@C with 2-1-5-5 and a good clubs for NT|pg||
nt|larrymori: pard might be 5404 or 5413|pg||
nt|larrymori: ok thx all bye|pg||
