nt|vugraphzau: of this board|pg||
nt|psridhar: that overstated 2s ( with KJ of dia under 1d opener) leads to curtain raiser game that is hopeless|pg||
nt|psridhar: even a response of 1N may hv been a better idea, planning to compete 2s if reqd later|pg||

pc|d8|nt|mrdct: NS stole the @s suit here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|mrdct: north can safely set up his @d suit whilst he still has @SA entry to his hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: suspect 3@h and 1 @s for defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: a good start for the wales|pg||
pc|c2|nt|suketbombi: yes and the lead has given nothing away|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|suketbombi: oops|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|suketbombi: cannot belive she playes the ace of @HS|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: going up with @HA was not such a good idea by Shashi with 2 more 1h tricks ensured by just covering East's card|pg||
nt|suketbombi: believe that she played the @HA|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes @h was played|pg||
nt|suketbombi: must be a misclick by buddy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzat: mahesh here|pg||
nt|rv: still declarer doesn't have 10 tricks, will take @c finesse and go 1 down|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|cT|nt|rv: North will be squeezed on last @h and declarer should make 9 here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s likely to fail also so not likely to be a swing|pg||

nt|psridhar: 3d can make can sartaj find a 2nd x now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: that club 9 is a crucial card in 3d|pg||
nt|psridhar: stops EW communication in clubs for a spd upper cut leading to trump trick for defense|pg||
nt|psridhar: tough problem for Sartaj|pg||
