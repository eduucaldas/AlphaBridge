nt|vbman: so they barely have time to compare results|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: that is right|pg||
nt|ciaran: that is not the most  testing lead for declarer..  up to 7 top tricks now and can easily generate an eighth in hearts|pg||
nt|ciaran: can endplay north for a ninth trick|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: the @H9 dropps|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR East - after small @C to @C8 - play @CAK and N discard 2x@H - later endplay for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ciaran: well done by north - making E commit  early|pg||
nt|ciaran: that was well played - likely to be safe to cash the clubs since north opened and is marked with the missing points|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|nicksan: This will be the last board of the first half, and another 5 IMP's to Trondelag will bring them to a deficit of only 5. All to play for in the second half. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the Norwegian Bridge Federation for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO. Inger Hjellemarken and Harald Skjæran have been instrumental in ...|pg||
