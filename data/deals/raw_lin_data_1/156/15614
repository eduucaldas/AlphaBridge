nt|ahollan1: but 37-0   |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will be back in aprox 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: with the last set|pg||
nt|rv: we play 16 boards in every segment in finals, so this and 1 more|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry Fred and claimed 12.... why sorry.... i misspalyed it .... and laughed|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly, yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so only 4 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H 1-round-force|pg||
nt|jtr: A chance at last for Strul|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 26 minutes to play one board, and to drink a coffee no time for shower lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in france it's 18:34|pg||
nt|jtr: Thinnish values for game here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzta: for fantunes|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, private|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: usually 14+ HCP, but maybe 12/13 with 5@H & 4@S   [as we see here]|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: At last a chance to get some IMPs for Strul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N= 5+ HCP, 3+@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now East in the tank..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director said you should be finished by now|pg||
nt|tez: in turkey 19:37 :) |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the structure from here -- probably 3@H saying reject game try    [without interference]|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bet theses guys will bid slam|pg||
nt|dburn: better let them use Blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: To be fair on the players time wise, all these part scores do take up a lot of time|pg||
nt|dburn: then, they won't bid a slam - if you make them guess, they might|pg||
nt|yvesj49: key cards BW is boring here|pg||
nt|jtr: But i guess it will be bid|pg||
nt|passell: this is the match of the year  cant wait for the last segment|pg||
nt|athene: zia didn't try for a diamond ruff here - just drew trumps and knocked out the heart|pg||
nt|rv: 4 segments of 16 boards will decide this match |pg||
nt|athene: and ended up dropping the @DQ|pg||
nt|algraves: 6@S a very good contract|pg||
nt|athene: although it looks against the odds|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West likely to play 4@h or 3NT - North-South may not get involved at all, and certainly won't bid much at the score|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: very lucky 10 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 1nt because he doesn't think he is good enough for 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand gestures on the alerts|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very heavy 3@S there|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S, declarer won't want to draw all the trumps because he wants a heart ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: ..exept with @Slead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth and Rodwell still discussing the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told EW play "strong weak-2@S opener" so 1@S - 1nt; 2@S is a good hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the last hand of this set|pg||
nt|jtr: Few 'routine' contracts|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe 2 Aces out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thwy will be pushed there probably|pg||
nt|passell: 1100 here if dbl|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Hmapson is helping them|pg||
nt|tlc: me neither..really exciting!|pg||
nt|rv: 3@S must be showing semi-solid/solid suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 1@S - 1nt; 3@S is a very good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Philadelphia Vugraph Archives at  http://www.bridgefederation.ch/2010/wtc/index.html  courtesy of Yvan Calame|pg||
nt|dburn: they use Turbo, but the effect is the same - they will discover that there are two key cards missing if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|rv: Moss will bid 4@d here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: Fred hasn't had so much luck this set with "solid" spade suits|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least Meckstroth now has bragging rights over Zia - "you went down two in 2@h, I went down only one"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really was a question of Fred scoring 2 trump or each scoring 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 32 IMPs in 14 boards, not impossible|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: I imagine they will restart as soon as they can compare.  This is the third of four sets.|pg||
nt|algraves: east needs a third trump trick one way or another, either through the forcing game of a ruffing game|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia ducked but doesn't it seem  @HA  @D  @CA @D @D better start ??|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: Gitelman will pass here which should be forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Fred's 3@s shows solid suit and doesn't promise extras though as per knowledgable specs|pg||
nt|peachy: 2-way checkback, most likely, this one GF|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gulyas: in that case, this is almost forcing|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Michael|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asks about the 9 @C lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the end|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i lost|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the match now|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@H last train slam try?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: all my money|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i go to the bank for the 2nd round|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching back shortly|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it was a great show|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set...sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: great to watch|pg||
nt|passell: finally a good hand for Bobby Wolff he refuses to play key card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with both black suits 41 probably nothing works|pg||
nt|passell: yes for sure  but it doesnt work either|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Similar auction|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nobody doubled. Still a chance|pg||
nt|jtr: Standard Norwegian i am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes ... a chance to improve the 0|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A decent slam in norwegian. Needs S to lead diamond ace. But thereafter good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes did not lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so screen stil down|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe Traian could ask them just to play on?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i need a break... forget about them|pg||
nt|jtr: I bet|pg||
nt|passell: same auction at the other table except hamman bid 3nt instead of passing 2spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: I am told a standard Norwegian slam is where the opponents cash 2 aces then wait for their trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|jtr: I cannot myself comment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: fast play i guess|pg||
nt|tez: enjoyed a lot:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they did not bother playing it lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: back very shortly! ty Traian,our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|daman: tilt|pg||
nt|rv: maybe 5@h by Moss here with @CA and @h values|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: :(|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has 3 trumps, an A, and a possible ruff, not a bad hand|pg||
nt|tlc: so,, more IMPs to nickell,, they took the low road here and landed in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@D is a cue for spades, moss feels he hasn't really got any extras|pg||
nt|jallerton: West retains trump control|pg||
nt|me argent: they might well get to slam|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, they need to take care not to over-reach - slam certainly possible from East's point of view facing the right cards|pg||

nt|toral5: is it like murray-kehela natural?means natural system with ONLY 100 modifications.lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we start now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching the show|pg||
nt|ritong: three slams in a row can be called a show i guess|pg||
nt|daman: could be a big swing right back|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in 35 mins with the next set|pg||
nt|jallerton: another Burn's Law violation|pg||
nt|me argent: lets hope it doesnt tire him out|pg||
nt|blum1956: Padon fighting for the 12th trick successfully|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jkotor: EW traditional polish club when vulnerable, agressive strong club not vul|pg||
nt|jkotor: prec style 2@c 11-14, 5+ unbal|pg||
nt|toral5: here we go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set    4th and final 16-boards for the championship scheduled to start in about 30 min|pg||
nt|dburn: attempted by both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Nickell in front for a change|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you can set up the hearts when east wins his ace on the first round|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: this, though, could not really be called a slam|pg||
nt|athene: but what if he unsportingly ducks the first heart and returns a diamond to take the entry out|pg||
nt|algraves: 30 points and 9 @D|pg||
nt|algraves: you can see how they got too high|pg||
nt|rv: NS might have dodged slam bullet after North's pass and Meckstorth opening:)|pg||
nt|algraves: but not now with meck opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=17+ bal or 16+ unbal [upgrades allowed]|pg||
nt|norby: gitelamn pass:-)))|pg||
nt|jallerton: David will explain Burn's Law|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D suction??    @H or @S & @C      or just a transfer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Or Multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: others suggesting might be multi|pg||
nt|passell: this may save rodwell|pg||
nt|peachy: Or give an adrenalin rush to hinder thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow, Greco passed that hand in third seat!|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy for South to put his diamonds in the picture|pg||
mb|1N|nt|swanson: 5@H is a good save for N-S here but with some defense in each hand and no shortness, E-W will probably buy it for 4@S.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = nF by 90% of Polish|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like west found a gr8 @D lead to beat 3@S in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and some more thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: as u see 4 card opening in major by the norwegian pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the cards now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still no sign of making a bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just trying for a swing board, knowing Meckstroth will be right there with 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that a crime? He does not have an opener :)|pg||
nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. 1-suit   @H or @S|pg||
nt|dburn: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impossible for Rodwell to know that it's best to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: no nobody trying to cause swings in this match|pg||
nt|athene: well, passing looks a bit of a girlie action to me|pg||
nt|ritong: crime was perpetrated otherr room|pg||
nt|algraves: well that is why we are here and they are there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred put the cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thinking|pg||
nt|rv: Fred could bid 3@s here to setup GF since 3m might be non-forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: they got to 6@d after getting doubled in @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: something is wrong in paradise|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if Moss's 2@s is Inv+ or promises another bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  on the last board, if East holds up on the first @H, declarer has to guess the position to make, which Zia did|pg||
nt|norby: meck pass...lololol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck's PASS = 0-4 HCP|pg||
nt|norby: all the people want play in diamond this hand|pg||
nt|norby: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|norby: no majors pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|norby: diamond yesssssssssssss|pg||
nt|chessmaste: E/W might be in big trouble now|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|toral5: difficult for north to resist with tht hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bids are not input until the tray with the board is passed under the screen.  That way the players cannot tell the tempo of the bids from my clicking :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: correction: only 4 card in @h and 5 in @s|pg||
nt|blum1956: Other room West  opened 1@c and that was it - finally East played 5@s after the NS's 4@d-5@d|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|athene: yes - no-one can see quite why he took that view|pg||
nt|athene: east might just take 3@D as natural given the vulnerability|pg||
nt|norby: pass rodwell pleaseeeeee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is funny|pg||
nt|robinswr: you play it partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: north writes a question|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure what Meckstroth is to make of all this - 2@d showed one major, so how can West want to show both?|pg||
nt|norby: now gitelman bid 4 spades:-) lol|pg||
nt|jallerton: Meckstroth was not sure what to make of this either.|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 55 in the majors you might want to show both, because you expect partner to have lots in the one north doesn't have|pg||
nt|dburn: could be, I guess, but everyone except Moss must be sorely puzzled by the whole business|pg||
nt|jallerton: hope rather than "expect", Bill.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: he had a count at that point so isn't it 5:2 that the @DQ is with east?|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes. and apparently he dropped it|pg||
nt|rv: with 55 in reds, I much prefer 3@h or 4@h with Moss hand instead of nebulous 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west just was obviously in trouble on the discards and zia backed his table feel|pg||
nt|rv: Fred is definitely confused here trying to figure out what Moss has|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred back in the tank now|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he will eventually pass since he is not sure if 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is stil thinking|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 3@S is interesting|pg||
nt|robinswr: he couldn't beat 4hearts|pg||
nt|athene: moss is puzzled too but in a happy way|pg||
nt|norby: last hand for i meckweel is dangerous, before 7 diamond now ...........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about Fred now. Does he think partner has spades?|pg||
nt|robinswr: double pass or correct|pg||
nt|me argent: only @C lead beats 4@Ss|pg||
nt|peachy: 3D shows spades, prob max w spades?|pg||
nt|me argent: or @S lead and @C shift|pg||
nt|dburn: Multi may work better than weak two here, putting West on lead|pg||
nt|me argent: GB says its cold|pg||
nt|peachy: 3D min w spades|pg||
nt|blum1956: What is the reason for North to write any questions&|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Mildred Breed|pg||
nt|blum1956: ?|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi everyone |pg||
nt|blum1956: hi Mildred|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I cannot see what was written, but I assume it was a question on the alerts :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: he knows rodwell is 5-5 in majors|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of situation is why the english bridge authorities don't like you passing a multi-2@D opener|pg||
nt|jallerton: and South will have been told that by West |pg||
nt|me argent: shows what i know|pg||
nt|dburn: but this West doesn't seem the sort you want on lead - that's a good shot|pg||
nt|me argent: in practice @C lead does the job|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher in the tank|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: besides, it makes:)|pg||
nt|athene: most would play that as showing a top honour, for the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bingo|pg||
nt|dburn: usually "don't lead a spade"|pg||
nt|athene: yes it means that if he has bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i heard meckwell had trouble with final board of last set too|pg||
nt|dburn: he has enough entries to establish a long heart and keep control|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe the fifth heart provides a parking place for one club, then just lose a spadediamond and club|pg||
nt|dburn: but there are other ways to play, of course|pg||
nt|ewj: well he might want to know what 2@D was to work out what his partner's double was?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if only 5@c West will have a 4-card major|pg||
nt|algraves: I think they play double dont lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought anti-lead doubles only applied from a player who has actually bid the suit though|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's double of 3@s says don't lead @s, normally he should have a good alternate lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will go to the break with a realy close match|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he pscyhed double thinking opps could have a slam after 3rd seat Meckstorth opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Martens did the right thing|pg||
nt|jkotor: yup, with 4@d-5@c -> 1@d, unless they play different than others|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are starting with board 16 and playing 14 boards this session|pg||
nt|toral5: 4 losers in this game.so we begin with a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Robin Barker|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and David Edwin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|norby: pass of gitelman is strange, sure 6 cards in heart of partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was just 1 trick|pg||
nt|dburn: this might even be a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2|pg||
nt|dburn: one of the stranger ones, to be sure|pg||
nt|passell: great pass by fred  it created this monster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is just what Israel needs|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes probably|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: good evening Roland  and everone|pg||
nt|norby: not possible 6 spades because rodwell explain at gitelman 5-5- majors....so...|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess if South continues clubs, it might be down five|pg||
pc|h7|nt|norby: but now is normal the double|pg||
nt|passell: maybe a spectacular push|pg||
nt|jkotor: pass is throwing points away...|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess there were no red cards in the NS bidding boxes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|toral5: zimmerman must have found the @D lead to beat 3@S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will be delighted to see @DAQ opposite his side king to six|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, they are playing in the final, we are not. There must be a reason for it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|blum1956: Polish club opens 1@c with 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes, Poland did well to get them to the 5 level CR|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: trump switch looked best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fairness -- in many situations Rodwell 3@D would be Michaels for @H & @S|pg||
nt|jallerton: from Fred's point of view, double might persuade them to run to the suit breaking more evenly|pg||
nt|blum1956: Natural methods allowed to bluff out opponent's suit on this board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|toral5: in the other room|pg||
nt|jkotor: which one, and what would be the result? :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: The reason you are not in the final. Roland, is that you did not enter the event!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: in CR 3@S played in S and killing defense: @d( to K - and duck!|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: killing @D lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably wandering how not to loose a trump|pg||
nt|peachy: second trumps seemed unnecessary|pg||
nt|dburn: now, he no longer has enough entries to establish a heart and keep control|pg||
nt|me argent: like i said @C lead did the job|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rmb1: How strong was 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: too late now|pg||
nt|ady: but still down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|ady: might have tone down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: glasses as well on the table|pg||
nt|ady: in fact  as pointed out   still in time   trump now   and overruff table and 2nd trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman stil thinking|pg||
pc|s7|nt|toral5: in 1 way helness wd be hapy to see @H 9/10 at trick 1.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: One of the reasons, indeed|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|swanson: With all suits breaking well declarer will have no problem.  |pg||
nt|ady: very reluctant to play a trump|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jkotor: if @d 4-1, he would ruff one|pg||
nt|rv: many play anti-lead doubles applies to both sides of partnership after one of them has bid suit|pg||
nt|rv: thanks all|pg||
nt|algraves: well that was some action filled bridge to say the least|pg||
nt|athene: odd auction in the other room - does anyone know what 3@S was?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all... see you soon for the second set|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Traian and last he made an error was in 1987|pg||
nt|algraves: no this is the well known meckwell and the great young Israeli pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 2n with East hand showing @C+@h split range?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it's the sixth heart that stopped him, rather than being so weak|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth|pg||
nt|algraves: EW have 8 tricks in  @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell-Meck in 6@s|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 6@h on 16 was a particularly good contract, any more than it is here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: now north needs a support re-redouble :)|pg||
nt|norby: i prefere 1 hearts with 6 heart, if 6 diamond and 5 heart better bid 2 suiter|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstroth certainly chose winning bid especially with Rodwell having other 2 suits:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
nt|athene: not so useful when south has denied five spades though|pg||
nt|norby: sorry 6 club and 5 heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no one steals from West|pg||
nt|algraves: we are finding out what system they play|pg||
nt|athene: east's choice of rebid suggests it was indeed the sixth heart he was thinking about when he bid 1@H rather than 2nt|pg||
nt|rv: does 1@s substitute for supp X with north hand?|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to get that sixth heart into it - he might bid clubs later maybe if it seems like a good idea i suppose|pg||
nt|norby: stron hand only|pg||
nt|norby: strong|pg||
nt|algraves: he is 4333 and doesnt want to encourage anything|pg||
nt|algraves: A lot of bidding around Rodwell|pg||
nt|algraves: with the best hand at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod thinking now|pg||
nt|athene: he might raise hearts now|pg||
nt|algraves: I think XX showed exactly 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: is Greco's 2@s conventional if Hampson didn''t show 3@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: was not alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you want to be in slam 6@D is better than 6@S because of the lesser risk of a ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D with 5@S is new animal for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: North opened 2@D (multi) in CR, almost forced EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 22 hcp 3NT  CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yuval Yener and David Burn|pg||
nt|athene: well, 2@S says he wants to compete but he is known to have only four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so logically he must be prepared for north to pull to 3minor|pg||
nt|athene: i expected 3@H from west but he doesn't mess about :)|pg||
nt|rv: normally Rodwell gives allowance for Meckstorth's aggressive bids, this time he doesn't|pg||
nt|pelu: no EW bidding - lead @d|pg||
nt|algraves: well it is just standard 2 over 1, not a diamond raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess the 3@C bid will make you guess the spades|pg||
nt|peachy: N might make one try|pg||
nt|me argent: south took control in the CR to disaterous effect|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is considering now|pg||
nt|peachy: Other room had a GF 3H rebid (assume GF) which made South overextend|pg||
nt|me argent: if north takes control they should avoid slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovski in the tank at the moment|pg||
nt|dburn: in the other room, declarer got what appeared to be a friendly @d10 lead to the jack, queen and king|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzta: more imps now for nickel|pg||
nt|dburn: except perhaps East, who thinks his partner might have something|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW plays 2/1 with transfers in responses over 1@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|mildredb: best start, for sure|pg||
pc|s9|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: so this plays well with the friendly hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing too fancy|pg||
nt|kareno: David, you know my feelings on the subject - you must get in the auction when it is appropriate and this time \i feel it is definitely appropriate :)|pg||
nt|tlc: and the friendly clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: probably 9 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asking about leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably too much action|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks like quite a lot of bidding|pg||
nt|algraves: yes exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodwell didn't open the Greco hand|pg||
nt|algraves: no reason particularly to guess spades in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Nickell seems to thrive if they are 40 behind. So maybe a slam swing here will be useful :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D better that 6@S - risk in 6@s a @D-ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: so, he played @sA and ruffed a spade - overruffed, and West cashed his ace|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves: for sure 8|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: this is where you are supposed to run the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play israeli standard souped up no doubt which is a straight forward natural approach |pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
nt|algraves: undoubtedly very good card players and fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks that 5d was prefered in the closed as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco doubled in a flash|pg||
nt|pelu: but also a @S ruff could be setup with 3 @s and @DA on same hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but a lesser risk|pg||
nt|dburn: now, was that [a] bad luck or [b] bad play?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he can make it if they don't lead a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|rv: this is 2 down on accurate defense even after this lead|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is definitely better|pg||
nt|peachy: Once teo keys are missing, should not be in slam|pg||
nt|peachy: two |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: did have 2 hearts  1 spade   and K@D on 3rd heart   but not now|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead, Israel has a chance here|pg||
nt|me argent: north was Q bidding in a situation that KCBW would have worked better|pg||
nt|me argent: declarer aint making this hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: but maybe the auction indicated a club lead - not sure exactly what the later rounds meant, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance for a swing from the word go|pg||
nt|rv: defense should get 3@cs and 2@h if they can shift to @h in time|pg||
nt|algraves: So Meck is playing with a lot of information but it wont help him much|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell making a comment about the tray being slow coming back|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Rodwell played Meck for more since he didn't bid 2@h or 2n in first round|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows the spades and the diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think unhappy with something|pg||
nt|algraves: so they stop off a key card and the trump q very disciplined|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
nt|norby: strange double of greco, probabily understimate rodwell?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just impressed they knew what was trump|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|blum1956: That is the best NS could achieve - 3NT defence against the 4@s game|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|nt|dburn: or, of course, not play on hearts at all - although I am not quite sure why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell thinking north took a long time to pass 4@H and that influenced the double?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think so|pg||
nt|norby: i think also with 5 hearts and 8 club:-))) |pg||
nt|pelu: S know rhey are missing 1Ace and @SQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: yes he needed to judge between under-estimating Rodwell to over-estimating Meckstorth:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|c8|nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost impossible to over-estimate meckstroth's aggression|pg||
nt|norby: sorry for my italenglish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only my Spanish/Italian was half as good as your English|pg||
nt|rv: np Norby, message (bridge language) is very clear:)|pg||
nt|norby: ty:-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco in the tank now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: have to say 3NT   ambitious  in CR    but came home|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he won't make it|pg||
nt|algraves: well he wont make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: may be ducking the spade was wiser|pg||
nt|rv: now @s back best|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: since he took the diamond with ace, he might need to finesse for the club jack. just as long as he does not give trick to HK|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|me argent: north sees 26 cards he aint making this|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the system card of NS|pg||
nt|peachy: even no finesse, J club drops|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still studying the system card of NS|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzta: I have lost the cards :(|pg||

nt|toral5: praying that becker doesnt have @C 10 and single @S|pg||
nt|algraves: open cards now for Hampsom as they say|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid panicking and trying to cash clubs out, but it does all come down to the eight and nine|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: East thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: thinking what to discard from dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks normal to pitch a diamond and play @HAx hoping for another trick somewhere|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: but there will be a 2nd discard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me remind specs that the Nickell team came back from 40 IMPs down with 8 boards to go the other day, so nothing is decided|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DJ lead and small from East the safeplay is to finess in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They won the last 8 boards 47-0!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jkotor: with blocking @c@c|pg||
nt|peachy: Israel might get couple IMPs if they get 11 tricks instead of ten|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher in the tank now|pg||
nt|peachy: heart lead would have virtually guaranteed 2 down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzta: lets see now|pg||

pc|s8|nt|toral5: @D 9 cant be promoted cos north has a 4th @S pitch on @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you giving odds  and/or imps??|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||

nt|rmb1: Declarer has to win and hope @D are stopped|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment he is thinking|pg||
nt|me argent: it will be interesting to see how NS play from here there first 4 boards from their point of view have been disasterous|pg||
nt|peachy: could have tried to swindle, ruff spade, small diam from dummy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: better to duck with @dK|pg||
nt|algraves: well so he can try and ruff a spade|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: closed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves: so meckwell defend accurately and of course Greco settles for his contracdt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: but what is 1 trick between the true friends !|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs some more|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good NS result next door|pg||

nt|tlc: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will play in 3NT of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: do they know how to be in front feels|pg||
nt|rv: Both Wolfson and Nickell played only 1 set each (25% of boards) each in semis|pg||
nt|norby: i dont like 2 nt with 2 small heart......difference style|pg||
nt|peachy: lively hands so far,  keep the juniors busy|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|odysseus69: i have to admit to  strong bias in favour of Wolfson and hope i have arrived in time to see a late rally|pg||
nt|jtr: not the start needed by Wolfson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+   EW get to choose which minor to open when 4@c & 4@D|pg||
nt|me argent: east to see EW in slam|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least now they have started doubling 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: and the hand lies relatively well for declarer so he will make it easily enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|norby: never the dummy have king second or q third?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco asking about 3c bid.. Rod writing explanations at the moment|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: lool|pg||
nt|peachy: LOL|pg||
mb|2S|nt|algraves: not today, maybe tomorrow or maybe yesterday, but never today|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: yap, very good 3nt by Chechs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aww....|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate position in hearts    though always a good chance if 10@H is with west|pg||
nt|athene: i like 3@D over 3@H - when opps have spades, all other suits rank the same|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010nonJuniorPhiladelphia/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf   for Meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: i mean 3@D rather than 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H decent sac vs making 5@s|pg||
nt|me argent: fay might have been better off showing what he has rather that what he hasnt|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is surely looking for a 4@D bid from his pd|pg||
nt|me argent: good to have partner involved|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm not fond of 3H, apparent LR spades.|pg||
nt|blum1956: will West find a diamond lead?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|toral5: 2nt by east will be natural here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: incase he decides to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
nt|athene: from a lead point of view, a diamond lead is less likely to cost than a heart too|pg||
nt|me argent: q bid shmoo bid at this vul show your 2nd suit get your oxe involved|pg||
nt|peachy: should have better trumps, four for starters|pg||
mb|3S|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a X in East - but only if pd has a 5 card suit :)|pg||
nt|norby: forgive me but i comment both bad and good think of players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H may bypass equal/longer @D in 1-bid hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: So far the deals have been good for the leading team - little chance of a swing|pg||
nt|algraves: he can guess the clubs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar asked : normal stayman auction, answer yes|pg||
nt|algraves: but only two will still see him home 3 in each red , 2 clubs and a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of that may be obvious but i think it is good to reenforce inferences for many of the spectators|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: he might have 2NT available to show a raise with four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 3 NT looks quite normal,,but i cant see 9 trciks|pg||
nt|udo: after @S lead|pg||
nt|udo: a,i see, @H  come in|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, a @d to the Ace then @hs|pg||
nt|ritong: i wonder what 1@s 2@h double means|pg||
nt|hedyg: what would you bid Raija?|pg||
nt|dburn: it shows the minors and denies spades, would be my guess|pg||
nt|peachy: instead of 3H, either Dbl or 2S|pg||
nt|ritong: or any hand without a good bid available|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Lucky @d break in an odd way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well if he finds the diamond position he just plays on hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as usual I am last of 3 at typing|pg||
nt|udo: this @D break has its advantage,,u see  first round there is no future|pg||
nt|mildredb: takes @D lead to hold to 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: South alerted the 2 nt bid, however north did not|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: 5@c seems OK|pg||
nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
nt|algraves: some how it is always hard for the defense to hold these to 9 tricks |pg||
pc|h9|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|algraves: well they the full 20 for their slam try auction|pg||
nt|rv: I am told that it used to that each player needs to play 33% of boards in finals till recently, of late rules have changed and it is 33% of cumulative boards across all k/o matches|pg||
nt|dburn: if 3@h is a three-card limit raise in spades, then 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: agree David, denies @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is gf so not really necessary to alert 2NT i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: once you are gf you stay gf|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly David, they may have another bid on card to show 4-card limit raise|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i lefy CR after a club lead- Rosenberg was in deep thought|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact he may get home even if @ds are 4-2|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|algraves: so he guessses clubs straight away|pg||
nt|tlc: he still has to guess whether to drop the doubleton K or to pin the 9 tho|pg||
nt|algraves: so no he has 9 with spades still to be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes last set... and the table was slow...this set looks like flying|pg||
nt|algraves: well, he wont go wrong there east could have Q9xx|pg||
nt|tlc: for 3 club tricks anyway..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/ronpa-gino.pdf  for E-W's convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably knows i said the table is flying|pg||
nt|figo: great|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 1 imp match at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east stil in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asked for the screen to come down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking rodwell stuff...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now screen back up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ron Pachtman is the faster of the two. Ginossar has his tanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: having a drink now....does not look in a hurry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Live video streaming in this set is from the closed room of the playoff match|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like pass over 5@H is taken as forcing here|pg||
nt|dburn: these days everyone has, as Paul Simon might have put it, fifty ways to raise your partner|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: That is certainly part of our job, being educational|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: You don't know if N-S have a fit|pg||
nt|toral5: yes and almost as gud as 0-3/4 hcps|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Roland - absolut normal to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C better than 5@D as 2nd spade ruff with 10@C holds|pg||
nt|rmb1: This has play, take two ruffs and draw trumps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: the Rosenblum and McConnell teams are playing the same boards, ostensibly at the same time, but the Rosenblum Teams play 15 boards a session and the McConnell 16 boards|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|algraves: i mean the opps have 27 - 29 hcp , everything is breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: McConnell = women's event|pg||
nt|jtr: As long as they cant cash the @d and a @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 6@s looks like the least Fay could bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: The diamond lead could cause a problem for the declarer giving the significant weight tj the plan: cash two spades and try for hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|mildredb: @D shift now might prevent S from taking @S finesse before taking pitches|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|jtr: and the @hs behave of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now the surprise|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves: now meckstroth wants to play the next club from hand in case west has K9x|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jkotor: IMO he can double for T/O, @h jump will correct to NT|pg||
nt|dburn: this is presumably because the women have time for 16 boards in two and a half hours, while the men can manage only about 11|pg||
nt|algraves: so Zia is down now, he had to guess the @C to make|pg||
nt|me argent: that east hand looks like a 2@S bid to me albeit a little heavy my partners are not shy about bidding vul games|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Live VG theatre with Live comments on http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  Credit to Mila Antonova :)|pg||
nt|dburn: if pass was forcing, then East should have doubled 5@h (in fact, East should probably have doubled 5@h anyway)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: not plain sailing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness-Helgemo vs Pachtman-Ginossar|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|nt|algraves: so an imp riding on Rodwells play of trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|swanson: Pass is possible because 1@C is forcing, but that is far from a guarantee that North will find it easier to describe his hand later.|pg||
nt|ady: needs care|pg||
nt|me argent: west was always bidding slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: well 4@c must have been slammish so pass over 5@H surely forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: (whether he meant it as such or not)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
pc|s4|nt|algraves: routine wash|pg||
pc|sA|nt|toral5: thank god strul doesnt have a trump now:)|pg||

nt|kareno: Pop up squeeze in preparation perhaps.  |pg||
nt|udo: didnt even test @D:)=|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: They will let the men play 16 boards per set in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|algraves: he was worried about qT8x with east|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: west better to duck diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: if W had just wanted to play game he would have bid 4@s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Hmmm I rather think he wanted his cake and to eat it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jkotor: W is mostly weak nt, so no singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and meckstroth going down in 3@D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: Hoping to test the @hs bfore @ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's questionable whether Zia played the clubs with the odds|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|othered1: 4@S NS normal and on @D lead needs @S pickup|pg||
mb|p!|nt|sybarra: looks farily straight forward to get the 4 @S and make |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: North can raise if south promises 6@S, not a uinversal treatment, or bid a forcing 2N, if their methods allow.|pg||

nt|sybarra: now is 3 @S forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but N has a moose|pg||
nt|othered1: 2/1 GF, I think|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: without a @D lead, they can make 6 @S |pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Wonder if 2@S denied @H length?|pg||
nt|othered1: that can be a matter of style, even in 2/1, whatever that is.|pg||

nt|ady: was not straaight forward    |pg||
nt|algraves: and it is now increasingly ancient history|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east writing an explanation while south whispers with west|pg||
nt|hedyg: X= @s + another|pg||
nt|mildredb: what is the convention name, Hedy?|pg||
nt|blum1956: According to the CoC NE are right, SW wrong|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|hedyg: 6@s only -3|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c was an attempt to get his partner to cuebid diamonds, so it wasn't that stupid|pg||
nt|hedyg: no idea :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: may be end|pg||
nt|jkotor: just have to jump|pg||
nt|udo: some specs point out ,hamman hates @D s,,,:)) so maybe therefore @h-play|pg||
nt|dburn: it didn't work very well, because he forgot to shoot North at the same time as he bid 4@c|pg||
nt|mildredb: I've never played vs that before|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: now 3@h - 3NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh sorry  they're still playing  19    i should have checked my source :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: i hate to disagree with you Joey, but i am sure he was fishing for a @d cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL David|pg||
nt|dburn: this 6@h is far from awful, though|pg||
nt|me argent: did he think at the prevailing vul he wasgoing to have a quiet auction with no interference?|pg||
nt|peachy: A new suit by opener prob should be cue with hearts, I would have like a cue better than 4H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chiu took 4s card out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but put it back|pg||
nt|peachy: Well he does have two side suits controlled, awith known 9-card trump fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Game is iffy to bid here after 1NT.  Hamman can show a good spade hand by bidding at the three level over Zia's xfer, but will Zia go on?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some might have passed with Zia's hand - Hamman will smile|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe 3@d :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think North will stop below game whatever South does|pg||
nt|swanson: How big can his smile be, though?|pg||
nt|jkotor: "i d like, but i m affraid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: simple straight bidding in the other room cos north passed|pg||
nt|algraves: and he guessed wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least Joey will approve of 5@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: messages from specs coming in :) "Granovetter" "Lionel"|pg||
nt|blum1956: What is 3@d? Could it be NF?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C was 100% game force|pg||
nt|pelu: opening 1D and the D from N very informativ - for decl - again pass works best :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he would have bid 5@D over 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: zia-hamman started very well this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: well predicted|pg||
nt|yuval10: big result to Wolfson in the CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are thinking for 10 mins and then they arte throwing the cards on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT forces 3@C, unless doubler is strong, then he ignores the transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Oshri speaks with south|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jkotor: seems like second transfer|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@H is a retransfer.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H may be re-transfer|pg||
nt|tlc: well done to get to the cold (albeit lucky) 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: this game is cold even if N would find the very inspired K@c lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't|pg||
nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what Ginossar intended to do if Pachtman had actually bid 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: after N opened 2@s, it seem illogical to finesse to the T in that suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: in @h rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: good players tend not to open weak 2's with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asked earlier for the session times to be changed and it seems the wish was granted|pg||
nt|algraves: well it seems he wants to get on @H straight away and if they are good for 5 tricks, then just give up a @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play Lebensohl by a passed hand then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing much to think about here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: can i tell him?|pg||
nt|algraves: anything but hearts from the top is illogical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you must tell him in Hebrew, Traian. Is that a challenge?|pg||
nt|algraves: my Hebrew is weak but I can call a lifeline|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: huge for me....i do speak the language|pg||
nt|rv: 2@C is fourth suit game force (FSGF)|pg||
nt|mildredb: this is what Israel needed, tho|pg||
nt|blum1956: If 3@d were NF, I would have passed North's hand immediately|pg||
nt|davidb: i JUST ENTERED .was playing mixed  teams /|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: cant Zia ruff a 2nd spade with 10C   and draw trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking now|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry S bid 3@D over 3@C and down 1 -50|pg||
nt|me argent: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow Joey!|pg||
nt|dburn: correct play for one lose with this trump suit is ace and another, not two finesses|pg||
nt|dburn: but if you're going to take two finesses, for pity's sake don't lead the queen for the first one|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not sure.  We knew where @CJ was|pg||
nt|blum1956: hello David. How are you doing in the mixed teams?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi David|pg||
nt|davidb: hi  micael. ok  so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: north appears emotionless, but his eyes are darting rapidly|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|algraves: Greco keeping alternate contracts open|pg||
nt|norby: routine wash.-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't blame him -- slam just depends on finding trump Q  or underlead @DQ    maybe some squeeze possibilities|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Norway/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From when H&H last played internationally for Norway, and won the gold medal|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards stil on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand|pg||
nt|toral5: helness thinking of a possibility of trump promotion|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks no problems here with friendly oppo|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson 100% for NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rmb1: But he ended up playing for @CJ with West (or guessing to drop @CJx with East)|pg||
nt|algraves: well good practical shot by hamman, he knows he is stuck|pg||
nt|algraves: cowardly not to bid it really and he is anything if not fearless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if misguess @HQ   does @S return kill a double squeeze?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|toral5: incase helgemo raised with aq|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL I have about six words of Hebrew|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, at this point it looks like a final between Diamond and Nickell, but still time for their opponents to come back|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves: not comletely cold form Greco point of view and moreover an imp here or there can decide match|pg||
nt|algraves: so he wants 9 and then more than 9|pg||
nt|norby: the bidding 3nt is 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|norby: in this case 4-2-5-2|pg||
nt|norby: 2nt is relais with stop in club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no 100% line. He doesn't know that diamonds come in|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the cameraman trying to film greco's card..but they are folded under the table lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: greco's cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, he would just set up the missing tricks in spades|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Greco will start with @SK and if ducked will shift his attention to @h suit?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: specs have answered full spectrum    no, yes, maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|algraves: well there is always Q lies over the J|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|algraves: that is an old rubber bridge saying as when the cards are scooped up sometimes the tricks stay in the old order for the next deal|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: Jim types faster as well as commentating better|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: too fast for me :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hand shown|pg||
nt|rv: so much for my prediction:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: You can call Yuval, he is nearby|pg||
pc|d4|nt|swanson: A heart lead would have defeated 4@H because the discard must be taken immediatly - the East can ruff the third round.|pg||
nt|rmb1: East must play a diamond now as the defence's only source of tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rmb1: Enough for five tricks?  I am asked.  Declarer has entry problems, may not get to enjoy the spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: can transfer any message via juniors' friends, which are also playing at the same time the world championship for juniors' teams|pg||
nt|algraves: so Rodwell will switch to clubs and hold this to three|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i missed the NOT...i do not speak the language|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then I am not sure you qualify as our operator :)|pg||
nt|algraves: this may be a long set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck said sorry.. and he is taking his ahare of the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manual for Vugraph Operators, page 17, paragraph 5, lines 8 and 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: share|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps west will help meck out and just claim ...|pg||
nt|algraves: I have thought that some variation of the chess clock principle but where it applies to total team time at all 4 seats|pg||
nt|algraves: not including system explanantions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: funny enough the director kept last set the exact time of each pair|pg||
nt|algraves: so you have a total team time of say 2hrs|pg||
nt|tlc: If Joey were the Operator, could he just yell NEXT at the appropriate time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now..who want to know the result?|pg||
nt|algraves: so that takes into account that NS and EW may have much different problems|pg||
nt|algraves: and if you have a very fast pair , well that helps if you have a very slow pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes and greco-hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: and vice versa|pg||
nt|algraves: so after you play you hit the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess you could only do it during the play|pg||
nt|algraves: but that would be a big help|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@c discard looks logical|pg||
nt|kareno: Many years ago, when he was sstill a student at MIT, I asked Mark Feldman what he was thinking about on every bid and play.  He told me he was reviewing every hand he had ever ...|pg||
nt|kareno: played for solutions.  And he was serious!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he will play spades|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tlc: will be surprised if the @C queen isnt played as well|pg||
nt|peachy: oh dear|pg||
pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: this is exactly the type of board you want when sitting on a lead|pg||
nt|norby: i like diamond and diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: now off if he doesnt get the @cs right|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should have listened to David|pg||
nt|blum1956: North should have ducked the first spade to avoid a huge defeat|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|algraves: yes best not to make predictions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No danger any more as @HA is an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all laughing now....|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is exactly why he said NOT to play Q@H if you want to doublefinesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director at the table|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|ady: lot of talk from specks   about hand 19     Zia played high trump early from hand  -  maybe better to not touch trumps early   A@S   and ruff a spade  and then diamond finesse   ...|pg||
nt|ady: and if tghe play goes the same way   diamond back   ruff another spade with 10C    then has ace and another club to draw trumps  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Rosenberg made 3NT on 19 - |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|algraves: so his sequence of cards suggests 6 to QJ98|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|vugraphzta: Helness said TOUGH TO BEAT and all laughed|pg||
nt|algraves: and percentage is low to King for singleton Q|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Live streaming video will be back for the final tomorrow. 4 segments of 16 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland   newer ACBL CC available from 2010 Team Trials under  www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|algraves: Zia may not have to play them at all with this line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss in 7@H!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to John Stewart|pg||
nt|stewball: hi all|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cool feature, hope you agree|pg||
nt|algraves: so he will make 5 |pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|d2|nt|rmb1: I know @C6 is an entry but he has to knock out @CJ and @SA first,|pg||
nt|algraves: so rodwell has no losing play and declarer should claim 3|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rmb1: I think East had to play @H when in with @CJ|pg||
nt|algraves: this shows the " power of the closed hand" in that defense had very hard time discarding on this |pg||
nt|norby: before he is waiting to see if the jack of diamond drops and after play spades|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|blum1956: the current plan also works|pg||
nt|mildredb: if he exits w/ @C Q or 9, he'll hold to -1|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|stewball: Moss in 7 in the other room|pg||
nt|pelu: so 17 IMP on stake here|pg||
mc|8|nt|algraves: and running long suit in NT|pg||
nt|mildredb: -1 is great for north|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: 30 imps in not many boards|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Nickell led @SK at trick  so Diamond knew to hold on to all his spades|pg||

nt|mildredb: well played|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: For various reasons, H&H have not played for Norway since 2007, and it's not because they don't qualify|pg||
nt|pelu: in all 4 matches the total IMP-swing is 20!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||
nt|toral5: i think fireworks are reserved for the last 2 sets|pg||
nt|algraves: so 3 rounds of @D , if no J then switch to @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's there and I think he can|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: odds are lengthening against Nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: this hand does not play well for NS in anything and they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|hedyg: so director declared -1?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|rmb1: Reminiscent of the closing boards yesterday when Nickell score 47IMPs in 7 boards to win by approx. 5|pg||
nt|dburn: the point about not playing the queen if you intend to finesse twice is that if the next hand shows out, you will reflect that you should perhaps have run the six or the seven ...|pg||
nt|dburn: instead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: do HH play 2@H here as natural or @S raise?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT rebid suggesting more than an opening NT, 18-19|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok pls let us know his decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Chiu protested|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: another good board for leaders|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: That was a big blow - 4@S is far from certain to be bid even if North opens 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia writes a maximum with 3 spades|pg||
nt|jkotor: Max, with HHx@s?|pg||
nt|algraves: now Pachtman has a decision about wether to re open|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: 2@H would be a good spade raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Redouble is 9+ hcp|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness said aha nice |pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  aggressive   partner balancing|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not the South is interested|pg||
nt|yuval10: X over NT for EW means @s and suit, as we learned yesterday, and W would never dream of bidding it with such a horrible suits|pg||
nt|kareno: Lucky Rodwell \:)|pg||
nt|algraves: best defense is 500 against 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Pachtman thinking THESE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM US|pg||
nt|algraves: but west may remove double to 2!|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S |pg||
nt|tlc: same auction to this point in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves: so practically speaking best to collect undertricks at 100 per|pg||
nt|rv: playing std 2/1, Rodwell's hand would be considered too strong for splinter (10-12 is preferred range), playing precision 13-15 makes more sense|pg||
nt|rv: Meck's 4@s is kickback asking for keys|pg||
nt|rv: they play suit above agreed suit as RKC at 4 level:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|algraves: anyone balance out there with double?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|algraves: nope discretion the better part of valour|pg||
nt|tlc: at MPs maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously Rodwell intended to pass any response but this is the one he really hoped to hear I would guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 2NT probably shows a maximum spade hand with two honor and three cards in spades.|pg||
nt|toral5: should he hook @H here?|pg||
nt|stewball: here's trick 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  carding  upside-down count & attitude   Smith not mentioned|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: rod could have KQJx/Jxxx/K/KQJx|pg||
nt|rv: 5@d must be asking for specific kings, 5@C would be trump queen ask which Meck has  in any case|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least no one was in 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said i will be back|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: right on Karen|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Routine here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 easy tricks - no options for anything else|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is routine hand . on the Last hand our world champion suggest 3 rounds @D then 4th @D if no Jack as the 8 of @C a strong card|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's jump to 6@h shows no kings|pg||
nt|norby: good bidding , easy and effective|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck saying TOO MANY KINGS|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5dia asks 0 or 3|pg||
nt|algraves: then you can wait with many options|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rd was asking for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 5d|pg||
nt|algraves: imp riding on the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|norby: probabily 4 spades is ask for aces.......|pg||
nt|algraves: no only 6 always|pg||
nt|norby: and 4nt is 3 aces|pg||
nt|algraves: so no further problems here to make at least 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: why 3@h now if anyway 3nt?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you have to say, this is a bit of a silly contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: needs to guess the red finesse|pg||
nt|stewball: and @s will be 9|pg||
nt|blum1956: It seems South thinks North has a strong hand. |pg||
nt|mildredb: south was aggressive w/ the 2NT call as was north w/ the 3NT call|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: st looks at his opps convention card before leading|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: south looks :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: can come by 7 tricks, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I meant Oshri looks at south's convention card|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: noone can explain what happened here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, North has implied majors too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rodwell could have been 4450, no reason to re-open|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell went to the bathroom|pg||
pc|d7|nt|algraves: well sometimes they are in big trouble and you have more high cards than they do. so you might get a penalty or a partscore swing|pg||
nt|robinswr: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|norby: of course 0 or 3|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|norby: but meck think or hope 3:-))|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would think 5sp asks for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: mack : i am making six ...just looking for the other trick|pg||
nt|norby: better when trumps is hearts play rkcb at 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: request for link to video please|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did you win your 2nd division match tonight, Victor? If so, you did better than England vs Montenegro|pg||

pc|s2|nt|mildredb: @S to T now?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|swanson: This sequence would seem to offer a choice of games with emphasis on spades (rather than a direct 3NT over 2NT).|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess down the middle is to pass it out|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: the North hand isn't strong enough for 3N=slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia is impassive|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer has to guess which red suit finesse to take.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|jkotor: friend is telling me J@h, if no K, then kill it take @s, and finesse @d|pg||

nt|dburn: the Director may well take the view that anyone who took the danger play of running the queen of hearts would not take the safety play of  cashing the ace of clubs|pg||

nt|yuval10: T@c for @s, very good|pg||

nt|norby: kickback is convention at 4 spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Now even 47-0 isn't enough, on the other hand, they have more boards to get the missing IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: According to the Rule of 15, Helness has an opener. HCP + spades must add up to at least 15 if you go by Pesrson's Rule|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Pearson's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S   looks 1 over the top |pg||

nt|udo: yes, with all finesses wrong looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: The try looks dubious facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the good old days this would have been a passout. 12 aceless 4333 was no opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1892|pg||

pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: On a serious note, it is no crime to pass the East hand in 1st vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|udo: maybe that lead helps in @c, but still down , imo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i lost the play... i had to close the screen|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think they lead the 10 from this holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Ginossar went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and i had to protect the screen|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|yuval10: might've played @d to the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky zia claimed quickly 2 down|pg||
nt|udo: since the round of last 16,,when u go to restroom, u get an bodyguard:))|pg||
nt|jtr: A couple of singles passed the slips for Wolfson|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all of those weaned on weak nt would not consider a move over 2 spades- |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west is back now|pg||
nt|udo: playing weak NT it goes prob. 1NT pass pass pass|pg||
nt|rv: here Hampson's X shows primary @c+@hs possibly, 2n would have primary @cs+@ds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: Back now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: on the surface e-w cards look good for 4 hearts - but the 4-1 trump break means curtains - kind of game everyone is bidding|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|algraves: Yes I guess it is possible to misquess diamonds if west plays low and you put in ten|pg||
nt|kareno: Only way I can see making only five is with Ace and a diamond led.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 probably the right card though|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps..actually the percentage play|pg||
nt|algraves: 9|pg||
nt|rv: good stop though even this might be too high on trump shift now|pg||
nt|algraves: so even with a trump switch Hampson can guess @H for three tricks and down one losing trick in each suit|pg||
nt|athene: trump shift is very good, kills two possible tricks in dummy (ruff, @DK)|pg||
nt|norby: somepeople prefere 3 club at double over 2 spades, but double is perfect bidding for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck in the tank now|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding is revealing - they know north has something like 7411|pg||
nt|algraves: a " bad buy " as they say for Hampson|pg||
nt|rv: I like X to show @c+@hs and 2n to show @cs+@ds|pg||
nt|algraves: picture Greco with @C K and @H Q|pg||
nt|athene: if the double shows hearts and clubs, maybe south should bid 2nt, saying "i am not sure if we want to play clubs or diamonds"|pg||
nt|athene: i am just looking for ways to play 3@C rather than forcing yourself unnecessarily to 4@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: well i have a feeling they have discussed this and that 3@D is the bid that is in compliance with the partnership agreement|pg||
nt|norby: club is the best come back|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table...stil thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: while we are waiting. a lot of messages on the auction. Hampson was prepared to show a strong @C overcall|pg||
nt|stewball: it seems fred bid 7 knowing he was missing the trump Q|pg||
nt|stewball: maybe he was expecting a trump lead or hamman/zia to bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly right John -- with big lead, try to maintain parity    or so they say|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fred had a great first board when Meckwell went down in slam, so it seems a little strange that he bid the grand slam if he knew they were off @HQ|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2 down after the heart switch|pg||
pc|h7|nt|toral5: cd easily have been an ALL PASS brd:)|pg||
nt|mildredb: don't see that|pg||
pc|h9|nt|toral5: helness did wel to open here as the cards lie|pg||
nt|algraves: he was always willing to " bid it out to 4@C" looking for the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|rv: good defense|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|tlc: wins with QT or AT on, only loses to AQ|pg||
nt|mildredb: oh, can get 2nd @H ruff|pg||
nt|blum1956: A,K,ruff, @dA, heart ruff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzta: east thinking|pg||
nt|ady: if the spades were played as shown this nearly slipped through|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thinking some more|pg||
nt|rmb1: East can see cards are not good for declarer, but still anything could be the wrong thing to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is getting very impatient now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: writing notes to the cameraman...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east put the cards on the table and thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia shaking his had |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: head|pg||
nt|algraves: sorry not vul but looking for game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play again, but Zia says nasty, nasty|pg||
nt|jkotor: easy -1 now, everything clear|pg||
nt|swanson: Zia needs both club honors (3-3) to his left - with than assumption the @SK is almost certainly offside.|pg||
nt|jkotor: only chance for E is AK@c in partners hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia leads a low club to the queen and it wins|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: folks on North's double, do you prefer some form of sohl by South hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least he can't get hearts wrong as the 10 drops if he plays to the jack. No entry to dummy to get it wrong later|pg||
nt|norby: now play diamond hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: well he can play low to 9 as well|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: minor games look good|pg||
nt|swanson: That was a very quiet looking hand on which to win 10 IMPs.  BUt the Nickell team needs three more of the same.|pg||
nt|kareno: No losers in spades but are there enough winners for a grand slam?  |pg||
mb|1N|nt|jkotor: what is your call after 1@h from E?|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see how many @d's will E bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess 4|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Mecksroth took zero time to play that a guess is a guess , lets get on to the next board|pg||
nt|algraves: he probably always plays it that way|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, his partnership has little think time to spare :)|pg||
nt|udo: zia 1 @H:)|pg||

mb|3N|nt|bt: an interesting hand coming up, , can ns make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H opening is creative; not sure how many would do that|pg||

nt|davidb: nice imaginative bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2NT = @D ?|pg||
nt|kareno: Does 3@d break up their relays if anyone knows?|pg||
nt|udo: but when u have this 2 NT, thats perfect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT likely and that will go down with clubs 3-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad -- wanted to see if Hampson was going to bid 2@S or lebensohl 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: N can bid easy 3@s now|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what else?|pg||
nt|stoffers: Looks like 9 tricks in either @h or @s here, even only 8 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they make 3?|pg||
nt|bt: helgemo has a tough choice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||

nt|yuval10: then S can cuebid and show his great hand against @s suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell writing a book for pachtman |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that Rodwell erred when he covered @C10. That is not correct, it does not matter. The error came when Meck tried to cash @SA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: His opener was not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|mildredb: can't make it even, if they lead singleton @C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bt: some wouldnt open the south hand, i hear :-)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble is that he might bid 2NT here with shape and little values|pg||

pc|h6|nt|tlc: surprised no 4@d cue|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5@d voidwood|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's the only reason|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 is not a bad contract without a @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and more writing...i can see 3-4 pages until now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H  2NT  ;  3NT   solid suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Fine contract, roughly 73.45%, but no luck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all roads were going to lead to 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I ubstracted a little from the 78% because Zia pre-empted|pg||
nt|pelu: but prob same contract in CR - so the % dont count :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bathroom break after this board...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bt: live by the sword ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looooooooooool|pg||
nt|algraves: in that you can save a potential heart finesse to later|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck started writing too now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jkotor: some people bid 2@h|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks if it is his lead and then plays the heart king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT 2 keycards outside diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@c now asks non @d kings, but 6@d would ask for @c help specifically|pg||
nt|algraves: east cant lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
nt|udo: work in 5 hours:)|pg||
nt|davidb: good  save vs  4m that makes|pg||
nt|athene: now they have to hurry to cash their diamond|pg||
nt|robinswr: they play all the boards (yesterday and against my team)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said SOLID OPENER|pg||
nt|blum1956: For me the North's hand is worth 2NT response|pg||
nt|mildredb: i agree|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear - what did 1@c mean?|pg||
nt|mildredb: perhaps 1NTY shows this in strong @C system, tho|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west asked for an explanation of the 1 nt bid ::)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or  Hvor er din åbningshånd, makker?|pg||
nt|bt: there is a subtle squeeze on east in pointed suit but thats after going one down already|pg||
nt|stoffers: I am surprised that one of the world's best players gets it for his light opening. I think he has played more hands than us together and have an idea of whats best in the long run. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the one you had when you opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nope... english plain|pg||
nt|stoffers: I wouldnt open, but its a border hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now...thinking|pg||
nt|bt: sorry, but i didnt hear anyone critizising|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness I mean|pg||
nt|bt: its a fact that players like meckwell make a good living on light openers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and a lot of sighs|pg||
nt|stoffers: Just 15 specs and some coments that looked like it :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|passell: no problem without trump lead|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will make |pg||
nt|yuval10: N figure up he've heared enough|pg||
nt|athene: not too tricky - danger of discards on spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yuval10: after E will fail to lead trump ( from his void ) , 3 @c ruffs will make the contract easily|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rmb1: I guess declarer loses two hearts and a diamond, but losing spade goes on a heart|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: and 6@s in the CR, so new leaders|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is surely much better than the rest of us, but that should not mean that we can't question the opening. No-one critizised him|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It works for him, fine|pg||
nt|toral5: i m sure MOST would pass souths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: dont care about the spect - they are spect and Helgemo the player :)|pg||
nt|toral5: no question of criticizing at all|pg||
nt|bt: now the other question is how to get away with light openers like this in a natural framework and no conventions, thats a mystery to me|pg||
nt|toral5: meckwell will SURELY open|pg||
nt|toral5: and so will versace:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because they judge so well and are great card players, Lars|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he gave a distinct look to the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|toral5: ya i agree they are super card players|pg||
nt|pelu: opening is the best attack - and u dont have a 2@D overcall later on 5 cards suit and vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in hand now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stoffers: so, spade is best now, but he cant shorten himself enough can he?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: again,,Meckwell flatten it|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bt: one down is good bridge they say|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I would presume that 1 @C is the Polish club|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@c Polish club|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|stoffers: But this is two down, wich isnt that good bridge :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why is it 2 down?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Virtually same difference in the other semi-final. Diamond up by 26|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe I missed something|pg||

nt|sybarra: 6 @D's makes but not sure you can ever get there (nor would you necessarly want to be there)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ed,   doubt I would with the pattern |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: ponted out to me me that E can get club ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: in 6 @D |pg||
nt|othered1: I rarely violate pattern constraints, but might here, unless I had a good rebid over 1M.  I think 2N is way too much of an underbid, given playing strength.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 nt better|pg||
nt|othered1: Playing KS, where I had a choice of forcing 3@D rebid or forcing 2@C, 1@D is easy|pg||
nt|othered1: KS = Kaplan-Sheinwold|pg||
nt|jkotor: so u agree with 2@c bid? I m always for 2NT :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|sybarra: here come the cue bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jakub|pg||
nt|othered1: This south hand is just too good for an 18-19 rebid, and I'm only rarely an upgrader|pg||
nt|sybarra: what would 4 nt be over 3 nt here?  quanti?|pg||
nt|jkotor: but I ask about Norths 2@c -> anti bridge IMO|pg||
nt|othered1: And I guess they don't play that jump rebid in opened suit over 2/1 response shows solid suit, an agreemnt many have.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they play 2 /1 Jakob|pg||
nt|othered1: Depends on what 2N shows.  I think it's light, if it's forcing.  If not, seems right out of the book.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|jkotor: this bid (2@c) was a short way to this stupid contract :)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: mmmm|pg||
nt|swanson: The problem is they won't be able to improve on the result.|pg||
nt|bt: i would think ns at the other table would bid similarily|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he asked Becker : 3 spades and 4 diamons ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: answer YES... Helnes : i can do one better|pg||
nt|ady: mis fit|pg||
nt|rmb1: Robinson need more than pushes|pg||
nt|yuval10: have to go now - thanks all and see you later!|pg||
nt|kareno: Thank you!!|pg||
nt|athene: one point worth a mention is hampson's choice of 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are gathering speed here|pg||
nt|rv: this is not Buffett Cup scoring still 1 IMP may just be crucial in final analysis:)|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a GF balanced hand it can work much better to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thats wonderful|pg||
nt|algraves: I will hire John as my lawyer and sue the rules committee|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back to play now|pg||
nt|mildredb: thx all - have to leave - enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|blum1956: thx Mildred|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: 4@d and what after 4@s?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: desperate measures- but even then 7 spades is so much|pg||
nt|algraves: you know edgar Kaplan did an exhaustive study and found that big club pairs slam bidding was better if the opponents got into your auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- rather than guessing  how's our game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 1@H-D-2H-2S maybe|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4 to zimmerman on 22, where i think 2@h is a much better bid than 1NT. Quite deserved then..:)|pg||
nt|algraves: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: in R-M precision it just shows clubs or balanced, might be only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: it is hard enough as it is|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: we can all see 7@S makes, but it is going to be very difficult even to get to six|pg||
nt|swanson: It is possible that N-S will push to a grand, knowing they are behind big time.  But the bidding is starting at a high level.  |pg||
nt|bt: 1@H-D-2@H-2@S i mean lol|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@S/5@D save in picture;but 5@H also making|pg||
nt|stoffers: will Helgemo bid 2@s?|pg||
nt|bt: well i would think so|pg||
nt|stewball: would surely corrupt the endgame|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: he just did|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: 6 at least now|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d X 4@d X at other table|pg||
nt|algraves: its like the shootout in hockey who needs it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it offers too much shooting, but maybe it is just another form of competition  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 7 card fit in all of West's suits|pg||
nt|odysseus69: laydown game on minimal values|pg||
nt|stewball: any 4@s bidders as S?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jkotor: both tables at least in 6|pg||
nt|stoffers: Note Helness double here, if he is gonna pull a 2@c bid for Geir to 2@d, it wouldnt show extras|pg||
nt|blum1956: Is East disciplined enough to pass 2@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: down 2 = 300/450|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You were wrong re 23, Lars. Brogeland passed the South cards|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a game force you should never bid 1spade over 1 heart with only four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: A big bid by Zia.  He was evidently planning to bid 4@S over 4@H.  But would that show another place to play or would it be a strong had with spades?|pg||
nt|swanson: hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double showed spades|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell 1n shows 11-13 here?|pg||
nt|stewball: i mean any other 4@s bidders:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: may be a namyat 4@C would have shut out north from entering|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jkotor: both tables in 5@d NS now :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will they know what 4NT means - time for spades now|pg||
nt|kareno: \i didn't know that.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in game now|pg||
nt|blum1956: Oshri preferes not to check|pg||
pc|h6|nt|toral5: but strul did wel to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes N opening is light in hcps|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it sure looks like an opening hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jkotor: 6@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: both|pg||
nt|swanson: This would be uncharted waters for most partnerships.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if South bids 5@S now, North may well bid 7 - no, 6@C |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not finished|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was more positive than pass- enough for Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman looking for action...asking questions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment hamman writing stuff for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|norby: yes 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|pelu: why 4@C from Zia - just to be sure that S will play the @Ss correct?|pg||
nt|dburn: getting closer, these matches - England within 17 IMPs of the Netherlands and have acquired a 1700 penalty on some as-yet-unscored deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East checks out his scorecard while waiting for the lead from south|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|swanson: Now 6@S and then 7@S?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: time for spaes now|pg||
nt|bt: aha ... lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he passed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only hopr for defence is if Zia decides to play anti-odds for K doubleton club with West - no chance really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is too flat to act|pg||
pc|dA|nt|algraves: game bidding harder|pg||
nt|rv: now defense can cash 8 black suit tricks|pg||
nt|norby: club now or never...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: surely this must be a 2-suiter  |pg||
nt|jtr: He will eliminate first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forgetting he was going to be on lead ??|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stewball: he likely assumed a 5 level decision was coming|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkotor: for a push|pg||
nt|rv: Greco's @d3 would be some form of smith echo?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: 7@S not super after the 3@D bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can establish a third club trick but no entries|pg||
nt|jtr: So losing to Kx wont matter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Jack for spade switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not yet|pg||
nt|stewball: and wanted some help|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|algraves: nice lead by greco as he reads the auction well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: last pass from Hamman was very quick- should have at least given it a thought|pg||
nt|swanson: Evidently Hamman knew how little Zia might have for the auction.  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: not good at all except that it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia unwrapped another cough drop before the dummyhit the table|pg||
nt|jkotor: what if Zia have: QJxx xxx x AQTxx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East and West get some water while Zia contemplates the hand|pg||
nt|swanson: But maybe he could hold: xxxx, Qx, x, AQJxxx?  Nothing is clear after the 3@D opening.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||
nt|swanson: He had something to say about Philadelphia also.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: contrary to popular belief in constructive auctions Zia usually has his bid - he embarks on some psychological adventures but they are the exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wouldn't W.C. Fields rather be here in Philadelphia?|pg||
nt|pelu: EW in 4@S over 4@H in CR|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S fine for me - @HK = no value opp partners singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck did bid 4@S over similar auction  [Gitelman 3@D instead of 3@H]|pg||
nt|algraves: now he knows his partner has 5@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: 4@sX|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Yes, they did get to 4@H regardless, but East 'saved'|pg||
nt|toral5: this means it wil be a small pick up for struls team|pg||
nt|norby: finesse in hearts for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: with diamonds 3-3  will make   |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Diamonds carefully from the right hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe @DA now to see if partner can overruff dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D2 must mean yes|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: but will cash diamond and exit with club      |pg||
pc|s9|nt|rv: he couldn't have possibly asked for @h continuation if they are playing rev smith echo (lo-hi in declarer's suit asks partner to continue)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not easy to calculate a number of tricks - looks like just made|pg||
nt|dburn: but this one is not so close now - on the previous deal North-South reached 5@c, and East led a sneaky jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: declarer put up the ace, hoped to avoid two trump losers, and failed|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: excellent defense|pg||
pc|dT|nt|algraves: so he cant quite handle it at this point|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|algraves: very strong result for Hampson Greco|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: I think that's what he said about dying....|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rmb1: Roland described Bocchi commentating today as a "scoop"|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he intended @d3 as asking for @c shift since @h continuation can't be right with @hAKQ9 in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did and I mean it|pg||
nt|norby: scoop??|pg||
nt|rv: Geoff possibly misread the signal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, don't you understand that word?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a compliment|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is notoriously difficult to defend if no suits have been mentioned - here we see it's even hard when the bidding has been a bit more revealing|pg||
nt|norby: of course|pg||
nt|rmb1: Oops - was private|pg||
nt|norby: like italian, same word sccoop|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bt: this a more solid 1@D ...|pg||
nt|toral5: 200?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because you know what you are talking about|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Gredo-Hampson would discuss defensive signalling on @h and @d suit in the post-mortem|pg||
mb|d!|nt|toral5: plus 200?|pg||
nt|pelu: it will double the IMP-swing for the match :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you have been there, done that|pg||
nt|rv: Greco|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|pelu: that 4@C from Zia looks desperat :)|pg||
nt|algraves: Greco was able to deduce that Hampson doubled on the sort of hand he had|pg||
nt|algraves: and led Ace of @C to keep the ruffing option open in case declarer void in @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N or make mild slam try with @D?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok slam again|pg||
nt|stewball: they should have the tools to 6@d here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: south sits back in his chair to consider the double on his right|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe a major and a minor - not sure what the Israelis play|pg||
nt|dburn: spades and another, I am told by someone who knows|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: Or KQ doubleton of hearts west |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slam even without @HQ, so Hampson will investigate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 4@sX - 1 = 200|pg||

nt|stoffers: 3@s|pg||
nt|stoffers: or rkcb |pg||
nt|ady: may get too high in spades|pg||
nt|stewball: N will show max for @ds and now S is huge|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: so 450 plus and 300 minus for strul|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: This is a great 3NT from the West side.  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: another easy game  just what Martens team wants|pg||

nt|toral5: after a long time we have a slam|pg||
nt|pelu: can Greco give super-accept?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is|pg||
nt|pelu: yes a normal accept - 2NR could be weak or strong|pg||
nt|algraves: this is not the sort of hand to play NT as you want to either ruff a @H if dummy has doubleton |pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play that 2N can also include weak 5@C & 5@D  so 3@C says  i don't like @D  3@D says I like|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|algraves: or use you trumps to ruff out black suit or suits for 12 th trick or to set up squeeze|pg||
nt|algraves: once you find the @D fit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|passell: great 7nt here  4-1 diamonds still might make on lie of the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H probably RKC @D    hmmm   4N Quant??|pg||
nt|dburn: but South was seemingly unprepared for this, and just bid what he hoped would make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rmb1: 2@D mini-roman, 4441 opening values (with @D).  |pg||
nt|pelu: I would have a problem now - we play that 3 in major now is a short suit :(|pg||
nt|algraves: of course 6NT makes as the percentage play in @H is low to Q and if it loses finesse the ten next time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D: good for diamonds - 3@c would be less fit/hand|pg||
nt|algraves: but 6@D laydown for one of the 3 good reasons to prefer the suit contract|pg||

nt|rv: I would have opened 1@h with North hand|pg||
nt|pelu: is 4Nt balanced slaminvit in @D?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bt: it is difficult bidding slam w Axxxxx opposite Kxxx when missing an ace, and asking for aces |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked if 6nt is quantitative|pg||
nt|passell: surprised w didnt bid 3diamonds first|pg||
nt|kareno: Me too - 6nt is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wofson back in the lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: bad rebid over 1nt|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|algraves: South could have made last hand if he chose to believe @D K as singleton, we leave it to you at home to work it out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: claiming and not playing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant say I admire the 2NT bid but no doubt all will be well|pg||
nt|jtr: Things lie well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Friendly lie for Zia|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like|pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: 2C alerted - maybe non-forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell gave him 12 tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: 8 red tricks 4 blacks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar to the bathroom now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: waiting for him|pg||
nt|kareno: Reminds me of the old joke, "For the first time all day we know what he has in his hand!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol...pachtman wants another trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking them about their distributions|pg||
nt|jtr: So Zia may go down:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe that is right about 4N  Peter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Greco can't have more than he has. 1NT is 14-16|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jkotor: yup, in Poland level 2 in NF|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not the way to sit on a lead |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a great slam and one has to congratulate them on bidding it|pg||
nt|bt: so helgemo detected Kxxx or so opposite|pg||
nt|bt: yes wd ns|pg||
nt|toral5: nice slam to bid|pg||
nt|toral5: i think easy for north to bid aftr hearing a nat 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jkotor: unless you play transfers, but not here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Easy?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped low    but not in best spot    assume 2@D  3 suited  but singleton unknown to west|pg||
nt|robinswr: if 2clubs asks for 4-card major hampson should bid 2spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fay in the tank|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: Nice duck|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jkotor: seems 10 back, 20 left|pg||
nt|swanson: Jassem didn't like his @DK in a club contract, but still - partner made a big bid and it is a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nly 2 cards were played and Jassem claimed 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but only 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: everyone is talking except Hamman|pg||
nt|toral5: not easy to splinter/cue?|pg||
nt|bt: it is tempting to play diamonds by north|pg||
nt|toral5: easy i meant for taking control;NOT bidding slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo showing his hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol Steve|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson likes to open 1NT , anyway it is what their partnership does and they have done pretty well I would say|pg||
nt|norby: absoluty dont like 1 nt with 5-4 majors and 2 ace second........for me is terrible but........i undestand 2 king second|pg||
nt|robinswr: he can't pass 1nt because greco would bid 1nt with 12 semi forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: he was right - it will make, but...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|blum1956: 9 tricks safe. Will the declarer try an almost sure heart finess for 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c6|nt|hedyg: it is so frustrating when you bid a suit and pd does lead it and leads your singleton instead|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rmb1: No 2@D is any 4441 - hence 2@H to play opposite @H|pg||
nt|norby: hampson play in the final and i stay in my house, so is better 1nt with 5-4 majors:-)))|pg||
nt|algraves: there is that|pg||
nt|hedyg: he probably thinks N has 4@ss and pd void|pg||
pc|h2|nt|robinswr: he upgraded to 14-16 |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson just claimed 10|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: a vindictive great shuffler would mirror the round suit distribution|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: But Zia has 8|pg||

nt|odysseus69: so 120 instead of probable 100 v 2S|pg||
nt|blum1956: I do not think 3NT was a good bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: south inquiring about north's distribution|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: board 29 will be our last one|pg||

nt|dburn: nor I, but he might just not have known how his partner would interpret some other bid|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|tlc: hard to find the 4@S sac after this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zimmerman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the women's final, China are up by 26 against the Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: hands are offering little scope for swings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond against Zimmermann of course, sorry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many will say that when Nickell came back from the dead against Martens he was destined to win the event|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know to bid 2@H with 5 card fit|pg||
nt|blum1956: It could well have led to down a number 4@h being a laydown|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: north writing to his screenmate, expaining the 3 @C bid no doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may end in 3NT    will need to play on spades for 2 tricks to make   on a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C nat forcing (inverted)|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia knows they may be pushing|pg||
nt|algraves: still a few boards to go but the Diamond team has played extremely well, all things considered as they play in their 12 th straight day|pg||
nt|algraves: perhaps they have been a little luckier but not by much and they are full value for their big lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzta: the jack is normal, Zia confirms|pg||
nt|jkotor: low @d is for the bulletin :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: and it works :)|pg||
nt|algraves: so the misdefense on 24 cost 6|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you open you have to think about your rebid and sometimes you have to open wrong to avoid a bad rebid|pg||
nt|rv: classical 3n response on 1M precision opening, showing 13-15 with 3M cog|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|blum1956: natural invitational - popular in Russia as well|pg||

pc|hA|nt|vugraphzta: rodwell had the paper in his pocket|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this really has to be a flat board- he needed to underlead the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W are not feeling so comfortable as they were early in the set - they have given back at least a couple game swings.|pg||
nt|jkotor: meckwell need swings, lets wait for their move|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 IMPs to Strul on board 23   200 + 200|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rv: showing 4333 13-15, cog|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: all laughing about Helness diamond suit|pg||
nt|ady: been asked if Zia can open 1@D  anyone know|pg||

nt|algraves: ah out of misery|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: we had|pg||
nt|algraves: so a NT partscore for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meck|pg||
nt|tlc: a kibitzer mentioned that Helness played this in 5@h and got a @H lead!  still guessed it right|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: reckon they will have cause to regret board 21  |pg||
nt|toral5: lucky i wd say|pg||
nt|algraves: he would have eventully switched to @D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: He never gets to play in his solid suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's better than 50%|pg||
nt|bt: minor suit slams are not the strength of standard systems imho|pg||
nt|rv: possibly @DT as well|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Why is that lucky?|pg||
nt|toral5: very thin 1@H here|pg||

nt|kareno: Ira Rubin used to call notrumps, "grabbits,"  first to bid them grabs them :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Zia waggled the one spade bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with very different sequence|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bt: 4@H = i have extras, hearts controlled and am interested in higher, could that be wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room is being broadcasted in the VG theatre|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so we have a lot of cameras around us|pg||
nt|stoffers: I think most top pairs wil reach 6@c on this hand. So many points and trumps together. Hard to find out its on a finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Certain symmetry.  East has AQ... in South's suit, so bids the suit that North has AQ.... and noone can bid any more|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: south has passed and west is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: and 2 cameramans|pg||
nt|blum1956: is Mroczkowski in fact thinking?|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|bt: problem w 3@S is that it is ambigious|pg||
nt|toral5: most pairs will surely land in 6@C|pg||
nt|toral5: atleast the top ones|pg||
nt|stoffers: går an å spille på ja|pg||
nt|rv: 1@C is strong @c, double by Meckstorth shows 5-8 in classical precision|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a full house - maybe he is thinking of raising the pot|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bids are not entered until the board is passed underneath the screen, so that the players cannot hear the clicking of the mouse to give them an idea of the tempo of the bidding ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Sry, that was private, meaning he COULD go down playing N for K@h and Q@s|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H by west wd have made life easy for becker i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I assume 2@H agrees clubs without 4 spades, so 3@S is not natural, is it?|pg||
nt|toral5: 6@C does have a play.he might play for a vienna coup on north|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i did not notice an alert|pg||
nt|toral5: and as the cards are the roof will fall|pg||
nt|toral5: with @S q IN|pg||
nt|bt: thats a good point, the devious 1@H may lead him wrong|pg||
nt|bt: when south has @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, a losing option|pg||
nt|toral5: and full chances to go wrong cos of THAT super thin 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: after the bidding is best chance the sueeeze when S show @DA - but will Strul play for that?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker still thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy for us to see what's right because we have all 52 cards to look at|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and stil thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hear that Kit Woolsey got it wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He played for the squeeze|pg||
nt|toral5: did kit recieve a 1@H oc?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|robinswr: 2nt opening is 19-20|pg||
nt|algraves: no big deal but note that the overcall by Hampson did not hurt their bidding gave away information|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|rv: folks who themselves play precision generally don't like to Intefere with artificial methods like CRASH/Suction against others who play precision, possibly some sympathy for ...|pg||

nt|norby: more easy after 1 heart overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: does greco have singleton heart honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell stil thinking|pg||
nt|norby: i dont understand why greco dont bidding 2 diamond.......|pg||
nt|rv: I believe Greco-Hampson play Mathe against strong @c, Hampson could have doubled to show majors|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: Discard a @H and play @H|pg||
nt|stewball: note that N didnt dbl 2@d|pg||
nt|algraves: he played Meckstroth to have 4@H and not throw the third one when dummy had only one left. he made an error|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Fay seems to think there is a real @H fit in E|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fay in the tank|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: EW had it all to themselves in that room|pg||
nt|bt: winning imps against robinson, lol|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 25 only 4 out of 8 pairs bid the fine 6@c - not top-standard :(|pg||
nt|rv: he chose to bid 1@h and hide his @s suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this will need some play|pg||
nt|jkotor: I think Cayne 14 imps behind after board 25, other Polish (Balicki-Zmudzinski) with Lauria-Versace trying hard|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are way too high - but there was little chance of stopping in time.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant make 4 spades whatever defence does|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia explaining that he can bid 1 NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is why he wiggled or waggled the 1 @S bid|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|bt: some suffer after 1@D-(1@S) when 2@C is not forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul did not play but Helgemo already preapred diamond ace for play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Woolsey opened a Precision 2@C and then North was out of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: prepared|pg||
nt|bt: what was explanation of 4NT?|pg||
nt|davidb: entry problem for finessing twice|pg||
pc|s7|nt|swanson: The lack of spade spots meant there was little play and with unfavorable diamond situation this will be down several.|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||

nt|pelu: I would X - and then play against 2@DX - making|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the open room, with all of the cameras and machinery, is much noisier than the closed room.  In the closed room, the clicking of the mouse is loud|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzta: do not know|pg||
nt|toral5: 4nt alerted as?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: it was alerted|pg||
nt|norby: with the cards of hampson i prefere bid heart and spades , like 2 club or double against club strong or PASS|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs 6  trump tricks but  not quite possible|pg||
nt|norby: is strange that me and the pair american play so different:-))))|pg||
nt|stewball: no trumps to lead and not many quick tricks|pg||
nt|blum1956: NS will hardly miss their diamond ruff, hence 3 off|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|rmb1: There are 15 boards per segment, 60 in each match.  This final segment ends with board 30|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: Pitch @d then @c|pg||
nt|rv: if you have to get in, I much prefer double to show majors|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: 3 more tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|algraves: private|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: Birman in CR did not bid 2@c, he passed but they still got to 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the trick...no kidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: we believe you :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: Oh|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toral5: becker surely dint take it as rkcb in @C in leiu of bidding 5c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe club to jack?|pg||
nt|jtr: Mind you South cant attack @ds to advanat|pg||
nt|jtr: advantage|pg||
nt|jtr: As finesses are taken into him|pg||
nt|algraves: so this reveals all to Rodwell who now knows entire shape|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|swanson: I am told that GIB says it can be made - but GIB has the hand record.|pg||
nt|kareno: Ten of hearts looked like suit preference.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|algraves: as Hampson did not continue diamond he had only one|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|bt: some wise commentators suggested 4@H, that might have simplified things, lol|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jkotor: open cards maybe could won|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|bt: playing for the squeeze in 6@C is antipercentage but if you are down to a good team maybe its good strategy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he claimed saying i cash ak of spades in q will fall i make 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: if q will fal......|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: makeas the same 6 tricks in hearts |pg||
nt|rmb1: more symmetry|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the heart queen coming down in 3 must help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm i was sure Zia decided he wanted to continue the tap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which i think leads to down 2    but don't quote me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman stil thinking|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzta: he said I am going to make and now explaining|pg||

nt|othered1: IMP scale goes to 24|pg||
nt|sybarra: have to have some hands that break their way |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Even slam down v. game making will require a huge result on final board.  |pg||
mb|2N!|mb|3C|nt|othered1: NS does have game (aces and shape are good things) with few points.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: N has to take a look at tray,  pard is passed hand and only bid 2 @S as first bid|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|othered1: It's late in the event and if north senses they're not in great position, he might push.  Pushing past 4 will be a loser|pg||

nt|toral5: is this 14 brd segment?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness said MADE 5|pg||
nt|bt: no 15brds|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had a bathroom break here|pg||
nt|algraves: so it seems the club finesse was safe at that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: very difficult for VG when in the middle of play this happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set now|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board now Traian?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to our excellent operator in Philadelphia ,Traian , great job!; great job!to my talented fellow commentators Raija Davis, David Burn and Joey Silver for donating their ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to guide us through this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will be back in 50mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well to the WBF for allowing BBO to broadcast from this prestigious event, especially to Hervé Lustman who has been instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
nt|peachy: The isreal tem has dominated this set|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all for joining and for your helpful comments and messages.we hope you enjoyed the show. |pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Hedy and Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board :) Thx for watching!|pg||
nt|dburn: thanks for operating, and well done Poland - remains to be seen who their opponents will be tomorrow|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bt: they say, lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: back in play now|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Zia should have cashed the heart early - guess he can make then.|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@H EW|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 boards - now Nickell need more that 1 miracle :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: So Poles make it comfortably enough. What is the score in England-Netherlands, David?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzta: Zia talking about the last hand and coughing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you kibitzers, you are the sole reason we have vugraphs!!!|pg||
nt|copeyj: England are 10 down|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there seems to have been an adjustment in the third set|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a +1700 to score and 4 deals left to play|pg||
nt|dburn: so England are 9.5 IMPs behind|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Osshri pulls down the screen.  Earlier he looked at the ops convention card|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stoffers: first trick, J@c-Q@c-K@c. then 2 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think we can congratulate Nickell team|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we start 30 minutes later than the BBO schedule|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: 4@s NS?|pg||
nt|jkotor: NS can put EW into 5@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: W cannot pas 4@s :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem apparently explaining about possible hands for Martens|pg||
nt|bt: unless decl goes up ace off course|pg||
nt|bt: dont know why he would though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 3nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will Zia find another bisd?|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Greco did not reopen double with lightish values and a void. ONe needs to avoid re opening with voids as your defense is really limited|pg||
nt|hedyg: geez Raija and i thought it was for the commentators!|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Will Hamman?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: of course|pg||
nt|rv: Traian you are doing a terrific job|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jkotor: or 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, 6@c plays quite well for EW, too |pg||
nt|stoffers: I am soooo glad noone ever taught me jack denies...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: but that 1700 will (one hopes) put them ahead, and the last three results are solid enough|pg||
pc|h5|nt|algraves: NS make 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 2@H guarantees 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks like a make|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the cards are going too fast for me and he claims|pg||
nt|swanson: This might be another ten for Nickell - it is easy to imagine that N-S would double a 'save' of 5@C against 4@S.|pg||
nt|rmb1: This should be quick|pg||
nt|kareno: Competing for the partscore. and happy to push e/w up a level.|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this was very fast at the table|pg||
nt|tlc: the balance has now secured a plus position for NS|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell reluctant to lead A of @S of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell thinking now|pg||
nt|algraves: but wont lead a red suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzta: Zia says that they can make 4 @S lol|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is consdiering a Tref|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: of course lol|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heart lead into heart bidder - often best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are bidding like juniors... they are in heat 1 and they know it|pg||
nt|dburn: still, as the great Fats Waller was wont to say, one never knows, do one?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jtr: my grandmother would turn in her grave  3NT with 22 points|pg||
nt|jtr: Great lead though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C checkback  2@D  2-5-3-3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bt: sometimes too much knowledge is bad, i agree|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|algraves: finally goes with partners suit|pg||
nt|jtr: But West has a lot of discards to make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|stoffers: i am just a wizard..shal i tka the next 10 tricks also, lool|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Greco-Hampson bid a 3NT on a combined 20 count earlier. It was cold|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: try 1 @D first, just 1!|pg||
nt|peachy: This will be another swing for Israel team|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then claim :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I srael had a very good set|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jtr: I would have thought this was rather dangerous by Hamman  Could neasily run into a double if @ds arent behaving|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway, congratulations to the Polish team and good luck tomorrow. Thanks to the players, vugraph operators, colleagues and spectators|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Still, Zia could have more|pg||
pc|c7|nt|algraves: and is pleased|pg||
nt|jtr: Much prefer 3@d to 2NT with the offsuit holdings|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|odysseus69: West has no problem finding 5 discards so this must be 1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D7 lead is Zia -- not systemic|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|algraves: he want to signal diamond thru|pg||
nt|tlc: there's always the saying that "it's hard to lose the post-mortem by leading partner's suit"|pg||
nt|algraves: rather than a trump promotion|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes the J @C was called for|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stoffers: wasn't it zia that mentioned that convention in 'bridge my way' ?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rmb1: +1 when @SQ appears|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks     some will play in 4@H   which will also make   in spite of  a ruff in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia claiming |pg||
nt|algraves: this guarantees his 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|norby: yes|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|algraves: although it doesnt matter what meck does|pg||
nt|algraves: so he takes safe course|pg||
pc|c6|nt|toral5: heading for 4 losers in trump suit now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|norby: 100 %|pg||
nt|algraves: he can force re entry to his hand via @C QJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: seems they announced next set in 20 minutes in the VG theater|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|algraves: no reason not to finesse that I can see|pg||
nt|jtr: He seems to have a problem already|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|s2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no just planning all 5|pg||
nt|algraves: always start with 9 in mind in 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|stoffers: wich is the best book out there (exept the menagerie ofcource)|pg||
nt|algraves: then go from there|pg||
pc|h7|nt|davidb: the  bidding was ok. the lead  was not friendly-spade|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
