mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|figo: hi|pg||
mb|d!|mb|2D!|nt|figo: very aggressive overcall|pg||
nt|dslee: EW are a veteran partnership from the Eastern part of the country called KOlkata - they represent team CV Rao in the domestic circuit|pg||
nt|figo: Indian 1 is 2nd right now|pg||
nt|figo: when one learns bridge , it is taught that this is not a suit to overcall with :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dslee: throughout the game, I am sure you all will see a lot of aggressive bidding from EW - especially E who is one of the most aggressive player in the country today|pg||
nt|dslee: well, I am sure, modern day bridge has been a lot different :)|pg||
nt|figo: but things have changed , overcalling has changed |pg||
mb|p|nt|vasanti: this shows 9 cards in minors either ways|pg||
nt|sybarra: N not in love with his hand |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: S did not open 1 @C so his hand is limited |pg||
pc|hT|nt|figo: 2D good spade raise|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vasanti: 1c is 16/17/18 hcp depending on pship style|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|figo: this is an easy make |pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: I am told N/S in other room is playing 4 @H |pg||
nt|vasanti: on the nose shift by rana|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dslee: two interpretations, 2@H or 2@D - the latter being cue bid in favor of @S, first one is a game force in @S|pg||

nt|psridhar: N will need to attack one black suit to prevent the end play on S-or is it not possible?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: as cards are South is ripe for an endplay guarding both black suits, can declarer read it?|pg||

nt|kista: If declarer reads the cards he can make now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: sadhu asking  some  written Q|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||

pc|h9|pc|dQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
