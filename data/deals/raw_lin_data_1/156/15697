mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: admittedly there is room after this splinter for 4@D last train and so on, so maybe hans just hopes he can backpedal sufficiently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed the double of 4@C to deny a first round control in clubs|pg||

pc|c5|nt|gulyas: so 4@C looks fine|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|athene: i don't think 2@S is GF for most people so strictly speaking 4@C has to show extras|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And if your agreement is that a splinter en route does not promise extras, then fine|pg||

nt|gulyas: instead of the @CQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A little too good for a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: 17 and a decent 5c suit is too good for 15-17NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would probably be close to 19 on the KNR|pg||
