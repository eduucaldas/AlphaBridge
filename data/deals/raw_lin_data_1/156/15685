nt|vugraphzau: of this board|pg||
nt|psridhar: that overstated 2s ( with KJ of dia under 1d opener) leads to curtain raiser game that is hopeless|pg||
nt|psridhar: even a response of 1N may hv been a better idea, planning to compete 2s if reqd later|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: http://www.hcl-bridge.com/jspCWBRecultClientView.jsp|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: so the first board is the grand one!!|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3s shd be H support as he can bid 4c if he wants to support clubs|pg||
mb|4C|nt|psridhar: somehow S has to find out key cards outside diamonds- since diamonds are opener's first suit EKCB is difficult|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: that helps- N has no dia ace or king ! wd|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 4s by N is sweet music to South's ears|pg||

nt|vicky888: a simple voidwood or Exclusion keycard would have solved the problem... but neither tables used it|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a well judged balancing X there by Sartaj-even holding 5 spds, i like that x|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3d can make can sartaj find a 2nd x now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: that club 9 is a crucial card in 3d|pg||
