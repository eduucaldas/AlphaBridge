nt|ahollan1: but 37-0   |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will be back in aprox 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: with the last set|pg||
nt|rv: we play 16 boards in every segment in finals, so this and 1 more|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry Fred and claimed 12.... why sorry.... i misspalyed it .... and laughed|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly, yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so only 4 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H 1-round-force|pg||
nt|jtr: A chance at last for Strul|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 26 minutes to play one board, and to drink a coffee no time for shower lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in france it's 18:34|pg||
nt|jtr: Thinnish values for game here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzta: for fantunes|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, private|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: usually 14+ HCP, but maybe 12/13 with 5@H & 4@S   [as we see here]|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: At last a chance to get some IMPs for Strul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N= 5+ HCP, 3+@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now East in the tank..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director said you should be finished by now|pg||
nt|tez: in turkey 19:37 :) |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the structure from here -- probably 3@H saying reject game try    [without interference]|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bet theses guys will bid slam|pg||
nt|dburn: better let them use Blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: To be fair on the players time wise, all these part scores do take up a lot of time|pg||
nt|dburn: then, they won't bid a slam - if you make them guess, they might|pg||
nt|yvesj49: key cards BW is boring here|pg||
nt|jtr: But i guess it will be bid|pg||
nt|passell: this is the match of the year  cant wait for the last segment|pg||
nt|athene: zia didn't try for a diamond ruff here - just drew trumps and knocked out the heart|pg||
nt|rv: 4 segments of 16 boards will decide this match |pg||
nt|athene: and ended up dropping the @DQ|pg||
nt|algraves: 6@S a very good contract|pg||
nt|athene: although it looks against the odds|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West likely to play 4@h or 3NT - North-South may not get involved at all, and certainly won't bid much at the score|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sommer: very lucky 10 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 1nt because he doesn't think he is good enough for 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand gestures on the alerts|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very heavy 3@S there|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S, declarer won't want to draw all the trumps because he wants a heart ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: ..exept with @Slead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth and Rodwell still discussing the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told EW play "strong weak-2@S opener" so 1@S - 1nt; 2@S is a good hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the last hand of this set|pg||
nt|jtr: Few 'routine' contracts|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe 2 Aces out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thwy will be pushed there probably|pg||
nt|passell: 1100 here if dbl|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Hmapson is helping them|pg||
nt|tlc: me neither..really exciting!|pg||
nt|rv: 3@S must be showing semi-solid/solid suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 1@S - 1nt; 3@S is a very good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Philadelphia Vugraph Archives at  http://www.bridgefederation.ch/2010/wtc/index.html  courtesy of Yvan Calame|pg||
nt|dburn: they use Turbo, but the effect is the same - they will discover that there are two key cards missing if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|rv: Moss will bid 4@d here|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|athene: Fred hasn't had so much luck this set with "solid" spade suits|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least Meckstroth now has bragging rights over Zia - "you went down two in 2@h, I went down only one"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really was a question of Fred scoring 2 trump or each scoring 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I imagine they will restart as soon as they can compare.  This is the third of four sets.|pg||
nt|algraves: east needs a third trump trick one way or another, either through the forcing game of a ruffing game|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia ducked but doesn't it seem  @HA  @D  @CA @D @D better start ??|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: Gitelman will pass here which should be forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Fred's 3@s shows solid suit and doesn't promise extras though as per knowledgable specs|pg||
nt|peachy: 2-way checkback, most likely, this one GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: in that case, this is almost forcing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asks about the 9 @C lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the end|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i lost|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the match now|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@H last train slam try?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: all my money|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i go to the bank for the 2nd round|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching back shortly|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it was a great show|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set...sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: great to watch|pg||
nt|passell: finally a good hand for Bobby Wolff he refuses to play key card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with both black suits 41 probably nothing works|pg||
nt|passell: yes for sure  but it doesnt work either|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Similar auction|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nobody doubled. Still a chance|pg||
nt|jtr: Standard Norwegian i am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes ... a chance to improve the 0|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A decent slam in norwegian. Needs S to lead diamond ace. But thereafter good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes did not lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so screen stil down|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe Traian could ask them just to play on?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i need a break... forget about them|pg||
nt|jtr: I bet|pg||
nt|passell: same auction at the other table except hamman bid 3nt instead of passing 2spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jtr: I am told a standard Norwegian slam is where the opponents cash 2 aces then wait for their trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|jtr: I cannot myself comment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: fast play i guess|pg||
nt|tez: enjoyed a lot:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they did not bother playing it lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: back very shortly! ty Traian,our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|daman: tilt|pg||
nt|rv: maybe 5@h by Moss here with @CA and @h values|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he has 3 trumps, an A, and a possible ruff, not a bad hand|pg||
nt|tlc: so,, more IMPs to nickell,, they took the low road here and landed in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@D is a cue for spades, moss feels he hasn't really got any extras|pg||
nt|jallerton: West retains trump control|pg||
nt|me argent: they might well get to slam|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, they need to take care not to over-reach - slam certainly possible from East's point of view facing the right cards|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jtr: An Irish slam for those that ask, is where the opponents take their 2 trump tricks and then wait for their Ace(s)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sommer: now..a @C?|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the first trick might have been wise if the lead was a doubleton|pg||
nt|peachy: 3H certainly stronger than 4H would have been, in sys|pg||
nt|dburn: take away @sJ and give West @dK instead - same point count, cold slam|pg||
nt|me argent: off to the races|pg||
nt|me argent: south has no easy lead|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe West can make 6NT - or East can make 6@h without a spade lead|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|bessi2: oh no.. this is still making since he played a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: odwell leads high from a singleton :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: <meckstroth agrees <<<|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to set up a club trick using the trumps and @DA as entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: No the slam has excellent chances. All you have to do is lead Q of @D from hand and S to take the Ace|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine this was an invitational sequence.  |pg||
nt|me argent: only @S lead beats 6@Hs|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bessi2: he is on his way down it seems|pg||
nt|athene: he surely didn't duck this queen|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, this was not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson goes hmm on the drop of the spade queen|pg||
nt|athene: he led to the @DA and played a heart up|pg||
nt|sommer: @C3 would work!|pg||
mb|d|nt|bessi2: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now the dble came|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, East will get a spade lead, so better let West play it|pg||
nt|me argent: X at last|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and the lead does not need a guess anymore|pg||
nt|me argent: 6nt by west|pg||
nt|peachy: spade lead to 6NT by West actually gives 12th trick|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, even on a spade lead against 6@h, South might be squeezed in the minors|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sommer: wow..the @C3:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|jtr: East hand looks pretty good to decline it|pg||
nt|algraves: so the Meckwell interference took away the comfort level to have a more secure auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: he can claim now:)|pg||
nt|athene: he is planning to draw trumps ending in dummy and just lead the @C7|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson talking to Meckstroth and chuckling|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he gets lucky even with @Cs 5-1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson shows his hand|pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth could have returned a small club after winning the queen, but it wouldn't have helped|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@c perhaps designed to ask West whether he wants to play 6NT to protect his spades|pg||
nt|peachy: Chiu apparently thinking of converting to 6NT, would be better but he cant know it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: took the pass card out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and put it back :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|athene: decalrer could just ruff high, draw trumps, and set up the club|pg||
nt|athene: dummy's club spots and @S8 are nice cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the players have left and bye for now >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>:)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|sommer: guess this was the last...tnx all:)..tnx kibz for your remarcs|pg||
nt|gulyas: tx all - sry abt the score, but the connection was lost, and running scores are down, too|pg||
nt|gulyas: Nickell was up by abt 25 the last time we knew|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but we can say Nickel leads "a bit"|pg||
nt|sommer: 25-6 it was|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was 31-6 at some point|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear that Zia went down in the same 4@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the lead is more now|pg||
nt|gulyas: making a wild guess: Nickell up by at least 35|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, more news: Zia made the 4@S, but the score maybe 39-6|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzta: woow...|pg||
nt|algraves: and earned 13 imps|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is sqz to develop, the run of 7 hearts is going to put NS in trouble|pg||
nt|me argent: there might be a squeeze here but unfortunately i dont do sqeezes::(|pg||
nt|dburn: well, let's hope Chiu does|pg||
nt|dburn: because there is one|pg||
nt|peachy: I do them blindly, if they work, it is beyond my control LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east in  the tank|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: See|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh no!|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree, even nv.  It is a good hand.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|jtr: He played too quickly!|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it was at all a given that south was going to make 6@S here if he bid it|pg||
nt|athene: why not play east for the @DQ?|pg||
nt|algraves: tilt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzta: woooow|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks Traian  Great job|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all... this was dramatic end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice try|pg||
nt|passell: this seems like a good line of play though|pg||
nt|passell: does a low spade to the nine at that point work?|pg||
nt|algraves: you cannot cash your second club or play trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tlc: a lot of tens and nines to go quietly with east's hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|passell: Nickel will now have a small dbl digit lead going into last segment|pg||
nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|athene: ok, you can set up the hearts now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|dburn: might have been better to win with the king, inducing declarer to take a spade finesse and not play for a (long odds against) squeeze|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, he would double 5@s with just the king, but probably not with just the queen|pg||
nt|peachy: Many Kibitzers excited, they saw the squeeze. Thanks for your input|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c7|pc|hT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|tlc: and a very big spade ace|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: Tens count for something - club texture...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovski in the tank now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has no reason to keep diamonds any longer|pg||
nt|dburn: so he might as well keep them shorter, so to speak|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s5|nt|dburn: but Chiu has forced a decision upon himself at this point|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: still OK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|dQ|nt|dburn: this is turning into a guard squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovski back to thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|me argent: too complicated for moi|pg||
nt|me argent: too easy for me too lose count|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovski stil thinking|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidstern: These are boards 15 to 28 of a total 56 board semi final|pg||

nt|fabsayc: hi ed, david|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Pretty clear that EW play 2C game-forcing and 3@H as slam try (fast arrival?)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction looks odd to me, 3@H not forcing uually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: As cards lie, slam doesn't look like it can make on @S lead, unless west plays 6N, perhaps.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east hand needs to cover 4 of 5 losers, west's failure to cue makes that unlikely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|othered1: Possible you can find a minor suit squeeze on south, if declarer reads all positions, including @S.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: there are several leads that will allow slam to make, including this one|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|c9|pg||

nt|toral5: is it like murray-kehela natural?means natural system with ONLY 100 modifications.lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we start now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching the show|pg||
nt|ritong: three slams in a row can be called a show i guess|pg||
nt|daman: could be a big swing right back|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in 35 mins with the next set|pg||
nt|jallerton: another Burn's Law violation|pg||
nt|me argent: lets hope it doesnt tire him out|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: EW traditional polish club when vulnerable, agressive strong club not vul|pg||
nt|jkotor: prec style 2@c 11-14, 5+ unbal|pg||
nt|toral5: here we go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set    4th and final 16-boards for the championship scheduled to start in about 30 min|pg||
nt|dburn: attempted by both sides|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|vugraphzta: Nickell in front for a change|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you can set up the hearts when east wins his ace on the first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this, though, could not really be called a slam|pg||
nt|athene: but what if he unsportingly ducks the first heart and returns a diamond to take the entry out|pg||
nt|algraves: 30 points and 9 @D|pg||
nt|algraves: you can see how they got too high|pg||
nt|rv: NS might have dodged slam bullet after North's pass and Meckstorth opening:)|pg||
nt|algraves: but not now with meck opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=17+ bal or 16+ unbal [upgrades allowed]|pg||
nt|norby: gitelamn pass:-)))|pg||
nt|jallerton: David will explain Burn's Law|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D suction??    @H or @S & @C      or just a transfer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Or Multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: others suggesting might be multi|pg||
nt|passell: this may save rodwell|pg||
nt|peachy: Or give an adrenalin rush to hinder thinking|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|athene: wow, Greco passed that hand in third seat!|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 5@H is a good save for N-S here but with some defense in each hand and no shortness, E-W will probably buy it for 4@S.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = nF by 90% of Polish|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like west found a gr8 @D lead to beat 3@S in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and some more thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: as u see 4 card opening in major by the norwegian pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the cards now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still no sign of making a bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just trying for a swing board, knowing Meckstroth will be right there with 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that a crime? He does not have an opener :)|pg||
nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. 1-suit   @H or @S|pg||
nt|dburn: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impossible for Rodwell to know that it's best to defend|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|algraves: no nobody trying to cause swings in this match|pg||
nt|athene: well, passing looks a bit of a girlie action to me|pg||
nt|ritong: crime was perpetrated otherr room|pg||
nt|algraves: well that is why we are here and they are there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred put the cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thinking|pg||
nt|rv: Fred could bid 3@s here to setup GF since 3m might be non-forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: they got to 6@d after getting doubled in @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: something is wrong in paradise|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if Moss's 2@s is Inv+ or promises another bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  on the last board, if East holds up on the first @H, declarer has to guess the position to make, which Zia did|pg||
nt|norby: meck pass...lololol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck's PASS = 0-4 HCP|pg||
nt|norby: all the people want play in diamond this hand|pg||
nt|norby: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|norby: no majors pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|norby: diamond yesssssssssssss|pg||
nt|chessmaste: E/W might be in big trouble now|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: difficult for north to resist with tht hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: correction: only 4 card in @h and 5 in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes - no-one can see quite why he took that view|pg||
nt|athene: east might just take 3@D as natural given the vulnerability|pg||
nt|norby: pass rodwell pleaseeeeee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is funny|pg||
nt|robinswr: you play it partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure what Meckstroth is to make of all this - 2@d showed one major, so how can West want to show both?|pg||
nt|norby: now gitelman bid 4 spades:-) lol|pg||
nt|jallerton: Meckstroth was not sure what to make of this either.|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 55 in the majors you might want to show both, because you expect partner to have lots in the one north doesn't have|pg||
nt|dburn: could be, I guess, but everyone except Moss must be sorely puzzled by the whole business|pg||
nt|jallerton: hope rather than "expect", Bill.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he had a count at that point so isn't it 5:2 that the @DQ is with east?|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes. and apparently he dropped it|pg||
nt|rv: with 55 in reds, I much prefer 3@h or 4@h with Moss hand instead of nebulous 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west just was obviously in trouble on the discards and zia backed his table feel|pg||
nt|rv: Fred is definitely confused here trying to figure out what Moss has|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred back in the tank now|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he will eventually pass since he is not sure if 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is stil thinking|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 3@S is interesting|pg||
nt|robinswr: he couldn't beat 4hearts|pg||
nt|athene: moss is puzzled too but in a happy way|pg||
nt|norby: last hand for i meckweel is dangerous, before 7 diamond now ...........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about Fred now. Does he think partner has spades?|pg||
nt|robinswr: double pass or correct|pg||
nt|me argent: only @C lead beats 4@Ss|pg||
nt|peachy: 3D shows spades, prob max w spades?|pg||
nt|me argent: or @S lead and @C shift|pg||
nt|dburn: Multi may work better than weak two here, putting West on lead|pg||
nt|me argent: GB says its cold|pg||
nt|peachy: 3D min w spades|pg||
pc|c5|nt|passell: he knows rodwell is 5-5 in majors|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of situation is why the english bridge authorities don't like you passing a multi-2@D opener|pg||
nt|jallerton: and South will have been told that by West |pg||
nt|me argent: shows what i know|pg||
nt|dburn: but this West doesn't seem the sort you want on lead - that's a good shot|pg||
nt|me argent: in practice @C lead does the job|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher in the tank|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: besides, it makes:)|pg||
nt|athene: most would play that as showing a top honour, for the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bingo|pg||
nt|dburn: usually "don't lead a spade"|pg||
nt|athene: yes it means that if he has bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i heard meckwell had trouble with final board of last set too|pg||
nt|dburn: he has enough entries to establish a long heart and keep control|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe the fifth heart provides a parking place for one club, then just lose a spadediamond and club|pg||
nt|dburn: but there are other ways to play, of course|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: if only 5@c West will have a 4-card major|pg||
nt|algraves: I think they play double dont lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought anti-lead doubles only applied from a player who has actually bid the suit though|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's double of 3@s says don't lead @s, normally he should have a good alternate lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will go to the break with a realy close match|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he pscyhed double thinking opps could have a slam after 3rd seat Meckstorth opening|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Martens did the right thing|pg||
nt|jkotor: yup, with 4@d-5@c -> 1@d, unless they play different than others|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are starting with board 16 and playing 14 boards this session|pg||
nt|toral5: 4 losers in this game.so we begin with a push|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Robin Barker|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and David Edwin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|norby: pass of gitelman is strange, sure 6 cards in heart of partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was just 1 trick|pg||
nt|dburn: this might even be a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2|pg||
nt|dburn: one of the stranger ones, to be sure|pg||
nt|passell: great pass by fred  it created this monster|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: good evening Roland  and everone|pg||
nt|norby: not possible 6 spades because rodwell explain at gitelman 5-5- majors....so...|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess if South continues clubs, it might be down five|pg||
pc|s4|nt|norby: but now is normal the double|pg||
nt|passell: maybe a spectacular push|pg||
nt|jkotor: pass is throwing points away...|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess there were no red cards in the NS bidding boxes|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|toral5: zimmerman must have found the @D lead to beat 3@S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: East will be delighted to see @DAQ opposite his side king to six|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, they are playing in the final, we are not. There must be a reason for it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: trump switch looked best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fairness -- in many situations Rodwell 3@D would be Michaels for @H & @S|pg||
nt|jallerton: from Fred's point of view, double might persuade them to run to the suit breaking more evenly|pg||
pc|s6|nt|toral5: in the other room|pg||
nt|jkotor: which one, and what would be the result? :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: The reason you are not in the final. Roland, is that you did not enter the event!|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR 3@S played in S and killing defense: @d( to K - and duck!|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: killing @D lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably wandering how not to loose a trump|pg||
nt|peachy: second trumps seemed unnecessary|pg||
nt|dburn: now, he no longer has enough entries to establish a heart and keep control|pg||
nt|me argent: like i said @C lead did the job|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: How strong was 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: too late now|pg||
nt|ady: but still down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|ady: might have tone down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: glasses as well on the table|pg||
nt|ady: in fact  as pointed out   still in time   trump now   and overruff table and 2nd trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman stil thinking|pg||
pc|c6|nt|toral5: in 1 way helness wd be hapy to see @H 9/10 at trick 1.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: One of the reasons, indeed|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|swanson: With all suits breaking well declarer will have no problem.  |pg||
nt|ady: very reluctant to play a trump|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jkotor: if @d 4-1, he would ruff one|pg||
nt|rv: many play anti-lead doubles applies to both sides of partnership after one of them has bid suit|pg||
nt|rv: thanks all|pg||
nt|algraves: well that was some action filled bridge to say the least|pg||
nt|athene: odd auction in the other room - does anyone know what 3@S was?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all... see you soon for the second set|pg||
nt|passell: why didnt he pitch a spade loser?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, well - just another flat board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: EW will want thirteen more like this one, please|pg||
nt|toral5: @H 8 with helness would have changed the trump suit play|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: reluctant|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sure?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: I think Nickell will gain 3 IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe not even that, any more|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|toral5: after 10 appeared|pg||
pc|h2|nt|me argent: now a vienna soup|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzta: sorry..W is still thinking|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@D showed both majors and 4@d presumably equal length|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness stopped and said does not matter|pg||
pc|sK|nt|passell: 4 down  push|pg||
pc|s9|nt|norby: now i go to sleep , but promise that tomorow i see all the hand and all the comment......good night before the kibbitzer and after my friends commentator...............and tx at ...|pg||
nt|norby: steve weinstein(he knows why9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: three down now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Phew|pg||
nt|jallerton: thanks all, bye|pg||
nt|algraves: well just your kitchen bridge push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 20-25 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|dburn: he had enough for a trump squeeze as well, perhaps, so East needed to return that diamond|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c9|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|mc|9|nt|dburn: so perhaps Joey is right - this is a Vienna soup rather than a Vienna coup|pg||
pg||

nt|othered1: simple 4@S looks normal here.  Looking for a miracle hand is odds-off|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: Now, if you play sound weak 2's, which they obviously don't, it's a different issue.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually he can establish the fifth heart if entries used wisely|pg||
nt|othered1: Or, if you think sound is in context of their style, say solid weak 2's :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR North dobled 5@S and won the first spade with the queen likely steeruing declarer to the right play on the previous board|pg||
nt|othered1: remember, this declarer's first concern is to find the safest way to make 4.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this is not it|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny how often lead directing doubles backfire.  Probably why some very good pairs avoid them.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: birman appears to be playing declarer for both missing clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: If north could get to his hand, he could squeeze west.  But he can't |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so this was excellent defense|pg||
pc|hA|mc|9|pg||
qx|o17|st||md|3S9HT9842DAJ8CKQ94,SJHK73DQ765CA8763,SAK632HAQJ6DK43CT,SQT8754H5DT92CJ52|sv|o|nt|swanson: Martens probably didn't know if he was saving or making when he too the push.|pg||
nt|swanson: took|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so they started brd 17|pg||
nt|toral5: another dull push coming up|pg||
nt|ady: so declarr played a trump|pg||
nt|tlc: hi karen and alan :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are off|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fasten your seatbelts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I live 3 mins from Stamford Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director came in the room and said GO|pg||
nt|norby: very similar system grco ham and meckwelll|pg||
nt|pelu: here we go and start with a potensional slam|pg||
nt|me argent: tasty for the def|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance for israel here|pg||
nt|dburn: but these have been two pretty impressive effort by Fay and Chiu|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tlc: Fasten your seatbelts...showtime!|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: spectators are expecting some early fireworks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is the action man|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|algraves: NS on @S Guess for 6|pg||
mb|1N|an|alerted|nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Traian and last he made an error was in 1987|pg||
nt|algraves: no this is the well known meckwell and the great young Israeli pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 2n with East hand showing @C+@h split range?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it's the sixth heart that stopped him, rather than being so weak|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth|pg||
nt|algraves: EW have 8 tricks in  @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell-Meck in 6@s|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 6@h on 16 was a particularly good contract, any more than it is here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: now north needs a support re-redouble :)|pg||
nt|norby: i prefere 1 hearts with 6 heart, if 6 diamond and 5 heart better bid 2 suiter|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstroth certainly chose winning bid especially with Rodwell having other 2 suits:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
nt|athene: not so useful when south has denied five spades though|pg||
nt|norby: sorry 6 club and 5 heart|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: no one steals from West|pg||
nt|algraves: we are finding out what system they play|pg||
nt|athene: east's choice of rebid suggests it was indeed the sixth heart he was thinking about when he bid 1@H rather than 2nt|pg||
nt|rv: does 1@s substitute for supp X with north hand?|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to get that sixth heart into it - he might bid clubs later maybe if it seems like a good idea i suppose|pg||
nt|norby: stron hand only|pg||
nt|norby: strong|pg||
nt|algraves: he is 4333 and doesnt want to encourage anything|pg||
nt|algraves: A lot of bidding around Rodwell|pg||
nt|algraves: with the best hand at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod thinking now|pg||
nt|athene: he might raise hearts now|pg||
nt|algraves: I think XX showed exactly 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: is Greco's 2@s conventional if Hampson didn''t show 3@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: was not alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you want to be in slam 6@D is better than 6@S because of the lesser risk of a ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D with 5@S is new animal for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: North opened 2@D (multi) in CR, almost forced EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 22 hcp 3NT  CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yuval Yener and David Burn|pg||
nt|athene: well, 2@S says he wants to compete but he is known to have only four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so logically he must be prepared for north to pull to 3minor|pg||
nt|athene: i expected 3@H from west but he doesn't mess about :)|pg||
nt|rv: normally Rodwell gives allowance for Meckstorth's aggressive bids, this time he doesn't|pg||
nt|pelu: no EW bidding - lead @d|pg||
nt|algraves: well it is just standard 2 over 1, not a diamond raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess the 3@C bid will make you guess the spades|pg||
nt|peachy: N might make one try|pg||
nt|me argent: south took control in the CR to disaterous effect|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is considering now|pg||
nt|peachy: Other room had a GF 3H rebid (assume GF) which made South overextend|pg||
nt|me argent: if north takes control they should avoid slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovski in the tank at the moment|pg||
nt|dburn: in the other room, declarer got what appeared to be a friendly @d10 lead to the jack, queen and king|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzta: more imps now for nickel|pg||
nt|dburn: except perhaps East, who thinks his partner might have something|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW plays 2/1 with transfers in responses over 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: so this plays well with the friendly hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing too fancy|pg||
nt|kareno: David, you know my feelings on the subject - you must get in the auction when it is appropriate and this time \i feel it is definitely appropriate :)|pg||
nt|tlc: and the friendly clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: probably 9 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asking about leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably too much action|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks like quite a lot of bidding|pg||
nt|algraves: yes exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodwell didn't open the Greco hand|pg||
nt|algraves: no reason particularly to guess spades in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Nickell seems to thrive if they are 40 behind. So maybe a slam swing here will be useful :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D better that 6@S - risk in 6@s a @D-ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: so, he played @sA and ruffed a spade - overruffed, and West cashed his ace|pg||
mb|5D|nt|algraves: for sure 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|dburn: this is where you are supposed to run the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play israeli standard souped up no doubt which is a straight forward natural approach |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
nt|algraves: undoubtedly very good card players and fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks that 5d was prefered in the closed as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco doubled in a flash|pg||
nt|pelu: but also a @S ruff could be setup with 3 @s and @DA on same hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but a lesser risk|pg||
nt|dburn: now, was that [a] bad luck or [b] bad play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he can make it if they don't lead a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this is 2 down on accurate defense even after this lead|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is definitely better|pg||
nt|peachy: Once teo keys are missing, should not be in slam|pg||
nt|peachy: two |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: did have 2 hearts  1 spade   and K@D on 3rd heart   but not now|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead, Israel has a chance here|pg||
nt|me argent: north was Q bidding in a situation that KCBW would have worked better|pg||
nt|me argent: declarer aint making this hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: but maybe the auction indicated a club lead - not sure exactly what the later rounds meant, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance for a swing from the word go|pg||
nt|rv: defense should get 3@cs and 2@h if they can shift to @h in time|pg||
nt|algraves: So Meck is playing with a lot of information but it wont help him much|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell making a comment about the tray being slow coming back|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Rodwell played Meck for more since he didn't bid 2@h or 2n in first round|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows the spades and the diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think unhappy with something|pg||
nt|algraves: so they stop off a key card and the trump q very disciplined|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
nt|norby: strange double of greco, probabily understimate rodwell?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just impressed they knew what was trump|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|dburn: or, of course, not play on hearts at all - although I am not quite sure why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell thinking north took a long time to pass 4@H and that influenced the double?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think so|pg||
nt|norby: i think also with 5 hearts and 8 club:-))) |pg||
nt|pelu: S know rhey are missing 1Ace and @SQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: yes he needed to judge between under-estimating Rodwell to over-estimating Meckstorth:)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost impossible to over-estimate meckstroth's aggression|pg||
nt|norby: sorry for my italenglish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only my Spanish/Italian was half as good as your English|pg||
nt|rv: np Norby, message (bridge language) is very clear:)|pg||
nt|norby: ty:-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco in the tank now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: have to say 3NT   ambitious  in CR    but came home|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he won't make it|pg||
nt|algraves: well he wont make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: may be ducking the spade was wiser|pg||
nt|rv: now @s back best|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|peachy: since he took the diamond with ace, he might need to finesse for the club jack. just as long as he does not give trick to HK|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|me argent: north sees 26 cards he aint making this|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the system card of NS|pg||
nt|peachy: even no finesse, J club drops|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still studying the system card of NS|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|jkotor: i think he is winning in the different boards|pg||
nt|pelu: carefull unblocing @DA|pg||
nt|toral5: claim time now|pg||
nt|toral5: praying that becker doesnt have @C 10 and single @S|pg||
nt|algraves: open cards now for Hampsom as they say|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid panicking and trying to cash clubs out, but it does all come down to the eight and nine|pg||
nt|rv: Hampson might just find it since Meck didn't @d  pitches earlier|pg||
pc|h4|nt|swanson: Would the 9 or 10 be led for 10-9 doubleton, Jakub?|pg||
nt|algraves: yes Meckstroths opener seems to have fooled him a little|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|me argent: like a dog|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|davidstern: And mercifully you will be spared me in the picture|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we can trot out Blackwood :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like forcing 1N resp and strong jump-shift, which they don't play as showing 5.  Other methods let you distinguish length at the cost of considerable complexity (Gazilli, for ...|pg||
nt|othered1: example).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he now knows this is a marginal slam|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: nor will you see my visage :)|pg||
nt|othered1: One of those less than great hands for RKC -- as they're off 2 keys but above safety, so south needs to be lucky now that it's n ot two aces and the @HK is onside|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: that appears to be what Lee is considering :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: back to cue bidding to avoid this|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: 5N surely would be conventional, too, so south eventually has to just bid 6@H.  Really, this is just posing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Birman asks questions before he leads|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: Even if you play "KIckback" RKC, where @S would be key asking in @H on some auctions, this may not be one of them.|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||
nt|dburn: ducking the spade would have been a bad idea if South held the king of hearts, which was what Pachtman was playing for|pg||
nt|algraves: well yes but then heshould have just played on hearts at trick two|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he was going to do that, he might as well have played on hearts earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we start final 16 boards with a double digit swing -- but in which direction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: inresting in this matchwe have Norway NS at both tables - in CR: Brogeland-Sælensminde|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: match tied|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s down|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jkotor: 10-16 this vul|pg||

nt|Walddk2: OK, extra boards and we have them ready|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   Meck misguessed @S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I guess if you bid every hand to 6@h you will make it some of the time|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|algraves: oh well , easy when you see them all as they say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|algraves: kudo to Brad Moss for not overcalling the big club opener in other room and tipping off the @S shortness|pg||
nt|algraves: Passing is under rated these days|pg||
nt|peachy: let me correct, two were in 4H, two were in 6H, all four made 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: effectively 47 brd shootout|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: 1@h by E would've been 3 cards support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  0-2 hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: West thinking now|pg||

mb|p|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D just shows 5+@ds GF or is it conventional?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 more to Diamond|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman gave him 2 fingers|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play a standard start with a very modern approach after that with transfers and information requesting waiting bids etc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's actually 'natural' after he already denied as many as three|pg||
nt|algraves: anad more to come no doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck did not know he is on lead lool|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: and HH landed in 3d|pg||
nt|algraves: the future will be to bid games giving away as little as possible|pg||
nt|algraves: and try and position NT contracts  if possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asked him do you know you are on lead?|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|nt|toral5: looks like a make here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: thinking what to discard from dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks normal to pitch a diamond and play @HAx hoping for another trick somewhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: but there will be a 2nd discard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me remind specs that the Nickell team came back from 40 IMPs down with 8 boards to go the other day, so nothing is decided|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DJ lead and small from East the safeplay is to finess in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They won the last 8 boards 47-0!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jkotor: with blocking @c@c|pg||
nt|peachy: Israel might get couple IMPs if they get 11 tricks instead of ten|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher in the tank now|pg||
nt|peachy: heart lead would have virtually guaranteed 2 down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzta: lets see now|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: going for hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: I am a gambler :) I bet a coke on Diamond :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just top of a sequence when following to declarer's suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|toral5: @D 9 cant be promoted cos north has a 4th @S pitch on @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you giving odds  and/or imps??|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rmb1: A small club now and south will make @CQ and @HK and no more|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||
nt|ady: now must go up with ace|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer has to win and hope @D are stopped|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment he is thinking|pg||
nt|me argent: it will be interesting to see how NS play from here there first 4 boards from their point of view have been disasterous|pg||
nt|peachy: could have tried to swindle, ruff spade, small diam from dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: better to duck with @dK|pg||
nt|algraves: well so he can try and ruff a spade|pg||

nt|fabsayc: from what i saw he played for wrong squeeze, but maybe i missed something|pg||
nt|othered1: Last is just another hand to add to you list of bad RKC results to balance against the few where RKC is the only way to slam.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Lee has pulled out his pd's hand from the last board and is looking at it instead of his new hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: very bad form|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: you have to move on immediately to be a winner|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|othered1: Final t houghts on last hand -- both north and south bid a whole lot.  North because his hand was marginal -- will you miss many games if you rebid 2@H? and south because his stiff ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @S and unproven @C don't really justify RKC.|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is not a terrible slam, better than the last, but again very thin|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@H isn't a hateful contract, it just needs good things to h appen, and is likely under 50 percent|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Argelazi asks Lee concerning the 4 !@D bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphztb: Lee stated that he was disturbed by the noise of the typing, but it is really the mouse clicking|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oil that mouse|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't being willing to play in a vugraph room a condition of contest?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club shift will sink this|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the room is so quiet that the placing of the bids is sufficiently loud that the tempo of bidding is very clear to all players|pg||
nt|othered1: won't anything other than another @D beat it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but declarer probably cant manage it anyway|pg||
nt|othered1: East's card here *must* be count, as this is a cashout situation|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Argelazi places his cards on the table and takes off his glasses to think.  Maybe this is something he learned from Bob Hamman?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: and south can't realistically have @Dxxx on the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good shift|pg||
nt|othered1: now he needs the @C finesse plus|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if south is being pushy because of the last board, without realizing that the first hand was a potential pick-up|pg||
nt|fabsayc: too early in match to be swinging|pg||

nt|mdgraham: aww....|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate position in hearts    though always a good chance if 10@H is with west|pg||
nt|athene: i like 3@D over 3@H - when opps have spades, all other suits rank the same|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010nonJuniorPhiladelphia/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf   for Meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: i mean 3@D rather than 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H decent sac vs making 5@s|pg||
nt|me argent: fay might have been better off showing what he has rather that what he hasnt|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is surely looking for a 4@D bid from his pd|pg||
nt|me argent: good to have partner involved|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm not fond of 3H, apparent LR spades.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|toral5: 2nt by east will be natural here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: incase he decides to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
nt|athene: from a lead point of view, a diamond lead is less likely to cost than a heart too|pg||
nt|me argent: q bid shmoo bid at this vul show your 2nd suit get your oxe involved|pg||
nt|peachy: should have better trumps, four for starters|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a X in East - but only if pd has a 5 card suit :)|pg||
nt|norby: forgive me but i comment both bad and good think of players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H may bypass equal/longer @D in 1-bid hand|pg||
mb|6S|nt|chessmaste: So far the deals have been good for the leading team - little chance of a swing|pg||
nt|algraves: he can guess the clubs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar asked : normal stayman auction, answer yes|pg||
nt|algraves: but only two will still see him home 3 in each red , 2 clubs and a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of that may be obvious but i think it is good to reenforce inferences for many of the spectators|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: he might have 2NT available to show a raise with four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 3 NT looks quite normal,,but i cant see 9 trciks|pg||
nt|udo: after @S lead|pg||
nt|udo: a,i see, @H  come in|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, a @d to the Ace then @hs|pg||
nt|ritong: i wonder what 1@s 2@h double means|pg||
nt|hedyg: what would you bid Raija?|pg||
nt|dburn: it shows the minors and denies spades, would be my guess|pg||
nt|peachy: instead of 3H, either Dbl or 2S|pg||
nt|ritong: or any hand without a good bid available|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Lucky @d break in an odd way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well if he finds the diamond position he just plays on hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as usual I am last of 3 at typing|pg||
nt|udo: this @D break has its advantage,,u see  first round there is no future|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: 5@c seems OK|pg||
nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
nt|algraves: some how it is always hard for the defense to hold these to 9 tricks |pg||
pc|hA|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|algraves: well they the full 20 for their slam try auction|pg||
nt|rv: I am told that it used to that each player needs to play 33% of boards in finals till recently, of late rules have changed and it is 33% of cumulative boards across all k/o matches|pg||
nt|dburn: if 3@h is a three-card limit raise in spades, then 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: agree David, denies @ss|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly David, they may have another bid on card to show 4-card limit raise|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i lefy CR after a club lead- Rosenberg was in deep thought|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact he may get home even if @ds are 4-2|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|algraves: so he guessses clubs straight away|pg||
nt|tlc: he still has to guess whether to drop the doubleton K or to pin the 9 tho|pg||
nt|algraves: so no he has 9 with spades still to be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes last set... and the table was slow...this set looks like flying|pg||
nt|algraves: well, he wont go wrong there east could have Q9xx|pg||
nt|tlc: for 3 club tricks anyway..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/ronpa-gino.pdf  for E-W's convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably knows i said the table is flying|pg||
nt|figo: great|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 1 imp match at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east stil in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asked for the screen to come down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking rodwell stuff...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now screen back up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ron Pachtman is the faster of the two. Ginossar has his tanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: having a drink now....does not look in a hurry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Live video streaming in this set is from the closed room of the playoff match|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like pass over 5@H is taken as forcing here|pg||
nt|dburn: these days everyone has, as Paul Simon might have put it, fifty ways to raise your partner|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: That is certainly part of our job, being educational|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: You don't know if N-S have a fit|pg||
nt|toral5: yes and almost as gud as 0-3/4 hcps|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Roland - absolut normal to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C better than 5@D as 2nd spade ruff with 10@C holds|pg||
nt|rmb1: This has play, take two ruffs and draw trumps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: the Rosenblum and McConnell teams are playing the same boards, ostensibly at the same time, but the Rosenblum Teams play 15 boards a session and the McConnell 16 boards|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|algraves: i mean the opps have 27 - 29 hcp , everything is breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: McConnell = women's event|pg||
nt|jtr: As long as they cant cash the @d and a @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 6@s looks like the least Fay could bid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|nt|jtr: and the @hs behave of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now the surprise|pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves: now meckstroth wants to play the next club from hand in case west has K9x|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jkotor: IMO he can double for T/O, @h jump will correct to NT|pg||
nt|dburn: this is presumably because the women have time for 16 boards in two and a half hours, while the men can manage only about 11|pg||
nt|algraves: so Zia is down now, he had to guess the @C to make|pg||
nt|me argent: that east hand looks like a 2@S bid to me albeit a little heavy my partners are not shy about bidding vul games|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Live VG theatre with Live comments on http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  Credit to Mila Antonova :)|pg||
nt|dburn: if pass was forcing, then East should have doubled 5@h (in fact, East should probably have doubled 5@h anyway)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: not plain sailing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness-Helgemo vs Pachtman-Ginossar|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|algraves: so an imp riding on Rodwells play of trumps|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|swanson: Pass is possible because 1@C is forcing, but that is far from a guarantee that North will find it easier to describe his hand later.|pg||
nt|ady: needs care|pg||
nt|me argent: west was always bidding slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: well 4@c must have been slammish so pass over 5@H surely forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: (whether he meant it as such or not)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||

nt|udo: didnt even test @D:)=|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: They will let the men play 16 boards per set in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|algraves: he was worried about qT8x with east|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: west better to duck diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: if W had just wanted to play game he would have bid 4@s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: Hmmm I rather think he wanted his cake and to eat it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jkotor: W is mostly weak nt, so no singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and meckstroth going down in 3@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: Hoping to test the @hs bfore @ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's questionable whether Zia played the clubs with the odds|pg||

nt|fabsayc: should be a lively auction on this hand stopping 5 or 6 level|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: he cashed the club ace|pg||
nt|algraves: I dont think we had the play quite correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Traian never makes an error!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think the end was bit ...cloudy|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|algraves: anyway he made 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|me argent: west couldnt trust his partner to make an informed decesion because he never informed him|pg||
nt|dburn: this must be a record|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c was information|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, slam after slam|pg||
nt|dburn: for the numner of consecutive boards on which 6@h has been the final contract at one table or another|pg||
mb|2N|nt|odysseus69: willHamman open 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: goalless draw so far....|pg||
nt|algraves: nS 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|norby: like 3 diamonds and not 3 hearts because hearts 5-0?????lol|pg||
nt|algraves: he judged that south more likely to have singleton Honour than North to have KQX, if 2-2 didint matter what he did|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@Cs was noise not information of any great consequence|pg||
mb|3D|an|hearts|nt|toral5: we are having a very flat session til now,this brd no exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thought for a while and dbled|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nickell piling it on on every board|pg||
nt|ady: was not straaight forward    |pg||
nt|algraves: and it is now increasingly ancient history|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 6@s only -3|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c was an attempt to get his partner to cuebid diamonds, so it wasn't that stupid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|odysseus69: may be end|pg||
nt|jkotor: just have to jump|pg||
nt|udo: some specs point out ,hamman hates @D s,,,:)) so maybe therefore @h-play|pg||
nt|dburn: it didn't work very well, because he forgot to shoot North at the same time as he bid 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: now 3@h - 3NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh sorry  they're still playing  19    i should have checked my source :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: i hate to disagree with you Joey, but i am sure he was fishing for a @d cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL David|pg||
nt|dburn: this 6@h is far from awful, though|pg||
nt|me argent: did he think at the prevailing vul he wasgoing to have a quiet auction with no interference?|pg||
nt|peachy: A new suit by opener prob should be cue with hearts, I would have like a cue better than 4H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chiu took 4s card out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but put it back|pg||
nt|peachy: Well he does have two side suits controlled, awith known 9-card trump fit|pg||
mb|5C|nt|swanson: Game is iffy to bid here after 1NT.  Hamman can show a good spade hand by bidding at the three level over Zia's xfer, but will Zia go on?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some might have passed with Zia's hand - Hamman will smile|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe 3@d :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think North will stop below game whatever South does|pg||
nt|swanson: How big can his smile be, though?|pg||
nt|jkotor: "i d like, but i m affraid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: simple straight bidding in the other room cos north passed|pg||
nt|algraves: and he guessed wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least Joey will approve of 5@c|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C was 100% game force|pg||
nt|pelu: opening 1D and the D from N very informativ - for decl - again pass works best :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he would have bid 5@D over 5@c|pg||
mb|6H|nt|vugraphzta: zia-hamman started very well this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: well predicted|pg||
nt|yuval10: big result to Wolfson in the CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are thinking for 10 mins and then they arte throwing the cards on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT forces 3@C, unless doubler is strong, then he ignores the transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: seems like second transfer|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@H is a retransfer.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H may be re-transfer|pg||
nt|tlc: well done to get to the cold (albeit lucky) 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: this game is cold even if N would find the very inspired K@c lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't|pg||
nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what Ginossar intended to do if Pachtman had actually bid 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: after N opened 2@s, it seem illogical to finesse to the T in that suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: in @h rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: good players tend not to open weak 2's with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asked earlier for the session times to be changed and it seems the wish was granted|pg||
nt|algraves: well it seems he wants to get on @H straight away and if they are good for 5 tricks, then just give up a @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play Lebensohl by a passed hand then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing much to think about here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: can i tell him?|pg||
nt|algraves: anything but hearts from the top is illogical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you must tell him in Hebrew, Traian. Is that a challenge?|pg||
nt|algraves: my Hebrew is weak but I can call a lifeline|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: huge for me....i do speak the language|pg||
nt|rv: 2@C is fourth suit game force (FSGF)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cant Zia ruff a 2nd spade with 10C   and draw trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking now|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry S bid 3@D over 3@C and down 1 -50|pg||
nt|me argent: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow Joey!|pg||
nt|dburn: correct play for one lose with this trump suit is ace and another, not two finesses|pg||
nt|dburn: but if you're going to take two finesses, for pity's sake don't lead the queen for the first one|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Not sure.  We knew where @CJ was|pg||
pc|d8|nt|algraves: Greco keeping alternate contracts open|pg||
nt|norby: routine wash.-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't blame him -- slam just depends on finding trump Q  or underlead @DQ    maybe some squeeze possibilities|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Norway/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From when H&H last played internationally for Norway, and won the gold medal|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards stil on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand|pg||
nt|toral5: helness thinking of a possibility of trump promotion|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks no problems here with friendly oppo|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson 100% for NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: But he ended up playing for @CJ with West (or guessing to drop @CJx with East)|pg||
nt|algraves: well good practical shot by hamman, he knows he is stuck|pg||
nt|algraves: cowardly not to bid it really and he is anything if not fearless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if misguess @HQ   does @S return kill a double squeeze?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|toral5: incase helgemo raised with aq|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL I have about six words of Hebrew|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, at this point it looks like a final between Diamond and Nickell, but still time for their opponents to come back|pg||
pc|s8|nt|algraves: not comletely cold form Greco point of view and moreover an imp here or there can decide match|pg||
nt|algraves: so he wants 9 and then more than 9|pg||
nt|norby: the bidding 3nt is 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|norby: in this case 4-2-5-2|pg||
nt|norby: 2nt is relais with stop in club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no 100% line. He doesn't know that diamonds come in|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the cameraman trying to film greco's card..but they are folded under the table lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: greco's cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, he would just set up the missing tricks in spades|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Greco will start with @SK and if ducked will shift his attention to @h suit?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs have answered full spectrum    no, yes, maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|algraves: well there is always Q lies over the J|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|algraves: that is an old rubber bridge saying as when the cards are scooped up sometimes the tricks stay in the old order for the next deal|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: Jim types faster as well as commentating better|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: too fast for me :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hand shown|pg||
nt|rv: so much for my prediction:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can call Yuval, he is nearby|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|swanson: A heart lead would have defeated 4@H because the discard must be taken immediatly - the East can ruff the third round.|pg||
nt|rmb1: East must play a diamond now as the defence's only source of tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rmb1: Enough for five tricks?  I am asked.  Declarer has entry problems, may not get to enjoy the spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: can transfer any message via juniors' friends, which are also playing at the same time the world championship for juniors' teams|pg||
nt|algraves: so Rodwell will switch to clubs and hold this to three|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i missed the NOT...i do not speak the language|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then I am not sure you qualify as our operator :)|pg||
nt|algraves: this may be a long set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck said sorry.. and he is taking his ahare of the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manual for Vugraph Operators, page 17, paragraph 5, lines 8 and 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: share|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps west will help meck out and just claim ...|pg||
nt|algraves: I have thought that some variation of the chess clock principle but where it applies to total team time at all 4 seats|pg||
nt|algraves: not including system explanantions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: funny enough the director kept last set the exact time of each pair|pg||
nt|algraves: so you have a total team time of say 2hrs|pg||
nt|tlc: If Joey were the Operator, could he just yell NEXT at the appropriate time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now..who want to know the result?|pg||
nt|algraves: so that takes into account that NS and EW may have much different problems|pg||
nt|algraves: and if you have a very fast pair , well that helps if you have a very slow pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes and greco-hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: and vice versa|pg||
nt|algraves: so after you play you hit the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess you could only do it during the play|pg||
nt|algraves: but that would be a big help|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@c discard looks logical|pg||
nt|kareno: Many years ago, when he was sstill a student at MIT, I asked Mark Feldman what he was thinking about on every bid and play.  He told me he was reviewing every hand he had ever ...|pg||
nt|kareno: played for solutions.  And he was serious!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he will play spades|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tlc: will be surprised if the @C queen isnt played as well|pg||

pc|h9|nt|odysseus69: this is exactly the type of board you want when sitting on a lead|pg||

mb|2H|nt|rmb1: Reminiscent of the closing boards yesterday when Nickell score 47IMPs in 7 boards to win by approx. 5|pg||
nt|dburn: the point about not playing the queen if you intend to finesse twice is that if the next hand shows out, you will reflect that you should perhaps have run the six or the seven ...|pg||
nt|dburn: instead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: do HH play 2@H here as natural or @S raise?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT rebid suggesting more than an opening NT, 18-19|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok pls let us know his decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Chiu protested|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: another good board for leaders|pg||
mb|2S|nt|swanson: That was a big blow - 4@S is far from certain to be bid even if North opens 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia writes a maximum with 3 spades|pg||
nt|jkotor: Max, with HHx@s?|pg||
nt|algraves: now Pachtman has a decision about wether to re open|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2@H would be a good spade raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Redouble is 9+ hcp|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness said aha nice |pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  aggressive   partner balancing|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not the South is interested|pg||
nt|yuval10: X over NT for EW means @s and suit, as we learned yesterday, and W would never dream of bidding it with such a horrible suits|pg||
nt|kareno: Lucky Rodwell \:)|pg||
nt|algraves: best defense is 500 against 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Pachtman thinking THESE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM US|pg||
nt|algraves: but west may remove double to 2!|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S |pg||
nt|tlc: same auction to this point in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves: so practically speaking best to collect undertricks at 100 per|pg||
nt|rv: playing std 2/1, Rodwell's hand would be considered too strong for splinter (10-12 is preferred range), playing precision 13-15 makes more sense|pg||
nt|rv: Meck's 4@s is kickback asking for keys|pg||
nt|rv: they play suit above agreed suit as RKC at 4 level:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|algraves: anyone balance out there with double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: nope discretion the better part of valour|pg||
nt|tlc: at MPs maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously Rodwell intended to pass any response but this is the one he really hoped to hear I would guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 2NT probably shows a maximum spade hand with two honor and three cards in spades.|pg||
nt|toral5: should he hook @H here?|pg||
nt|stewball: here's trick 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  carding  upside-down count & attitude   Smith not mentioned|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: rod could have KQJx/Jxxx/K/KQJx|pg||
nt|rv: 5@d must be asking for specific kings, 5@C would be trump queen ask which Meck has  in any case|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least no one was in 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said i will be back|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: right on Karen|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: Routine here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 easy tricks - no options for anything else|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is routine hand . on the Last hand our world champion suggest 3 rounds @D then 4th @D if no Jack as the 8 of @C a strong card|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's jump to 6@h shows no kings|pg||
nt|norby: good bidding , easy and effective|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck saying TOO MANY KINGS|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5dia asks 0 or 3|pg||
nt|algraves: then you can wait with many options|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rd was asking for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 5d|pg||
nt|algraves: imp riding on the lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|norby: probabily 4 spades is ask for aces.......|pg||
nt|algraves: no only 6 always|pg||
nt|norby: and 4nt is 3 aces|pg||
nt|algraves: so no further problems here to make at least 3|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jkotor: why 3@h now if anyway 3nt?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you have to say, this is a bit of a silly contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: needs to guess the red finesse|pg||
nt|stewball: and @s will be 9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: noone can explain what happened here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, North has implied majors too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rodwell could have been 4450, no reason to re-open|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell went to the bathroom|pg||
pc|s3|nt|algraves: well sometimes they are in big trouble and you have more high cards than they do. so you might get a penalty or a partscore swing|pg||
nt|robinswr: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|norby: of course 0 or 3|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|norby: but meck think or hope 3:-))|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would think 5sp asks for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: mack : i am making six ...just looking for the other trick|pg||
nt|norby: better when trumps is hearts play rkcb at 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: request for link to video please|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did you win your 2nd division match tonight, Victor? If so, you did better than England vs Montenegro|pg||
nt|udo: 10 when he plays small now|pg||
nt|stewball: kind of an odd lead..i could see it if he had an entry|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|swanson: This sequence would seem to offer a choice of games with emphasis on spades (rather than a direct 3NT over 2NT).|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess down the middle is to pass it out|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: the North hand isn't strong enough for 3N=slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia is impassive|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer has to guess which red suit finesse to take.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|algraves: Moss in 7@H in closed room and their is a line of play that makes |pg||
pc|sA|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: it appears Brad Moss is executing the double squeeze in 7@H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jkotor: friend is telling me J@h, if no K, then kill it take @s, and finesse @d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: jack of hearts to test was usual Zia style - if no king then play diamond finesse|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|toral5: that can be costly if @H q off.|pg||
nt|toral5: presuming defence wont allow @D ruff,helness does have a problm here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|swanson: I don't think 3NT should be a slam try over 2NT on this auction.  North could always cue bid.|pg||
nt|jkotor: and I think we have the end of the story now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i do not know it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but someone will have give it for sure|pg||

pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: not good|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: 12|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
mc|11|nt|hedyg: specs saying only 1 way to play @c, and only 1 way to play @H and he didnt?|pg||
nt|dburn: the Director may well take the view that anyone who took the danger play of running the queen of hearts would not take the safety play of  cashing the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he claimed 11|pg||

nt|othered1: Why would he want to play for 5 tricks,if there's a safer line for 4, losing only to @Cj10xx behind KQ?|pg||

nt|jkotor: I dont believe slam tries opposite 1NT from the passed hand :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i think its "white cliffs" as the local cockneys say|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He "knows" spades are 4-2 after the double so the finesse seems called for|pg||

mb|1D|nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Yes, there is a risk but it is surely with the odds to finesse|pg||
nt|algraves: more NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said YOU ARE 2 DOWN|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as usual I got that wrong |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in either round of 32 or 16  Nickell team was down 40 with 7 or 8 to play -- and here they are |pg||
mb|1H|nt|kareno: I usually try 'one down' when I'm aboutt five down :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
mb|3D|nt|odysseus69: 1h- t/fer= 2 spades - a weak NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 2@S was too high I think|pg||
nt|norby: kickback is convention at 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now even 47-0 isn't enough, on the other hand, they have more boards to get the missing IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: According to the Rule of 15, Helness has an opener. HCP + spades must add up to at least 15 if you go by Pesrson's Rule|pg||
nt|toral5: match getting closer now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pearson's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S   looks 1 over the top |pg||
pc|h7|nt|swanson: Without the redouble 2@S would be invitational; now it is preemptive.|pg||
nt|algraves: on the claim, Hampson told Meck that there was no chance for extra spade trick KQ< KQX of HX south|pg||
nt|algraves: Well done Brad Moss, a good slice of luck to Diamond and good play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the lead|pg||
nt|jkotor: no K|pg||
nt|jkotor: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will not be sticking their necks out during the auction now, after the previous good results.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: everyone stares at the dummy|pg||
nt|ady: a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|algraves: lucky 6|pg||
nt|tlc: finally an easy hand for everyone...altho only 5 was made at the other table|pg||
nt|udo: yes, with all finesses wrong looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: The try looks dubious facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the good old days this would have been a passout. 12 aceless 4333 was no opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1892|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia waiting for hamman to lead|pg||
nt|jtr: @c lead may help a little|pg||

pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to David Birman|pg||
nt|davidb: hi  again |pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On a serious note, it is no crime to pass the East hand in 1st vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|udo: maybe that lead helps in @c, but still down , imo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i lost the play... i had to close the screen|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think they lead the 10 from this holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Ginossar went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and i had to protect the screen|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: might've played @d to the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky zia claimed quickly 2 down|pg||
nt|udo: since the round of last 16,,when u go to restroom, u get an bodyguard:))|pg||
nt|jtr: A couple of singles passed the slips for Wolfson|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all of those weaned on weak nt would not consider a move over 2 spades- |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west is back now|pg||
nt|udo: playing weak NT it goes prob. 1NT pass pass pass|pg||
nt|rv: here Hampson's X shows primary @c+@hs possibly, 2n would have primary @cs+@ds|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rmb1: Back now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the surface e-w cards look good for 4 hearts - but the 4-1 trump break means curtains - kind of game everyone is bidding|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|algraves: Yes I guess it is possible to misquess diamonds if west plays low and you put in ten|pg||
nt|kareno: Only way I can see making only five is with Ace and a diamond led.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 probably the right card though|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps..actually the percentage play|pg||
nt|algraves: 9|pg||
nt|rv: good stop though even this might be too high on trump shift now|pg||
nt|algraves: so even with a trump switch Hampson can guess @H for three tricks and down one losing trick in each suit|pg||
nt|athene: trump shift is very good, kills two possible tricks in dummy (ruff, @DK)|pg||
nt|norby: somepeople prefere 3 club at double over 2 spades, but double is perfect bidding for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck in the tank now|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding is revealing - they know north has something like 7411|pg||
nt|algraves: a " bad buy " as they say for Hampson|pg||
nt|rv: I like X to show @c+@hs and 2n to show @cs+@ds|pg||
nt|algraves: picture Greco with @C K and @H Q|pg||
nt|athene: if the double shows hearts and clubs, maybe south should bid 2nt, saying "i am not sure if we want to play clubs or diamonds"|pg||
nt|athene: i am just looking for ways to play 3@C rather than forcing yourself unnecessarily to 4@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: well i have a feeling they have discussed this and that 3@D is the bid that is in compliance with the partnership agreement|pg||
nt|norby: club is the best come back|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table...stil thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: while we are waiting. a lot of messages on the auction. Hampson was prepared to show a strong @C overcall|pg||
nt|stewball: it seems fred bid 7 knowing he was missing the trump Q|pg||
nt|stewball: maybe he was expecting a trump lead or hamman/zia to bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly right John -- with big lead, try to maintain parity    or so they say|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fred had a great first board when Meckwell went down in slam, so it seems a little strange that he bid the grand slam if he knew they were off @HQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|toral5: cd easily have been an ALL PASS brd:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|toral5: helness did wel to open here as the cards lie|pg||
nt|algraves: he was always willing to " bid it out to 4@C" looking for the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|rv: good defense|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tlc: wins with QT or AT on, only loses to AQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzta: east thinking|pg||
nt|ady: if the spades were played as shown this nearly slipped through|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thinking some more|pg||
nt|rmb1: East can see cards are not good for declarer, but still anything could be the wrong thing to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is getting very impatient now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: writing notes to the cameraman...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east put the cards on the table and thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia shaking his had |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: head|pg||
nt|algraves: sorry not vul but looking for game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play again, but Zia says nasty, nasty|pg||
nt|jkotor: easy -1 now, everything clear|pg||
nt|swanson: Zia needs both club honors (3-3) to his left - with than assumption the @SK is almost certainly offside.|pg||
nt|jkotor: only chance for E is AK@c in partners hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia leads a low club to the queen and it wins|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: folks on North's double, do you prefer some form of sohl by South hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least he can't get hearts wrong as the 10 drops if he plays to the jack. No entry to dummy to get it wrong later|pg||
nt|norby: now play diamond hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: well he can play low to 9 as well|pg||

nt|yuval10: i guess 4|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Mecksroth took zero time to play that a guess is a guess , lets get on to the next board|pg||
nt|algraves: he probably always plays it that way|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, his partnership has little think time to spare :)|pg||
nt|udo: zia 1 @H:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 looks good to me|pg||
nt|udo: to good for a vuln weaktwo ?|pg||
nt|udo: or weak3|pg||
nt|davidb: E  thunks  they playing with 2 decks of cards|pg||
nt|davidb: think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: NE writing notes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 'thunks'|pg||
nt|udo: 2@D and later 3!@C looks fine, |pg||
mb|4S|nt|jkotor: I m also for X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@h = 5+@s or 11-13 bal, game force|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't think 3@d will confuse NS much|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably best to start with simple 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: an interesting hand coming up, , can ns make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H opening is creative; not sure how many would do that|pg||
nt|udo: dont think 2@D will be passed out,,,after this start|pg||
nt|davidb: nice imaginative bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2NT = @D ?|pg||
nt|kareno: Does 3@d break up their relays if anyone knows?|pg||
nt|udo: but when u have this 2 NT, thats perfect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT likely and that will go down with clubs 3-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad -- wanted to see if Hampson was going to bid 2@S or lebensohl 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: N can bid easy 3@s now|pg||
nt|rv: Meck would have surely defended accurately if this was 3rd or 4th day, this is 12th day for folks who started wth Mixed Pairs:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|odysseus69: what else?|pg||
nt|stoffers: Looks like 9 tricks in either @h or @s here, even only 8 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they make 3?|pg||
nt|bt: helgemo has a tough choice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||
nt|stoffers: he had to bid like he did i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: problm for helgemo here|pg||
nt|yuval10: then S can cuebid and show his great hand against @s suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell writing a book for pachtman |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that Rodwell erred when he covered @C10. That is not correct, it does not matter. The error came when Meck tried to cash @SA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: His opener was not a thing of beauty|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bt: some wouldnt open the south hand, i hear :-)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble is that he might bid 2NT here with shape and little values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, AKQxxx you can show when asked after a weak 2. It's a rare bird but here it is|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tlc: surprised no 4@d cue|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass might've already showed some good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@d voidwood|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's the only reason|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 is not a bad contract without a @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and more writing...i can see 3-4 pages until now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H  2NT  ;  3NT   solid suit|pg||
nt|rv: fatigue does set in|pg||
nt|norby: also rodweel , better no king of club|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he had to exit with @D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Read above :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 9 tricks in @S and 8 in @h |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|bt: @DK looks fairly obvious but who knows|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: his opener needs beauty therapy|pg||
nt|bt: upgrading KQ doubleton, lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8 losers, KQ doubleton, vulnerable. Call me a chicken, but I pass|pg||
nt|toral5: 200 looks bad here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lets see what Helness will say when dummy will come down|pg||
nt|udo: nite all, wish u a great last hands,,,,,,|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine contract, roughly 73.45%, but no luck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all roads were going to lead to 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I ubstracted a little from the 78% because Zia pre-empted|pg||
nt|pelu: but prob same contract in CR - so the % dont count :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bathroom break after this board...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bt: live by the sword ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looooooooooool|pg||
nt|algraves: in that you can save a potential heart finesse to later|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck started writing too now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkotor: some people bid 2@h|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks if it is his lead and then plays the heart king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT 2 keycards outside diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@c now asks non @d kings, but 6@d would ask for @c help specifically|pg||
nt|algraves: east cant lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
nt|udo: work in 5 hours:)|pg||
nt|davidb: good  save vs  4m that makes|pg||
nt|athene: now they have to hurry to cash their diamond|pg||
nt|robinswr: they play all the boards (yesterday and against my team)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzta: he said SOLID OPENER|pg||
pc|s7|nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or  Hvor er din åbningshånd, makker?|pg||
nt|bt: there is a subtle squeeze on east in pointed suit but thats after going one down already|pg||
nt|stoffers: I am surprised that one of the world's best players gets it for his light opening. I think he has played more hands than us together and have an idea of whats best in the long run. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the one you had when you opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nope... english plain|pg||
nt|stoffers: I wouldnt open, but its a border hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now...thinking|pg||
nt|bt: sorry, but i didnt hear anyone critizising|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness I mean|pg||
nt|bt: its a fact that players like meckwell make a good living on light openers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and a lot of sighs|pg||
nt|stoffers: Just 15 specs and some coments that looked like it :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|passell: no problem without trump lead|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will make |pg||
nt|yuval10: N figure up he've heared enough|pg||
nt|athene: not too tricky - danger of discards on spades|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yuval10: after E will fail to lead trump ( from his void ) , 3 @c ruffs will make the contract easily|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|rmb1: I guess declarer loses two hearts and a diamond, but losing spade goes on a heart|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: and 6@s in the CR, so new leaders|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: He is surely much better than the rest of us, but that should not mean that we can't question the opening. No-one critizised him|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It works for him, fine|pg||
nt|toral5: i m sure MOST would pass souths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: dont care about the spect - they are spect and Helgemo the player :)|pg||
nt|toral5: no question of criticizing at all|pg||
nt|bt: now the other question is how to get away with light openers like this in a natural framework and no conventions, thats a mystery to me|pg||
nt|toral5: meckwell will SURELY open|pg||
nt|toral5: and so will versace:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because they judge so well and are great card players, Lars|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he gave a distinct look to the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|toral5: ya i agree they are super card players|pg||
nt|pelu: opening is the best attack - and u dont have a 2@D overcall later on 5 cards suit and vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in hand now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stoffers: so, spade is best now, but he cant shorten himself enough can he?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: again,,Meckwell flatten it|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bt: one down is good bridge they say|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|stoffers: But this is two down, wich isnt that good bridge :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why is it 2 down?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Virtually same difference in the other semi-final. Diamond up by 26|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Maybe I missed something|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|pelu: @S ruff, @D to A @S-ruff, @CA and @D - then East must him him the last 2 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe it is now, but if he had led a diamond instead of cashing @HA I can see 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: push|pg||
nt|yuval10: he can very well claim now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno: Style points for pitching @h k|pg||
nt|tlc: well bid and played|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @c and @c was an endplay rather than Q@C|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|8|pg||
qx|c23|st||md|1S8H93DAQJT9852CK3,SKJT2HAJT8D43CA64,S976HKQ62DCJT9752,SAQ543H754DK76CQ8|sv|b|nt|fabsayc: the best example ever was 6@H by zia yesterday|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|othered1: Was that the hand where he lost a grand slam swing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missing trump queen five times he eloped all his small trumps then threw them in with a club to force a trump lead|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: yes, a very lucky hand for the otherwise deserving Diamond team|pg||
nt|othered1: right,that's the one bid to 7@H in other room and made on a lucky trump position after a questionable play by declarer at trick 1|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|othered1: That hand yesterday was KJ v. A107654 or the like with a low trump led thoough the KJ on opening lead.  Declarer played J, which would win if leader had led from trump Q against ...|pg||
nt|othered1: grand, but lose if low lead was from 98xx.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: last night in the closed room, Moss and Gitelman bid to 7 @H which would probably go down except for a heart lead and Rodwell lead a heart.|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the position I just cited, I think.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth told Rodwell that a heart had to be led on that auction, which was a wonderful thing to say to your pd :)|pg||
nt|othered1: But on that hand, the normal play was K first (catering to stiff Q), so it would have made.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is quite a bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Back to  this match -- with over half the match to go, 51 imps isn't decisive, but USA has to get thing into gear after a shaky start here, with Israel playing solidly.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually is offering a choice|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Lee tilts his chair backward upon seeing the 3 nt bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@S is a bit conservative, but red suits look badly placed|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: Many players would have precluded EW's 3N by their opening bids.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slight problem for defense, north has no diamond to lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this should go down of course|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphztb: I have not caught Lee's cards as his hand is covering them:(|pg||
nt|othered1: Sii if east can make this.  He likely has all of south's honors placed, except maybe @CJ.|pg||
nt|othered1: see if . . . |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: after the run of spades, east lead a low diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then heart and club shift|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Lee then returned the king of clubs|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|o24|st||md|2S87HAT8D8652CAJ84,SK2H543DK94CQ7653,SQJT64HKQJ6DJT7C9,SA953H972DAQ3CKT2|sv|o|nt|jkotor: now sth more interesting|pg||
nt|odysseus69: mmmm|pg||
nt|swanson: The problem is they won't be able to improve on the result.|pg||
nt|bt: i would think ns at the other table would bid similarily|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he asked Becker : 3 spades and 4 diamons ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: answer YES... Helnes : i can do one better|pg||
nt|ady: mis fit|pg||
nt|rmb1: Robinson need more than pushes|pg||
nt|yuval10: have to go now - thanks all and see you later!|pg||
nt|kareno: Thank you!!|pg||
nt|athene: one point worth a mention is hampson's choice of 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are gathering speed here|pg||
nt|rv: this is not Buffett Cup scoring still 1 IMP may just be crucial in final analysis:)|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a GF balanced hand it can work much better to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thats wonderful|pg||
nt|algraves: I will hire John as my lawyer and sue the rules committee|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back to play now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: 4@d and what after 4@s?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: desperate measures- but even then 7 spades is so much|pg||
nt|algraves: you know edgar Kaplan did an exhaustive study and found that big club pairs slam bidding was better if the opponents got into your auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- rather than guessing  how's our game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bt: 1@H-D-2H-2S maybe|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4 to zimmerman on 22, where i think 2@h is a much better bid than 1NT. Quite deserved then..:)|pg||
nt|algraves: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: in R-M precision it just shows clubs or balanced, might be only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: it is hard enough as it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: we can all see 7@S makes, but it is going to be very difficult even to get to six|pg||
nt|swanson: It is possible that N-S will push to a grand, knowing they are behind big time.  But the bidding is starting at a high level.  |pg||
nt|bt: 1@H-D-2@H-2@S i mean lol|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@S/5@D save in picture;but 5@H also making|pg||
nt|stoffers: will Helgemo bid 2@s?|pg||
nt|bt: well i would think so|pg||
nt|stewball: would surely corrupt the endgame|pg||
mb|1N|an|alerted|nt|vugraphzta: he just did|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 6 at least now|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d X 4@d X at other table|pg||
nt|algraves: its like the shootout in hockey who needs it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it offers too much shooting, but maybe it is just another form of competition  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|rmb1: 7 card fit in all of West's suits|pg||
nt|odysseus69: laydown game on minimal values|pg||
nt|stewball: any 4@s bidders as S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: both tables at least in 6|pg||
nt|stoffers: Note Helness double here, if he is gonna pull a 2@c bid for Geir to 2@d, it wouldnt show extras|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: down 2 = 300/450|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You were wrong re 23, Lars. Brogeland passed the South cards|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a game force you should never bid 1spade over 1 heart with only four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: A big bid by Zia.  He was evidently planning to bid 4@S over 4@H.  But would that show another place to play or would it be a strong had with spades?|pg||
nt|swanson: hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double showed spades|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell 1n shows 11-13 here?|pg||
nt|stewball: i mean any other 4@s bidders:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: may be a namyat 4@C would have shut out north from entering|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: both tables in 5@d NS now :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will they know what 4NT means - time for spades now|pg||
nt|kareno: \i didn't know that.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in game now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|toral5: but strul did wel to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes N opening is light in hcps|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it sure looks like an opening hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jkotor: 6@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: both|pg||
nt|swanson: This would be uncharted waters for most partnerships.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if South bids 5@S now, North may well bid 7 - no, 6@C |pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzta: not finished|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was more positive than pass- enough for Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman looking for action...asking questions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment hamman writing stuff for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|norby: yes 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|pelu: why 4@C from Zia - just to be sure that S will play the @Ss correct?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|swanson: Now 6@S and then 7@S?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: time for spaes now|pg||
nt|bt: aha ... lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he passed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only hopr for defence is if Zia decides to play anti-odds for K doubleton club with West - no chance really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is too flat to act|pg||
pc|s7|nt|algraves: game bidding harder|pg||
nt|rv: now defense can cash 8 black suit tricks|pg||
nt|norby: club now or never...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: surely this must be a 2-suiter  |pg||
nt|jtr: He will eliminate first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forgetting he was going to be on lead ??|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|stewball: he likely assumed a 5 level decision was coming|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jkotor: for a push|pg||
nt|rv: Greco's @d3 would be some form of smith echo?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: 7@S not super after the 3@D bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can establish a third club trick but no entries|pg||
nt|jtr: So losing to Kx wont matter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Jack for spade switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not yet|pg||
nt|stewball: and wanted some help|pg||
pc|hA|nt|algraves: nice lead by greco as he reads the auction well|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: last pass from Hamman was very quick- should have at least given it a thought|pg||
nt|swanson: Evidently Hamman knew how little Zia might have for the auction.  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: not good at all except that it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia unwrapped another cough drop before the dummyhit the table|pg||
nt|jkotor: what if Zia have: QJxx xxx x AQTxx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East and West get some water while Zia contemplates the hand|pg||
nt|swanson: But maybe he could hold: xxxx, Qx, x, AQJxxx?  Nothing is clear after the 3@D opening.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||
nt|swanson: He had something to say about Philadelphia also.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: contrary to popular belief in constructive auctions Zia usually has his bid - he embarks on some psychological adventures but they are the exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wouldn't W.C. Fields rather be here in Philadelphia?|pg||
nt|pelu: EW in 4@S over 4@H in CR|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S fine for me - @HK = no value opp partners singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck did bid 4@S over similar auction  [Gitelman 3@D instead of 3@H]|pg||
nt|algraves: now he knows his partner has 5@S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: 4@sX|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Yes, they did get to 4@H regardless, but East 'saved'|pg||
nt|toral5: this means it wil be a small pick up for struls team|pg||
nt|norby: finesse in hearts for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: with diamonds 3-3  will make   |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds carefully from the right hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe @DA now to see if partner can overruff dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D2 must mean yes|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d7|pc|cK|nt|ady: but will cash diamond and exit with club      |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rv: he couldn't have possibly asked for @h continuation if they are playing rev smith echo (lo-hi in declarer's suit asks partner to continue)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: excellent defense|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|algraves: so he cant quite handle it at this point|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|algraves: very strong result for Hampson Greco|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: I think that's what he said about dying....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: Roland described Bocchi commentating today as a "scoop"|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he intended @d3 as asking for @c shift since @h continuation can't be right with @hAKQ9 in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did and I mean it|pg||
nt|norby: scoop??|pg||
nt|rv: Geoff possibly misread the signal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, don't you understand that word?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a compliment|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is notoriously difficult to defend if no suits have been mentioned - here we see it's even hard when the bidding has been a bit more revealing|pg||
nt|norby: of course|pg||
nt|rmb1: Oops - was private|pg||
nt|norby: like italian, same word sccoop|pg||
nt|rv: Norby commenting here is like Nadal commenting on Federer in Wimbledon final:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: K&R (QJT64 KQJ6 JT7 9) = 10.75 |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|swanson: His tombstone reads somthing like: on the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: boards running out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Martens jokingly tried to overruff with the Queen of spades and then showed his other card lol|pg||
nt|kareno: No|pg||
nt|algraves: he needed diamonds 3-2 |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: there was no way out for defence    if Zia plays a club   can win   cash diamonds and exit with club|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Zia : i could have dbled for spade lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and all laughing|pg||
nt|norby: because i comment? this is scoop?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are back in play now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Traian|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: this a more solid 1@D ...|pg||
nt|toral5: 200?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because you know what you are talking about|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Gredo-Hampson would discuss defensive signalling on @h and @d suit in the post-mortem|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: plus 200?|pg||
nt|pelu: it will double the IMP-swing for the match :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you have been there, done that|pg||
nt|rv: Greco|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|pelu: that 4@C from Zia looks desperat :)|pg||
nt|algraves: Greco was able to deduce that Hampson doubled on the sort of hand he had|pg||
nt|algraves: and led Ace of @C to keep the ruffing option open in case declarer void in @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N or make mild slam try with @D?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok slam again|pg||
nt|stewball: they should have the tools to 6@d here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kareno: Or KQ doubleton of hearts west |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slam even without @HQ, so Hampson will investigate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 4@sX - 1 = 200|pg||
nt|toral5: its 2 down.both NV|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3@s|pg||
nt|stoffers: or rkcb |pg||
nt|ady: may get too high in spades|pg||
nt|stewball: N will show max for @ds and now S is huge|pg||
mb|1N|nt|toral5: so 450 plus and 300 minus for strul|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: This is a great 3NT from the West side.  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: another easy game  just what Martens team wants|pg||
nt|bt: south has some plus and some minus here|pg||
nt|toral5: after a long time we have a slam|pg||
nt|pelu: can Greco give super-accept?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is|pg||
nt|pelu: yes a normal accept - 2NR could be weak or strong|pg||
nt|algraves: this is not the sort of hand to play NT as you want to either ruff a @H if dummy has doubleton |pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play that 2N can also include weak 5@C & 5@D  so 3@C says  i don't like @D  3@D says I like|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|algraves: or use you trumps to ruff out black suit or suits for 12 th trick or to set up squeeze|pg||
nt|algraves: once you find the @D fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: great 7nt here  4-1 diamonds still might make on lie of the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H probably RKC @D    hmmm   4N Quant??|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@D mini-roman, 4441 opening values (with @D).  |pg||
nt|pelu: I would have a problem now - we play that 3 in major now is a short suit :(|pg||
nt|algraves: of course 6NT makes as the percentage play in @H is low to Q and if it loses finesse the ten next time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D: good for diamonds - 3@c would be less fit/hand|pg||
nt|algraves: but 6@D laydown for one of the 3 good reasons to prefer the suit contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fay thought for a while and....passed|pg||

nt|stoffers: 4@S rkcb I GUESS|pg||
nt|jtr: Hamman may stick this with good @ss|pg||
nt|rv: I would have opened 1@h with North hand|pg||
nt|pelu: is 4Nt balanced slaminvit in @D?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bt: it is difficult bidding slam w Axxxxx opposite Kxxx when missing an ace, and asking for aces |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked if 6nt is quantitative|pg||
nt|passell: surprised w didnt bid 3diamonds first|pg||
nt|kareno: Me too - 6nt is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wofson back in the lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: bad rebid over 1nt|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|algraves: South could have made last hand if he chose to believe @D K as singleton, we leave it to you at home to work it out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: claiming and not playing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant say I admire the 2NT bid but no doubt all will be well|pg||
nt|jtr: Things lie well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Friendly lie for Zia|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like|pg||
pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: 2C alerted - maybe non-forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell gave him 12 tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: 8 red tricks 4 blacks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar to the bathroom now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: waiting for him|pg||
nt|kareno: Reminds me of the old joke, "For the first time all day we know what he has in his hand!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol...pachtman wants another trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking them about their distributions|pg||
nt|jtr: So Zia may go down:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe that is right about 4N  Peter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Greco can't have more than he has. 1NT is 14-16|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jkotor: yup, in Poland level 2 in NF|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not the way to sit on a lead |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a great slam and one has to congratulate them on bidding it|pg||
nt|bt: so helgemo detected Kxxx or so opposite|pg||
nt|bt: yes wd ns|pg||
nt|toral5: nice slam to bid|pg||
nt|toral5: i think easy for north to bid aftr hearing a nat 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jkotor: unless you play transfers, but not here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Easy?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped low    but not in best spot    assume 2@D  3 suited  but singleton unknown to west|pg||
nt|robinswr: if 2clubs asks for 4-card major hampson should bid 2spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fay in the tank|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice duck|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|jkotor: seems 10 back, 20 left|pg||
nt|swanson: Jassem didn't like his @DK in a club contract, but still - partner made a big bid and it is a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nly 2 cards were played and Jassem claimed 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but only 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: everyone is talking except Hamman|pg||
nt|toral5: not easy to splinter/cue?|pg||
nt|bt: it is tempting to play diamonds by north|pg||
nt|toral5: easy i meant for taking control;NOT bidding slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo showing his hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol Steve|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson likes to open 1NT , anyway it is what their partnership does and they have done pretty well I would say|pg||
nt|norby: absoluty dont like 1 nt with 5-4 majors and 2 ace second........for me is terrible but........i undestand 2 king second|pg||
nt|robinswr: he can't pass 1nt because greco would bid 1nt with 12 semi forcing|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: it is so frustrating when you bid a suit and pd does lead it and leads your singleton instead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rmb1: No 2@D is any 4441 - hence 2@H to play opposite @H|pg||
nt|norby: hampson play in the final and i stay in my house, so is better 1nt with 5-4 majors:-)))|pg||
nt|algraves: there is that|pg||
nt|hedyg: he probably thinks N has 4@ss and pd void|pg||
pc|h3|nt|robinswr: he upgraded to 14-16 |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson just claimed 10|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a vindictive great shuffler would mirror the round suit distribution|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I think Martens thought he had forced to game - |pg||
nt|rmb1: Could also be any 5440|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 5 to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 6 to score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so 120 instead of probable 100 v 2S|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jkotor: if K@d in @h slam is cold, good try by Martens|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: board 29 will be our last one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also 29 difference in the other match, Diamond up against Wolfson|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tlc: hard to find the 4@S sac after this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zimmerman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the women's final, China are up by 26 against the Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: hands are offering little scope for swings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond against Zimmermann of course, sorry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many will say that when Nickell came back from the dead against Martens he was destined to win the event|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know to bid 2@H with 5 card fit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: may end in 3NT    will need to play on spades for 2 tricks to make   on a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C nat forcing (inverted)|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia knows they may be pushing|pg||
nt|algraves: still a few boards to go but the Diamond team has played extremely well, all things considered as they play in their 12 th straight day|pg||
nt|algraves: perhaps they have been a little luckier but not by much and they are full value for their big lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: the jack is normal, Zia confirms|pg||
nt|jkotor: low @d is for the bulletin :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: and it works :)|pg||
nt|algraves: so the misdefense on 24 cost 6|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you open you have to think about your rebid and sometimes you have to open wrong to avoid a bad rebid|pg||
nt|rv: classical 3n response on 1M precision opening, showing 13-15 with 3M cog|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzta: rodwell had the paper in his pocket|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: this really has to be a flat board- he needed to underlead the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W are not feeling so comfortable as they were early in the set - they have given back at least a couple game swings.|pg||
nt|jkotor: meckwell need swings, lets wait for their move|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 IMPs to Strul on board 23   200 + 200|pg||
nt|pelu: so board 23 was 9 IMP for Strul|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: showing 4333 13-15, cog|pg||
nt|rv: choice of game (COG)|pg||
nt|algraves: I suspect they regular count and attitude trick one|pg||
nt|robinswr: on the lead of ace they  play standard signals|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: reco thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco|pg||
nt|algraves: he is looking for 3 more tricks|pg||
nt|norby: double squeeze make 6|pg||
nt|rv: did Meck tell him he is playing for only extra tricks here as well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck said i am not going down|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.i was discussing with pelu cos i thought he is referring to brd 24|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all laughing about Helness diamond suit|pg||
nt|ady: been asked if Zia can open 1@D  anyone know|pg||
nt|algraves: it is critical to make a play now based on some view of where you can take 3 more tricks|pg||
nt|rv: can he always be trusted?, just kidding I am sure these guys have healthy respect for each other:)|pg||
nt|algraves: ah out of misery|pg||
nt|robinswr: meck can be trusted|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: how did he guess that correctly??|pg||
nt|stewball: going wrong there would make for a much more interesting hand...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzta: 70 imps with 5 to score|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|odysseus69: maybe underlead in CR?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can only guess that 1@D denies a balanced hand|pg||
nt|jtr: But it isnt really Rosenberg's style|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play a spade early|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: It makes if Ginossar plays the king|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: woow|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: got to play low  or 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How is he supposed to know?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They lead low from any 3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First to 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: then he has do duck to 3. tme and play N for @CA|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell also in 6@D|pg||
nt|peachy: a quiet push board for change|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bt: i made an extensive analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yesterday we 14 brd rounds|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hehe, i didnt, i saw it before :)|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 6@C coming up now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had|pg||
nt|algraves: so a NT partscore for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meck|pg||
nt|tlc: a kibitzer mentioned that Helness played this in 5@h and got a @H lead!  still guessed it right|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: reckon they will have cause to regret board 21  |pg||
nt|toral5: lucky i wd say|pg||
nt|algraves: he would have eventully switched to @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: He never gets to play in his solid suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's better than 50%|pg||
nt|bt: minor suit slams are not the strength of standard systems imho|pg||
nt|rv: possibly @DT as well|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Why is that lucky?|pg||
nt|toral5: very thin 1@H here|pg||
nt|davidb: something to say against leading low from  3 small in this typical situation .|pg||
nt|norby: play king of hearts, make 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@hD = 800 :)|pg||
nt|bt: 4@H cue stands out, and is strangely symmetric|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: West could D = extra vaues - and East could pass|pg||
nt|ady: North happy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for sure|pg||
nt|tlc: bd 26|pg||
nt|kareno: Ira Rubin used to call notrumps, "grabbits,"  first to bid them grabs them :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzta: Zia waggled the one spade bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with very different sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 4@H = i have extras, hearts controlled and am interested in higher, could that be wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room is being broadcasted in the VG theatre|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so we have a lot of cameras around us|pg||
nt|stoffers: I think most top pairs wil reach 6@c on this hand. So many points and trumps together. Hard to find out its on a finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Certain symmetry.  East has AQ... in South's suit, so bids the suit that North has AQ.... and noone can bid any more|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: and 2 cameramans|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bt: problem w 3@S is that it is ambigious|pg||
nt|toral5: most pairs will surely land in 6@C|pg||
nt|toral5: atleast the top ones|pg||
nt|stoffers: går an å spille på ja|pg||
nt|rv: 1@C is strong @c, double by Meckstorth shows 5-8 in classical precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Sry, that was private, meaning he COULD go down playing N for K@h and Q@s|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H by west wd have made life easy for becker i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I assume 2@H agrees clubs without 4 spades, so 3@S is not natural, is it?|pg||
nt|toral5: 6@C does have a play.he might play for a vienna coup on north|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i did not notice an alert|pg||
nt|toral5: and as the cards are the roof will fall|pg||
nt|toral5: with @S q IN|pg||
nt|bt: thats a good point, the devious 1@H may lead him wrong|pg||
nt|bt: when south has @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, a losing option|pg||
nt|toral5: and full chances to go wrong cos of THAT super thin 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: after the bidding is best chance the sueeeze when S show @DA - but will Strul play for that?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker still thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy for us to see what's right because we have all 52 cards to look at|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and stil thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hear that Kit Woolsey got it wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He played for the squeeze|pg||
nt|toral5: did kit recieve a 1@H oc?|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 2nt opening is 19-20|pg||
nt|algraves: no big deal but note that the overcall by Hampson did not hurt their bidding gave away information|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|rv: folks who themselves play precision generally don't like to Intefere with artificial methods like CRASH/Suction against others who play precision, possibly some sympathy for ...|pg||
nt|rv: comrades:)|pg||
nt|norby: more easy after 1 heart overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: does greco have singleton heart honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell stil thinking|pg||
nt|norby: i dont understand why greco dont bidding 2 diamond.......|pg||
nt|rv: I believe Greco-Hampson play Mathe against strong @c, Hampson could have doubled to show majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Discard a @H and play @H|pg||
nt|stewball: note that N didnt dbl 2@d|pg||
nt|algraves: he played Meckstroth to have 4@H and not throw the third one when dummy had only one left. he made an error|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: Fay seems to think there is a real @H fit in E|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fay in the tank|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty unlikely after the 2@c bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|toral5: ouch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: EW had it all to themselves in that room|pg||
nt|bt: winning imps against robinson, lol|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 25 only 4 out of 8 pairs bid the fine 6@c - not top-standard :(|pg||
nt|rv: he chose to bid 1@h and hide his @s suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: this will need some play|pg||
nt|jkotor: I think Cayne 14 imps behind after board 25, other Polish (Balicki-Zmudzinski) with Lauria-Versace trying hard|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are way too high - but there was little chance of stopping in time.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant make 4 spades whatever defence does|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia explaining that he can bid 1 NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is why he wiggled or waggled the 1 @S bid|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|bt: some suffer after 1@D-(1@S) when 2@C is not forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul did not play but Helgemo already preapred diamond ace for play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Woolsey opened a Precision 2@C and then North was out of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: prepared|pg||
nt|bt: what was explanation of 4NT?|pg||
nt|davidb: entry problem for finessing twice|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|swanson: The lack of spade spots meant there was little play and with unfavorable diamond situation this will be down several.|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: This wont look easy from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|pelu: I would X - and then play against 2@DX - making|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzta: do not know|pg||
nt|toral5: 4nt alerted as?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: it was alerted|pg||
nt|norby: with the cards of hampson i prefere bid heart and spades , like 2 club or double against club strong or PASS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: needs 6  trump tricks but  not quite possible|pg||
nt|norby: is strange that me and the pair american play so different:-))))|pg||
nt|stewball: no trumps to lead and not many quick tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rmb1: There are 15 boards per segment, 60 in each match.  This final segment ends with board 30|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: Pitch @d then @c|pg||
nt|rv: if you have to get in, I much prefer double to show majors|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: 3 more tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|algraves: private|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: Birman in CR did not bid 2@c, he passed but they still got to 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the trick...no kidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: we believe you :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: Oh|pg||
pc|s3|nt|toral5: becker surely dint take it as rkcb in @C in leiu of bidding 5c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe club to jack?|pg||
nt|jtr: Mind you South cant attack @ds to advanat|pg||
nt|jtr: advantage|pg||
nt|jtr: As finesses are taken into him|pg||
nt|algraves: so this reveals all to Rodwell who now knows entire shape|pg||
pc|sK|nt|swanson: I am told that GIB says it can be made - but GIB has the hand record.|pg||
nt|kareno: Ten of hearts looked like suit preference.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|algraves: as Hampson did not continue diamond he had only one|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|bt: some wise commentators suggested 4@H, that might have simplified things, lol|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jkotor: open cards maybe could won|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bt: playing for the squeeze in 6@C is antipercentage but if you are down to a good team maybe its good strategy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he claimed saying i cash ak of spades in q will fall i make 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: if q will fal......|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: makeas the same 6 tricks in hearts |pg||
nt|rmb1: more symmetry|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: the heart queen coming down in 3 must help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm i was sure Zia decided he wanted to continue the tap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which i think leads to down 2    but don't quote me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman stil thinking|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said I am going to make and now explaining|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: inundated with corrections to my error     continued @D play just lets Greco score small trump|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|nt|vugraphztb: the director comes in to check on the pace and it gets louder in the hallway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the face of 1@H was mildly surprising, clearly limited overcalls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass not face|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Fournier has bid 1 @S and Birman is thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: when I double with that hand, partner things I have actual values and we wind up in some number of @D,usually suboptimal.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm referring to pass over 11H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, but i would try 2@C with birman hand over 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Birman is tapping his fingers and scratching his head|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S!|nt|fabsayc: now he is really stuck, good hand, no bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Birman kind of waggled his fingers over the 2 @S bid, but it was clearly alerted by West|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: 3@H is beatable|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Fournier passed and Birman is again thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|othered1: North is the one who has gone right here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a routine double, although there were many i thought routine in rosenblum that were not made|pg||

nt|toral5: is this 14 brd segment?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness said MADE 5|pg||
nt|bt: no 15brds|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had a bathroom break here|pg||
nt|algraves: so it seems the club finesse was safe at that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: very difficult for VG when in the middle of play this happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set now|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board now Traian?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to our excellent operator in Philadelphia ,Traian , great job!; great job!to my talented fellow commentators Raija Davis, David Burn and Joey Silver for donating their ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to guide us through this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will be back in 50mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well to the WBF for allowing BBO to broadcast from this prestigious event, especially to Hervé Lustman who has been instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
nt|peachy: The isreal tem has dominated this set|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all for joining and for your helpful comments and messages.we hope you enjoyed the show. |pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Hedy and Traian|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bt: they say, lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: back in play now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|swanson: Zia should have cashed the heart early - guess he can make then.|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@H EW|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 boards - now Nickell need more that 1 miracle :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzta: Zia talking about the last hand and coughing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you kibitzers, you are the sole reason we have vugraphs!!!|pg||
mb|4C|an|alerted|nt|stoffers: first trick, J@c-Q@c-K@c. then 2 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think we can congratulate Nickell team|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we start 30 minutes later than the BBO schedule|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: 4@s NS?|pg||
nt|jkotor: NS can put EW into 5@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: W cannot pas 4@s :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem apparently explaining about possible hands for Martens|pg||
nt|bt: unless decl goes up ace off course|pg||
nt|bt: dont know why he would though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 3nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will Zia find another bisd?|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Greco did not reopen double with lightish values and a void. ONe needs to avoid re opening with voids as your defense is really limited|pg||
nt|hedyg: geez Raija and i thought it was for the commentators!|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jtr: Will Hamman?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: of course|pg||
nt|rv: Traian you are doing a terrific job|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: or 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, 6@c plays quite well for EW, too |pg||
nt|stoffers: I am soooo glad noone ever taught me jack denies...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: NS make 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 2@H guarantees 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks like a make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzta: the cards are going too fast for me and he claims|pg||
nt|swanson: This might be another ten for Nickell - it is easy to imagine that N-S would double a 'save' of 5@C against 4@S.|pg||
nt|rmb1: This should be quick|pg||
nt|kareno: Competing for the partscore. and happy to push e/w up a level.|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this was very fast at the table|pg||
nt|tlc: the balance has now secured a plus position for NS|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell reluctant to lead A of @S of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell thinking now|pg||
nt|algraves: but wont lead a red suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzta: Zia says that they can make 4 @S lol|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is consdiering a Tref|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: of course lol|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heart lead into heart bidder - often best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are bidding like juniors... they are in heat 1 and they know it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jtr: my grandmother would turn in her grave  3NT with 22 points|pg||
nt|jtr: Great lead though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C checkback  2@D  2-5-3-3|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bt: sometimes too much knowledge is bad, i agree|pg||
pc|c8|nt|algraves: finally goes with partners suit|pg||
nt|jtr: But West has a lot of discards to make|pg||
pc|c9|nt|stoffers: i am just a wizard..shal i tka the next 10 tricks also, lool|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Greco-Hampson bid a 3NT on a combined 20 count earlier. It was cold|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: try 1 @D first, just 1!|pg||
nt|peachy: This will be another swing for Israel team|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then claim :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I srael had a very good set|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jtr: I would have thought this was rather dangerous by Hamman  Could neasily run into a double if @ds arent behaving|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: Still, Zia could have more|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves: and is pleased|pg||
nt|jtr: Much prefer 3@d to 2NT with the offsuit holdings|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West has no problem finding 5 discards so this must be 1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D7 lead is Zia -- not systemic|pg||
pc|c5|nt|algraves: he want to signal diamond thru|pg||
nt|tlc: there's always the saying that "it's hard to lose the post-mortem by leading partner's suit"|pg||
nt|algraves: rather than a trump promotion|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stoffers: wasn't it zia that mentioned that convention in 'bridge my way' ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: +1 when @SQ appears|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks     some will play in 4@H   which will also make   in spite of  a ruff in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia claiming |pg||
nt|algraves: this guarantees his 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|norby: yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|algraves: although it doesnt matter what meck does|pg||
nt|algraves: so he takes safe course|pg||
pc|d4|nt|toral5: heading for 4 losers in trump suit now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|norby: 100 %|pg||
nt|algraves: he can force re entry to his hand via @C QJ|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems they announced next set in 20 minutes in the VG theater|pg||
pc|cT|nt|algraves: no reason not to finesse that I can see|pg||
nt|jtr: He seems to have a problem already|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: no just planning all 5|pg||
nt|algraves: always start with 9 in mind in 3NT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|stoffers: wich is the best book out there (exept the menagerie ofcource)|pg||
nt|algraves: then go from there|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|davidb: the  bidding was ok. the lead  was not friendly-spade|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|othered1: Thanks, Ala, nice presentation and keeping us informed of table activities :)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: tough hand, 5@D cold, 3nt beatable|pg||
nt|othered1: potentially -300 on @C lead, with lots of tricks in @D available|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: auction, however, makes @C lead iffy|pg||
nt|othered1: low @C back here also good enough for large set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club shift should be found|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Birman thinking and Lee looks towards me as I type|pg||
nt|othered1: 2 then west must win and return low @C, a very good, but possible defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any other defense needs more from partner|pg||
nt|othered1: South hasn't guaranteed @D that good or long, has he?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if east returns a spade west can still shift to a low club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he bid 2@C, should have 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but for only -1 and again it's not clear declarer has and will take 45@D tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so playing partner for a diamond trick (needed for spade return to work) is a long shot|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Birman settles into his seat to think some more|pg||
nt|othered1: As per some actions in the Rosenbloom by standard bidders, south could h ave 4@D-5@C (not my style)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: They lead middle from 3?  wonder what they lead from 4-2?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: I was wondering the same thing about the 4 @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low presumably|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: it does not solve this problem whatever you lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||

pc|dA|pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told Ew play reverse signals.  Wonder if that and attitude -- quite important here -- are fully compatible|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: @h was an excellent switch. Guarantees the contract will go down whenever it can be defeated|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d8|nt|othered1: EW still need to take some care|pg||
nt|poohbear: Most declarer can take is 8 red tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes he knows declarer has at most 8 tricks|pg||
