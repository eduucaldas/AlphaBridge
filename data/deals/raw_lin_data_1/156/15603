nt|vugraphzsx: all Dutch players here, so I may not understand much of what is said|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 6 probably|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes six more probable|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzsx: close match 71 to 74 so look for a battle today. |pg||
nt|toral5: unfortunately south CANT get on lead|pg||
nt|toral5: sadek wil make this|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer should play on @D|pg||

nt|toral5: hi osman|pg||
nt|mrt2000: although how N thinks S is going to will a trick is a mystery to me !   lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @C a@H a@S and 2 @D is all i hope|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: gu should play club king to avoid accidents|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: the @S10 also set up an entry to S hand, but not much use for it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|toral5: sadek is in trouble now|pg||

nt|mrt2000: v likely|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room same contract|pg||
nt|chick: N still has the spade to escape an endplay|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W has gone to sleep|pg||
nt|chick: what if she leads a heart and ducks S's 10?|pg||
nt|bobholl: north will overtake and cash 2 down|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S will cash to @S and exit with a @C|pg||
nt|chick: (not that this is obvious to the declarer)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry stupid|pg||
nt|chick: if N overtakes and cashes out, it's only -1|pg||
nt|bobholl: open it was played by E which is much better|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|toral5: he cd stil have made,if he had preserved a @C on table|pg||
nt|toral5: i think he is down for sure|pg||
pc|cT|nt|blum1956: diamond is best now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might even get out down 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it appears lu will get endplayed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: i guess carla will take no risk and cash 1 down|pg||
nt|chick: is it 100% certain that N knows where the @S7 is?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: think so originally 4th best played back|pg||
nt|mrt2000: the carding at trick 2 told N that|pg||
nt|blum1956: suppose Gu Ling played a heart now. Then seven tricks available|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: only a @S is good now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now declarer must win ,lu must cash diamond and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: we are back in 3rd session in Match Martens-NIckell|pg||
mb|1N|nt|uni_cicam: There was probably an appeal in the first round so 9 more imps for Martens team|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: yes, thanks|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit over strength 2 @H so 6 won't be reached :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hi David|pg||
mb|3H|nt|uni_cicam: 3NT by Kopecky will come|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@S now?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|bobholl: it is 5@S for the vulnarable NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: He thought about it.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@S on a trump guess and NO @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice treatment forcing 3@C by partner for this hand anyway|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: easy 9 tricks so we can relax in the second board|pg||
nt|chick: N knows S is short in hearts :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: They need to make a right choice between 4@s and 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: There goes the @s guess|pg||
nt|davidstern: I was about to ask how about trumps whenever|pg||
nt|toral5: now no guess:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: the defence is in|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 2NT further explained as try for game, single suited...  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: test|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9 are easy only looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1st board was +2 IMPs for Nickell|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sure, but Kopecky will not have any problems with making it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Good for him to take some time in the first boards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|uni_cicam: last sessions proved most happend in the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopacky-Kurka are playing ACOL with 5c @S and 12-14 NT, 2 over 1 is 9+|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: 6 @C doubled in other room |pg||
pc|h6|nt|oosmanb: should still make 3@S, 4@S would need @h to be picked up?|pg||
nt|toral5: he can make 10|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room -500 in 5@H doubled|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure there is one on single dummy basis|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2@s NF after the checkback|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: 5 @S migth have some difficulties :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|uni_cicam: if @H finesse will be wrong, will be difficult to guess @D, but @H K is on side, no problems for Kopecky|pg||
nt|chick: turns out to be a good save for a small gain|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosmanb: For BBO JEC matches fans, Teodorescu is LeRouMain|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect|pg||
nt|bobholl: start with @S won't helkp|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I think it should have gone for 800 mind you|pg||
nt|bobholl: and 4@S will make but is not completely sure yet|pg||
nt|bobholl: bep (vriend) will not be sure she can trump the 2nd @H small|pg||
nt|chick: better to trump the clubs and use @Ds as entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is now, without diamond lead a bit harder|pg||
nt|blum1956: The @cK stays and diamons resolved by the opening lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Bob Holl and Gábor Szõts|pg||
nt|bobholl: help|pg||
nt|cicus: hi Bob|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzsx: cross ruff works well in 5@S, doesnt it?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: South is the one with most @C (almost ) now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: hi difficult hungarian name :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: every player will duck @H K, is there any other line of play?|pg||
nt|cicus: use only the first part :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|uni_cicam: can still loose 3 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: will give ruff :) but nothing essential|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|uni_cicam: cant afford to duck @D now|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess she 'll play Q@H|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: now it helps :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bobholl: marion has a difficult decision now |pg||
nt|bobholl: i think she ''l play a @C to J but just guessing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|toral5: 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: now Vriend's turn to think|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is almost as good as @C to 9|pg||
nt|bobholl: if fred doesn't ruff he will never beleieve it :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: believe|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange that he doesn't play for @H to be 32|pg||
nt|anton72: just safety play....what is strange|pg||
nt|caitlin: strange|pg||
nt|anton72: your point |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mrt2000: play @DA, ruff @H high, draw trump and enjoy the @Ds|pg||
nt|mrt2000: does that work?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but she needs 1 @H trick also|pg||
nt|chick: I think that leaves her 1 trick short|pg||
nt|chick: @DA, @D, @D, crossruff?|pg||
nt|bobholl: so only way is the a@D Q@H |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|bobholl: @H and @D now :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrt2000: no, the cross-ruff works too|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even without a diamond lead the Culbertson finesse in diamonds (best chsnce) works|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is amazing how often a trump lead seemingly loses a trcik but comes back in the play|pg||
nt|bobholl: T of @D and 2@S will take care of @C|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobholl: good guess|pg||

nt|cicus: 2NT may be a 4-card raise - Andrew Robson popularized this method|pg||
nt|bobholl: what has happened to the cuebid = limit or better i agree that 2NT may be conv. but prefer good bad (many people don't agree)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and you can keep an eye on other tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|cicus: those playing 2NT as a 4-card raise use the cue-bid for a 3-card raise|pg||

mb|d|an|alert|nt|cicus: it seems to me that an unlikely spade lead is needed here to prevent EW from making 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Jassem in 4@S west|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this contract has easy 7 tricks so well done by chinese|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: west must count the hands|pg||
nt|lml: diamonds 5-2 you mean|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's true but think it's the best line|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly optimistic 4@D even if the redouble is support (3 crds)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cicus: right you are, should figure it out looking at those clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, declarer has to guess spades to make|pg||

nt|yvesj49: when ace of @h in south seat|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not dangerous -- impossible|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: looking at that dummy, it is a bit surprising Nickell didn't attack @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ducking 1st round of @D gives Martens a losing option next time he plays the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't read them, but i'm told the recently released books authored by Martens are excellent|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: after @H now she'll know|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes, playing natural methods you probably stop in 2@c which is worse than 1NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yvesj49: a@d and @d and it's closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: ace surely and end play N|pg||
nt|bobholl: again "forced"to guess good but she (laura) is under pressure maybe.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't think she'll finesse @C|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|uni_cicam: ducking second @H is not very helpfull, knowing partner has even cards in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S also relies on @C finesse|pg||
nt|davpro: declarer might get back an imp more here|pg||
nt|blum1956: or in 2@s which also may meet problems|pg||
pc|c2|nt|davidstern: I like the 4@H bid as, if the opponents do compete to 4@S you can attend to tht too|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, but 3NT is down after taking @H A, unfortunately no information for S, just a try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck could have started with 5@H - and his quick play of the suit put Kurka in doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well it would need to be specifically @HA and @D or 2nd @C and misguess|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: at least an imp for NS which is also counting|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|cicus: and the X has probably told who has the @SA|pg||
nt|xenya: probably N's double will help|pg||
nt|cicus: we agree here :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: Meck's play gave defense biggest problems|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3/5 leads so no chance to missgues probably|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't think 3/5 leads were allowed in that part of the world  [2nd/4th very common]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: trust me, it is :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   just bad attempt at joke|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: it is around 50/50 in Czech Republic between thee leads|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|chick: with 9 tricks now, finessing would be suicidal|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: now @C shift essential -- but @S8 is entry and trump 22 meant Martens would always prevail|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yvesj49: stange play by west|pg||

nt|bobholl: if she didnt notice the small @C she doesn't know it's 100%|pg||
nt|chick: finessing the club when opp diamonds are established would be silly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H EW, but not clear to reach it|pg||
nt|xenya: this|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 4@S will be too high for N/S|pg||
nt|lml: but she would have already had nine tricks in|pg||
nt|chick: true, after the @H10 set up|pg||
nt|bobholl: 19 imps already without this very good result|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and she might as well take best shot for most overtricks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: convention cards are available online for both pairs   EW from the 2010 USBF Trials,  NS from the 2008 World Championships|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: It is possible to open 2NT for minors in some partnerships, this time it would lead to a fantom save in 5@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why phantom?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'll dig out the links if anyone is interested|pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|ahollan1: in college we used to play system  Mandatory 3rd seat Opener|pg||
nt|bobholl: red is just points i am told |pg||
nt|davpro: A light opening...NS needs some big swings...in their favour|pg||
nt|blum1956: Does the club lead not put that down?|pg||
nt|blum1956: I mean 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So this could well be another 5 IMPS|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3Nt is working with this distribution, but impossible to get there, or?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: S is passed hand so Kopecky will not force this hand probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: they play transfers after 1M-dbl|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: we went down a lot in college|pg||
nt|davpro: W can see 4 tricks in defense against 3@d :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will brad double 3@S ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: very dangerous|pg||
nt|davpro: will N only bid 3@s?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe if defense perfect, pitch comes too late|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chick: wow, pretty ambitious slam in the OR|pg||
nt|blum1956: That is what I am talking on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: guess we will find out, a critical board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if you haven't seen it yet, you can watch live streaming [video AND sound] of one table every set  at  http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 2NT? showing a club suit with a chance for D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Support DBL but it isn't obligatory to show 3 in this situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks like a fredin redouble :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: can they find out their identical distributions ?|pg||
nt|chick: a 3@D preempt by E make the OR auction much tougher|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes we  will see now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: first is not clear to lead a club|pg||
nt|blum1956: North may choose another lead for example|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: oh, was just writing as I know Kopecky, he will take an action, didnt, 2@S it is|pg||
nt|davpro: 4th highest |pg||
nt|blum1956: that's the end of the defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fantoni-nunes took the PHANTOM?! save|pg||
pc|cA|nt|uni_cicam: this can earn a bit more, we will see how many tricks NS will get|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|yvesj49: maybe flat board.....|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will be a small gain for holland again|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or 1 imp|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: west is young player like Marion ?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I seldom pass 8 card suits myself|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is vulnerable so :)|pg||
nt|chick: in this case it worked, but I hate to preempt my partner with a nice major holding like Qxx and a void in the other|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense unlikely to get their @H trick|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: E can discard either H or C so might be only 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and goes 1 off in 3DX|pg||
nt|lml: if it is our style to open hands like this vul 3 level then its fine but otherwise partner will expect a real suit|pg||
nt|lml: your|pg||
nt|chick: so I admit, I would pass E's hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be she thinks she can afford a safety play in @H|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @C would have worked much better bit C always|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: almost i think laura is one year older|pg||

pc|c7|nt|bobholl: 1 down only ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: The fantom save may prove to be not that fantom if you are going to allow the 4@h make|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobholl: but|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|yvesj49: hard for young players to play quarter final mac connell|pg||

nt|yvesj49: semi*|pg||
nt|bobholl: marion has experience enough :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: interesting play by Lu|pg||
nt|lml: Arnolds might expect hearts not to break and slow down drawing trump|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H also makes here  (quite luckily) but 3N is far superior|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: EW 1N=(very good 14)15-17     Jassem knows Nickell has at most 1-q or 2-j|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: surprise|pg||
nt|mrt2000: can go offf now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: oh oh doesn't expect the @D to be ruffed|pg||
nt|chick: ouch (for Arnolds) :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps south could have helped with 4@C bid over 3@H|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky tried to take 2 club tricks before E will discard them, but not succesful in this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd of 4 14-board segments for the Round of 16    the McConnell [women] are in the Round of 8 [Quarter Final] playing 15 board sets|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if Rosenblum will begin 15 board sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: me neither, I wa a bit confused today it is "only" 14|pg||
nt|lml: it was set up by the @HJ|pg||
nt|chick: well, with no preempt, no reason to expect an 8-1 split|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: Arnolds|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yvesj49: 1 spec told me laura (west i suppose) play bridge since 3 years!|pg||
nt|lml: she should duck|pg||
nt|lml: whatever happens Lu's play of the @HJ is very nice and a lesson to all of us|pg||
nt|mrt2000: game over|pg||
nt|bobholl: if she ducks @S ruff and @H back 1 down |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i suppose Q+J allowed too|pg||
nt|davpro: hte @s-suit will be picked up. So, yes|pg||
nt|lml: she may think a while but I am pretty sure she will play a spade|pg||
nt|chick: and with the known @D distrib, she should worry about that.... W has no choice but to shift to a @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: very unlucky but holland wins imps anyway|pg||
nt|lml: but they reduced the damage by this very good result|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|bobholl: what's the ooops for ?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|davidstern: Three level for NS and maybe one level higher for EW|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT obviously was some kind of @S raise|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like a good hand to get a cup of coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: this is the best lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 2@C was only 1-round force [not automatic game force]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: interesting hand is coming|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they play double as 12-15 or strong so they will get (at least) 1 higher|pg||
pc|h3|nt|uni_cicam: Now N has a @C discard to get rid of one @S|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, few more are still in the hand :-(, let see how Kopecky will handle this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead in the other room|pg||
nt|bobholl: normal in holland i predicted it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|toral5: more imps coming for lavazza as 5@D got dbled in other room|pg||
nt|davidstern: Havent stopped here yet though|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: you know you are playing high level bridge when it takes 16 bids to get to 2D, but they can bid 7D with 6 bids..  |pg||
nt|toral5: 5@C is 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: just my observation for the week. has nothing to do with this match|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1 off......|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 1 ? i guess 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i saw it a second later bob lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@s is quite agressive|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 4333 shape|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Marion is in attack|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is a balanced game raise (which I sometimes play)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but why falsecard|pg||
nt|blum1956: small spade is probably the only way to make it now|pg||
nt|blum1956: eve that does not help, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: on trump leads 4@S may go down|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: sadek asked about 4C, South replies natural |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: then asked about the 2C bid responded forcing. |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south asking about the 3S, undiscussed, but jump should be long spades.  |pg||
nt|xenya: on 5, the Russian EW also reached 4@H -- guess what N led -- a spade! Not that i like the lead myself but it worked like magic|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have time to find their @S ruff but will they ?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|uni_cicam: Now @H to the queen will establish some entries to dummy for playing spades from the declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: now they will|pg||
nt|cicus: they may find the @D ruff instead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|toral5: 7 more|pg||
nt|davidstern: Then 14 more|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman played intermediate @S at trick 2 -- i wonder if tougher on defense with Kopecky's @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: trying to recover the mistakes from laura |pg||
pc|d2|nt|uni_cicam: sorry @S from DUMMY|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzsx: then join us at the bar:)|pg||
nt|toral5: 7 more i meant as imps for lavazza on this brd:(:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah but 7 more boards as well|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: no safety play nneded for @D now|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|yvesj49: long way to the end.....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|uni_cicam: hard for KOpecky now, but he should be sure E does not have a K|pg||
nt|blum1956: the defence takes 7 tricks earlier|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bobholl: wd|pg||
nt|bobholl: ifff they cash their @C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: kool @SK from Meck to get tap of dummy going|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrt2000: true|pg||
pc|c4|nt|uni_cicam: lack of one entry to cross ruff and end play|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: it was easier in the other room|pg||

nt|bobholl: nice @S play |pg||
nt|davpro: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: they didn't notice :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|davidstern: So Lavazza took a while but starting to put the pedal to the metal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: there was a director call on the 3S bid we may need to adjust the last board. |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: or perhaps one of the pitches was actually not a @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 @C or 1@S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|uni_cicam: doubling 4@H in Open room was risky, but might earn few imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess multi so 2@S now|pg||
nt|lml: you might overcall diamonds on the east hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: how many @S ? 2/3/4|pg||
mb|3S|nt|davidstern: Good hand EW make 4 either major while NS have good save -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: But EW have to judge|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now NS will probably buy the contract in 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: West maybe thinking about 3NT!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C has four possible meanings, most of time 3-10 with diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: lots of questions now.|pg||
nt|blum1956: It could be pass-3@d-3NT-pass-pass-pass if North opened 3@d, making eight to nine tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D    5@Cs possible; 11-17|pg||
nt|chick: 1@S always for me|pg||
nt|lml: while you only have 5 they are very chunky|pg||
nt|lml: and it is lead directing on occasion|pg||
nt|bobholl: hope they don't get too high may be if arnolds bids 3@D now they will|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so much for that guess Al |pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: this will win some imp but not enough|pg||
nt|blum1956: back to 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So spotlight on Wesy|pg||
nt|cicus: could have bid 3@H looking for 3NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|uni_cicam: nice lead, underlead @S Q can get the extra trick for defense|pg||
nt|bobholl: although vriend hasn't got anice card|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: delicate enough this contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: too delicate they already made it in the open room|pg||
nt|lml: this ones deserves some thinking at trick one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense will need early shift to spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4 rounds of @D is just enough to beat 4@S  -- but   wow|pg||
nt|blum1956: so North-South need to switch to spades on the second trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So duplicatd result here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told when exactly 4@D & 5@C  max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martens' pass stopped me from asking if they could land in 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: they play gazilli :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@h by east is weak opening ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: probably|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i promise i learn dutch system|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: earlier looked like 2@h is hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S good save :)|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks to previous board, Russian on the scoreboard|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davidstern: Anybody for a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I was wondering what the lead was at the other table...  |pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes will now make as declarer will finesse spades pitch two diamonds and only lose 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think laura should have bid 2@H but not sure |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: sry, i thought you meant opening 2@H.  here would deny 16 points I think|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty|pg||
nt|bobholl: best with open cards is drop a @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: it will make if verbeek wins and continues diamonds now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: 9 will look migth high so @H back may be|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|cicus: is this 40 boards altogether?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I believe so.|pg||
nt|bobholl: just what a weak two on J high with 3@S on the side deserves |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|davidstern: Lead at the other table was @DA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: the other room is only on Board  6  so we won't know for a while if Zia-Hamman can get to [correct] game|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: north missed to play K @s|pg||

nt|lml: she cant really tap|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh but I think she can|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|blum1956: Yes - the @d9 lead could not be from 3 small I guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|uni_cicam: But, could have also give the contract|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 9 tricks|pg||

mb|2N|an|alert|nt|ahollan1: since 1@H=4+  Kurka using some form of checkback -- but with 4333 many wouldn't bother|pg||

nt|blum1956: 25 points, plenty of Aces but no resonable game|pg||
nt|bobholl: it surely is |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry  3@D was typo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ralph Katz will rebid @S so they should reach 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: but the alternative is 1@H, distorting the hand completely|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: nope -- i didn't think about 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe max 1@S bid with BOTH decent @S AND @D support??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: similar to  5 where Rodwell didn't stayman with the same shape|pg||

nt|davpro: Declarer will play that suit trick two. Difficlut to find @h shift (could even duck)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: there may be a compound squeeze if defense does not attack hearts early|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so game swing for Nickell|pg||

nt|cicus: if only at least N had @S10|pg||

nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||

nt|davpro: 1@h was not @h|pg||
nt|caitlin: X takeout|pg||
nt|bobholl: but double was 3@H anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: impossible these days|pg||
nt|blum1956: still 2@d is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: many Precision players say 1@H is forcing -- not sure if it was here|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3NT just balanced 15-17. 2NT can be even 18-20|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D no aces 4@H do you have @S Q 4@S no simple bridge :)|pg||
nt|xenya: which 10 points, Gabor?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: what about a club slam?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzsx: if I try to correct it though you may miss the whole board.. sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 1h showed 4 diamonds.|pg||
nt|lml: this goes for 500 anyway|pg||
nt|mrt2000: EW really haven't got to grips with this hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: going to make|pg||
nt|xenya: obviously clubs should be trumps? |pg||
nt|cicus: right there, that many black cards :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: even with a 74 it is often better to play in the 7 card suit if you have 44 fit |pg||
nt|cicus: 6@C is clearly superior, you only have to guess well, in 6@S there is no guess, the Q must be well placed and short|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: failure to bid 2@C suggests 1@H could have been 4@H with longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|lml: the worst thing about 6@C is it just might push e-w to slam, probably not now|pg||
nt|lml: ok|pg||
nt|blum1956: and 3@d may go down|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: No need April thanks you're doing a fantastic job!|pg||
nt|cicus: even then, it may be awkward on a @D lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|caitlin: rusinow leads my favourite   www.bridgeguys.com|pg||
pc|d2|nt|uni_cicam: dbl can help, but @C lead is still obvious, will Kopecky guess right?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: just 5@D with this hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: take it back my bulgarioan help made mistake|pg||
nt|caitlin: their variation|pg||

nt|timmy5: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@S!!|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the winner once past 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: if they can stay there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: needs a bit too much for 15-17 for a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S must be 32 so a of @H any @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|oosmanb: Since this is such an important match, declarer will try a pseudo squeeze and try to ruff two @D for a miracle|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: very tough hand |pg||
nt|othered1: if south's @SQ were the @CK slam isn't bad at all.|pg||
nt|davpro: 6 tricks for defense...that can't vanish|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: NS play Precision when not-vul  Polish Club when vul|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Taymour welcome|pg||
nt|timmy5: hi Oosman|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: east trying to figure out how the heck he won this trick and what trap the declarer is trying to set up for him...  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|uni_cicam: true, but 3NT might be a warning bid, anyway here we go|pg||
nt|othered1: Will be faced with same position Hamman misguessed|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: tough decision|pg||
nt|xenya: there is a spade guess in 6@C, but not in 6@S -- as a spectator pointed out to me a while ago |pg||
nt|xenya: but there may be squeeze chances in 6@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: I'm curious, can kibitzers send me a personal message whether they'd play this deal all the way through or just claim -1 and move on|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H was  no 4 card in MAJORS.. and 4@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should be played like rubber bridge, draw two trumps and claim|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: 3@C than 2 down|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|timmy5: ill play :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm told 3NT was bid by Pharmaservice, Thank you Mh. Shaker :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: As I was saying, for us mere mortals 3NT seems hard to find, but at this level all 32 teams ARE capable of finding the 9 trick cold game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I had pharmaservices this morning.  a very nice pair from Denmark...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: and it has to be N who needs to convince South (due to the 4333 and AA Kxx @H)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: anyway, a welcome 11 IMPs for Russia|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: the defence only needs to cash a heart|pg||
pc|sT|nt|uni_cicam: but, if they try to get a ruff, probably they have it|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|uni_cicam: this will take a while|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: taking by A is winning also againt 4th @D J on side|pg||
nt|othered1: do those good @D spots in dummy have an effect on the decision?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: so yes, they might|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: play the Ace Michal, please :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think this is anything other than a guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck would play the same regardless of who holds the @DJ   and maybe even with @C33|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, I have an option, put 2 cards on the table and hit them. The one which jumps further is the right one. You will be surprised how it works|pg||
nt|lml: they will get the spade eventually|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|uni_cicam: YES|pg||
nt|bobholl: vladimir do you know those guys ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzsx: talking (in Dutch) and laughing|pg||
nt|lml: because West has a club|pg||
nt|lml: so safe now for 500|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|xenya: incidentally, a @H lead beats 6@S?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|uni_cicam: sorry for being one way oriented, but I am trying to handle with the excitement. I would rather sit at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when North's @C length is known -- Rod doesn't have to give true count|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blum1956: From the declarer's point of view  East should have a @dQ if both club honours are with West. Lu did not show her @cAK but this allowed Verbeek to play for the extra chance that ...|pg||
nt|blum1956: West has a third spade. Suddenly the @dQ appeared|pg||

pc|h9|nt|xenya: yes i do -- not very well though|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||

mb|1C|nt|timmy5: i agree|pg||

nt|bobholl: guess minors with better @D ?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: marginal 1nt overcall but probably the popular choice|pg||

nt|lml: not too worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: key now -- is Katz PASS forcing?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not sure to win 1NT.....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good view @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1nt is indeed ok if it does not show more than a normal 1nt opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the range for 1N response is higher than standard because if 1@D opened with balanced hand it is 11-13 HCP|pg||
pc|dA|nt|timmy5: 3nt coming|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough is enough |pg||
nt|lml: Arnolds doesnt have extra |pg||
nt|chick: EW are playing precision, so the 1@D is just a generic opening hand|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrt2000: there's a good start for the chinese recovery|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps South should have just bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: vulnerable|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry lost contact for 10 minutes or so|pg||
nt|lml: rather than inviting|pg||
nt|chick: the other room didn't get the W hand opening, so here S may have worried that there was no good source of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: well the 1NT response from north suggested diamond help|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: which apparently yan treated it as|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this won't make either|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2@D is only four way bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either major weak, strong balanced or strong with diamonds|pg||
nt|blum1956: The popular convention after multi (if 2@d is multi) is to bid 4@c now asking partner to bid a transfer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Then not possible I guess|pg||

nt|yuval10: back to board 11, Israeli supporters would be happy to hear that the U-21 team made 6@c XX there ( 6@c was made by China in the Other room )|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yikes|pg||
nt|yuval10: China still holds the lead there, 16:13|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i dont say that often but I dont know how many you get for 6@Cxx|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1380 - thanks specs|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't really understand what W thinks about, he already bid his hand ( and more ) with 2@h, what more does he has to say?|pg||
nt|eugenem:  Probably E should bid 6@h directly over 4@h because W didn't cuebid @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it's a quick 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: he is in a deep tank|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he should watch his hand again... P didn't bid 4@s, and he has no control in that suit...how can you bid anything else than 5@h ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: open closing hand putting hand down picking up hand|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenem:  By the way, EW are not regular partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: n e talking about bidding|pg||
nt|yuval10: only @c lead can make declarer some problems, it seem|pg||
nt|eugenem:  W's regular partner didn't get US visa in time|pg||
nt|Gerben42: did 5@H show "no side cue"?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@H I mean|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|Gerben42: perhaps 5@C was exclusion and 5@S was 2 without|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: divider droped|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: s w talking|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h CR|pg||
nt|yuval10: so this will be a swing, likely for Russia|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's easy, AK@h, AK@d and a @d ruff with the T. @h to the Q and claim|pg||
nt|yuval10: can also ruff 2 @c's|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so Russia back in the match|pg||
nt|yuval10: will make it either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: divider droped again s w talking|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: w thinking|pg||
nt|Gerben42: can you make out what they were talking about|pg||
nt|eugenem:  With @h 3-1 or 2-2 any reasonable line wins now|pg||

mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: thanks everyone, will be an exciting last session, hope organizers will put it to the schedule since we did not see second session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure yet which matches will be on vugraph but with this match so close, won't be surprised to see this same matchup|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: and, please, give greetings to the Czechs, everyone is watching and holding fingers|pg||
nt|bobholl: 16 imps on 1 board is a lot |pg||
nt|xenya: is it a good slam?|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least 3@H then slam reachable|pg||
mb|3H|an|alert|nt|ahollan1: 1@C  not vul    maybe they are playing Polish Club throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then i thought open 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|davpro: Yes!|pg||
nt|lml: the OR result looks normal|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D 32 and @H not 41 thats good i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no still looks like Precision but slightly different range|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 12-14 nv I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: too strong for 4@H ?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: 6@D is possible with the same guess|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: quite a flat set with some chances for swings, Nickell has biten 11 IMPs from the Martens Pie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator -- please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and thank YOU for the great job|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 5@D safer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ah yes, I just noticed the @C position. :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 40|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzsx: anyone like 4C over 2C splinter?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oosmanb: is 5@D a bad contract?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Q drops, MIchal can relax a bit, OR?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C auto splinter marion didn't like that|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not after 4th suit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: next segment scheduled to being in 75 minutes [1h15m]|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blum1956: the boards were not that exciting this segment, still there were some interesting points of technical nature|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzsx: 1  over trick only, my mistake.|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they lead @C no problem either|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|uni_cicam: if E is taking @H K by the Ace, there is a squeeze|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: i have never considered it but for me it would be a super 4054|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bobholl: but splinter may be more usefull|pg||
pc|d2|nt|timmy5: not that easy to bid|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I wouldnt mind being in it, (or actually putting partner in it)|pg||
nt|othered1: But doesn't south have to take early discard if he runs all the @C?|pg||
nt|lml: an autobridge hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oosmanb: and then telling him "you couldve made you know"|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @C finesse now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: from Kopecky view, double squeeze should work, but will be turned quickly to simple @S @H squeeze|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: think netherlands will loose 1 or 2 imp on this one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @HQ then a @S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|oosmanb: K@S ruff a @S probably|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ok That's it for this set|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Roland whens the next one?|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: should have played @H K first, now he realized |pg||

mb|1N|nt|bobholl: bit weak in @D for 2nt|pg||

mb|2H|nt|yvesj49: 4@s|pg||

nt|davpro: Perhaps, but still the best bid (imho)|pg||
nt|bobholl: that is not what volozheni expected :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oosmanb: By our very soon Dutch correspondent , van Spoookyyyy, aka Gerbrand Hop|pg||
nt|oosmanb: own*|pg||
nt|spooky: Hello all :)|pg||
nt|chick: W may lead the @DA and thereby give away the fact that she has the @SK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yvesj49: trump lead beats|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: a fredin redouble |pg||
nt|bobholl: i think as jeanharings that they won't bid it missing two 'aces' as i said before|pg||
nt|blum1956: only 3 imps to the Netherlands up to this moment, the Chinese coolecting 31|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hoi!|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C was 6@C or 5@C-4M 2@D relay 2@S natural, 3@H forcing I guess|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So West has shown @C + @S, limited hand|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C is 11-15 about|pg||
nt|oosmanb: East deciding between @C and NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oosmanb: since West could have dubious 2 or 3 @D|pg||
nt|davpro: a blind lead somehow. Didn't hit the spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult and costly lead problem (@DA could be my choice)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|oosmanb: even though he promised a stopper|pg||
nt|yvesj49: possible to play on @c !!!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: well she knows they have 11 @S but :(|pg||
nt|chick: doubling for a lead doesn't make a lot of sense when you will be on lead against a slam|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|spooky: the 4 players at this table know each other very well. all from the Netherlands and training a lot together|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Good choice I think, with the mini @S fit as well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes I found that interesting.|pg||
nt|davpro: Moss might be concerned about @d 3-0, but in that case S would probably have led trumps...so he should relax :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: K of @D now for lavinthal but poor south has nothing to say|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oosmanb: Interesting 1NT opening by West next door, that got them to 4@H making!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: though it may not lead to many explainations of alerts if they all know the system...  |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't think they know each others system that well..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I will do my best :)|pg||
nt|spooky: they are "rivals" in the dutch league :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Running scores are 108-97|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Not 119-86 as we see here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: April can you fix ?|pg||
nt|spooky: She can't fix scores, she can only check at the players|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Alrighties we'll keep the kibitzers informed then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I can fix scores for this session, but I do not have access to the previous results|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Best line here G?|pg||
nt|spooky: I would throw a @S and play @HQand see what the opponents do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: playing @h does establish communication for the 2@S ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: it scares them off :)|pg||
nt|lml: at this vul though East might have cooperated in diamonds with a different hand|pg||
nt|xenya: @H back is safe|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: begin with @S is bad :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: she did'nt put the 10 ??????|pg||
nt|xenya: and this seems to beat it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: I like to play that double as a suggestion for a save|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|spooky: he ruffed directly, so looks like heis playing to make his hand good|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Still needs to ruff one @S which shouldnt be hard to manage now that he has communication|pg||
nt|spooky: he'll throw 1@S on @HK and ruff 1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes but isnt that risky|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @h 4-2 prmotes A10x etc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: everyone is just staring at the cards on the table...  |pg||
nt|spooky: yes, I see, but I think there was no way to declare without that risk|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen goes down, south asking Qs I cant hear...  |pg||
nt|spooky: probably about the bidding, and how many @H's west may have etc|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's probably asking if 3NT showed 5422 or can be 5431? |pg||
nt|spooky: probably not 5422 I think, because East might have bid something like to end up in 4@H somehow then|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and other shapes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: or 544|pg||
nt|spooky: hi Jean|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen up more staring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi|pg||
nt|chick: that would make more sense to me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yvesj49: OOPS|pg||

pc|s3|nt|yvesj49: incredible|pg||
nt|bobholl: laura is playing bridge not long (3 years or so)\|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 6430 possible?|pg||

nt|yvesj49: now it's 1 off|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry but I have been receiving so many requests for pairs results|pg||
nt|spooky: a lot of ways to 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no problem David. We like to hear results!!!  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably quite nervous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well some coming here to make things interesting|pg||
nt|blum1956: finally something essential for the NS team|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|davidstern: No way to avoid 11 I would say|pg||
nt|davidstern: But of course declarer doesnt know that|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oosmanb: Now he will|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: This is getting harder and harder|pg||
nt|oosmanb: J@H discard will scare him alot|pg||
nt|davidstern: North Pitches a heart the @C10 may come into play|pg||
nt|spooky: even if North discards @HJ he still has no choice does he?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Should be OK @HK pitch last spade and club honour|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well he can try ruffing @H high|pg||
nt|davidstern: But this would be down if North held @CA10x|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and then playing another @S|pg||
nt|spooky: did you see another line David?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could just play to establish hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: Leave all dummy's trumps intact|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lots of entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That would work too|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyway did well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|spooky: but your trumps in your hand are quite bad...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I think I can see the wheels turning in their heads..  we could be in for a long night at this rate. :)|pg||
nt|spooky: so a possible overruff with @C10 is still there|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK I am off leave you in very capable hands. Most of the matches are close to conclusive but one or two still in the balance|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think he means your hands Spooky|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Peter Lund|pg||

nt|Walddk3: because the score is incorrect|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Please|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|spooky: I know NS play optional blackwood sometimes, no idea if this is an auction for that|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'll tell you how Nunes combined chances on a @C lead|pg||
nt|afulton: Martin, maybe that's why we aren't playing in Philly|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oosmanb: he won A@C played A@S ruff a @S, then @C ruff, and @S ruff with 10@D, now back to hand with @C to ruff to test @D|pg||
nt|pelu: the play in 6@D looks like @S-ruffs in dummy and @C-ruffs in hand - that is very close to 12 tricks (3 ruffs in hand)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: When @D dont break he fell back on @H finesse which works|pg||
nt|afulton: :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk3: Somehow I feel I am wasting my time|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rado: N-S use sophisticated prec @C , EW tooo in my memory from last days|pg||
pc|sK|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: too late for that - cross-ruffs looks like the winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being told @S finesse needed, I was just telling you how Nunes played it. And I'll dare say he knows his percentages|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is @D8|pg||
nt|spooky: the auction might help him here to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: or a @H to take away entry in dummy to cross-ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: still two clubs to lose, making this 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: OK|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|spooky: if 4NT was optional Blackwood, then 5@D was minimum and 5@H asking again i guess...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok @H finesse not needed you win @D 5 en passant. thanks kibz|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this breaks up communication for that @H ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south worried he is going down...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Other dutch pair got @H lead and went down I'm told by Jean|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u take @HAK and ruff a @H|pg||
nt|pelu: but that is not normal bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: DD can finesse @S too :) |pg||
nt|pelu: will he take @S-finess in trick 2?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finessing @H doesnt help|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I think he'll finesse @s trick 2, yes |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't know whats best.. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: then ruff two small @S returning with @C and @C ruff, then you're all set|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thats why these guys are here... and were not :)|pg||
