nt|yvesj49: 4@sto play|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vicky888: Hello all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-13 HCP, unbal 5+@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Good evening people|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thsi is a dream table for bridge lovers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 4 players from top 10 for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 3rd seat  point count can be [much] lower|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@c would seem ok too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fantoni stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: in the closed 3c went down|pg||
nt|kareno: Traian :)|pg||
nt|passell: hi karen  how are things in sunny lv?|pg||
nt|kareno: David :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that 1N opener is all Brad Moss|pg||
nt|norby: 1nt????lololol|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This does not look right|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem as if we miss something here....|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Sapan :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Giving them a little bit of a headstart|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: You should be here, Mike.  Perfect weather.  Your house must be missing you!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Karen@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Karen|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@s ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: weak ???|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: 2@s some sort of flower bid.|pg||
nt|toral5: hi karen:)|pg||
nt|kareno: I suspect it is east who is thinking - north has said his piece.|pg||
nt|algraves: ns 5 or 6 losers in a minor |pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010YouthPhiladelphia/Ortiz%20Patino/China/lin-chen.pdf|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 73 imps... may be a good beginning for come back. Yes we hope !|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk10: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Karen, David, Jim|pg||
nt|algraves: so a routine start|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: in the closed we had action from the word go|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am VERY grateful to Anna Gudge for posting the CCs of all the junior and youth pairs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vicky888: this should make i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for multitasker  you can try to follow bidding/play in other vugraph rooms using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|othered1: EW are Precision-based.  NS's system is unto itself, with things like weak NT, all 1-bids forcing, and intermediate 2-bids that can have lots of playing strength|pg||
nt|kareno: Roland :)|pg||
nt|rv: ar favorable vul, Fred might have come in again with 4n to show both minors with longer @cs|pg||
nt|daman: Zia bid 4NT over 4@S    long @Cs with secondary @Ds|pg||
nt|algraves: notice the Meckstroth style of never disclosiing information if he doesnt have too|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT: 14+-17 bal or semi-bal|pg||
nt|norby: funny, i like this gameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No imagination, Norby? :)|pg||
nt|algraves: so an easy 3NT basically easy 5@D|pg||
nt|norby: absoluty no|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@C will be in easy make especially aftr a dbl frm west|pg||
nt|kareno: Good trump lead by west|pg||
nt|toral5: and now no @C guess|pg||
nt|jallerton: well 3NT is 100%, 5@d could go down on a very bad day|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd bet that the boards are incorrect|pg||
nt|yuval10: hope we'll fix it soon|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the minetime we can talk about the semifinals in both U-21 and U-26|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: sorry we have the wrong boards loaded|pg||
nt|yuval10: China vs France is the other SF of the U-26|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the last match of the round-rubin, Israel manhandle USA1 25:0  ( 59:1 imps ) to secure first place|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the camera operator is trying to show a close-up of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: because we have the wrong boards loaded|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Herve us working on it|pg||
nt|yuval10: last night, Israel eliminated Russia, USA 1 defeated Sweden|pg||
nt|yuval10: the semifinals of the U-21 event are as follows :  Israel vs Poland , England vs Netherlands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In all likelihood we shall have to start all over again. The technicians are working on it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|tlc: roland, karen, mike..nice to see everyone again|pg||
nt|Walddk10: and Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Warren :)|pg||
nt|tlc: hi warren|pg||
nt|passell: this is the kind of match bridge is all about|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    the other events on vugraph are playing different boards|pg||
nt|algraves: Brad's NT comes with that " dont try that at home " proviso|pg||
nt|algraves: but easy to see many scenarios where it wins a big one|pg||
nt|algraves: 3 am in Jakarta|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW   lead 4th vs NT     most situations  upside-down  count, attitude, suit pref and reverse Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: and many where it is a big loss|pg||
nt|algraves: well....|pg||
nt|hedyg: (wish she could have done the same for open and ladies)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: Not really favorable though, equal|pg||
nt|rv: at equal vul, it is not such a percentage action, hence he passed|pg||
nt|algraves: theoretically 4@H on some hand might be better but he thinks it is poor bridge to disclose infomation needlessly|pg||
nt|daman: Greco bid 4@H in the CR|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision system has the advantage that ALlan mentioned, opening limited to 15HCP|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 8 IMPs to Diamond      first blood|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck and Moss having a chat|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since Greco-Hampson also play Precision, it was a matter of style, not system|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Gitelman has no clear idea of declarers distribution so is guessing somewhat at this point . trying to come up with scenarios that lead to 4 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they apologise to Fred for te noise|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but Fred said Its OK i am undistructable|pg||
nt|algraves: he does know the meck is limited to 16 as he did not open 1@C|pg||
nt|algraves: obviously|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: it seems we do not have comentators :(|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: For those who don't know the term, 'flower bid' means a fit showing jump.|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: yeah.thts wt i was typing to a kib:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Norby -- how often do opponents forget about meckwell Reverse Suit Preference??|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad said something like i will make this|pg||
nt|algraves: it is on their card|pg||
nt|norby: i dont know|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Bessis in the tank|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|copeyj: Chen should play @H10 on next round (assuming Lin cashes @HA) to show a @D card (or maybe @HJ has already done that with the doubleton @H in dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@d is a giveaway|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: he should have played the Q|pg||
nt|hedyg: pick up K10@d|pg||
nt|copeyj: now draw trumps and a @C to the Q|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: EW have found thenormal 3N and from the better side|pg||
nt|athene: South must know there's very little chance of beating the contract, with the strong dummy and well-placed @DK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|toral5: @D 8 is gud here.so 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa jiggles his leg while Greco thinks|pg||
nt|kareno: With the diamond in the pocket, it's an easy hand for declarer.|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll be jiggling his leg a lot this match I think :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco asking about leads|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to David Burn|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni explaining|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco asks some more|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Fantoni took out of his pocket a paper explaining leads...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now all clear and he is thinking...Greco|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so first board will noot be flat|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|toral5: trumps now ll restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Oh please don't throw me in the briar patch,, says Eric Rodwell!!|pg||
nt|jtr: I doubt if there was much the derfence could do|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi all|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tlc: very happy lie of the cards on this hand..should be no further problems|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|passell: tap declarer and duck 2 hearts|pg||
nt|passell: impossible to find|pg||
nt|jtr: only in the movies|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell staring at the 3 of clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Rodwell's biggest concern is a very bad spade break.  |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: and if his partner has the @HK that's onside too|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|toral5: ouch a @D discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: players show their hands|pg||
nt|yvesj49: don't worry traian i'm here lol|pg||
pc|s6|nt|toral5: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|passell: its a shame every bridge player in the world cant be watching this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ok thx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yvesj49: 31 x 2 + 10|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@h making is a good result for France, since you have 4 losers with a @s lead and the obvious @d continuation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and double was probably takeout of spades, hence the 4@H bid|pg||

nt|algraves: and we are off|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Not so bad when 4@s wins in NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Since he could see 25 high card points between his hand and dummy, I don't see much advantage to knowing declarer is limited to 15|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sorry, it was of course Grosset playing the hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|copeyj: very sound preempt from Lin, first in at favourable. Not that any other opening particularly appeals. Now let's see how Lorenzini treats the S hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: streaming is off|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Quite a few are watching, Mike, but you're right, this is the epitome of match bridge.|pg||
nt|algraves: so meck will do something here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@H or 3nt?|pg||
nt|kareno: Zia opened the south hand 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all fantunes 1-suit openings are 1-round-force|pg||
nt|othered1: I can't imagine north will not push to game, even though their overcalls don't have to be very sound.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: here we see the problems of ambigous 1@D-2@C sequences|pg||
nt|algraves: good point|pg||
nt|athene: you can end in 4-2 fits|pg||
nt|algraves: a more or less prosaic two hearts|pg||
nt|yvesj49: thomas bessis won the price f personality of the year by IBPA|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: can be weaker if (5/4) @H & @S  but usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|jtr: Surprised Garner didnt express and opinion about 4@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: light double...|pg||
nt|norby: maybe in open pairs open sometime 1 nt but in team never never never never i open 1nt, think same 1 very good player american that now is kibbitzer in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I would just get to the heart game quickly with the south hand.  Maybe Stayman first but then hearts.|pg||
nt|toral5: ya stayman is betr|pg||
nt|jtr: an opinion|pg||
nt|algraves: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert probably because  could be 5 [and sometimes 7 vul]|pg||
nt|yvesj49: AND FREDERIC VOLCKER PLAYED IN OPEN TEAMS IN OSTENDE|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 very good players|pg||
nt|raidouille:  4@h in other room too... but @s lead :)|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|yvesj49: dangerous board for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Tez|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: Many pairs play pass from N as forcing on this auction, when the opps bid 3m-X-5m at favourable|pg||
nt|copeyj: obviously not Grosset-Lorenzini though|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: but 4@H on 2@D wont normally show 6-4?|pg||
nt|kareno: If north hasn't got four spades, then hearts looks right on a known 6-2 or 6-3|pg||
nt|copeyj: should be an easy defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H was making so 5@c a good sac|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and 2 good guys !|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: many people playing standard methods like to bid the west hand 1@D - 2@C but it does have its drawbacks|pg||
nt|daman: the perils of this canape sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck writing stuff for Moss|pg||
nt|athene: playing strong club of course you are rather more forced into this sort of thing|pg||
nt|algraves: well, this sequence shows both minors and they have ways to sort it out|pg||
nt|copeyj: A@H with the 9@H from North asking for a @S switch (because singleton @h in dummy)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: and if the 1nt oc tends to be offshape,5-3 @S can be missed and land in a 6-1 @H fit:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Notrump overcall with singleton heart?????|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable I'm sure they'll get to game.|pg||
nt|athene: with 2-2-(5-4) west would tend to rebid 1nt to avoid this problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought Meck bud 1@d-2@h with 4@s and 5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: Meckstroth has inferences from this sequence and knows bidding on makes no sense|pg||
nt|algraves: what will meck lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table ,thinking|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 6@s -1... ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: South in the tank now|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: If France can win 10 imps per board, it's good...|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: so Moss sure of 9 here as he must win 2 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: but thts against the odds.likely is he has atleast 2@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Fantoni did express one|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well... Fantoni expressed a strong opinion now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|tlc: mmany would play this sequence was a mild slam try,,,|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know if they have gradations of these raises.|pg||
nt|daman: North will lead a trump|pg||
nt|athene: yes, EW do play 1@D - 2@H as flannery shape|pg||
nt|peachy: nice lead, but as expected :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: some imps dor nickell here|pg||
nt|algraves: it is the other way 5 @S and 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: but that is 5-4 not 4-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is with 4-5 you just bid 1@H and you won't miss a spade fit as partner will rebid 1@S with four|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-4 if it goes 1@D - 1@S you can miss a heart fit though|pg||
nt|algraves: Moss has chosen the standard lead holding declarers first bid suit|pg||
nt|algraves: basically trying to win @D tricks later|pg||
nt|algraves: by stopping @D ruffs now|pg||
nt|norby: 18 points and 5 diamond, prefere double.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 2009    http://usbf.org/docs/2009usbc/acblcards/GitelmanMoss.jpg|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell in the tank|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, North can stretch his 2NT bid in protective seat|pg||
nt|norby: with american lebhensol is easy call 3 nt|pg||
nt|algraves: Moss is likely to lean towards A of @C with dealer|pg||
nt|norby: sometime partner have 6 point and only 4 diamond and you play 2 nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with lebensohl after DBL  often wrong-side 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: depends on how strong responder must be for constructive 3-level bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell still thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: I should think that Moss will place any high cards with West, given what East might open with at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|norby: but in this case you dont make 3 nt if the partner is weak|pg||
nt|jallerton: If North does double, 2NT Leb is the only awkward response|pg||
nt|algraves: but the play will revolve around wether it is safe to lead club before he cashes his 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bessis family are all playing bridge at a high level|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jtr: Well, the opening was stronger here|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I was dreaming...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: But even so|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: action in the 2nd board...|pg||
nt|jtr: Cant see any interst here the way the cards lie|pg||
nt|jtr: Although declarer will not be so sure|pg||
nt|henryb:  the trick on this hand is to avoid the decent 6@d, which needs the @h finesse which unfortunately is offside|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves: he is home safe in a cold contract after pre emption.  That is always good|pg||
nt|dburn: but he might at least place East with the king of hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so right after number 9 now|pg||
nt|jallerton: range of 2@h is 4-10HCP according to vuln|pg||
nt|algraves: if meck ducks this then safe to play @C to K as that holding prevents 5 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East pu cards on the table and thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco opened Meck's hand 1@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe they play reverse suit preference then|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks to me as though declarer is likely to get 7 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kareno: 4@h would be equal lengths in majors or longer hearts and that's the end of this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: yes!!|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H has to be longer @H for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all players look away and think about the hand|pg||
nt|kareno: How many boards this round?  32?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I believe it is 14 boards.  All rounds today have been 14 :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Hey:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 4@s seems makeable.....|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: Lots of handling charges here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: easy 4h for israel now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tez: i prefer 3@h ..looks like 2 down|pg||
nt|peachy: Since the diamond ruffs arent ha[p[ening, Rodwell developing spades|pg||
nt|algraves: well it is more on elimination lines|pg||
nt|algraves: playiing for 5 trump 2 @S and one in the wash|pg||
nt|peachy: Puttin Moss on lead obviously what declarer wants|pg||
nt|henryb:  Moss could play on @h now, to get the tap, or just play a second trump|pg||
nt|algraves: Moss realizes that he is going to be endplayed in @D and is tryiing to think through a counter|pg||
nt|peachy: I think Moss has no "evidence" to change his plan, more trump|pg||
nt|henryb:  Of course if East led the @sQ you could make it|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they stop before 6.....|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h makes 5 fairly comfortably. Six if West does not cash out|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: board1, other table East overcalled with his 4 good @s, and they are also in game|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|tlc: this removes any ambiguity|pg||
nt|kareno: Now the diamond in case west has the ace?|pg||
nt|norby: better dont play the lebenshol in this position.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the opening structure for both EW pairs is the same -- just a style issue|pg||
nt|algraves: Meck wasntdealt an offside @H K to not take it|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are French Simon :) they show nr of cards !|pg||
nt|raidouille:  of course but we have to be patient |pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 32 boards, we can't wait too much...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|yvesj49: in france 4@c shows 5/5 at least....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Tez|pg||
pc|d8|nt|algraves: well that is why he is there and we are here|pg||
nt|athene: the obvious counter to diamond endplays is to keep hearts in your hand as exit cards|pg||
nt|peachy: And surely I am mistaken, since that didnt happen|pg||
nt|norby: i play modified lebenshol only in this position....|pg||
nt|copeyj: i very much doubt they are giving count in this position, but I might be wrong|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|copeyj: what possible use is count|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: 3..hi Yves|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzta: West has to cash clubs ace now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i think is going to play small|pg||
nt|yvesj49: only chance to beat the contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|algraves: well that forces Rodwell to pull trump or losse his @S A|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 10/board we win by 253 lol|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm surprised they are still playing 56 board matches at this point in a World Championship.  In the US major KO's we start with 64.|pg||
nt|toral5: yes:(|pg||
nt|toral5: is sementa heading for trouble?|pg||
nt|toral5: on a @D return?|pg||
nt|kareno: He doesn't want to burn his club entries.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa played a heart and discarded a high diamond, and it appears Greco discarded the diamond jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: clubs are now being played|pg||
nt|toral5: but he will end up making as the cards lie|pg||
nt|kareno: You think?|pg||
nt|toral5: has the play been haulted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play of the cards :( |pg||
nt|toral5: wt happens here on a @D return|pg||
nt|ahollan1: excellent point Norby -- that positional issue doesn't get discussed nearly enough|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: I think declarer is in trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, east holds the jack ov clubs so no guess in that suit.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|toral5: final is suppose to b 96 brds?|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if a trump back rather than the @h might have worked better|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, north isn't playing with open cards, as we are.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but Fulvio thought 3@c in Claudio's seat lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco thinking|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @s ace and @h for the jack ?|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, west played 5@Cx and north led trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry and..back to thinking|pg||
nt|tez: all tickets to 3 down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Systems of all four pairs are rather different, so it's possible we'll see few identical auctions (perhaps strong NT openings, excepted)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yvesj49: good new !|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more imps for Zimmermann here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes thinking|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|daman: I still don't think he can navigate a trick in the wash|pg||

nt|yvesj49: i'm wrong......|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yvesj49: i won|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yvesj49: normal line|pg||
nt|tez: fulvio will play @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: claudio to play|pg||
nt|dburn: that would be a remarkable effort even for him|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or trump|pg||
nt|tez: for appercut..pd maybe has 10 of @c|pg||
nt|dburn: first it isn't his turn, second he doesn;t have a diamond|pg||
nt|tez: nunes sry|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe a world class puppeteer could pull that off|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: diamond jack in his hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yvesj49: i won again lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: easier with screen than cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and back to thinking now after a quick...sorry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Moss needs to get Gittelman to lead another @d|pg||
nt|dburn: I play modified lebensohl also - 2NT shows a balanced hand with a heart stop|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jtr: Sneaky|pg||
nt|kareno: So I'm told that Meckwell have a variety of accepts of transfer to show various types of good hands.|pg||
nt|henryb:  So maybe he should shift to the @h7|pg||
nt|athene: small heart rather than the jack, yes|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows partner has the AK @H or the !K|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: yes.2@S is invitational with minors|pg||

nt|algraves: this is just the sort of boards that Moss and Gitelman want|pg||
nt|norby: boring hand|pg||
nt|algraves: routine 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On 2, the French were pushed to 6@C over 5@H and got doubled. IMPs to China soon|pg||
nt|copeyj: fortunate to find HX@C with North so that you have the entries to all your tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c apparently some version of Drury|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: hampson and claudio discussing the last board... now the bidding|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1 off with @h lead|pg||
nt|dburn: not by any means a record, and not even particularly abnormal for this tournament|pg||
nt|daman: this is a pianola hand    just a matter of overtricks if any|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing to this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 of them|pg||
nt|copeyj: suspect this auction is just a kokish relay so all that has happened so far is that east has shown 23-24 bal|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs asking why we dont show both semis|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: easy defence for 1 down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: flat board|pg||
nt|tlc: there's a fair amopunt of evidence to support those assestions :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Never give up on a partscore |pg||
nt|algraves: somebody offer Norberto a glass of chianti|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not as routine as all that - he might lose a club trick, after all|pg||
nt|algraves: oh yes sorry of course the clubs are not solid|pg||
nt|algraves: we may get to describe the mysterious rule of restricted choice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs  NT   EW Ace asks attitude  [King asks unblock or count]|pg||
nt|dburn: surprised they use standard attitude|pg||
nt|algraves: trick one only|pg||
nt|algraves: most top american pairs play that|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking |pg||
nt|norby: also the italian pairs|pg||
nt|norby: ace for attitude and king for unblock or count|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rv: @CQ lead and @d shift will swiftly lead to 10 tricks for declarer |pg||
nt|henryb:  only issue is to cash @d immediately|pg||
pc|sK|nt|toral5: in local games we often say looking at 3 jacks:3 PLUS 1|pg||
nt|kareno: I predict down one.  And I offer tea (_)? and cookies to all OOOOO as we watch it happen :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, probably not:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and some more thinking now|pg||
nt|tlc: and i'm sure meck loves his "soon to be executed @D monarch"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|algraves: standard attitude at trick one is good idea on balance because there are the three card holdings you want continued and also want to unblock middle card|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably operators getting tired :(|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like 3@S puppet to 3N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: only Walter Johnson [bigtrain] is certain when meckwell revert to standard attitude/count   but Meck's @S3 sure looks like standard discouragement|pg||
nt|algraves: say you have QTX|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: North, especially, can be pretty deliberate|pg||
nt|athene: it might be essential to cash diamonds as declarer could throw a diamond on his @CK or his diamond on dummy's heart|pg||
nt|algraves: you want to play ten to encourgee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great insight Allan -- thanks|pg||
nt|algraves: so he had ten winners without the clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fred just claimed 10 without playing the clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: a method i used to play but have dismissed as I don;t like giving them a free shot at doubling @S every time i want to play 3N|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: but it has lots of other advantages, doesnt it?|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal J@H lead for me |pg||
nt|copeyj: and for Lorenzini too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I used to play 3NT as a transfer to 4@C :)  Then of course I forgot and bid 3NT to play. Partner duly bid 4@C and then we had an agreement that 4NT now meant: "I forgot 3NT was a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: transfer, so please pass"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's legitimate|pg||
nt|copeyj: it has advantages Hedy, but i think you can fit most of the hand types in without the need for the puppet - I agree it opens up some windows|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: need @h 8 at the hand|pg||
nt|athene: also a small chance south has @DAx and can get a ruff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|passell: probably suspects because of the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  so + 480 N-S|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 9 now and another IMP to Z|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: It is a bit like claiming as a declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: If you always claim then when you dont claim the defenders know there is a problem|pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves: so on the first hand , Zia got a bit frisky and bought a hideaous dummy in 5@C X for 800 and 8 imps away|pg||
nt|athene: quite possible that east opened 1nt with 4 spades and 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: Let's see if he can sniff out the club position.|pg||
nt|athene: that's what moss is going for|pg||

nt|algraves: wow|pg||
nt|algraves: this hand wild|pg||
nt|jallerton: that's why they revert to standard when an unblock may be required|pg||
nt|henryb:  I assume North did not actually play the cards in that order|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we do not have results from closed room|pg||
nt|raidouille:  On board 2, Israel found a good save in 5@h and French players didn't defend well|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: i'm told one south opened 1@C and actually bought it in 2@C on the auction 1@C - 1@H; 2@C|pg||
nt|tlc: the other room apparently had a Bergen related accident...East dbld the 3@c bergen raise and west thot he had clubs and got too high|pg||
nt|jtr: Fair game here|pg||
nt|athene: north decided to ignore the clubs - probably a matter of lead-direction|pg||
nt|athene: but i wouldn't want to hide that 6-card suit in a 65 shape|pg||
nt|athene: come on north bid 2nt|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S down 1 with a @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ew play Precision   so 1@S limited to max 15 HCP|pg||
nt|algraves: not in the old days that is for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: seems a little bit wet perhaps not to overcall 1@S with the west hand|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: It is impossible not to take the spade Q I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and hope in his eyes...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in hand now|pg||
nt|jtr: Even if he wins and plays one back East will need to find the @d switch to be sure of beating it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and stil thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table of this match is on livestream   http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|jtr: If you need to use the bathroom specs, now would be a good time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this table is on the VG theater in front of spectators|pg||
nt|tlc: 2NT a limit raise or better in hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: well Gitelman has interesting problem. his majors suggest defense, his clubs owe partner a raise|pg||
nt|rv: very aggressive rev drury by Rodwell|pg||
nt|algraves: double game try|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 7@d|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Bidding 5@h with W's hand leave me without voice... (board 2, closed room)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 6 only probably|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: Dont bet on North playing within the next five minutes|pg||
nt|athene: moss isn't stopping surely now his partner hit his six-card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking about 3h bid now|pg||
nt|rv: Moss will pass since he has already bid his hand and has all values outside of @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: If declarer allows Spade Q to hold the trick he will be able to endplay W later|pg||
nt|passell: especially if rosenberg false cards the quenn of diamonds at trick 1|pg||
nt|kareno: Good stop n/s|pg||
nt|algraves: well rv that is their style, their style is aggressive so the Drury is normal for them|pg||
nt|athene: he might pass 4@C but will he pass 4@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck writes down explanations for him|pg||
nt|algraves: Meckwell are actually very disciplined pair|pg||
nt|algraves: like every pair they have a style|pg||
nt|algraves: it may not be your style|pg||
nt|algraves: but it is for sure their style|pg||
nt|rv: good pass by Moss, he has bid his hand and has all values outside of @c suit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, people often confuse having an aggressive system with having an aggressive style - the two things are different|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by both Gitelman and Moss|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Moss in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell has a hand too good to raise to 2@S as a passed hand intheir methods|pg||
nt|algraves: Meck smells a rat|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west surely too good for 2@S with the fourth trump|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Rodwell didn't have mixed raise in their methods on a passed hand, ideal hand for that|pg||
nt|dburn: double probably a game try in spades - 3@s only competitive|pg||
mb|3N|an|alerted|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|jtr: Ducking wasnt a feasible play though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been very interesting [double dummy] to duck trick 1   maybe then Brogeland gets endplayed|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, east made no try |pg||
nt|hedyg: better lead his A@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Easy 3nt without a diamond lead and since they are blocked, even with an unlikely diamond out |pg||
nt|athene: E-W might be Flannery-ites, judging from 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have a card for them|pg||
nt|hedyg: Traian is this not the 3rd segment?|pg||
nt|copeyj: it is yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so pls ignore the title|pg||
nt|henryb:  Other room is still playing Bd 1|pg||
mb|4C|nt|toral5: @D lead as the cards lie was killing|pg||
nt|kareno: Ellen :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, 4 can make if you read it|pg||
nt|kareno: 4 makes with the lucky heart lie|pg||
nt|kareno: But better not finesse the spade.|pg||
nt|passell: playing the queen at trick 1 might induce a heart finesse|pg||
nt|kareno: spade lie, I meant|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth 4@h might be strategic, ostensibly showing more, just tempting Fred to bid again|pg||
nt|athene: now north will surely pass because he isn't in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|athene: he would have had more reason to bid if it went 4@S P P round to him|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: woow ...realy|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they have the keys of the room ? lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow and a plus to boot|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: nice 6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: i prefer 3@c in west|pg||
nt|caitlin: they may get there|pg||
nt|yvesj49: tos how 6 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance again for diamond team|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S is stronger in their methods than in standard Precision, as an omnibus 1@H response handles 8-11 point hands|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 3@H show @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamson writing explanations for Claudio|pg||
nt|algraves: well no here Rodwell could be 3-5 or 3-4 so he was suggesting a final contract with 4@H|pg||
nt|algraves: they have to be accurate on defesne|pg||
nt|algraves: becasue rodwell has ten tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: 6 @S|pg||
nt|algraves: 1@D|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 11 tricks|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jtr: East may just go passive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: Neither minor looks attractive|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think Brogeland should have played @S 6 to indicate no interest for @H. Count is not interesting here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the name field on BBO alowes 10 limit so i asked him to choose his name|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and this is his choice|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he can write for me too ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: here we go|pg||
nt|peachy: Gitelamn has some defense so he is not going to sac, I think|pg||
nt|peachy: well, surely not now:)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Same contract went 2 off in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@C and a ruff|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Great switch|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Silla got it right anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still 3 imps to the italians|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2@H shows also @C|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: may be try 7 with 70 imps off|pg||
mb|4N|nt|algraves: both these is tough bridge for hand 4|pg||
nt|algraves: now they need the club ruff|pg||
nt|algraves: and another ruff for 500|pg||
nt|algraves: or else he makes|pg||
nt|dburn: when Zia didn't bid 3@h and then doubled 4@s, Hamman knew (or strongly suspected) that his partner had a singleton club|pg||
nt|algraves: with 4@H one down|pg||
nt|jallerton: Not so obvious for Moss here|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed not|pg||
nt|algraves: the cast of thousands here is suggesting that A @H @C|pg||
nt|algraves: would have been better|pg||
nt|jallerton: I wonder what @h9 means.|pg||
nt|algraves: the messages are flowing in|pg||
nt|algraves: even the guy from Jakarta|pg||
nt|dburn: like fifty million Frenchmen, 1600 BBO kibitzers can't be wrong|pg||
nt|algraves: 1703|pg||
nt|norby: absoluty dont like 2 club of hamman and moss, for me i see other bridge|pg||
nt|algraves: 1708|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad still thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: 1710|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1600 BBO kibitzers all drinking wine?|pg||
nt|algraves: no me neither Norby|pg||
nt|algraves: I learned game playing rubber bridge for the rent|pg||
nt|algraves: where everyone used penalty doubles etc|pg||
nt|algraves: and oftern partner was incompetent|pg||
nt|norby: i dont bid 2 club also not vulnerable...........whit me also versace lauria sementa duboin madala and other......|pg||
nt|algraves: so you stayed quiet|pg||
nt|dburn: well, @h9 presumably just violently discourages hearts (if they play upside-down)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 2009  NS play upside-down count & attitude    maybe @H9 showed count=odd|pg||
nt|norby: i pass 100%|pg||
nt|dburn: or just shows count (seven rather than five, because he bid 3@h), and partner is expected to work out why Fred doubled|pg||
nt|algraves: but  you know they like the action these guys|pg||
nt|norby: all the italian, i garantizes|pg||
nt|jallerton: If @h9 is disc, how does North know that South is not just implying @dQ?|pg||
nt|algraves: and makes for more exciting bridge if not better|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - my mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: count makes more sense in the auction -- and looking at dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: North rather than South doubled, of course|pg||
nt|dburn: so this is seriously tricky|pg||
nt|algraves: I pass too but respect those who dont, that is what makes bridge such a great game|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad still thinking|pg||
nt|henryb:  Apparently N-S play "Puppet Stayman" over 2N, and the 3@d response (probably) showed no 5 card major but a 4-card major.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Meckwell udca|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Povl Sommer|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure what Moss's double is in this situation, does it show "shall we bid on/save suggesting double" with extra shape or outside values and suggesting defense?|pg||
nt|peachy: NS aqueezed the last drop from this hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|toral5: ahh.suit is blocked|pg||
nt|toral5: hi caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|jtr: There we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3@s then showed four hearts|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry......no plus should be in @Ss.....so obvious|pg||
mb|5N|nt|georgia19: cudda used a vul game|pg||
nt|jtr: an IMP will do meanwhile:)|pg||
nt|algraves: well Moss a passed hand. and is saying you decide partner  , I have some defense for my bidding|pg||
nt|jallerton: With @dQ and a doubleton @c, South may want N to play a low @d from A(xxx)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nicely bidded|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: voila|pg||
nt|othered1: An effective auction|pg||
nt|yvesj49: natural method can arrive at the same contract|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 12|pg||
nt|yvesj49: anybody knows 2NT value ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: a nice grand|pg||
mb|6D|nt|vugraphzta: Hampson in the tank |pg||
nt|caitlin: does this place@CK with Fantoni?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no way to go down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @h are pretty lol|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - what would he lead if he didn't have it?|pg||
nt|tez: natural play..@h ruff 2 times..if overruff with king..finished|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: true David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson stil thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand now|pg||
nt|tez: only down singleton @h and !k of !k offside|pg||
nt|othered1: relative to the lead, IIRC, the Italians in general don't go out of their way to double for a lead|pg||
nt|rv: I presume it is the latter here, some partnerships play the former treatment from hand which is limited and has more shape|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows that Fred has some defense to bid 4@C|pg||
nt|algraves: or enough offense to make 5@C a good save|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree with panel's views|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck put the cards on the table and thinking|pg||
nt|bg: no thx watching vugraph today|pg||
nt|athene: some people play this sort of double - by a hand which isn't expected to bid again - as "action" - the idea is you have a good hand for defence AND bidding on, but it seems a bit ...|pg||
nt|athene: illogical to me - the two things are opposite|pg||
nt|yvesj49: board 4 meckstroth plays 4@s x|pg||
nt|algraves: well illogical or not it is going to result in 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|rv: I think it should be played as either "showing more shape and less defense" or "outside values with defense"|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: oooooooops didnt unblock @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: so only 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: so south's pass of 4@D may not be all that meaningful|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed Marc....I was looking at 2 different boards, not even 1:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: grands on finesses not great idea|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west considering....|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I don't understand 6@d :|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: One king ? but, with Q of @d more... I think E would have to bid 7@d now|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5N choose strain?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|raidouille:  Good news for France ! Two boards from previous segment have been ruled and TDs gave back 20 imps to France (this information was given by a very famous player in Philadelphia)|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow!|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 20 imps ?!|pg||
nt|raidouille:  Yes that's a lot !|pg||
nt|caitlin: the breaks in @S and @D so favourable|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Uncredible|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meantime israel bid and made slam on 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: big hand for brad to get right|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: good try by Lin, envisaging a@D singleton for a @C return|pg||
nt|caitlin: and of prime importance is @C finesse on|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vieuxtroll: Another difficult lead... but may be could be found (4@d in dummy, 4@c in East)...|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I'm speaking about board 3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|jtr: Silla?  Like the sea monster Scylla?|pg||
nt|athene: zia plays it as "i want to sac, but you can pass if you have loads of defence partner"|pg||
nt|jallerton: Spec suggests: Fred should have to overtake with A...and lead @c...everything obvious then...just to save partner's energy:)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|pc|d8|nt|algraves: good for the old confidence|pg||
nt|jallerton: sounds right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: had to play the 10@d to have an ebtry to hand with the 8@d|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is not a sensible play: East was looking at 9HCP; the dummy had 7. Declarer is known to have about 21, so partner cannot have more than a queen and a jack|pg||
nt|yvesj49: west will suffer now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sommer: makes now..|pg||
nt|algraves: this is the second time he has made tight double of meckwell comp 4 Major and right both times|pg||
nt|algraves: first hand of match I believe|pg||
nt|caitlin: time for tea:)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: entry even|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|sommer: ..withput this...|pg||
nt|sommer: ..without|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson shows his cards to Meckstroth|pg||
nt|rv: I like the former treatment by a "pre-emptor or limited hand with fit" doubling high level auction to show more shape and asking partner "shall we bid on"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  the @s10 squeezes dummy first|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pbmarstr: Anyway, another 3 IMP to Z for bidding a better game|pg||
nt|besbes: @c then @s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: yes I prefer that style as well|pg||
nt|raidouille:  So this is a good board for France, since Israel stopped at 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|c6|nt|rv: in my opinion, it takes high precedence over lightner as well|pg||
nt|rv: higher|pg||
nt|algraves: so a good tight decision by Moss to double|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, sorry. declarer can endplay West for one of the tricks he has failed to take|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|othered1: On board 4, Meckwell had to deal with a 11D overcall and a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meantime Claudio cards on the table|pg||
nt|algraves: he has 8 tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kareno: From a spec:  Zia would play a @d here  |pg||
nt|kareno: Could work!!|pg||
nt|toral5: only 8 tricks even aftr @C hook|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson needed to be escorted to the restroom|pg||
nt|kareno: But I'd still rather be in 4@s :)|pg||
nt|sommer: they may bid the game now|pg||
nt|sommer: done|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that we have anywhere to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Can Strul take their foirst IMP in this session?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are 15 down this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: time for some norwegian magic|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see how|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but for a change Fantoni is thinking|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead at trick 1 and that's the end of the defence|pg||
nt|algraves: well that will be the play issue, as to wethe he makes 4 , seems so really|pg||
nt|algraves: Meck thinks he has 6 @D so abandons the forcing defense|pg||
nt|yvesj49: does volcker ruff @s or finesse to win ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east 4@H bid from west, facing a sound raise, with good opening bid and six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: easy 4@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is a standard queen, but it varies at times|pg||
nt|sommer: sure..it was E's bid, wich was tough|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose guess both rounded suits|pg||
nt|jtr: This one is a gimme|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad there aren't any statistics for average time per hand  per player|pg||
nt|jtr: Nobody has a sad enough life to calculate it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye thinking now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes would be high on that list -- maybe even higher than their WBF ranking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking nunes about nt range|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking...he learned from fantoni|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not the fastest player|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well...he is stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky he is not playing with Fantoni|pg||
nt|jtr: Nunes can be slow too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|jtr: I think it was he that took enarly 20 minutes to play a hand the other day|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i had him 2 or 3 times on vg this week and did not seem slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in politically correct speak    they are     deliberate|pg||
nt|jtr: It all revolved around KJ9xx opposite Axx|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not slow, but he likes to think when he has a problem|pg||
nt|jtr: He eventually dropped the doubleton Q offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but cards in his hand|pg||
nt|jtr: It was Fantoni i am told|pg||
nt|algraves: which would have been better|pg||
nt|algraves: he is playing Rodwell for a trump card and heart card so he can get a ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: good shot by Grosset but will not be successful this time it seems|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West has no entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: W@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: queen is an entry|pg||
nt|copeyj: more importantly declarer has no tricks?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ok, on a @S lead it will go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Lin thinking|pg||
nt|copeyj: spose if declarer wins first @H and plays on @D|pg||
nt|copeyj: he can make 5@D one@C 1@H 1@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he has no entry to hand when the @ds are good|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wowwwwwww|pg||
nt|besbes: if not declarer may set up the @s |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pressure now|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: S will have problems to go out from his hand in the end of game, may be...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: strange card !!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: ys - a contract without much hope|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he could play on @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: how does he get to hand to make the @ds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@cs, 3@ds, 1@H 1@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: still off|pg||
nt|caitlin: @S lead defeats 5 unless wheb 2@H played W jumps up with Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I think 2@c shows a good hand but I don't know the structure.|pg||
nt|jtr: Meck was sort of endplayed with the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: screen closed... east askeng leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back up now,,,|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Not lead A of @h please|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|caitlin: one example of few in favour mof bidding stayman|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S may have been a strong relay and 3@S a maximum response, but I'm unsure about that.|pg||
nt|tlc: it almost appears they are playing transfers after 2@C..2@D=@H,2@H=spade pref,2@S=club raise...just guessing..anyone know?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: now volcker is home|pg||
nt|raidouille:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lool|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh well|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Traian, I hate you ! :)|pg||
nt|raidouille:  i was frightened !|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lool|pg||
nt|caitlin: Traian!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: well, East has to hold @S & @D in the endgame|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you need to be optimistic as declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Debbie was watching|pg||
nt|jtr: is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer can come to a slow @c trick for 8|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|algraves: so making 4 for a push|pg||
nt|algraves: easy hand after last one|pg||
nt|algraves: so this was friendly for Fred|pg||
nt|tejjyid: good switch|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hum|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asksabout card ing and the response is udca|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: Volcker went to 4@H after Bessis overcalled 1@s with the E hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pbmarstr: A suspicious mind|pg||
nt|tejjyid: fair enough too|pg||
nt|copeyj: and presumably that has been doubled|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: so looks like another swing to China|pg||
nt|copeyj: lord knows they need it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|caitlin: stats show not bidding stayan with 4-3-3-3 is far superior|pg||
nt|kareno: If you play forcing stayman, then you can get more hands right :)|pg||
nt|toral5: now duboin has the easiest of shifts...|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is an imposing lead the French have built up|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: if Fisher thought about that, he is a genious !|pg||
nt|besbes: stupid |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well..this was the play|pg||
nt|besbes: trump is better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vieuxtroll: and now...|pg||
nt|raidouille:  now you can play your Ace Nico|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: 3@D did make things a little tougher for EW - without it, 3@S is constructive for sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: this French team very strong - won the Europeans in Brasov, Romania, last summer|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: yes !|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tez: 10 trick now|pg||
nt|raidouille:  and spade back|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Nicolas is not sleeping... |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wait..he is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table...|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: everybody wants we die|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Traian, Nicolas... everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west in the tank|pg||
nt|raidouille:  Nico dislike this 4@h|pg||
nt|raidouille:  I think|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: what else than @s ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: East was on lead on open room w @S. Unclear what went wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil in the tank..do noyt go away|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: south could have risen with his @HA to play a diamond and get the @DK set up|pg||
nt|jtr: Now he neds to guess the @h|pg||
nt|jtr: needs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he has to loose a club and a spade... so no imps at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he can even loose some|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: then declarer has to drop the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: playing against sound opening bidders you could do it|pg||
nt|athene: since north would be pretty much marked with the @SQ after south produced the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but Meckwell open pretty light|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nt is 14 to 16 points by Meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: still he has the same decision here, anyway, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|athene: you can't try to endplay north as you can't strip his clubs|pg||
nt|sommer: N MUST have @DK + @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: ah, but the @C7 might get set up - sorry|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and a diamond looks pretty good from here|pg||
nt|algraves: so 9 tricks |pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: I taught it to Lynn Deas decades ago and she loved it enough to adopt it - she's done pretty well I'd say :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|algraves: 5@D 3@H|pg||
nt|raidouille:  sapristi !|pg||
nt|caitlin: @HA, @S and @C are losers|pg||
mc|11|nt|sommer: agreed|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Definitively no Strul IMPs|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and -12 lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: incredible|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: What did he think about ? |pg||
nt|caitlin: not here because W did not return @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: about the 4 of hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio opened 1c lol|pg||
nt|athene: maybe double 3@D would be a game try in spades|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really use 3@H because you need that as natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod said i will claim quickly and he did|pg||
nt|algraves: well I dont think they wanted to be in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not saying Meckstroth actually had a game-try hand|pg||
nt|algraves: diamond by 22|pg||
nt|algraves: with 27 boards to go|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT opening by S in CR, all pass|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the pre-emptive strong NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT has a chance for EW here, 4@H is dead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: claime 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: claimed|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: just wondering what he would do if he did|pg||
nt|athene: probably 4@S :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C, maybe other 4/5 suit|pg||
nt|raidouille:  yes as I said...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I dont think so|pg||
nt|othered1: At these colors, preempt on east's hand is very aggressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky we have screens|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow good suit lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco told him TAKE IT BACK|pg||
nt|jtr: Some 4@s bid next door|pg||
nt|rv: slam time here|pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16 NT this seat|pg||
nt|daman: a sensible auction in the CR|pg||
nt|algraves: you might choose not to open 1NT in standard but in Precision the alternative 1@D is awkward|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell may trf at 4 level and do RKC or trf at 2 level and splinter with 4@d|pg||
nt|algraves: you know this is very much the old guard vs the new kids on the block|pg||
nt|algraves: Diamond just won the Spingold|pg||
nt|caitlin: playing udca?|pg||
nt|caitlin: E-W?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzta: Greco and Sementa are joking at the suggestion that Greco would duck a diamond|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 3nt here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinsonsw and Boyd both point to their bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this what he said|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s 10-15 in theory|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=non-force, 10-13 HCP, 5+@S, unbal, not 4+@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Sort of pushed into it|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother splintering, personally|pg||
nt|algraves: and it is meck style to open a lot of NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=INV+ 6+@H|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@H makes 5 with the @C finesse|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: Fisher is a really good player:) They can be juniors, but their bridge is at top level.|pg||
nt|raidouille:  no count here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: passed out?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no operator error|pg||
nt|kareno: Just undo :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: three passes and Sementa opened 1 @C then Greco bid 1 @S Duboin bid 2 @D and Hampson doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: after 4 passes I cannot undo <<<<<<<<<<<<<<.8|pg||
nt|toral5: lavazza played 4@S in other room:)|pg||
nt|toral5: match getting closer|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sommer: this looks like a solid 4@S EW|pg||
nt|athene: well, EW missed the game in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: (4@H, previous board)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bids are not entered until the board is passed through the screen so that the clicks are not heard :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Daniel Gulyas and Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||
nt|sommer: not sure 1@C is strong (only) ..is it polish-like with forced 1@D?|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|athene: 1@d hearts i'm told, and 1nt strong (18-19)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: also, I do multiple clicks when playing the cards :)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess EW play the style where they just complete the transfer with any weak notrump|pg||
nt|sommer: 1NT looks like a 18-19NT or something|pg||
nt|kareno: Lower level here will change the auction and the pressures on n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: the lack of paint in the tray makes this action much more comfortable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 3@D :(|pg||
nt|algraves: 3NT makes just 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: England's u20s played in 3NT E/W for a swing in - they were plenty down before this set so will need a few more like that|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like a 3 @H bid to me |pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: The 4 of @h is 5 cards or 3, that's all...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks while Boyd writes an explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Nunes playing may be faster|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h has chances|pg||
nt|passell: looks like 5 diamonds even with a trump lead|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess Rod will do something though|pg||
nt|athene: west can just take control, take the pressure off his partner|pg||
nt|rv: he must be assesing his options, looks like he has chosen former option of bidding at 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: suspect better than 3@H|pg||
nt|raidouille:  but I see no shape where @c back is urgent|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 2@H another transfer, so the strong hand gets to play it in spades|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure if 1nt denied four hearts - probably, i would think|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson rubs his head before going back into a reflective pose while considering his bid.|pg||
nt|athene: so west knows that this way he is sure to be dummy and have a nice rest|pg||
nt|algraves: key card|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s is kickback asking for keycards in @s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if i started with X i think i'd pass|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Eric-Geoff' style|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not so sure Mike|pg||
nt|passell: yes it looks like the j of diamonds is likely to score a trick|pg||
nt|norby: now not vulnerable  is possible bid 3 spades......|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not raise hearts, could easily be 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@H= 8-10, 4 cards i would not bid 3NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would rather o'call 1NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: i would not dream of 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this can be some imps to china too|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: guess undo again|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I could not undo, but I redealt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd writes an Rodwell nods|pg||
nt|gulyas: this probably shows both Ms 4-4|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I will be impressed if Nunes make this contract|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow south failed in 6@c|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 24 imp's board....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: how?|pg||
nt|athene: keycards in hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so a routine hand|pg||
nt|norby: can good defense over 4 hearts....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco did upgrade to 1@C  and Hampson 3N West|pg||
nt|hedyg: i meant 3@H by E, Roland , not by W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol Andrew, 1NT overcall vul against not facing a passed partner and unpassed LHO|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think X by west is normal and overcalling 1N deserves to go for 1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: strange|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing with screen..no penaly |pg||
nt|dburn: not especially strange|pg||
nt|dburn: they led a diamond, so he tried to cash spades but West ruffed|pg||
nt|dburn: then, he played West for three trumps rather than two|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but @h are pretty......|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky 1c opening can be a lot of things for fantunes....did not discose to much lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jack 3rd|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: disclose|pg||
nt|yvesj49: expensive board|pg||
nt|norby: if the pd have 4 spades, but now bid pass:-)))|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: why not count ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this was the invitational sequence in spades|pg||
nt|raidouille:  it can be an echo|pg||
nt|yvesj49: simplier a fault lol|pg||
nt|raidouille:  Nico thought that i guess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: So double sounds like it was some sort of Snapdragon|pg||
nt|copeyj: anyway, a chance for China|pg||
nt|raidouille:  afraid of discards on @hs|pg||
nt|caitlin: Open in same contract|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I can't understand that. You give count and leave partner thinking...|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: right...|pg||
nt|raidouille:  Nico is Nicolas Lhuisser, player in West :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sommer: ..ya, but why prefer 3NT to 4@S from E?|pg||
nt|gulyas: with those very strong minor holdings, he decides to play it there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell asks a ? and Boyd quietly explains|pg||
nt|sommer: @Dlead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asking questions and Robinson talks quietly|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@Hlead from @S and @Dshift is good, but hard|pg||
nt|sommer: ..from S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks if the 2 @S bid shows 5 @S and Boyd says yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HJ looks good enough for me|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you would expect declarer to rise the ace and play spades right away|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want a diamond through him|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I think that is what I heard :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamonds are more of a worry than hearts|pg||
nt|tlc: if you run the club 7 and guess right, arent there still chances?|pg||
nt|jtr: Entry problems to hand|pg||
nt|rv: sry keys for @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: another claim coming up|pg||
nt|athene: in the buffett cup they might have bid 6nt :)|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell is very direct in his slam bidding usually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's 2nd hand Greco evaluated stronger than Meckstroth|pg||
nt|tejjyid: don't agree, it's worth 15|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, and minus 1100|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am lost for words|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is endplayed now since @d were his exit cards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X is OK, but conservative |pg||
nt|copeyj: South isn't endplayed yet, Hedy, since he doesn't hold the lead :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: still endplayed :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: why is double conservative? I am 3-3-3-4 with a 14 count (granted with a cpl of 10s) opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|copeyj: my only 4 card suit is the one they have opened on my right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South is a favourite to have the rest so a low heart from hand is not silly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DQ is placed with N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: because if you X you pretty much have to pass next move|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see any other bid than X for W|pg||
nt|hedyg: tell Chen that LOL|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 2@H was 8-10, then pass is auto after the X|pg||
nt|copeyj: if you gave me a choice between 1N and 1N, I would pass|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: probably just nine now, establishing the spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd denied 4 @H|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: screen closed..nunes asking boye about carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and defense|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He has a small chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  maybe @C before 2nd @D so partner can help direct defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|kareno: Exactly - and three pesky diamonds in west.|pg||
nt|passell: I think the jack of diamonds has to score a trick here|pg||
nt|algraves: hmm|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: difficult to think about @c lead ! |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovski in the tank....|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzta: upside down signals|pg||
nt|passell: its hard to find a better defender than Rosenberg|pg||
nt|kareno: Or declarer for that matter - great declarers make great defenders.  |pg||
nt|jtr: Even finessing the @c9 he cant get back to hand to ruff 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Without promoting the @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asks TELL BE ABOUT THE JACK OF HEARTS|pg||
nt|kareno: Would a diamond now do damage or just expose the jack to capture?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rosenberg said HE WANTS THE UNUSUAL SHIFT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: different wavelengths about signal when dummy has singleton?|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - I suspect North was just trying to attack dummy's trumps|pg||
nt|algraves: so Norberto comment was that at this vulnerability good bridge to bid 3@S over 3@C for possible 4@S save or even make|pg||
nt|dburn: he knows the club position is favourable, but West doesn't, and the hand is not so easy for Rodwell now even with the bonus spade trick|pg||
nt|norby: prefere 3 spades now that 2 club before......sure:-))))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and may just disrupt EW auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tez: if greco give 8 of @h..it will be interesting|pg||
nt|algraves: so another push|pg||
nt|tejjyid: good luck clawing back 40 imps with a pass|pg||
nt|copeyj: 28 boards plenty of time without having to roll the dice, IMO|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|toral5: rusinow leads for ew i guess|pg||
nt|daman: the CR is 3 boards ahead of us|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth-Rodwell believe firmly in just keycarding and bashing slams in rather than getting cute with cue-bids and things|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was point of Mike Lawrence in recent ACBL Bulletin article|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he may be thinking of leading @D|pg||
nt|copeyj: i like to keep the match alive rather than killing it by going for 1100 against nothing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: don't blame him - not just a matter of drawing trump and finessing clubs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: not sure that a diamond makes much difference|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: East is slightly endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C7 is mostly Attitude|pg||
nt|jtr: Now he has a good chance of making|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Now remove trump and take the rest with help of heart finesse|pg||
nt|yvesj49: y'll be impressed lol|pg||
nt|jtr: But may be tempted to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the sytem card of the norwegians now|pg||
nt|tez: different line of play|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tejjyid: from the land of the weak NT, Simon, :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@S now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he ducks, Chen will switch his attention to clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: what has playing a weak NT opening got to do with this decision? (and fwiw very few of England's top pairs play weak NT these days)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As stated by Tony Forrester in today's Daily Telegraph|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it has to do with going for 1100 - but you might note the icon at the end of the remark...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Simon did not know I presume|pg||
nt|hedyg: still no result from the other match|pg||
nt|copeyj: nope - they don't sell the DT in Philly :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: Well, it is effectively the same as he needs to ruff with a high one if he plays the 10 first|pg||
nt|norby: better 4 hearts that 3 nt|pg||
nt|algraves: now an easier way to make 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: now club to the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normal line|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell nods but does not play a card|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more nodding|pg||
nt|yvesj49: K @s|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Gains 2IMPs anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|passell: not with the club ruffing in|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow Roland|pg||
pc|s3|nt|algraves: if he cashes @DQ he has show up squeeze for 5 but he maynot want to risk is|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin took the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am normal|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: curious  the way to get a ruff is to NOT try to give partner a ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoping for 3-2@ss|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems a sensible option|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer just hoping for 3-2 spades - not much of a hope, but there wasn't much other hope|pg||
nt|copeyj: if Chen can bring this home which it looks like it will China will gain 10 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lool|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: He can't go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are talking about overtrick(s)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he looks confident|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves: so he takes safe route home for 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell just said I am going to make this|pg||
nt|yvesj49: better to duck 1st @h|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Blackwood accident for France in other room at board 2|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: its interesting to see how these players think these thru - you cannot tell that declarer is only playing for the overtricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: now on a diamond switch he will rise|pg||
nt|athene: hearts 3-3 or the red-suit squeeze is better chance|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell sits back and thinks some more about the hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|algraves: if he is convinced Gitelman out of @S he can take @C finesse in end for overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: pairs OR on webcam now|pg||

nt|athene: a sightly odd decision to go for 3nt with a 4-4 major-suit fit; it's a lot more common with a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of people have been told that it's uncouth to use blackwood so they avoid it even when it's much the best|pg||
nt|algraves: well not quite, but it the not getting cute part is bang on|pg||
nt|algraves: well only spade left was Ace and Brad had led the King|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: china 26-0 this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: israel in the lead early in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW carding   upside-down Attitude  standard Count|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 5 keys it's surprising|pg||
nt|yvesj49: to bid 6|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 2 keys out|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I was just trying to say: the reason why they DON'T claim 9 (or 10) tricks in 3NT - make the opps work for it, its a very long tournament|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: i think mistake between 30-41 and 41-30...|pg||
nt|caitlin: a small oint on that hand but more experienced would not hop uo with trump Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: small point|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pbmarstr: Another perfect result for Z|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: how do u tackle this very @H suit combo in case of silent opps?|pg||
nt|tlc: 1@h=spades after the X|pg||
nt|jtr: X i guess is one minor or the majors?|pg||
nt|passell: 1heart shows spades|pg||
nt|jtr: oops silly sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: double is takeout of diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Steve Robinson would approve of the 1@H opening. "I play 5-card majors" he says|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I was thinking the same thing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it's not the same ? lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I was thinking a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|algraves: so safe to finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 0508 is also 1@H for him|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although, given the relative weakness of the hand, I might join him this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: he didnt duck to @c..so 1 or void in @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: flat board 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: well, he might have opened one - not sure how far he would have to upgrade|pg||
nt|rv: Kickback is a convention where folks bid above trump suit as RKC once fit is established in GF auction, 4@d for @c keycards, 4@h for @d keycards, 4@s for @h and 4n for @s|pg||
nt|algraves: oh well|pg||
nt|norby: maybe rodwell is tired, play all the boards|pg||
nt|caitlin: new computer which needs new keyboard, sorry|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: east has a lot of points but a lot of losers, and three small hearts is very bad news|pg||
nt|athene: maybe passing 2@S isn't ridiculous|pg||
nt|kareno: One point with a bad hand and vulnerable.|pg||
nt|jtr: Not much worse than an earlier upgrade and that was what i was thinking about|pg||
nt|jtr: My brain forgot to change gear:0|pg||
nt|jtr: Must get an automatic next time|pg||
nt|warrens:   the other upgrade had a 5-card suit and was non-vul|pg||
nt|tlc: the earlier upgrade had a 5th spade|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at the other table North knew South had diamonds, so he bid diamonds (or at any rate, he transferred to diamonds)|pg||
nt|dburn: and South made a lot of tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: here, no one knew anyone had diamonds, and East will make enough tricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: And 1NT should do ok this way|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Willenken thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|tlc: seems  right to win on the table and lead clubs..|pg||
nt|passell: continuos heart lead will make communication difficult for 7th trick  or a spade shift|pg||
nt|kareno: That seems the natural line of play.|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, something will have to give for the defence|pg||
nt|dburn: at least, he will now - if anyone had known anyone else had diamonds, the defenders could have led diamonds and shifted to spades at some point, and that would have beaten 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east stil thinking....|pg||
nt|passell: yes looks like this will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we have a cameraman walking with a camera in her hand around the room|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose he could play for 2@s tricks and let the defence give hima  trick in the minors|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|algraves: so this will come down the end game for 5 or 6|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kareno: Not enough entries for two finesses I think - |pg||
nt|yvesj49: puppet ?|pg||
nt|tez: you can see with king of @s|pg||
nt|rv: it is more useful for RKC in minor suit where 4n may to too high for asking aces and stopping at 5 level|pg||
nt|algraves: oh yes, plus mixed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Zimmerman 21-0 for the set   think how much more it could have been|pg||
nt|jtr: Likely one more here|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in theory it's superior as you have more room for the lower trump suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: North in the tank|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sight of relief...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: North did not play...so no relief yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N can't have the ace. Becasue then he would not have the queen and then Lorenzini would have led that card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The king is destined to win|pg||
nt|tejjyid: should unblock , J is not from JT empty |pg||
nt|hedyg: they play smith echo|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: north is thinking|pg||
nt|tejjyid: from AQJTx, you lead the Q, Roland? Interesting...|pg||
nt|hedyg: reversed by leader, standard by his pd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what would you lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they lead Q shows J, J shows 10|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T, Roland. It's old, but I enjoy it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 2@C exactly 3@H Drury  [2@D=4+ fit]|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell has to protect diamonds and the ten of clubs and wont be able to do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson just blasted 4@S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sommer: 1@D was just transfer with @H .. http://usbf.org/docs/2006usbc/SSF/06boydrobinson.htm|pg||
nt|algraves: remember bridge buddies out there that these guys have been playing since last saturday|pg||
nt|norby: good stop|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead for the defense.  |pg||
nt|bessi2: it is surely an option.. his pd could hardly hold a better hand for 2@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quick play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: director happy|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess the moral is, whether you are insuring your jewellery or playing bridge, it helps to know how many diamonds you have|pg||
nt|jtr: But he may get squeezed doing that|pg||
nt|athene: the only danger is when the RKCB suit might be potentially natural|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzta: players to the bathroom .... all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: break here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or rest room lol|pg||
nt|tez: here too.brb|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably because they are playing too fast|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 coke 2 grappa lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i will not redeal unyil players back at the table|pg||
nt|udo: riesen|pg||
nt|udo: sy, priv|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: taking close-ups from players|pg||
nt|jtr: That is what he chose|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he has played on a suit that allows the defence to shift to... you've guessed it, diamonds|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes and take 2@ss 2@cs 3@ds|pg||
nt|kareno: So he's going for two spades, four hearts and a minor suit trick.|pg||
nt|tlc: but now a @D will beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell put the cards on the table now|pg||
nt|algraves: this is day 11 and Meckwell carry a huge load on this team|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vieuxtroll: first big world final for Grosset-Lorenzini... a few nervous, I think|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not an easy lead for volcker|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: I agree, passing is certainly a possibilty|pg||
nt|jtr: He did well not to play a @c|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if his partner had clubs he could have led them|pg||
nt|yvesj49: best is K@c but he can't find|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: @s give a problem to South, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher in the tank now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: a@s k@d k@h a@h and diamonds ???|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: probably...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: fast lead @s seems king bad located|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil in the tank|pg||
nt|yvesj49: we understand......|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if he finesse, he can go down with k@s in east and q@h in west|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|toral5: if hes forced to ruff 2@S,def has 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: i think i should betr slep.i m seeing @H as 4-0|pg||
nt|jtr: Meck could easily have them  But maybe then he would have led one|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|athene: i think M-R have some interesting comment in their notes like "4 of unfocused major is keycard"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I want dome of the drug you are on, Andrew. Pray tell what it is :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he takes my line.........|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: That defense should be clear to Greco after this spade play.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: is Fantoni @H8 then @H4 asking for @S?|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess so|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: I beat you in sentence length if not speed|pg||
nt|passell: diamond pouring it on in other match|pg||
nt|tlc: a ping pong match this hand has become..|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vieuxtroll: So, playing for @h 3-2 and @d 4-3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|toral5: now fate of the contract only on @H guess|pg||
nt|algraves: I meant they play more boards usually than anyone else at a world championship|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kareno: Wheels within wheels.  North should wonder why east did not continue spades.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa just plays with his tricks that lie before him|pg||
nt|rv: ok Meckwell are 10 years ahead of rest of the world:)|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't want to wheel that one out at the table without a lot of trust that partner knows when a suit is in focus :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jtr: Pinged again|pg||
nt|tlc: yup :)|pg||
nt|tlc: a spade instead of club wouldve found him home|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will make 5|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i'm happy said droopy.........|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yvesj49: yesssssssss|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: but as it is, 4-1 trumps and a couple of finesses offside make this go down|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|norby: not easy this stop at 3 spades, any players considered max the hand of meckstroth.....ace of spades A-R of hearts ace of diamond and 4-4-3-2......compliments meck|pg||
nt|norby: 7 half controls......mmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - I had thought he would bid four, with everything in aces and kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: He can rely on Rodwell to bid game with any excuse, so no need to stretch|pg||
nt|jallerton: @hAK doubleton a slight negative feature though, David|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe with @hAKx and two low clubs, he would have done|pg||
nt|norby: sorry, and 10 of spades .....lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, not often Nickell picks up a swing when Meckwell are out of game and the other room in it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: tends to be vice versa, but I guess not with Hampson and Greco at the other table|pg||
nt|norby: sometime i ask at 1 of the best players american , kibbitzer now in this table, and alwais me and he bid same....|pg||
nt|jallerton: There are a lot more super-aggresive pairs playing these days.  Times have changed.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jtr: Final pong maybe|pg||
nt|passell: looks like declarer might have gone after clubs early|pg||
nt|kareno: This is known as a contest between the declarer and the defense.|pg||
nt|tlc: this is why 1NT hands are so much fun to watch...|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like the declarer is going to win - and go down.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson jokingly says, I don't have the rest? And Meckstroth repeats down 2|pg||

nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL Ellen.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I feel the tide may have turned on that @s view|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in play|pg||
nt|jtr: A couple of intricate hands where we had as many problems as declarer:)|pg||
nt|tlc: so a push after all that|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director just said 1 hour remaining|pg||
nt|rv: Last 2 sessions of World Open Pairs will also be played today and 5 session finals willt start tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was a case of power of 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: now karen can say:ALWAYS play 2 way stayman:)|pg||
nt|toral5: it always helps.lol|pg||
nt|kareno: I do always :)|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes 2-way was very popular here but not now|pg||
nt|toral5: greco wd b amused to see 2@H opening frm his pd|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: since the players can hear the clicking of the mouse, the bids are not input until the board is pushed under the screen :)|pg||
nt|toral5: looking at his @H holding|pg||
nt|sommer: W MIGHT have not valued @HK and chosen 3@S, though|pg||
nt|yvesj49: cool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as Roland said -- properly located opp kings|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: W had to leave a diamond for -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(14)15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=1-suit @H/@S|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: France off the Schneider|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: and 4@H is down|pg||
nt|toral5: did he overcal 2@S??|pg||
nt|kareno: I might have made the LoTT bid of 5@h with the east hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: othing can be told from Greco's expressionless face|pg||
nt|gulyas: for all he knew, E could have held something useful in @H|pg||
nt|jtr: @c ruff needed to defeat 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 2nt is to play Boye said|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@d for E/W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Peter -- 1-suit with major OR  any strong 5+5+|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 4@s by north|pg||
nt|dburn: very awkward for South, this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia bid 3N in this same situation|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bessi2: yes.. i agree with 2@s.. kx in hearts is a terrible holding|pg||
nt|jtr: Even though this room started late?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this what he said..|pg||
nt|dburn: that I would have guessed for sure|pg||
nt|norby: not easy gitelamn s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: The hand with the distribution must take the pressure in the auction.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rather nothing|pg||
nt|sommer: lower values - better game|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s opening forcing 1 round..13+|pg||
nt|jtr: I thought 8 minutes a board with screens?|pg||
nt|tlc: let me guess:2@C is meckwell?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think he is logged in bbo.. WE CAN ARGUE WITH HIM LOL|pg||
nt|jallerton: South needs quite a lot from North for 3NT to be right|pg||
nt|norby: like 3 nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when fixed, stay fixed. good rule of thumb|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s weak 5-4|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3!nt or 4@s ?|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Hard for Volcker-Bessis looking Israel writing in is column again and again...|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: but may be -1 if N play A od @h and @d... |pg||
mb|1H|nt|yvesj49: 14 i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  in meckwell, 2@C=@C + Major, so this must be something else|pg||
nt|athene: who had seating rights this set? i.e. whose decision was it to put the similar systems the same way?|pg||
nt|rv: Top 4 placed teams in Juniors and Youngsters will get to choose their QF opponent with c/o as well|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if you need swings you sit the opposite way|pg||
nt|daman: here is the vugraph schedule for today and beyond     http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: 2 @H alerted with a waggle|pg||
nt|tez: may have 37:)|pg||
nt|algraves: this has chances of course|pg||
nt|algraves: the @D favourable|pg||
nt|rv: sry top 3 gets to choose and 4th placed team plays the team not chosen team from 5-8|pg||
nt|daman: here is the homepage for the Worlds             http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Bulletins.htm|pg||
mb|2N|nt|toral5: duboin with the highest hcps was watching ,til 3 players bid:)|pg||
nt|jtr: And here it comes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I must say I would be bidding 4@s with south's hand.  No trump tricks, not many tricks ar all but a spade fit.|pg||
nt|tlc: apparently 2C was landy, showing the majors|pg||
nt|warrens:   oh, now it's @D or Majors.|pg||
nt|warrens:  thanks|pg||
nt|norby: i dont pass, so the less worst is 3 nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Birman thinking|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2@C was majors - 2@D a @H transfer|pg||
nt|kareno: Just high enough and not too hign ;0|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, on this lead anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: A @h might not have been so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And a source of tricks in clubs.|pg||
nt|gulyas: another game missed I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rather the 1 nt bid was alerted by wiggling the 2 @H bidding card|pg||
nt|bessi2: the natural method works better here then gazilli for example in which case e-w would be plaing 2@s|pg||
nt|sommer: getting rid of @HJ helps:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zia bid 3NT in a split second!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bid 2@c with north's hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: slow for him - must be getting tired|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia couldn't guess Rabbi's Rule in @C after @S lead|pg||
nt|norby: not normal bid but correct bid|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3@s i don't like|pg||
nt|raidouille:  why is he thinking ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: a heart lead appears to be the winning lead on this layout|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wowwww very good lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: trump promotion|pg||
nt|yvesj49: helas|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: should i ask him?|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|athene: north really ducked there?|pg||
nt|gulyas: in precision, you bid this very fast: 1@C-1@D-1@S-1NT-2@H-4@H I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell did duck the J @H!|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he keeps the @HJ to overruff in spades, potentially|pg||
nt|rv: can|pg||
nt|rv: can|pg||
nt|rv: can't see this going down with @SQ favorably placed and 22 break|pg||
nt|athene: the best the defence can do is force dummy with clubs, so declarer can't pick up the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: but that's still only three tricks total for them|pg||
nt|algraves: right so this will make one way or another|pg||
nt|algraves: as in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad thinking|pg||
nt|athene: i guess on a club here, rodwell will come to hand and ruff his last club before playing trumps|pg||
nt|athene: he can't play a trump and risk the defence drawing trumps and cashing a club|pg||
nt|rv: this is 60 brd match comprising of 15 brds in each of 4 segments|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 64 boars today|pg||
nt|algraves: no it is a 64 board match|pg||
nt|rv: all matches till R16 comprised of 14x4 brds, from QFs onwards they are playing an extra brd in each segment|pg||
nt|rv: oh sry|pg||
nt|yvesj49: for 6 lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: i am also bidding 4@S.pd cd easily ve 6@S|pg||
nt|kareno: And there goes the club trick.|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|athene: this gives declarer more options, which sort of makes it a harder hand to play|pg||
nt|athene: you might now be able to survive a diamond loser sometimes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod in the tank now|pg||
nt|rv: has Nickell team won this event? I suspect this is only missing major trophy in their cabinet:)|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 3@s is not french style... but Tarnovsli's not french :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 6@d in dummy :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bad news for east|pg||
nt|yvesj49: well tried|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Argelazi in the tank now|pg||
nt|raidouille:  yes but this is obvious|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yvesj49: have to find  Q @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: Zia made 3NT on an elegant end game|pg||
nt|norby: if double 3 nt i bid redouble for minors......perfect:-)))|pg||
nt|yvesj49: specs i see the contrcat can't go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: Looks like the CR result will be copied|pg||
nt|jtr: @c10 better by South|pg||
nt|tlc: as David already pointed out :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: E has a good hand for Gazzilli! ..2@C is EITHER natural or 17(16)+ . That MIGHT have taken EW to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Then the 9 might look as being suit preference for @hs|pg||
nt|pietraccio: , |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: The only doubleton honnour I've never lead are kings... I'm happy to see Thomas thinking like me :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but if declarer have 2 @d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|toral5: this is making now|pg||
nt|kareno: AND the diamond trick.|pg||
nt|toral5: to late for the shift:(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 2@d overcall and 4 @s in east....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your bids are not normal, norby?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: A two trick compression by the defense.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa is yelling at Duboin|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|athene: well, whatever happens he is making an overtrick now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: easy now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: this 9@s will do a good job|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: i don't see anyone getting to game without the help of powerful hallucinogens|pg||
nt|bessi2: not so sure about that.. west would bid 2@s over 2@c showing a bad hand and east then has no bid I would think|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yvesj49: not a perfect count but |pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: both pairs play standard carding|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Greco cards on the table....thinking|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if east plays k@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco thinking|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yvesj49: nice|pg||
nt|jallerton: Would you bid 3NT at other vulnerabilities too?|pg||
nt|norby: no pass, so......|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves: the logic behind 3NT is that partner rates to have some cards and as east did not raise a few spades|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio put the cards on the table|pg||
nt|yvesj49: his round lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Q@c or 2 off lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Claudio reading the bulletin...no worries|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the 'playboy' bulletin ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nope... :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i will recomend for next session|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Q@c more important here than playboy girls lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not for Claudio|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lolllllll|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1 off in other room maybe zimmerman get the lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: give another bulletin for claudio lol|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|norby: 3 nt is inteligent bid|pg||

nt|gulyas: also, if you are non-vul, you are not pushing games as hard - vul games are worth a lot!|pg||
nt|sommer: game was not %-well, tho|pg||
nt|sommer: but good to bid, when it makes;-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: discussing the hand all 4 of them now|pg||
nt|tez: fulvio hopes long @d  and 4 @s at east|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice to see such players on BBO|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director said ...58 minutes to play|pg||
nt|algraves: Hamman and Zia having a good game in other room|pg||

nt|yvesj49: 6@c............|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|caitlin: sae contract in closed|pg||
nt|copeyj: strange auction from the closed room - does anyone know what 2@D opening is for Bessis/Volcker?|pg||
nt|copeyj: if it is a strong bid, it is astonishing that south never bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: can only guess it includes 8 playing trick types|pg||
nt|copeyj: even if it isnt - it seems a bit much to me to pass throughout with 7 solid @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: Traian has USA 1 given up? |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i do not know|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very passive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i do not think so.. 28 boards to go|pg||
nt|yvesj49: a board for french column lol|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jtr: Hmm 3NT looks beatable|pg||
nt|algraves: North does not expect to be dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but no results anywhere|pg||
nt|tejjyid: just a question of how many...4 looks about right|pg||
nt|yvesj49: marc will be happy|pg||
mb|3D|an|hearts|nt|ahollan1: south too good for 1N|pg||
nt|algraves: all 4 pairs are playing very hard right now just as you would expect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lin might be tempted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he bids again they will arrive in the failing slam|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 2@s... |pg||
nt|davidb: bid of a man|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|caitlin: 2@C artificial game force|pg||
nt|toral5: duboin played sementa for aj @S.so tried a @S ruff effect.but tht dint sound gud cos sementa cd easily have 6@S|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, E would have a "little" 3@H:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, both the last game (4@S bd7) and this (bd 8) were so-so games, but since the first one was in vul, they went for it|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
nt|rv: 5 level is not safe here, good to see NS in CR stopping in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the best trial bid?|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 6 imp out... but I prefer Volcker's bid of 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Even on a @s lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@S=6+ @S's|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not so easy to bid 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: its simple - say the other table misses the game: if non-vul, you are +6 if you make, -6(-5) if you don'T|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd rubs his chin while he thinks|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you are vul, you lose 6 if it didn't make, but gain 10-11 if it does|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: So far the Zimmermann team has played a perfect session and there has been nearly no possibilities to gain IMPs for Strul.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: enough to rread another bulletin lol|pg||
nt|jtr: It looks like East may need to unblock the @s double dummy|pg||
nt|norby: i agree 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 3@s...|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: this is a new treatment catching on|pg||
nt|algraves: direct 2@S weak|pg||
nt|copeyj: nice bid from Lorenzini - socked it to the chinese|pg||
nt|davidb: after partner passed hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: 3nt is a winner here.|pg||
nt|toral5: especially aftr knowing tht sementa has a low hcp overcal|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that the other room is playing the same board.|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah no entry short|pg||
nt|kareno: Need spade onside for any game |pg||
nt|tejjyid: West was a bit stuck, but to overbid at this vul is normal|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S good bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: @hA led next door|pg||
nt|algraves: weakissh|pg||
nt|algraves: so 1 and 2@S forcing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3nt|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or 3@h|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: easiest after 2NT over 1@h, I think|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
pc|h3|nt|toral5: only makeable contract is 3nt here|pg||
nt|toral5: wel done|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin says his pd is 3 5 3 2 shape|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, if West has Kxx it wont help anyway as he has an entry for @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: In NT that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zia thought 3@H was|pg||
nt|norby: probabily make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that 3@d might put Rodwell off a diamond lead|pg||
nt|algraves: this is interesting @D position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia's 3@H was old generic game try|pg||
nt|algraves: defense must stay passive|pg||
nt|norby: also with passive lead|pg||
nt|dburn: but still, the rest of his hand is not very attractive either...|pg||
nt|algraves: but declarer can guess the combination after stripping the hand|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3 club with @s discard, trumps, and @s :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i hate 1@s with this hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rv: It is confirmed by a lot of specs that Rosenblum is only missing trophy in Nickell's impressive trophy cabinet(s), similar to how French Open was to Federer till recently:)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d bid may help the opening leader|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A 6-loser hand is usually worth a try, the question is which with that hand|pg||
nt|algraves: not now|pg||
nt|norby: elimination and diamond versus Q8|pg||
nt|reisig: Next!|pg||
nt|algraves: cruel game , we will never know|pg||

nt|liujing: I think our young guys did very well in previous 8 boards|pg||
nt|liujing: but they need more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did|pg||
nt|copeyj: they did, but this well be a painful swing|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they do :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: when they were on the comeback|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bidding again with Lin's hand is not unreasonable; Chen could have had more|pg||
nt|liujing: not this one|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This will hurt, really no way out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, he was under pressure after 4@C|pg||

nt|yvesj49: thje road is open.........|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@d|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Bessis thinking about 4-3-1-5 in W|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and BW|pg||
nt|yvesj49: LET HIM THINK THAT MARC LOL|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Volcker in the tank now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: no endplay ... no make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way to make this - you can ruff the @HK down but you don't have the entry to cash the @HQ|pg||
nt|sommer: Boyd was tempted by his 4-loser hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 1 @D usually promises 2 @D|pg||
nt|bessi2: only way to let this through is if meck ducks the Q of clubs but I dont see that happening|pg||
nt|athene: E-W in the other room given a much easier ride; east could show extras and stop in 3@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: with both @CA and @HK wrongly placed for declarer, he is likely to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks for a review of the bidding|pg||
nt|gulyas: good lead there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: had had placed the 4 @C bid near the table, withdrew it, and then placed it there again :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: this is a rather nasty play problem though.. he might even finesse the hearts trick 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, but still 1 down|pg||
nt|bessi2: either that or cross to the ace of hearts to play a club.. playing Rodewell for axx in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks for a further explanation of the 1 @S bid made by Rodwell, which denied 5 spades|pg||
nt|sommer: he may go for @CAxx in N too|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but still -1 at least|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think he will finesse hearts trick 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: -1 most likely, either losing the 4th @C or the @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd makes no move to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: keeps shifting in his chair :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks another question of the bidding|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Moss's 3@c is transfer to @d?|pg||
nt|athene: Maybe Moss is wondering if 4@S is Kickback (re. previous discussion) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is thinking|pg||
nt|rv: have the rules changed, earlier every pair had to play a min of 33% of boards in finals to be eligible for title, I am told Nickell, Wolfson etc played only 1 set in semis ...|pg||
nt|rv: yesterday, have the rules changed for each pair to play only 25% of boards?|pg||
nt|algraves: bridge bidding at the top expert level continues to evolve in two ways|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Moss stil thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: one that will be come more and more common is non disclosure of uneccessary information|pg||
nt|rv: or is it cumulative 33% of boards across all k/o matches to be eligible for title and WBF MPs?|pg||
nt|algraves: and 2, savinb space via new agreements and mid auction transfers|pg||
nt|algraves: such as this treatment|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|toral5: last brd proved to be very costly.|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to run into a trump promotion with 2-2 trumps but he certainly can't afford to cash a second top trump if they are 3-1 and then be denied a club ruff|pg||
nt|norby: bad game, heart 2-2 and position of king of diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So give some credit to Lorenzini|pg||
nt|liujing: I think 4@C works here|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was under cruel ald unnatural pressure after that remarkable 4@c overcall|pg||
nt|liujing: both Chen and Lin know they need more IMPs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|algraves: they are not safe at 5 level with a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: south has certainly shown a very strong hand with this sequence (otherwise 4@S rather than 3@S) and i guess north thinks two aces and a spade, when he might have a void, is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: or any lead maybe|pg||
nt|algraves: they are at risk of 1@C 1@D and 1 trump loser|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: only 9 tricks now... may be a squeeze |pg||
pc|hK|nt|sommer: agree with @Hfinesse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..now:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: signals in trump suit are asked with 2 possible answers given|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Volcker is thinking about pass of E in first|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: He's not sure a slam is possible....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: N/S at the other table have had a fairly horrid time|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|liujing: I can totally understand 4@S from Chen and Lin's 6@S|pg||
nt|liujing: though I don't quite agree with 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East could perhaps have tried 5@C as a co-operative try, but he has such great trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zhuo could also have bid 4@C next door. He was very passive|pg||
nt|liujing: Indeed|pg||
nt|dburn: tough to pass - the usual rule is to be prepared to bid one more than your values but not two more|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the other match there are 5 results only for the 1st 9 boards, none of which less than 12 imps|pg||
nt|dburn: so West, who had just about a 3@s bid was prepared to bid four|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 4 push hands|pg||
nt|liujing: actually before the start of this set, I helped Zhuo and Liu study Bessis's convention card|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, although his shpe is bad, his controls are good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right David, but would West not also have bid 4@S if he had @HK instead of the jack? Then they have 12 toptricks|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Not easy to bid 6 after thinking in W...|pg||
nt|besbes: why not 4@d fred|pg||
nt|besbes: @c is trump!! |pg||
nt|yvesj49: very strange.......|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think this is east problem....why west did not bid 4d|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if thomas bid 6 he is an heroe.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: anyway Bessis in the tank at the moment|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: anf if he doesn't, he is too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil in the tank|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: afraid of ridiculous slam with 2 aces out|pg||
nt|besbes: i know this problem establish the trump i dont know if they have discussed this one|pg||
nt|yvesj49: we have to push thomas !!!!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: gooooooooooooo thomas|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: you're right, Michel, it's very important. Without discussion, you can play 7 with Ace of trump out after BW !|pg||
nt|yvesj49: -10 board 6|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably not the same lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: thomas if you bid 6 i offer you 2 drinks in 'saint cloud'|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: birman leads low from KJxxx, not Q from QJx.|pg||
nt|besbes: i have two pages with tom about 4th suit after pass but fred did not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: israel has a healthy lead after 6 boards scored|pg||
nt|yvesj49: give him michel lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east still in the tank|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: the problem now is that once they get into control-showing territory, it can be hard to stop out of slam when you DO have enough controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: new leader at the end of this board|pg||
nt|yvesj49: grrrrrrrrr|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: the 1@H bid might itself be light but you would not expect south to bid 2@S on a known 3-card suit with no values|pg||
nt|athene: so you know he has something|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just hoped it was the @HK, reasonably enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: orry folks, techinical difficulties|pg||
nt|gulyas: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|sommer: wlc back|pg||
nt|jtr: Meckwell arent use to having so many pooints for their 3NT contracts|pg||
nt|jtr: They usually make them with fewer|pg||
nt|algraves: unlucky hand for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: play will be faster |pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I think ha can't really bid 6 when fred said 4@h ant then 5@c... |pg||
nt|yvesj49: sur |pg||
nt|yvesj49: volcker's bids are not encoraging after 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: without a 4d bid hard to bid 6|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: It will be very difficult for France now after this KO beginning...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the match is fresh...64 boards is a long long way|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: The board 6 is good for my theory : you have to lead under kings, because when it's not good... it's good !|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovki asking questions at the moment|pg||
nt|yvesj49: did he asked do you underbid ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Tarnovski stil did not lead|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: the match is long, but if Israel bid 6@c in closed room, France will loose more than 40 in less of 10 boards... not easy to get up after that when you are 26 years old...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vieuxtroll: and not easy at 50 and more, too :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: are we down yet?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thought long and hard and returned a low spade finally|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure he would - as LiuJing says, I completely understand why this happened|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has to try|pg||
nt|liujing: I did tell them more inteference after their 2 level opening|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but BW is too unilateral|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzta: finally down one|pg||
nt|sommer: ..not 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: its hard to see how he lost more than 4 tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: this is decent slam|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: nice @D98|pg||
nt|yvesj49: so never easy ?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|warrens:  is it possible for declarer to shorten himself enough?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: how good is slam on a club lead?|pg||
nt|warrens:  not now I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fred put AKQ on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck said I have jack fourth|pg||
pc|d2|nt|norby: zia bid: 1 heart 2 heart 3 heart |pg||
nt|norby: old styile:-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod in the tank at the moment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 IMP at stake|pg||
nt|jallerton: East may not have had an opportunity to give suit pref|pg||
nt|reisig: 450 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 or 7 to Diamond|pg||
nt|jallerton: is that count?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am referring to IMPs, not @D7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems best chance at beat is Meck @SKx     |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: so  low @S to King then @S thru|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Coindicentally, it was @D7 and 6   lol|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tez: hampson greco play 2 way checkback stayman..2@d was relay to 2@d..then 2@s invitation to game with 5@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep...you said it exactly like Hampson expalined to Claudio|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i was in 'Estoril' 2005 and was soon eliminated (bad luck for sure...) and watching fantoni nunes at vugraph was a great pleasure|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoping for 3-3@cs 4-3@ds and the @s finesse|pg||
nt|tlc: eemed better to duck the 1st @C, so maintain communications, that play the AK first|pg||
nt|jtr: In theory yes  Good point and would save a trick|pg||
nt|jtr: He had certain npositions in @cs though|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: This would not make at the local club|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: At the other table the lead was @H ace from Weinstein who gave the ninth trick|pg||
nt|jtr: QJx with East say|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s7|nt|liujing: 2@D in the other room shows 22-23HCP BAL or any 8.5tricks+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Preparing a Vienna Coup, but South can hardly have that much|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|warrens:  Willenken want to make sure he doesn't get endplayed|pg||
nt|dburn: when both players make overbids that would each be marginal in themselves, the final contract usually fails without anyone having done much wrong|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pbmarstr: Here the contract could have been beaten|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yvesj49: fulvio is a fantastic card player|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: no more communications for it...|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: a little break here|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes lead cuts down necessary ruffs|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: If Robert get the third trump from dummy and play @c...|pg||

pc|h4|nt|fokal: declarer takes the switch ruff a club, and cash the last trump|pg||
nt|besbes: if declarer plays another @s south has to take with the queen|pg||

nt|Zmud99: no they start 15 mns after in genaral to get comparisons|pg||
nt|daman: they had a head start in the CR I presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no time issue here|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: 2@h some sort of two-suiter I imagine if it's alerted.  They'll end up in 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco writing to explain the 4 @C|pg||
nt|toral5: fit leader 4@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is probably down, but 4@S could be close|pg||
nt|athene: the defence just have to get their club set up here before it vanishes on a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: south had better not lead his singleton!|pg||
nt|algraves: i am in no hurry|pg||
nt|yvesj49: north bid......or not......|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I think he will|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more slams?|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: thinking about 2@s or 3@h !|pg||
nt|caitlin: N as nice hand w @H fit|pg||
mb|2H|an|alerted|nt|toral5: 4@S|pg||

nt|reisig: Luck counts too!|pg||
nt|caitlin: N HAS (ordered new keyboard!!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 4@c would suggest clubs (if that's east's second suit) or else hearts.|pg||
nt|toral5: now the real fun starts|pg||
nt|sommer: @S@S and @Cshift needed to sink 4@H|pg||

nt|yvesj49: traian, we are commentators and specs lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: probably 5@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 4-0 trump break|pg||

nt|kareno: Whoops - there goes a club trick.  But there aren't eleven tricks (or even close if defense leads trumps).|pg||
nt|kareno: Could be down one from this point, though.|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards lie,trump lead and @C ace was best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco puts his cards down and holds his head between his hands|pg||
nt|toral5: and than @D.tht wd ve been 800 i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa is fidgeting and his leg jiggles|pg||

nt|caitlin: Dismond has picked up 27 IMPs so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: "Sorry" from Greco|pg||
nt|sommer: good 4@S and sac|pg||
nt|athene: north with five spades and the void in hearts doesn't want to double and double, because that will lead to partner passing too often|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4@s might have been a close affair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks Robinsons if his bid shows a minimum and Robinson concurs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-18 HCP, not 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: action heroes ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod asking fred about the 3s bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: and Fred explaining|pg||
nt|athene: does this double just say "i don't want to bid 5@H" or what?|pg||

nt|algraves: welll we wont know |pg||
nt|dburn: Grosset may not have a way to intervene directly over 1NT, but he judged pretty well to pass over 2@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: what should he bid?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzta: danger lurking|pg||
nt|athene: that's some view from Rodwell - the most misfitting shape Meckstroth can reasonably have on this auction is 3-4-2-4, i guess|pg||
nt|peachy: this was a tough competitive auction|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps rodwell hopes for four spades opposite, and NS getting frisky|pg||
nt|algraves: there wasnt any defense that I can see|pg||
nt|peachy: I must admit I would have bid 5H, but my agreements are not as firm obviously|pg||
nt|algraves: even a @D lead moss just ducks and has ten tricks|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so the lead changes hands again|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bessi2: in the Wolfson-Fleisher match one table made it while the other wend down in 4@s I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards before leading|pg||
nt|jtr: Great @d switch by Helgemo next door|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these guys love to lead from Jxx|pg||
nt|jtr: And good lead here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have friend who berates partner/teammates anytime the lead from unprotected Jack -- even when it is right!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: Here the @ds are blocked|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmmmmm|pg||
pc|h4|nt|toral5: ?????|pg||
nt|toral5: undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for holding up the play|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C might have eleven tricks? five spades, four clubs in south hand, two ruffs in north hand|pg||
nt|algraves: played by east with @D lead no doubt in other room|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzta: woooow|pg||
nt|dburn: well, perhaps not quite right|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe not so right :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: optimistic|pg||
nt|caitlin: woke me up!!|pg||
nt|othered1: it was right not to play 4@HX . . .|pg||
nt|tez: with acelees hand 4 nt..i dont agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred back in the lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agree with yu tez|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @c for sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: of course, no-one is going to play in a mere 5-4 club fit with a splendid 5-3 spade fit available|pg||
nt|tez: np other leads|pg||
nt|dburn: why would anyone lead the ace of clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco choosing not to lead one of his bullets|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sommer: Boyd will see a small hope, when @DJ falls, but he will be disappointed|pg||
nt|tez: we belive they will not ruff to @c ace|pg||
nt|othered1: with partner's double of 4@S, how could east lose an ace?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: I don't believe they will either, but if partner has the king of spades and the ace of hearts is not cashing, it might be a good idea to establish spades for our side and not clubs ...|pg||
nt|dburn: for their side|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg thinking|pg||
nt|tlc: interesting if he takes the wrong major suit finesses and eric exits a low club..|pg||
nt|warrens:  a @H to the jack now?|pg||
nt|algraves: Welll since we can see all the cards and Rodwell has won about 200 world championships what we would have done is nt very relevant|pg||
nt|algraves: to make 6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: certainly hard to find:)|pg||
nt|jtr: But they can get the @cs going|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: sorry|pg||
nt|tez: some spec says 4NT shows even number of controls|pg||
nt|caitlin: ok.......W letting declarer on dummy|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and @s from dummy|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@d and 2@s |pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzta: Boyd is emotionless upon receiving the bad news|pg||
nt|athene: well, 4-0 hearts isn't so bad - it means 4@S might be making|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he is not doubled:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd leans his chen on his left hand and thinks further|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: or rather his chin :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brogeland led right suit -- just [in this case]  wrong card|pg||
nt|jtr: And declarer may not read the @d situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes cards on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D3 was ostensibly 4th best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in his hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and......back on the table|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He probably know Boye has the @H king after some thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i should go get a coffee|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play multilandy and he doesnt have enough for a 3@d bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|liujing: I remember in 2008 I played against these French guys in U28 play-off|pg||
pc|h2|nt|passell: ducking trick 1 might have left him better placed|pg||
nt|warrens:  no good exit for Rodwell|pg||
nt|tlc: whanyone know M-W agreement as to what the lead of the J asks for?|pg||
nt|tlc: anyone|pg||
nt|passell: low club no good he would win 6|pg||
nt|warrens:  a low club should do it|pg||
nt|passell: rusinow  asks attitude|pg||
nt|kareno: No idea of the jack lead.|pg||
nt|passell: yes low club|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he would get 2 @s, 3 1H's, 2@D's and 2@C's, but he has to decide whether to finesse in diamonds or spades|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  3 @h's|pg||
nt|tlc: he could,,but he may believe the D hook on|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he could maybe exit another @c and see what happens|pg||
nt|passell: dicking the opening lead woulda made this easier|pg||
nt|passell: ducking  sorry bad computer skills|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Mike|pg||
nt|norby: pietro forquet, is kibbitzer in this table..........ciao pietro|pg||
nt|jallerton: another gain for 1NT opening on Flannery shape|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
pc|h9|nt|toral5: but did he play @C q?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: Now two rounds of hearts after club ace inflicts some damage.  But must play a diamond after that.|pg||
nt|toral5: this is 800 now|pg||
nt|toral5: same position wt v discussed on an initial trump lead by duboin|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes, Greco played a small spade and trumped it and then lead the @C queen!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: This should have speeded things up.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difference of satyle again. Greco opened 1NT|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: @h 2-2 and king in E...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: So instead of down one, it'll be two .|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: extra trick|pg||
nt|algraves: he was 500 down at 5 level and a spare J or two away from beating 4@S a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: style even|pg||
nt|algraves: hello  senor Forquet|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzta: More thinking for Boyd|pg||
nt|sommer: -3 now - cant take all trumps|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think the way to beat 4@s is repeated heart plays be the defence.. pls correct me if I am mistaken|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Does not help to hold back the @D Q if Boye has 4 diamonds then|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay down two.  He can claim now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards are shown|pg||
nt|algraves: signor sorry|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and a nice 10 @s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|toral5: no.3 down|pg||
nt|toral5: 2 down i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: six six Greco says he could not resist :)|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: closed room is now playing board 9... |pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|nt|gulyas: repeated trump plays work, too|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh dear|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Might have the @D king of course|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see why he did that|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nunes should probably have blocked the diamonds|pg||
nt|jtr: And neither will he be able to soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye asked YOU CAN NOT HAVE 4 spades isnt it|pg||
nt|jtr: Blocking @ds doesnt help  The defence just establish a @c|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Fatal spade return|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: Are we back?|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Here we are, both of us|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not so sure|pg||
nt|tez: and Nunes believes he has 2|pg||
nt|othered1: Turbo?  But north could want to play 4N, so . . .|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: South in the tank|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he really ruff with the 5?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sommer: can take @HJ now and run @D9|pg||

nt|yvesj49: or 4@h|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not @s ??|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: Nunes may go again when he sees dummy|pg||

nt|liujing: Generally Lin and Chen's system is quite complex|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Okay, I'll make a cup for you with my nice new Keurig machine :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckwell writing furiously to each of their screen mates|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S natural but only 4+ and might be canapé; forcing one round|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT is 0-4 points or so, without 4 spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Meck went to the bathroom|pg||

nt|othered1: It does have to be forcing, doesn't it?|pg||

nt|toral5: nickell stil trailing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin taking his time to get this correct|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|yvesj49: PROBABLY FLAT BOARD|pg||
pc|s7|nt|algraves: what we have seen here is very aggressive decision making from both pairs|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 44/2....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher thinking|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: and 12 out more (6@c on the board 9)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: dream start for Israel|pg||
nt|yvesj49: han hell end lol|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Birman opened 1@d and said 2@c over 1@s : W dreamed about 7@c now !|pg||
pc|s2|nt|caitlin: a spec saying 6@S on non @C lead...no tea or coffee yet and my coffee is always decaf:)|pg||
nt|athene: if rodwell now bid 2@C east would surely emerge with a double|pg||
nt|kareno: Should make.  The defense can't get at spades before declarer can knock out the heart ace.\|pg||
nt|caitlin: in CR|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell asks about leads and is told A from AK|pg||
nt|athene: usually when you pass a strong hand over a strong club it's with the idea of coming in later, unless it looks like a real misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: one in each suit and 500|pg||
nt|jtr: They are trying|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck thinking now|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is why we balance!!|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Inspirated double by E...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|caitlin: oh well|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and Nunes made 1 nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: on the spade switch|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes we saw thanks|pg||
nt|algraves: really good bridge|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ok cool then we can|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not agrre with 1@d opening you have not rebid after 1@s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|liujing: But I don't think complex system is good for junior. They should pay more attention on play and card evaluation|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d looks like a relay, maybe asking for shortness in which case 3@H would show short in @d and 3@s in @H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: easy to overbid this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't understand much of this, but EW seem to know what they are doing|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: sorry was private*|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: if E flashes all his goods in the red suits, declarer will probably misguess @Cs|pg||
nt|bessi2: 8-9 tricks depending on the @c guess|pg||
nt|athene: east was a little bit passive here, especially at love-all, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but for all he knows south could have length in both red suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth leaves with the director for the restroom|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Due to a defensive error|pg||
nt|jtr: either 8 or 10 tricks i think|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer knew the lead was Jx he would duck the queen but of course it could be J10x(x)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: lots of @H duplication|pg||
nt|hedyg: and if he is short in @H KQ@H not much use|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no*|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kareno: Bath coup trick one.|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he continues|pg||
nt|kareno: For the specs, that is a duck hoping west continues into the tenace.|pg||
nt|kareno: The ten by east obviously denying the jack of hearts so west will shift.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson fingers different cards, but not a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: WC players rarely continue with signal from pd guiding them. Do you agree Karen?|pg||
nt|caitlin: WC-world class|pg||
nt|kareno: Ellen, what can I say?|pg||
nt|caitlin: she is having her tea:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bidding and play to the first few tricks is glacially slow, and then unbelievably fast, like an avalanche|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i open with 4144 not 1444|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i suppose it's 4 x 16 boards ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|caitlin: agree or not!!|pg||
nt|sommer: 2-3 imps pick-up are welcome for NS|pg||
nt|liujing: true, they are on the road to 5 level|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: also Meckstroth-Rodwell have been known to use the strong club as a pre-emptive weapon, opening it light and talking opps out of good contracts|pg||

pc|h8|nt|athene: still three small spades is a bad holding for east|pg||
nt|liujing: well, I wonder whether Lin has showed his singleton in @H|pg||

pc|c9|nt|gulyas: just the way I like to play it too:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. east was in a very tough spot|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a strong hand, but bad distribution to reopen|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell ys absent mindedly with his mustache while trying to decide the best line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: playing with his mustache is what I meant to say :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth returns, but only one trick was played in his absence|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Do they play the Nightmare system? 1@D contains 18-20 balanced in that system. If they don't, it's still a nightmare|pg||
nt|liujing: hmm, all effort ahead melts into air|pg||
nt|liujing: yes, I guess the idea derives from Nightmare|pg||

nt|tlc: or long trump with long heart..pretty good combo|pg||

nt|passell: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(4+/5+) @H & @S|pg||
nt|passell: 3-3 hearts|pg||

nt|norby: i think only 10 world championship:-))|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jtr: South 3@h|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh no maybe not|pg||
nt|caitlin: Eric Greco|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S makes|pg||
nt|athene: usual wisdom is to be very slow to come into the auction after one of these 3-suited bids|pg||
nt|tlc: 2@D being 11-15,with 4414,4405,3415, or 4315|pg||
nt|athene: since you know all the suits are breaking badly|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S short diamonds 11 -15|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Fred asking about 2h bid now|pg||
nt|algraves: Play bridge with the Blue Team is a great book of very special hands from their tournaments|pg||

nt|algraves: well he likes his AK @S|pg||
nt|athene: his partner will like them in 2@S, too - he won't like them as much in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: some more questions now|pg||
nt|algraves: good point|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and now he is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad said sorry and cards are on the table|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he will raise to 3@s which Fred will pass |pg||
nt|athene: if north thinks through the play, though....it won't play that well even when south has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|athene: for example if south's side suit is clubs, west has a stack over him|pg||
nt|athene: if south has diamonds, he can't go to dummy and finesse as west is ruffing diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: hamman didn't think it was worth a raise, on the same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: but admittedly zia isn't fred|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|norby: or more|pg||

nt|yvesj49: what's 2@d opening ?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d majors..weak hand|pg||
nt|othered1: minimum 3-suiter with stiff @D, I think.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty all|pg||
nt|tez: i thk..i m not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco stil thinking|pg||
nt|yvesj49: specs said me 3 suiter |pg||
nt|yvesj49: short @d|pg||
nt|othered1: includes 4=4=1=4, 4=4=0=5 and maybe some 3=4=1=5 or 4=3=1=5 hands|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ok i know what to bid when i'm 13/0/0/0|pg||
nt|yvesj49: (lol)|pg||

nt|caitlin: no suit any better|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's a reluctant pass, personally :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pietro's book finally helped me understand Trump Squeezes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|caitlin: btw Martens 88 Nickell 71|pg||
nt|algraves: There is a nice little tip first put forward by al roth about discounting the first couple of tricks you hold when partner enters after pre emption|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i'm priyng they don't finish in @s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: this will be a swing to sombody|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Short of tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: somebody|pg||
nt|jtr: Another poor board for N/S next door|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fantoni is thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|jtr: A @s lead and inspired views could make this|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Strul needs desperately some good boards to hope for a come back in the last session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the final board of the set   15|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni stil thinking|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: All heart leads will beat the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th and final 15 board session of the Quarter Final follows after a short break  [depends on when/if our room finishes :)]|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking ... do not go away|pg||
nt|jtr: Tell him it will be more intersting if he leads a @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: director must give the keys of the room to the players lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: pass ???|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 61... it's a lot...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Pass is good lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Ah A compromise|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Or diamonds|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Can win now I think. The right diamond wiew and the right choice in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye closed the screen asking some questions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: about leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: boye put the cards on the table|pg||
nt|jtr: Claiming?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no,,lol|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but an intersting ploy David      claim and let the opponents figure it out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards in his hand now|pg||
nt|othered1: east just trying to run for cover -- west could have only 3@H, I believe|pg||
nt|tez: pass is forcing i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think so|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D opening is part of precision system, it shows @D short 3 suited (4-4-1-4, 43-1-5, 4-4-0-5) hand 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: wouldnt X have been responsive, allowing him to get out in 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4sf|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he heared me lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1st time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzta: 2nt is natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell inquires further about the 1 nt bid|pg||
nt|yvesj49: But double punitive i thonk lol|pg||
nt|othered1: I don 't think you double them out in 2@H, vul, to pass them out in 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamson writing and Claudio reading|pg||
nt|yvesj49: start tomorrow what time ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Claudio asking questions...ans some more writing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they write cards for the family ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nobody reading the bulletin now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lolllll|pg||
nt|migry: why would you want to get out in 2NT with 9 opposite a 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|passell: hamman passed an defended 2 hearts a winning decision|pg||
nt|migry: sry - 8 5-4 almost 9:)|pg||
nt|tlc: he didnt overcall 1NT either..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H should be forcing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i've top speak more often|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: So Nickell have closed the gap a bit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we have music Greco says, as a piano plays in the background|pg||
nt|kareno: North happy to be able to pass!!|pg||
nt|sommer: difficult but makeable|pg||
nt|sommer: this makes it easier|pg||
nt|athene: that was really east's 2nt not north's?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yvesj49: nice weather in philadelphia but opponents are strong lol|pg||
nt|norby: fantastic writter of bridge also|pg||
nt|algraves: so an imp on the @S play|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: good inspiration !|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nicely played by thomas|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: unfortunatly, they heared me too few times...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|algraves: imps i mean|pg||
nt|norby: number one for analysis of bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during auction i was thinking   @SA and other Ace good play for slam |pg||
nt|jallerton: seems normal to play to the king though|pg||
nt|norby: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pietro_forquet|pg||
nt|jallerton: No 2nd entry to dummy and North has opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred in the tank now|pg||
nt|jallerton: East can't claim as there might be a @h ruff frm his point of view|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said I am not going down,,,or something similar|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but nevertheles, Fred is trying to beat him|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred is thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Norby -- what do you think of opponent making statement like "i'm not going down"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: I like the overcall folks.  You must get your good suits into the auction when it's safe.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa leaves to quiet the piano player|pg||
nt|kareno: I heard that Rodwell is still playing so he's innocent :)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might well finesse against the @H10 at some point and go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell puts his cards down on the table to think|pg||
nt|athene: he can lead the @HQ on the first round of the suit to delay the decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards and thinks some more|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: First challenge managed|pg||
nt|jtr: Next a low @s maybe?|pg||
nt|jtr: After @dA|pg||
nt|jkotor: Q@s ! @s|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Then the spades will be blocked|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he has to establish tricks somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think he can make this against good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i am told there will be time penalties...|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: In VPs?|pg||
nt|jtr: I hope you dont get any Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i hope not....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably we will start the next session immediately after this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lets finish this session first.. i say|pg||
pc|c2|nt|passell: yes  he went quietly|pg||
nt|jallerton: must have said "probably not going down" - otherwise he would claim without any overtrick chances|pg||
nt|yvesj49: dangerous board|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: No game's winning, I think|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3@c no more|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: unfortunatly not vulnerable|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yvesj49: very good lead|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, that is the 8th trick|pg||
nt|jtr: @d finesse not fancied|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is still thinking.... |pg||
nt|tlc: looks a trick short...he can build 9 tricks, but not before def gets 5..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very disciplined by South|pg||
nt|liujing: I have to go downstairs to meet them. China needs some LUCK in the last segment.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|liujing: see you later all.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Liu|pg||
nt|tejjyid: lots of it - fingers crossed|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems 800....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: match getting closer again|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and closed match again|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth better run for 6 tricks, now he might go 5 down|pg||
nt|ritong: he could not help:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Liu|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|pbmarstr: I think Boye will have to trust in a defensive blunder|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment counting how many tricks he has|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe playing North for Ax@c is best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and he said Incredible board|pg||
nt|jtr: Then he can be endplayed even if he wins @cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: closed the screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ours is actually one of the closest matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: and slowest!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking questions |pg||
nt|jkotor: cause all Polish lost yesterday :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes looks realy distressed now|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: N has to play @C Q, and S has to play low to beat the contract|pg||
nt|jtr: He should see us!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he was shaking his head|pg||
nt|jtr: Yep So are we|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: boye does not look to gather any momentum...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry and back to thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|rv: he thinks non-vulnerable is invulnerable:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vieuxtroll: unfortunatly for us, of course. Sorry for our friends israel's supporters ! :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: trying an intra-finesse in spades, playing east for @S10x/@S9x|pg||
nt|athene: now a club through, trying to get west off some endplay|pg||
nt|bessi2: a great technical play from Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will lead the @SJ from dummy next time he plays the suit, holding his losers to two|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd seemingly fidgets in his chair|pg||
nt|sommer: @Cshift needed to cause problems nowwww|pg||
nt|athene: squeezing every last drop out of his club spots - well when you overcall on such a threadbare suit you have to |pg||
nt|athene: sorry out of his spade spots|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd silently counts to himself|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: restart time for final set is scheduled for 30 minutes|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: this must be wrong|pg||
nt|jtr: Because i suggested it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we finish 3.5 boards ??|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: PLayed N for 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Fantoni thinking|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|kareno: Eight seems to be the limit here.|pg||

nt|tlc: a low club will now force meck to get spades on the track or watch this come home|pg||
nt|drewsky: test|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: do not test... he is till thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: \not this north.|pg||
nt|tlc: no sorry..my mistake..low club no good|pg||
nt|drewsky: What of declarer cashes 2 clubs....what does north pitch ?|pg||
nt|passell: another heart is ok too ducked|pg||
nt|kareno: Someone asking if a spade from dummy would draw the king from north.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry|pg||
nt|passell: can only cash 1|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer hasn't got two clubs to cash ??|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: now @HQ to king and ace, and @SJ, maybe|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|caitlin: this is painful to watch|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: declarer's probably is he is getting a bit forced in diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but if the defence force too much all that will do is strip west's exit cards so he will surely be endplayed in clubs |pg||
nt|sommer: endplay possible even for overtrick!|pg||
nt|bessi2: an interesting line would have been to cash the ace of spades play q of hearts.. ruff diamond and exit in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: well, you sort of don't mind fifties, but after a while they get a bit embarrassing|pg||
nt|algraves: Meck may regret not running to the hills as now he is booked for 3 down instead of 2 but that is his nature|pg||
nt|rv: now only 3 down|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: well, he did say it was a test - maybe he failed|pg||
nt|kareno: ROFL David|pg||
nt|passell: j of clubs not good on east coast|pg||
nt|drewsky: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But in Vegas it's Jake the Snake, right?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|tez: nice defence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sommer: is it over?|pg||
nt|bessi2: he can now.. play a heart to the jack ruff diamond and exit in spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no cards were played while we were offline :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahhh:)|pg||
nt|athene: if he views to drop the @H10 offside he can even unblock his @H8 and finesse the six :) as a kibitzer points out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell still has not played a card :)|pg||
nt|sommer: can you remake the score, Ala?|pg||
nt|bessi2: the 10 of hearts doesnt need to drop.. west will be endplayed in spades.. he knows he has the king|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure his nice intra-finesse play actually got him anything because if he gets forced in diamonds it doesn't matter whether he ruffs with a small spade or a boss spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i did not see meck card|pg||
nt|passell: what happens in vegas----|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: do not blame me if i get a wrong ending|pg||
nt|tlc: in CA,, a resoltion will be voted on and passed to make the club Jack good|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|tez: 4 down posible|pg||

nt|rv: many play 4m by South as conventional showing majors with longer @h/@s or some other 2 suiter hand|pg||
nt|rv: I don't think Fred could bid natural 4@d here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 5@d wins lol|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: In fact, it was better at @s trump...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|caitlin: I don't like it|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, don't give up your seats!!|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed.. I wonder how he played it|pg||
nt|yvesj49: by email|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Meckstroth may balance here, I guess|pg||
nt|jallerton: Greco did not protect as East|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South underbid slightly, becasue (presumably) worried about 3 small @D|pg||
nt|yvesj49: beaten by @h lead|pg||
mb|2H|an|alerted|nt|toral5: 4@H depends on the opening lead by greco|pg||
nt|jtr: @c wastage|pg||
nt|tlc: 4@c = pas/correct|pg||
nt|algraves: why would he want to ?|pg||
nt|dburn: not that he has much, but he doesn't need much|pg||
nt|norby: any 5-5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North didn't waht to cue @D becasue @C suit so poor |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on the flip-side   didn't Brogeland-Salensmind win one of the big pair events in this year's Summer NABC|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: quick down... this will be fast|pg||
nt|yvesj49: x again|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|kareno: Thanks to our excellent operator for a job well done.  Keeps us informed on bids, plays and knee jiggles too :)  I love how you bring the room to life for us.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of pointing and writing|pg||
nt|toral5: 12 imps at stake here only on the opening lead|pg||
nt|sommer: tough to bid 2@S now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell says he should have taken the intrafinesse in spades instead of hearts perhaps?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but good!|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S now?|pg||
nt|rv: best defense is to win @d, @SK, @SA, @s ruff followed by a @c back|pg||
nt|athene: yes, just cut west's hand out of it completely|pg||
nt|yvesj49: very hard after opening|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: hard to find|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sommer: done:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so they diagnosed the @D weakness quite well|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: so nickell has quietly sneaked into the lead...|pg||
nt|tlc: nice duck..u want brad to continue @D|pg||
nt|algraves: Fred will take his @S ruff now to get job one done which is to beat the conract|pg||
nt|athene: it's not trivial for south though - that would be wrong if it was west who had the @D3|pg||
nt|rv: I think Fred will win with @DJ and play @SK to get Moss's attitude for continuation of defense|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EW weren't listening to the auction though, or they would have lead a @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: danger now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|gulyas: I thought S may get excited:)|pg||
nt|dburn: if this came up in the World Pairs tomorrow, he would be doubled for -200 and a bottom|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: that's it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: killing lead|pg||
nt|toral5: beautiful lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow, found the diamond!! For the push.|pg||
nt|jtr: To be fair, HH have had a tremendous set|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1 spec told me we have to send director to hell !!!!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: at least 2 off|pg||
nt|yvesj49: double thomas !!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: Ace, king of @D should be of some value. Ought to cue 4 @D|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|tlc: i dont know if they know how to play the last segment with a lead....|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they know how to play from ahead?  I KNOW they know how to play from behind :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but at IMPs, he'll go down one for a push|pg||
nt|jallerton: A bottom?  Might be the most common auction!|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at matchpoints you might think twice or even three times about bidding with that|pg||
nt|yvesj49: grrrrr|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: many play this sequence as showing a better hand.. raising to 2@s immediately with that hand.. but they clearly dont play it that way|pg||
nt|norby: normal pass of card of gitelman|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: yes, but i think other room will play 3@s too after 1@s 2@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bid 1nt not 2@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 7 4333|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: first bad idea out... now a good ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: should Moss DBL 3@C?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he can beat it, true|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pbmarstr: This time off two aces of course|pg||
nt|caitlin: disagree!!|pg||
nt|rv: if Moss's discourages @s, he will try to cash @DA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: East may have a plan|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps they can drop a few IMPs these last couple bds so they're ready...|pg||
nt|jtr: Slowly formenting it|pg||
nt|hedyg: N opened 1 @d and he showed a hand that had 4+@ds|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|algraves: no he wont|pg||
nt|algraves: he does not know how many spades declarer has so he cant read encourage or discourage|pg||
nt|rv: well defended especially @DQ by Fred asking Moss not to continue @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now spade ruff and a club and imps on the board|pg||
nt|warrens:  did Fred win the Q of @D?  does that run the risk of misleading Brad?|pg||
nt|athene: isn't there a danger the @DQ will do precisely that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defensive hand -- then maybe gitelman can dbl 3@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: but must be very close|pg||
nt|yvesj49: zut|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kareno: Yes, I'm sure she has nice, expensive knees :)|pg||
nt|algraves: yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: my guess was correct and confirmed by many   EW won the 2010 LM Pairs -- a 3-day 6-session event|pg||
nt|athene: north will think another diamond is cashing|pg||
nt|athene: @DQ was just very dangerous |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: it is barely possible that Greco will play this one quickly|pg||
nt|dburn: too close - the one thing the Diamond team can't risk at this juncture is coming back with minus 730 on some "nothing" board|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I think it's too much for 1NT, but it's a question of agreement|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzta: Nunes put the cards on the table..practising some thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: He should be an expert at it by now.......|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: W: EKxx-Ex-Dxxxxx-x|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a timed event|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|besbes: ah non he ll say 1NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the second Gitelman false card that has been mis interpreted|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there was no way moss could get it right anyway - even if south wins !J first time, he doesn't know the diamond count|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes... i just wanted to say that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toral5: sadek had an easy lead at the other table cos walid dbled 3@D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|toral5: but wel done greco here for sure|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know how you find a diamond vs a spade.  But apparently it happens - I'd say it's a 50-50 lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco laughs and says he lead well|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty michel lol|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yvesj49: we can play together !|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jallerton: Well, Brad Moss showed us on the first board that he is not afraid of making abnormal actions|pg||
nt|norby: 3 club double is better|pg||
nt|norby: after 2nt double......|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|algraves: well they are having a good game|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but never with marc lol|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|athene: are these 14-board segments?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth was glad his pd had a minimum :)|pg||
nt|sommer: guess so, yes|pg||
nt|dburn: too quickly for Fantoni, at any rate|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah Something made!|pg||
nt|daman: yes   he falsecarded on Board 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: i'm told 15|pg||
nt|sommer: 56 in total|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, they play 4x14 bfs|pg||
nt|gulyas: bds, sry|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or 15 (60)|pg||
nt|athene: why not 16? 16 is a nice number - it's a power of two!|pg||
nt|athene: 14 and 15 - well, they aren't a power of anything|pg||
nt|sommer: 15 it is ..60|pg||
nt|gulyas: it has something to do with WBF policy, how many bds a player can be forced to play on a given day|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all sessions before this were 14 boards in the Rosenblum, but yesterday they played 15 boards in the McConnel|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last 2 boards -- i'm a bit amazed that director hasn't been in the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is in the room|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he has retired?|pg||
nt|algraves: well he knows that declarer has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to our excellent operator in Philadelphia ,Traian , great job!; great job!to my talented fellow commentators Roland Wald,Liu Jing, Andrew Webb and Simon Cope for ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: donating their time to guide us through this match|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they stopped at 3 level|pg||
nt|yvesj49: israelian guys are diabolic lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: very good team|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Last hand of the set.|pg||
nt|toral5: karen u mind listening to a silly theory?|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 @C and @H A|pg||
nt|rv: Fred might have thought he might have cashed @DA if he had only @DAQ since partner has denied @DJ|pg||
nt|tlc: wouldnt fred have led back a low spade if he's wanted @D continuation?|pg||
nt|phil: (hi all) - I think the @dQ was an intelligent card - the J should say "I'm not looking for a spade ruff, just a cash out"|pg||
nt|caitlin: CR didn't find it either.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kareno: I'm told in Nickell match both tables found @d lead without a clue|pg||
nt|toral5: its actually silly,but belladonna said this in his interview:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone have the video link?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco first alerted the diamond and then waved it off after seeubg the 1 @C opening|pg||
nt|caitlin: When are we back?|pg||
nt|athene: yes but he might have cashed the @SK just in case north had a diamond void|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, this contract might have been doubled at the other table|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well to the WBF for allowing BBO to broadcast from this prestigious event, especially to Hervé Lustman who has been instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all for joining and for your helpful comments and messages.we hope you enjoyed the show. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No more video today; tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: yes, Moss is at fault in my opinion|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@s ???|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kareno: No 'we.'  I won't be back today.  Sorry :(|pg||
nt|athene: i think after the @DQ it has to be south's fault when it all goes wrong|pg||
nt|tejjyid: & Thanks to Hedy for all that typing!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: easy to miss a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well..this is what he did|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but not here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I think 56 is the magic number|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: What can he do? Disqualify both pairs?|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Yes, but if EW are winning at 5 or 6 level in minors... |pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: Thanks Roland.|pg||
nt|toral5: beladonna told in his interview to eric jannersten:whn u hold 2 EQUAL suits,add up the suits.and lead the suit with HIGHER total.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room has its own director|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h limited to about 13 points, unbalanced|pg||
nt|tlc: 2 more till the break...nice job Traian,,and thanks to the other commentators: Kare, Mike, and the Davids...and Drew if he passed the entrance exam :)|pg||
nt|tlc: that would be Karen...|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks Jim:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, Jim to you too!!|pg||
nt|algraves: when you false card and partner goes wrong it is your fault|pg||
nt|athene: when you falsecard partner, he always thinks either more or less than you expected him to - usually more|pg||
nt|phil: a parallel is winning the A from AK and leading a singleton - the King would deny the singleton|pg||
nt|athene: and it's almost always fatal|pg||
nt|dburn: but it is just possible that...|pg||
nt|hedyg: last segment in ca 30 minutes|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol ty Andrew :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, he can apportion fines maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: being the VG theater room|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with 2@c?|pg||
nt|dburn: ...Nickell will attempt 2@h in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: it all started in Beijing 2008|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stop play??   and as David says -- apportion fines|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ohhhhhhh   you're big room vugraph    so started later than other rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 15 min late|pg||
nt|jtr: It will be known who was slower if he was here all the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but to be honest i can not point my finger|pg||
nt|rv: good GS in @s in Moysian fit here|pg||
nt|algraves: it is not even close to being a parallel|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S = 3-suiter, short hearts?|pg||
nt|rv: I suppose 5n is choice of LS or GS here?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 5nt is pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|athene: south could still have a 4-card minor and just prefer 3nt, if he has good hearts, if it's a choice of games|pg||
nt|rv: only 7@D makes double dummy, but 7@S is better contract because of quality of trumps|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N not a bad bid by W.....gives nothing away|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: You need it for typing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: He was a fabulous player.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa scratches his head|pg||
nt|drewsky: well, not easy to see everything from my 1-phone....especially without reading glasses|pg||
nt|athene: but if they are in slam it will be better to play the 44 fit|pg||
nt|athene: yes i know there is no 4-4 fit on the hand, but i am saying that is why north bids 5nt |pg||
nt|algraves: I have a feeling that 3@S showed this 4-1-44 shape |pg||
nt|athene: north bids 5nt to say "we want to play slam but i am not sure which denomination"|pg||
nt|athene: south could have a 4-card minor for 3nt|pg||
nt|rv: Moss might just raise this|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|athene: south feels that he would never bid 3nt with four spades though so 6@S can't be misinterpreted|pg||
nt|ritong: and encounter 5/1 break|pg||
nt|tlc: another unlucky slam for NS if he bids 7..|pg||
nt|rv: real bad luck if they bid to excellent 7@S and go down because of 5-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Moss thinking|pg||
nt|athene: yes, they gain 13 moral imps and lose 17 real ones, or some such arithmetic|pg||
nt|ritong: not vul  14|pg||
nt|algraves: so 6 NT has 12 tricks, 7 @S has 13 with 5-2 @C and 4-2 @S|pg||
nt|algraves: as declarer can ruff a club|pg||
nt|algraves: but the 5-1 @s break dooms it|pg||
nt|algraves: so lets wait and see|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking at the moment...we have to wait|pg||
nt|xenya: 7@D is on|pg||
nt|athene: moss might take the view that finding a 4-3 fit slam is good enough in itself - no need to push for the grand|pg||
nt|rv: unlike in Gymnastics or Diving, we don't have any artistic or technical IMPs in bridge:)|pg||
nt|athene: but he has so many points he will expect any small slam to make anyway|pg||
nt|tlc: NT range here is 14-16?|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I really think french team can play a better bridge.... but we have to say israel's team is really great.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bessi2: 4@c will not excite Boyd|pg||
nt|sommer: 1NT is 15-17...|pg||
nt|sommer: agree with upgrade|pg||
nt|rv: or moral IMPs as Henry put it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bessi2: as do I|pg||
nt|sommer: E's hand is more 16 than 14|pg||
nt|athene: this won't take too long|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson was caught red handed and everyone laughs|pg||
nt|dburn: prefer double, but if I can overcall 2@c with @cAJ empty fifth, I guess I can overcall it faster with AKJ empty fifth|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: finally|pg||
nt|algraves: well Fred may have bid this way with 4333 and AQX in hearts |pg||
nt|ritong: brad also knows that fred does not like his hand|pg||
nt|tlc: brad will briefly wish he had raised...|pg||
nt|rv: Moss will be unhappy when he sees dummy, he will a lot happier once he plays second round of @s:)|pg||
nt|ritong: if he did, he would no doubt have bid 6@h|pg||
nt|algraves: but we do have 35 hcp  that is enough for 6 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred went to the bathroom with the director|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad thinking now|pg||
nt|daman: right now he probably looks like someone who spilled turpentine on their pizza|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Victor Mollo loved hands like this  where same team playing same suit/contract in both rooms|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: And silver is nice, too...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toral5: in my unpublished book,the gr8est.|pg||
nt|kareno: Call me anything but late to dinner (per my late father).|pg||
nt|passell: was your father Henny youngman?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he played the 7 not the 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably i need glasses ,  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Birman thinking now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|norby: double is better, play hearts diamonds and 2 cards spades|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: Aww well thank you Karen....you always make commentating enjoyable and insightful! You still in Philly?|pg||
nt|toral5: he,benito and forquet..:)true legends of the game|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c can be made with the Morton's Fork coup.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's very, very unlikely to be bid, however.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i like to comment this sort of boards lol|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope.  Wouldn't have minded Henny for a father though.|pg||
nt|athene: when he finds the trump break he will look like someone who spilled turpentine on his pizza but then he found out it was his opponent's pizza|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher thinking|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: He'll play @h, I think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves: in closed room Hamman doubled  zia bid 2@H and went down 2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate to lead a low @S from this holding, but the auction suggests it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: Oh dear, this might go down now|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: too eager to meet|pg||
nt|jtr: A @s lead next door gave a trick effectively|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell do play some DBL show 2-support   but i never remember when they apply|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzta: maybe not so unlikely lol|pg||
nt|kareno: Morton's Fork would be leading low to dummy's heart in this case.  If east ducks, heart goes away.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not that it makes a big diffrence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Oh, can't be made because east can ruff second diamond - sorry, I tricked myself.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|kareno: I love Morton's Fork coup so much I named my trading company after it years ago.|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: is there a technical term for sticking a Morton's Fork into partner on opening lead?|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyway, let's watch Duboin try to make six clubs.  Heart loser going away now.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can East be squeezed in the majors? Barnet Shenkin suggests that he can|pg||
nt|jallerton: dbl by E would seem reasonable in any case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world you have four hearts for your double; the world is not ideal so you've got to bid the hand you are dealt|pg||
nt|dburn: "what happened on 14?" "2@h down two". "same here - must be a push." "er... no, not exactly"|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: The 6 imps at board 5 are a few unlucky for france, but not the others points : Israel played better on these 14 boards... |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kareno: But, Milton Berle style, he stole many good lines :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: but will Greco get the ruff?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: the other room is playing the last board of the segment     we have 2 after this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final 16 board set follows after a break|pg||
nt|algraves: so it will be 22 or so with 18 to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table....meck is thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: more than an imp a board at this point|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: If only east had a doubleton diamond, Morton would work :)|pg||
nt|toral5: east will be under severe presure to guard Majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin shakes his head no and then sits back in his chair|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: only hope for defence : opening at 11 HCP in E. Wd North...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sure - just from watching, some of it seems unneccesary - but he may also be just slow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, priv|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but 37-0   |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will be back in aprox 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: with the last set|pg||
nt|rv: we play 16 boards in every segment in finals, so this and 1 more|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry Fred and claimed 12.... why sorry.... i misspalyed it .... and laughed|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly, yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so only 4 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H 1-round-force|pg||
nt|jtr: A chance at last for Strul|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 26 minutes to play one board, and to drink a coffee no time for shower lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in france it's 18:34|pg||
nt|jtr: Thinnish values for game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: for fantunes|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, private|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: usually 14+ HCP, but maybe 12/13 with 5@H & 4@S   [as we see here]|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: At last a chance to get some IMPs for Strul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N= 5+ HCP, 3+@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now East in the tank..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director said you should be finished by now|pg||
nt|tez: in turkey 19:37 :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the structure from here -- probably 3@H saying reject game try    [without interference]|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bet theses guys will bid slam|pg||
nt|dburn: better let them use Blackwood|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: To be fair on the players time wise, all these part scores do take up a lot of time|pg||
nt|dburn: then, they won't bid a slam - if you make them guess, they might|pg||
nt|yvesj49: key cards BW is boring here|pg||
nt|jtr: But i guess it will be bid|pg||
nt|passell: this is the match of the year  cant wait for the last segment|pg||
nt|athene: zia didn't try for a diamond ruff here - just drew trumps and knocked out the heart|pg||
nt|rv: 4 segments of 16 boards will decide this match |pg||
nt|athene: and ended up dropping the @DQ|pg||
nt|algraves: 6@S a very good contract|pg||
nt|athene: although it looks against the odds|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West likely to play 4@h or 3NT - North-South may not get involved at all, and certainly won't bid much at the score|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: very lucky 10 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 1nt because he doesn't think he is good enough for 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand gestures on the alerts|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very heavy 3@S there|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S, declarer won't want to draw all the trumps because he wants a heart ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: ..exept with @Slead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth and Rodwell still discussing the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told EW play "strong weak-2@S opener" so 1@S - 1nt; 2@S is a good hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the last hand of this set|pg||
nt|jtr: Few 'routine' contracts|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe 2 Aces out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thwy will be pushed there probably|pg||
nt|passell: 1100 here if dbl|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Hmapson is helping them|pg||
nt|tlc: me neither..really exciting!|pg||
nt|rv: 3@S must be showing semi-solid/solid suit|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Will they stop at 4@d ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 1@S - 1nt; 3@S is a very good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Philadelphia Vugraph Archives at  http://www.bridgefederation.ch/2010/wtc/index.html  courtesy of Yvan Calame|pg||
nt|dburn: they use Turbo, but the effect is the same - they will discover that there are two key cards missing if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|rv: Moss will bid 4@d here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: May be loose 500 at 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Fred hasn't had so much luck this set with "solid" spade suits|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least Meckstroth now has bragging rights over Zia - "you went down two in 2@h, I went down only one"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really was a question of Fred scoring 2 trump or each scoring 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 32 IMPs in 14 boards, not impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: South bid game in a flash and West smiled|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kareno: I imagine they will restart as soon as they can compare.  This is the third of four sets.|pg||
nt|algraves: east needs a third trump trick one way or another, either through the forcing game of a ruffing game|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia ducked but doesn't it seem  @HA  @D  @CA @D @D better start ??|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: Gitelman will pass here which should be forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Fred's 3@s shows solid suit and doesn't promise extras though as per knowledgable specs|pg||
nt|peachy: 2-way checkback, most likely, this one GF|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: in that case, this is almost forcing|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Michael|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Grosset-Lorenzini don't play weak 2 ? Good new for us and 7 points back...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Bessis in the tank|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asks about the 9 @C lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the end|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i lost|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the match now|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@H last train slam try?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: all my money|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i go to the bank for the 2nd round|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching back shortly|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it was a great show|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set...sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: great to watch|pg||
nt|passell: finally a good hand for Bobby Wolff he refuses to play key card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with both black suits 41 probably nothing works|pg||
nt|passell: yes for sure  but it doesnt work either|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: Similar auction|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nobody doubled. Still a chance|pg||
nt|jtr: Standard Norwegian i am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes ... a chance to improve the 0|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A decent slam in norwegian. Needs S to lead diamond ace. But thereafter good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes did not lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so screen stil down|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe Traian could ask them just to play on?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i need a break... forget about them|pg||
nt|jtr: I bet|pg||
nt|passell: same auction at the other table except hamman bid 3nt instead of passing 2spades|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jtr: I am told a standard Norwegian slam is where the opponents cash 2 aces then wait for their trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|jtr: I cannot myself comment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: fast play i guess|pg||
nt|tez: enjoyed a lot:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they did not bother playing it lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: back very shortly! ty Traian,our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|daman: tilt|pg||
nt|rv: maybe 5@h by Moss here with @CA and @h values|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: he has 3 trumps, an A, and a possible ruff, not a bad hand|pg||
nt|tlc: so,, more IMPs to nickell,, they took the low road here and landed in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@D is a cue for spades, moss feels he hasn't really got any extras|pg||
nt|jallerton: West retains trump control|pg||
nt|me argent: they might well get to slam|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, they need to take care not to over-reach - slam certainly possible from East's point of view facing the right cards|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: It would be strange to bid 4@s now...|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: An Irish slam for those that ask, is where the opponents take their 2 trump tricks and then wait for their Ace(s)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|sommer: now..a @C?|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the first trick might have been wise if the lead was a doubleton|pg||
nt|peachy: 3H certainly stronger than 4H would have been, in sys|pg||
nt|dburn: take away @sJ and give West @dK instead - same point count, cold slam|pg||
nt|me argent: off to the races|pg||
nt|me argent: south has no easy lead|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe West can make 6NT - or East can make 6@h without a spade lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|bessi2: oh no.. this is still making since he played a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: odwell leads high from a singleton :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: <meckstroth agrees <<<|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to set up a club trick using the trumps and @DA as entry|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: If he had over 4@c, South will have certainly said 5@d, but it's reasonnable to pass with his hand... unfortunatly|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pbmarstr: No the slam has excellent chances. All you have to do is lead Q of @D from hand and S to take the Ace|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine this was an invitational sequence.  |pg||
nt|me argent: only @S lead beats 6@Hs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bessi2: he is on his way down it seems|pg||
nt|athene: he surely didn't duck this queen|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, this was not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson goes hmm on the drop of the spade queen|pg||
nt|athene: he led to the @DA and played a heart up|pg||
nt|sommer: @C3 would work!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bessi2: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now the dble came|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, East will get a spade lead, so better let West play it|pg||
nt|me argent: X at last|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and the lead does not need a guess anymore|pg||
nt|me argent: 6nt by west|pg||
nt|peachy: spade lead to 6NT by West actually gives 12th trick|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, even on a spade lead against 6@h, South might be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Mike Graham said in Poland v England, both West bid 2@s in W (@h @d)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sommer: wow..the @C3:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|jtr: East hand looks pretty good to decline it|pg||
nt|algraves: so the Meckwell interference took away the comfort level to have a more secure auction|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: he can claim now:)|pg||
nt|athene: he is planning to draw trumps ending in dummy and just lead the @C7|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson talking to Meckstroth and chuckling|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he gets lucky even with @Cs 5-1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson shows his hand|pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth could have returned a small club after winning the queen, but it wouldn't have helped|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@c perhaps designed to ask West whether he wants to play 6NT to protect his spades|pg||
nt|peachy: Chiu apparently thinking of converting to 6NT, would be better but he cant know it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: took the pass card out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and put it back :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|athene: decalrer could just ruff high, draw trumps, and set up the club|pg||
nt|athene: dummy's club spots and @S8 are nice cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the players have left and bye for now >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>:)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|sommer: guess this was the last...tnx all:)..tnx kibz for your remarcs|pg||
nt|gulyas: tx all - sry abt the score, but the connection was lost, and running scores are down, too|pg||
nt|gulyas: Nickell was up by abt 25 the last time we knew|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but we can say Nickel leads "a bit"|pg||
nt|sommer: 25-6 it was|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was 31-6 at some point|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear that Zia went down in the same 4@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the lead is more now|pg||
nt|gulyas: making a wild guess: Nickell up by at least 35|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, more news: Zia made the 4@S, but the score maybe 39-6|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: I'm not very quiet for this board in closed room...|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzta: woow...|pg||
nt|algraves: and earned 13 imps|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is sqz to develop, the run of 7 hearts is going to put NS in trouble|pg||
nt|me argent: there might be a squeeze here but unfortunately i dont do sqeezes::(|pg||
nt|dburn: well, let's hope Chiu does|pg||
nt|dburn: because there is one|pg||
nt|peachy: I do them blindly, if they work, it is beyond my control LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east in  the tank|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: And then 4@h -1 in EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: unbelivable....the fire alarm of the building was activated|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last board of the set    4th and final 16-boards for the championship scheduled to start in about 30 min|pg||
nt|dburn: attempted by both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Nickell in front for a change|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you can set up the hearts when east wins his ace on the first round|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: this, though, could not really be called a slam|pg||
nt|athene: but what if he unsportingly ducks the first heart and returns a diamond to take the entry out|pg||
nt|algraves: 30 points and 9 @D|pg||
nt|algraves: you can see how they got too high|pg||
nt|rv: NS might have dodged slam bullet after North's pass and Meckstorth opening:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D suction??    @H or @S & @C      or just a transfer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Or Multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: others suggesting might be multi|pg||
nt|passell: this may save rodwell|pg||
nt|peachy: Or give an adrenalin rush to hinder thinking|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: wow, Greco passed that hand in third seat!|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy for South to put his diamonds in the picture|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 5@H is a good save for N-S here but with some defense in each hand and no shortness, E-W will probably buy it for 4@S.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = nF by 90% of Polish|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like west found a gr8 @D lead to beat 3@S in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and some more thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: as u see 4 card opening in major by the norwegian pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the cards now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still no sign of making a bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just trying for a swing board, knowing Meckstroth will be right there with 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that a crime? He does not have an opener :)|pg||
nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. 1-suit   @H or @S|pg||
nt|dburn: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impossible for Rodwell to know that it's best to defend|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|algraves: no nobody trying to cause swings in this match|pg||
nt|athene: well, passing looks a bit of a girlie action to me|pg||
nt|ritong: crime was perpetrated otherr room|pg||
nt|algraves: well that is why we are here and they are there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred put the cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thinking|pg||
nt|rv: Fred could bid 3@s here to setup GF since 3m might be non-forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: they got to 6@d after getting doubled in @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: something is wrong in paradise|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if Moss's 2@s is Inv+ or promises another bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  on the last board, if East holds up on the first @H, declarer has to guess the position to make, which Zia did|pg||
nt|norby: meck pass...lololol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck's PASS = 0-4 HCP|pg||
nt|norby: all the people want play in diamond this hand|pg||
nt|norby: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|norby: no majors pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|norby: diamond yesssssssssssss|pg||
nt|chessmaste: E/W might be in big trouble now|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: difficult for north to resist with tht hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bids are not input until the tray with the board is passed under the screen.  That way the players cannot tell the tempo of the bids from my clicking :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: correction: only 4 card in @h and 5 in @s|pg||
nt|blum1956: Other room West  opened 1@c and that was it - finally East played 5@s after the NS's 4@d-5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes - no-one can see quite why he took that view|pg||
nt|athene: east might just take 3@D as natural given the vulnerability|pg||
nt|norby: pass rodwell pleaseeeeee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is funny|pg||
nt|robinswr: you play it partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: north writes a question|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: Thanks all and good night for European people... it's tomorrow now, here :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dburn: not sure what Meckstroth is to make of all this - 2@d showed one major, so how can West want to show both?|pg||
nt|norby: now gitelman bid 4 spades:-) lol|pg||
nt|jallerton: Meckstroth was not sure what to make of this either.|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 55 in the majors you might want to show both, because you expect partner to have lots in the one north doesn't have|pg||
nt|dburn: could be, I guess, but everyone except Moss must be sorely puzzled by the whole business|pg||
nt|jallerton: hope rather than "expect", Bill.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he had a count at that point so isn't it 5:2 that the @DQ is with east?|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes. and apparently he dropped it|pg||
nt|rv: with 55 in reds, I much prefer 3@h or 4@h with Moss hand instead of nebulous 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west just was obviously in trouble on the discards and zia backed his table feel|pg||
nt|rv: Fred is definitely confused here trying to figure out what Moss has|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred back in the tank now|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he will eventually pass since he is not sure if 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is stil thinking|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 3@S is interesting|pg||
nt|robinswr: he couldn't beat 4hearts|pg||
nt|athene: moss is puzzled too but in a happy way|pg||
nt|norby: last hand for i meckweel is dangerous, before 7 diamond now ...........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about Fred now. Does he think partner has spades?|pg||
nt|robinswr: double pass or correct|pg||
nt|me argent: only @C lead beats 4@Ss|pg||
nt|peachy: 3D shows spades, prob max w spades?|pg||
nt|me argent: or @S lead and @C shift|pg||
nt|dburn: Multi may work better than weak two here, putting West on lead|pg||
nt|me argent: GB says its cold|pg||
nt|peachy: 3D min w spades|pg||
nt|blum1956: What is the reason for North to write any questions&|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Mildred Breed|pg||
nt|blum1956: ?|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi everyone |pg||
nt|blum1956: hi Mildred|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I cannot see what was written, but I assume it was a question on the alerts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching..|pg||
mb|4S|nt|passell: he knows rodwell is 5-5 in majors|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of situation is why the english bridge authorities don't like you passing a multi-2@D opener|pg||
nt|jallerton: and South will have been told that by West |pg||
nt|me argent: shows what i know|pg||
nt|dburn: but this West doesn't seem the sort you want on lead - that's a good shot|pg||
nt|me argent: in practice @C lead does the job|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fisher in the tank|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: besides, it makes:)|pg||
nt|athene: most would play that as showing a top honour, for the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bingo|pg||
nt|dburn: usually "don't lead a spade"|pg||
nt|athene: yes it means that if he has bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i heard meckwell had trouble with final board of last set too|pg||
nt|dburn: he has enough entries to establish a long heart and keep control|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe the fifth heart provides a parking place for one club, then just lose a spadediamond and club|pg||
nt|dburn: but there are other ways to play, of course|pg||
nt|ewj: well he might want to know what 2@D was to work out what his partner's double was?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if only 5@c West will have a 4-card major|pg||
nt|algraves: I think they play double dont lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought anti-lead doubles only applied from a player who has actually bid the suit though|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's double of 3@s says don't lead @s, normally he should have a good alternate lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will go to the break with a realy close match|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he pscyhed double thinking opps could have a slam after 3rd seat Meckstorth opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Martens did the right thing|pg||
nt|jkotor: yup, with 4@d-5@c -> 1@d, unless they play different than others|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are starting with board 16 and playing 14 boards this session|pg||
nt|toral5: 4 losers in this game.so we begin with a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Robin Barker|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and David Edwin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|norby: pass of gitelman is strange, sure 6 cards in heart of partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was just 1 trick|pg||
nt|dburn: this might even be a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2|pg||
nt|dburn: one of the stranger ones, to be sure|pg||
nt|passell: great pass by fred  it created this monster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is just what Israel needs|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes probably|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: 2@c is better, but Bessis thought he was stronger for pass. And, sometimes, W has only 3 cards in @c|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: good evening Roland  and everone|pg||
nt|norby: not possible 6 spades because rodwell explain at gitelman 5-5- majors....so...|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess if South continues clubs, it might be down five|pg||
pc|d5|nt|norby: but now is normal the double|pg||
nt|passell: maybe a spectacular push|pg||
nt|jkotor: pass is throwing points away...|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess there were no red cards in the NS bidding boxes|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|toral5: zimmerman must have found the @D lead to beat 3@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: East will be delighted to see @DAQ opposite his side king to six|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, they are playing in the final, we are not. There must be a reason for it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|blum1956: Polish club opens 1@c with 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes, Poland did well to get them to the 5 level CR|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: trump switch looked best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fairness -- in many situations Rodwell 3@D would be Michaels for @H & @S|pg||
nt|jallerton: from Fred's point of view, double might persuade them to run to the suit breaking more evenly|pg||
nt|blum1956: Natural methods allowed to bluff out opponent's suit on this board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|toral5: in the other room|pg||
nt|jkotor: which one, and what would be the result? :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: The reason you are not in the final. Roland, is that you did not enter the event!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR 3@S played in S and killing defense: @d( to K - and duck!|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: killing @D lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably wandering how not to loose a trump|pg||
nt|peachy: second trumps seemed unnecessary|pg||
nt|dburn: now, he no longer has enough entries to establish a heart and keep control|pg||
nt|me argent: like i said @C lead did the job|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rmb1: How strong was 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: too late now|pg||
nt|ady: but still down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|ady: might have tone down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: glasses as well on the table|pg||
nt|ady: in fact  as pointed out   still in time   trump now   and overruff table and 2nd trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman stil thinking|pg||
pc|s9|nt|toral5: in 1 way helness wd be hapy to see @H 9/10 at trick 1.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: One of the reasons, indeed|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i lost play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are playing very fast|pg||
nt|besbes: no they play semi forcinng NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i will claim at the end|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: thanks Traian... but I'll remember Ace of heart ! :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|vieuxtroll: thanks all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is claiming now|pg||
mc|12|nt|swanson: With all suits breaking well declarer will have no problem.  |pg||
nt|ady: very reluctant to play a trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphztb: last board and the fire alarm is being investigated, but the blinding light is still flashing|pg||
nt|yuval10: so this is the last board of the day|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|yuval10: last session tomorrow at 10:00 local time, 16:00 Israel time|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|besbes: 1@s?????|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphztb: the blinding light is right in Tarnovski's eyes and is very distracting|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: that is the apparent source of Tarnovski's anger|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: hotel security says there is no emergency, but the flashing light keeps going off and on and off and on and off . . . |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: all the players are greatly upset as the hotel security just keeps saying there is no emergency|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is this so-called non emergency?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|s6|nt|fokal: and a squeeze for 13 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yuval10: will surely make 13 here on a show-up|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this happened before, a false alarm|pg||
nt|fokal: too slow my friend :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|nt|vugraphztb: m pologies, I have lost the play while Grosset was running the diamonds|pg||
nt|fokal: not anymore if he really played the @h Q |pg||
nt|yuval10: he just played small @h to the Ace and run @d's and last @s|pg||
mc|13|nt|yuval10: so, the score you see here is disputed, but either way Israel will have a comfortable lead heading tomorrow's last 16 boards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks everybody|pg||
nt|yuval10: goodnight all, and thanks|pg||
nt|yuval10: see you tomorrow for the last session of this event|pg||
