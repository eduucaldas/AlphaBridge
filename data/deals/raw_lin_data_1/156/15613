nt|vugraphzsw: HELLO|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|athene: obviously some cunning bidding going on here - NS must play a canap√© system|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: assuming south has shown 5 spades and 4 diamonds, the heart lead looks normal|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: assuming the clubs run declarer has ten on top so he wants to make 11 if he can|pg||
nt|athene: so ducks a diamond hoping he will be given time to set up a second trick there|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: but prompt spade shift puts a stop to that|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: notice how he wins the first trick in dummy even at the cost of slightly tangling his tricks up|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: trying to conceal his strength in the hope the defence carry on the heart attack|pg||
nt|athene: if all else is equal it's usually best to win with dummy's honour rather than your own - it tells the defence less|pg||
nt|athene: australian pair here - michael courtney and stephen burgess well-known rubber bridge players|pg||
nt|athene: both can find some great declarer plays from time to time|pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SK75HT2DQJ932CK75,STH9873DK765C8632,S8432HQJ6DT8CAJT4,SAQJ96HAK54DA4CQ9|sv|e|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|an|ALERTED|mb|p|nt|athene: but i guess west just takes a view - it's MP after all so if you miss 7@D or something, that's only one board|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: and hence usually considered to be forcing of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i was just about to say, strong club :)|pg||
nt|athene: i just checked the EW convention card|pg||
nt|athene: indeed they play a variant of polish club|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@C is natural or weak notrump or any very strong hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|athene: ahhh ok he didn't take THAT big a view|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|athene: 1@H is supposed to be 7+ hcp, fairly normal polish club style|pg||
nt|athene: and 2@S of course shows the big hand and is forcing to game|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: ok, maybe 1@H is in fact 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: system is slow,,,sorry|pg||
nt|reisig: What is this man saying?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: it won't let me redeal|pg||
nt|athene: ok, assuming west did in fact give the correct response of 1@D, then i think 2@S was "semi-forcing" according to their cc i.e. showing a big hand but west can pass with nothing|pg||
nt|reisig: If my partner passes a forcing bid ...they better run faster than me|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SA82HT97DJT65CT74,SK53HAK5DK98CK965,S76H8643DQ742CAQ8,SQJT94HQJ2DA3CJ32|sv|b|nt|athene: yes, passing forcing bids isn't usually a good idea - as the saying goes, even if it's right, it's wrong -  in other words even if it works on that board, the loss of partnership ...|pg||
nt|athene: confidence does you more harm in the long run|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|athene: ok i assume this went 1nt from west, transfer then 3nt choice of games from east|pg||
nt|athene: and west decides that with 4333 he will play 3nt even with the 8-card spade fit|pg||
nt|athene: all very reasonable|pg||
nt|athene: now he can see nine tricks, but he has to think about what will happen at those tables where 4@S is selected|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: probably those declarers are going to be making 620, just losing two clubs, most of the time|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: so 600 won't be a good board|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|athene: if you are sure everyone else will make 620 then it's a typical MP decision that you have to try for 630 somehow, even if it risks going down|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|athene: becayse 600 will be just as bad as -100|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think the situation is quite that clearcut here|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: there will be lots taking the same decision as west|pg||
nt|athene: in the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: so he just settles for his 600 and expects a 35-40% board or so|pg||
nt|athene: one thing worth a mention - it's a common misconception that matchpoints scoring means you always go for 3nt|pg||
nt|reisig: This game is over my head....I better start drinking|pg||
nt|athene: but in fact, often, 4 of a major can be higher-scoring (620 not 600) but risky in that it might go down|pg||
nt|athene: so 4major is the pairs contract and 3nt is the imps contract|pg||
nt|athene: of course diagnosing the exact position isn't exactly trivial|pg||
nt|tlc: that doesnt help, rich...it just looks blurrier|pg||
nt|reisig: Now you tell me, Jim?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told we have a live streaming video of the table|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: another tactical decision here much like the one i mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|athene: many players would automatically run that heart lead to their hand to take advantage of the free finesse|pg||
nt|athene: but that sort of tells everyone what is going on AND leaves you in the wrong hand to start clubs|pg||
nt|athene: if you rise king and finesse the club and it loses, south might well continue hearts, playing his partner for the jack|pg||
nt|athene: what you don't want is for south to play a spade and north to put a diamond through you|pg||
nt|athene: and showing the world that you have eleven heart stops is going to make that more likely|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||

pc|c5|pc|h4|pc|c8|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer knows that NS can surely make 2@S, so he is fairly happy with any normal amount of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: even if it's hard for NS to get into the bidding you will expect at least some pairs to manage it|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is now wondering whether to cash his @HA or exit and hope for an overtrick, i guess|pg||
nt|tlc: EW might mange to get to 3@c, which might make if north competes in spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that might be what he is thinking about|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks people are +110 in 3@C, then the difference between +90 and +120 in 1nt becomes huge|pg||
nt|athene: but the chances of an endplay working are pretty low|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: i think it looks best just to take the 90|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sT|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hJ|pc|sA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: well, no difference|pg||

qx|o6|st||md|4S52HJ532DA98532CK,SK986HQT7DJ6CAT74,SQT7H986DT7CQJ862,SAJ43HAK4DKQ4C953|sv|e|mb|1C|an|akerted|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east doesn't look for a 4-4 spade fit...perhaps the 4333 influence again|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: but playing 3n with a 4-4 fit in a major is a dicey proposition at pairs  - you rarely make as many tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|tlc: plus the KQx of diamonds...this eliminates any unfortunate @D ruffs as well..I|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like one board where it should work out, though|pg||
nt|athene: ten tricks in spades or notrumps |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|athene: it's just barely possible that some declarers in 4@S might manage to sneak an overtrick through|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tlc: this will be a good bd for EW, since after a stayman sequence, most will be in spades|pg||
nt|athene: eliminate the hearts first sorry|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: draw trumps, knock out the @DA and duck a club to south's bare king so he has to give a ruff and discard|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told stephen burgess just went down in 4@S getting his @DK ruffed|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: i would certainly expect 630 to be about 80% on this board|pg||
pg||

nt|tlc: this figues to be played either in 2NT or 3@s (going down 1) most of the time|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|athene: well 2nt would make|pg||
nt|tlc: hard to know what's right w/ the south hand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but south can't imagine that his hand is a better dummy in notrumps than spades|pg||
nt|athene: it looks worth about 2 or 3 tricks more in spades so you transfer i guess|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Live Streaming on this table at : http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  Credit to Mila Antonova :)|pg||
nt|tlc: certainly a normal contract...unlucky there are 8 tricks on the side|pg||

nt|athene: but only with a little help from his friends|pg||
nt|athene: -100 should be pretty reasonable as there will be a lot of 3@S-2 on that board|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Jim Griffin|pg||
nt|tlc: hi everyone..thx roland|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: might be hard to avoid 6@S here, but no play for it if the defence get their @CA right away|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how bad it is to have matching singletons|pg||
nt|tlc: moss will really like his hand after 1@S...it will be hard to figure out the duplication and avoid the bad slam|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: is 4@D a zia splinter?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: i.e. showing a singleton diamond but in fact bid on a doubleton|pg||
nt|tlc: a club splinter will certainly discourage north...|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: ah ok, 4@D is showing a singleton club - boring but honest|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tlc: but undeterred, brad goes on|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: ok, 12 tricks now - the club goes on a diamond|pg||
nt|tlc: with this lead it is cold, so what's the problem?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: trump leads against small slams are almost always bad|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|athene: and at MP especially, because you might need to get your ace at trick 1 or lose it forever|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|Walddk3: sometimes also against a grand slam as we saw yesterday|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|sQ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: yes :) although he was probably getting the trumps right in 7@H anyway|pg||
mc|12|nt|tlc: as we see, the advantage of having bid 4@D here is that west couldnt X it|pg||
nt|tlc: EW must feel like theyve just had their pockets picked|pg||
nt|athene: well, it will often be more advantageous for a defender to ask for a lead in dummy's fragment suit|pg||
nt|tlc: and  there are a fair number of players that play a X of a splinter asks for a lead in adiffernt suit (for example, the LOWER of the unbid suits)|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|tlc: the rational being that doubling a stiff or void isnt usually as valuable|pg||
nt|tlc: the exception is that when at favorable vulnerabilty, X suggests a save in the short suit|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|an|ALERTED|mb|p|nt|athene: east could definitely consider doubling 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Andrew Robson is one of the tallest top players in the game .... and one of the slowest :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can't just sit there, at MP - you have to fight a bit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tlc: EW can likely make 3@s, but the 3@d bid will make it very hard to come back in|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|tlc: unless east had made a hyper-aggressive T/O dbl over 2@d, they were out|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|dburn: well, there are some who play that it shows a rather better hand than East has|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: yes, since it's not a fit auction at that point, and it's not that limited either|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d2|nt|athene: so of course there is some risk|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|athene: but there is risk in passing throughout as well|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|h7|nt|dburn: well, he stopped them - in the sense that he stopped partner from being able to over-ruff dummy twice in spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, when you have length in declarer's side suit there is always the possibility that trump leads are unnecessary as partner is overruffing anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He also knows that partner has 2 spades and may be able to overruff dummy|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: but if partner actually has spade winners it's better for him to draw two trumps for one|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i think 3@H is normal because it might well be improving the contract as well - 2-3 majors for west is not at all unlikely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: but i guess there will be some 2@S contracts yes|pg||
nt|tlc: i think it is normal too|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We had one team in the Rosenblum Cup with players from 5 different nations|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 6 if you give Shenkin Scotland as well as USA|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that may be a record, but it can be beaten|pg||
nt|tlc: looking at both hands you'd think everyone would be in 4@s, but it's possible after xfr, then 3N, that east takes a view that NT is better and passes|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that might happen sometimes|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dburn: the cool school nowadays plays that 3@s shows three spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: there is a case for preferring the major more after 2nt - 3red; 3major - 3nt than after 1nt - 2red; 2major - 3nt, because in the former case partner might be more unbalanced|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: but yes lots of pairs now solve the whole problem by opener showing right away whether he has a 3-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: after 2nt|pg||
nt|tlc: seems like a 4@D super-accept is better than just signing off in 4@S..you have AK K in partners 2 suits..|pg||
nt|tlc: west will of course be uniterested|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 3@S to show a fit and 3NT to deny is fine, unless partner wanted to sign off in 3@S. You don't get anything for nothing|pg||
