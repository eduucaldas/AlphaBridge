pc|s3|nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: same spot in other room on a totally different auction |pg||

nt|sybarra: you probably know these players|pg||
nt|neobas: Yeah, I have played against S in the White House Juniors last March|pg||
nt|neobas: And see them practically every year in Youth competitions :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: n thinking holding his head|pg||
nt|neobas: 6@C is a rather interesting bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @D slam makes |pg||
nt|raidouille:  Yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha I see a spade ruff |pg||
nt|raidouille:  on @h lead after the double|pg||
nt|raidouille:  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx didnt notice that at first |pg||
nt|neobas: Even without the Double I doubt W would lead @SA and another after 3@S by South|pg||
nt|neobas: And Tom's comment leads me to believe Bessis does not understand 6@C either - at least it is not clear-cut|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|neobas: I am wondering what the difference between 5@C and 6@C is...|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: both side passing notes|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|fokal: asave in 6@h was cheap|pg||

nt|neobas: Finding @CQ is not his only chance to make|pg||
nt|fokal: he might play for an endplay|pg||
nt|fokal: I guess he can guess that @c are 4-2|pg||
nt|raidouille:  now yes E didn't open a weak two|pg||
nt|neobas: Yes, I think the EW distributions are known|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fokal: then he will have to guess between bufallo , cashing AK or the double finesse|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: if they make in the closed will another big score for france|pg||
nt|yuval10: wild board to begin the session, it helps France a lot|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: was a @H lead from ! W in the closed room |pg||
nt|sybarra: will test the nerves of all  |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thank you Shirley...|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt? by W?   scary at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and easier from this vantage pt |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 6@d went down - board 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wooow|pg||
nt|yuval10: a big relief|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet was on club guess will look |pg||
nt|sybarra: strange play in other room  some form of endplay I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Bessis was declarer?|pg||
nt|yuval10: Volcker|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Grosset in the tank here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: just the bid W wanted to hear|pg||
nt|sybarra: (NOT)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|fokal: he could have bid 4@h instead|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably decided he's too weak for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think they will discover the diamond fit in the end|pg||
nt|fokal: in the other room auction started 4@h p p|pg||
nt|sybarra: if W passes, it will go a quiet pass all around,  but I cannot imagine that |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Lorenzini thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s X CR|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: am told:  other room after 4@h p p E bids 4@s p p X and..... All pass !!!! W didnt consider 4N :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|nt|sybarra: here we go, finding the @D fit |pg||
nt|yuval10: they found it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: and this is going to be another hugh board for France|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i told you|pg||

pc|c6|nt|sybarra: not sure we shouldnt take the red cards away |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hop ace, that could be singleton |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Grosset thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely  that would give N 7 clubs|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh what a result from other room |pg||

mc|11|nt|yuval10: 3 boards, 33 imps and even a missed slam swing....unbelievable|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: israeli boys asked for the director|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok so why director?|pg||

nt|raidouille:  KQJxxx sorry :)|pg||
nt|fokal: KQJxxx ;)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|neobas: I am not sure if EW play a Weak 2, but surely a Weak 2M opening is available, maybe through 2@D Multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: EW can make 5@d but will eventually play 4@s |pg||
nt|neobas: 4NT with East?|pg||
nt|fokal: or let NS play 4@h|pg||
nt|neobas: Though at adverse vulnerability that is not the ideal hand|pg||
nt|fokal: he doesn't have enough|pg||
nt|fokal: he will double, pass or bid 4@s|pg||
nt|neobas: It isn't but they're juniors :)|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't think passing is a valid option, and if he has enough values for 4@S then for 4NT as well, surely|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|neobas: N has what we call "a goose on a rope"|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|neobas: Another reason for me to bid 4NT would be that you know that if partner lacks a decent fit (three card support), @S will be very unfriendly because of the 4@H bid|pg||
nt|gewd: they found the @d's in the other room, so it might a swing for France :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: e thinking|pg||
nt|neobas: Well, to be fair, after last board's disaster EW must suspect there was a swing of some sorts, making beating this slam very important|pg||
nt|fokal: they are playing 6NTin the other room after a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|neobas: But as Oliv said, even on a @S lead Bessis will get it right|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: asking questions|pg||
