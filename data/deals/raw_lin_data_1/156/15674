nt|sybarra: Roland and Geoffrey |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We may need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Crouch is pitiful on BBO and one of our regular commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 14-16 in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Kath   David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Good evening all|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|daman: I would have passed|pg||

nt|pelu: I know - but u are not italiean :9|pg||
nt|daman: I like lasagna    does that count?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S can take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Thomas |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: welcome for the 4th match of the week-end|pg||
nt|newmoon: Website Commonwealth Games:  http://www.hcl-bridge.com/jspCWB2010index.jsp|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2NT = superfit, 3 trumps, max|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lots of transfer responses on a strong club base|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|stc: 3@d probably a sort of Bergen|pg||
nt|sybarra: this likely to be a tight match,  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: retransfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyone know the results?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did they keep it up?|pg||
nt|lestergold: all strong players here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: david are there any results online?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: FEGARTY beat ROBERTS 25-5; PRYOR beat BIRD 25-5; COOPER beat SHILLITOE 23-7; DHONDY beat COPE 18-11 (Cope was penalised 1 VP for slow play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Players seem very chipper for such an early hour|pg||
nt|dslee: and 4@H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||
nt|sybarra: most of us know all the names on the screen |pg||
nt|tomi2: have just one question to the local experts from France... is Zaleski playing with a team in this competition?|pg||
nt|newmoon: simpler was just to go Texas 4@D first time|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: 1 nt or 2 @S not much further |pg||
nt|josj: 2@S seems too high already|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: zaleski doesnt play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h are 3-3 and a @s discard. @d are 3-3 and also a finess after the lead|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead can help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You got the results before you asked, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's very impressive yes :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: another double fit in the Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: West doing a lot of bidding |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again ralf :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: (or S.A. Texas 4@C)|pg||
nt|dslee: will anyone suggest that N opens 2@S with the hand :) unconventional but effective|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: but it also looks very much a normal contract|pg||
nt|stc: as you can see 4@s by S has good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the results : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Bonjour Laure, Constantin|pg||
nt|Walddk8: and Jos|pg||
nt|josj: Bonjour Laure, Roland, Constantin|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: just for remin you : 1 match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
nt|dslee: will be a simple push I guess for both the tables|pg||
nt|newmoon: perhaps later in the match, depending on swings|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: can make 6 now|pg||
nt|newmoon: this is board 1, and Asoka wants to retain morale with pd    hehe|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: predictable lead which stes up 3 heart tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Sandqvist - McIntosh are members of the England open team, and Crouch-Patterson have won the Camrose Trophy for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: both very good pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqcist originally from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|sybarra: that saved a trick |pg||
nt|tomi2: but Nunes - Fantoni play regulary in the Zimmermann team, yes? they were not available because of playing in Italy?|pg||
nt|dslee: welcome al viewers from Ghaziabad...from the northern part of India in the State of Uttar Pradesh in the vicinity of greater delhi|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: spade loser soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 after 20 boards: Teltscher +19 IMPs v Rosen, Senior +7 IMPs v Small, Crouch +8 IMPs v Hinden, Hackett P +3 IMPs v DeBotton|pg||
nt|josj: the 2nd @D loser likely to disappear but the @H ruff not...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzqj: remind|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Michelle must have been having kittens with that awful south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w could be candidates for one of the strongest mixed pairs on the planet|pg||
nt|daman: that's a pretty broad statement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: Cooper +36 v Dhondy, Cope +27 v Pryor, Roberts +19 v Bird, Fegarty +1 v Shillitoe|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: I have to say I don't agree|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: wisely |pg||
nt|dslee: me debgiri and sid welcome you to watch this & enjoy the fun under |pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Constantin Stancescu|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes easier to play the ace and finesse |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but he sin't  doing that |pg||
nt|garnetts: Must admit I cannot see much wrong with 1@H and if I had managed to bid 2@H --then 3@D wouldn't have been on my mind |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: In the balancing position here 2@H should be say a decent six card suit and a reasonable hand --what used to be called intermediate |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: the ace of clubs wont run away|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Constantin|pg||
nt|josj: hi Constantin|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks with a correct play in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: zimmermann team : Quantin-Bompis, Fantoni-Nunes and Zimm-Multon|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: yes it will |pg||
nt|dslee: for all the viewers, I have the pleasure of welcoming Manas-da(manas555) a top player from India who is watching with us|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: 10 9 of spades and the good @D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@c, 2@h, 2@s and 1@d = 9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also welcome to our operator, Nicky|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: This line is scary. It's not a good idea to shorten the long hand when you also have fit in a side suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should hold his cards up lol  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing bad will happen here, but on a different layout ....|pg||
nt|haans: tme for a clubs ruff|pg||
nt|haans: time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  has to make 4@C tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 'double dummy' @d lead would probably be only lead to put declarer undr serious pressure here|pg||
nt|ady: may only make 9 obvious tricks|pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: but should be suspicious that is exactly what to expect from a player opf King's ability|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anopther way was to play the remaining |pg||
nt|yo_yo: has he forsaken tom townsend?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i haD NOTICED EVEN THO AT THIS HOUR IM NORMALLY HAL;F ASLEEP|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry capslock|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D    3NT   likely staert|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg of course a legend and Ms.Senior one of the world's leading lady players|pg||
nt|lestergold: against the long standing partnerhsip of cooke and garvey|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from rainy central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: My second session - will try harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: so uneventful at end of the day |pg||
nt|josj: I cannot help thinking they just missed game on  1|pg||
nt|stc: I expect 4@h -1 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: strange push, same lead with same overcall in other room |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2nd match England vs India 1 on bbo|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
nt|daman: I have never heard of the legend and I subscribed to IPBM for years|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ffbridge.asso.fr/   the bracket sheet |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: fo the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|tomi2: then Fantunes can become French champions soon after missing the Italian some hours ago :) those top pros now seem to play everywhere :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Luare even better |pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: classement : Payen, Cronier Laffineur, Doussot, Zimmerman|pg||
nt|newmoon: Debgiri - other room opened 1@C in East, previous hand.   Are they weak NT?|pg||
nt|dslee: yes|pg||
nt|dslee: looks like they play precision|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Mahesh (operator)  :)|pg||
nt|dslee: i was been told that all the pairs are playing 2/1|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Hi Sid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey a great bit slightly wild talent|pg||
nt|daman: I have heard of Nevena|pg||
nt|stc: or even 4@s by EW|pg||
nt|stc: in fact 4@s is a making save !|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dslee: x from North - converted to 2@H by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg is a world class player|pg||
nt|daman: you said legend    he is not a legend|pg||
nt|daman: and I have a plethora of specs who agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a matter of opinion |pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h are in, not easy to find|pg||
nt|newmoon: cautious 1@H overcall, vul           (many would 2@H)|pg||
nt|dslee: with 5-4 in black suits, i would imagine, N to -ve x|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
nt|daman: he might be a legend in GB|pg||
nt|josj: yes, 5@D should go down by ducking @HA once|pg||
nt|josj: and defeating 5@C is even easier|pg||
nt|stc: and 5@d a phantom save !|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Le classement after 2 matches: Payen 45, Doussot 44, Cronier 42, Laffineur 40, Piganeau 33|pg||
nt|dslee: some might end up budding 2@S from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 : After 40 boards Small +39IMPs v Senior, Rosen +33IMPs v Teltscher, Crouch +5IMPs v Hinden, DeBotton +3IMPs v Hackett P|pg||
nt|dslee: bidding, apologies typo|pg||
nt|newmoon: I like "budding"   :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: fantastic pass from West    winning action|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: why not open weak 2@s? Or Multi? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  12-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: er my son has a louder voice and is a lot bigger!|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Classement = standings|pg||
nt|dslee: :)\|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: ok then very well known player :)|pg||
nt|daman: cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is originally from swedn and plays a great deal internationally especially the S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the US|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You have never heard of Nevena Senior, George?|pg||
nt|pelu: but long way from US to Canada :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2 : After 40 boards Cope +18IMPs v Pryor, Dhondy +16IMPs v Cooper, Shillitoe +11IMPs v Fagarty, Bird +6IMPs v Roberts|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone make sense of this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might find 4 @H if W bids @H now |pg||
nt|josj: but how would you play 4@H on a @S lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they play 4 card majors and had to confirm 5th ht first |pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that comment,  I thougnt N had opened |pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 4 @C now?  I am sure that is what N is thinking about  |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Standings after 3 matches: 1. Payen (64) - 2. Cronier (62) - 3. Laffineur (60) - 4. Doussot (58) - 5. Zimmermann (48) - 6. Chemla (45) - 7. Piganeau (43) - 8. Vinay (36) - 9. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Delfour (35) - 10. Hirchwald (35) - 11. Vives (25) - 12. Salliere (24)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Sure I have|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C looks like a decent spot to me |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
nt|daman: sctoll up|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bonjour à tous  and hello all |pg||
nt|dslee: surely IMP from EW gained here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead would let it thru|pg||
nt|daman: r*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you said you had not|pg||
nt|sybarra: true, probably not as easy it looks from here|pg||
nt|josj: well, in 3nt you just need to steal 1 @H trick :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, heard, sorry|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: can't remember her maiden name|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bill |pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tomi2: do I remember correctly that France missed to qualify for European Champions Cup this year? think they finished 11th or so?|pg||
nt|athene: I suppose you might bid 6@C on these cards if you really waned imps but it looks a bit much to me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then again a helpful lead |pg||
nt|athene: @DA off, @CQ lurking around, lots of work to do to get those hearts up and running.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: Demtinev or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Delova|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrrmmmmm|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: but it works well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call me naive, but I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|blum1956: no way to go down in 4@s (almost)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C lead in other room|pg||
nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6-card or player ))))|pg||
nt|garnetts: They do--and in my view their card play rarely live up to their expectations--a triumph of hope over experience |pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: Might there have been a pass by east to start this?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: lost it N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no alert from S on 1@d?|pg||

pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: I suppose John wanted to protect K@D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: with the opening on left,  you are pretty sure where the k of @H is |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|dslee: as I said, EW gains here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: same contract in the other room |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: now -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dop u agree with Townsend'spass david?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure, the ruffing finesse in hearts is a good bet, but you still have to ruff another one |pg||
nt|athene: unless the ten comes down|pg||
nt|athene: it's not a ridiculous slam but you don't mind not being in it|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: Best play from E is to discard @s6 on next @c|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: maybe Townsend tht 3@D likley if east had anything   that +300 would not be a great loss  and if partner had nothing would gain |pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: a very odd view imo|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N is of course a normal and goo contract very unlucky that apart form spades all other 3  Qs badly placed for dclarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3nt will go down now. N has not enough of entries to finess in all suits|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East will be in trouble soon|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: declarer cashing out and maybe hoping for a mistake|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: and that´s why E should discard @s6 on @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes discarding on clubs but Small has to read the position not easy|pg||
nt|josj: unlikely to happen|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes east has six diamonds too and it goes @DA, ruff right off|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good start for N-S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: ok the finesse was into the safer hand but ....|pg||

nt|neobas: 4@S NS here|pg||
nt|newmoon: Ashok Samjee (East) is also Chairman of Gauteng Bridge Union and Vice President of SABF|pg||
mb|1C|nt|josj: some work to do to make 4@S in EW, it might well go down|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s doomed because of the bad split in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Both sides deserved to suffer for getting to 3NT--life is never fair lol|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 11-15 at least  0  diamonds|pg||

nt|sharkey: i like 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes sets them on the right path (Hopefully) |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they should reach the @d slam now|pg||
nt|athene: Always 11 here because if the defence take their clubs, declarer gets a pitch for his heart|pg||

nt|newmoon: equal lev el correction if South bids 2@C|pg||
nt|dslee: last hand no negative x, now chop with this hand :)?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Li Jie bid 5@D on his own next door|pg||

nt|sharkey: either x or 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 4 @H works also?|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2NT = truscott, 10+, with @Ss|pg||
nt|dslee: south has to come in with a bid here  - keeping up the spirit of N's x|pg||
nt|dslee: white position, 3@D is not bad, show your values what you have|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT is good raise to 3@S|pg||

nt|sharkey: N shud bid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good  potential save in 7 @c   par contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure N should bid at all, 7@c is a good save but who is to say they will bid slam?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: he choosed  the lowest cue bid I think  Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes makes sense, |pg||
nt|sybarra: (lowest cue first) |pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead would hold it, sorry|pg||
nt|neobas: Pretty straightforward board, really|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D   3@D   5@D  he bid. Partner was silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: i guess you have to open that dog (4333)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Ed & Mike|pg||

mb|2H|nt|haans: will Gui give them 4@S?|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh it worked they kept them out of the laydown slam |pg||
nt|daman: good stuff to reach game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Ed and Marshall|pg||
nt|sharkey: W knows a @H cue shos 1. round control - no purpose showing 2. control knowing pd is 55|pg||
nt|stc: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: but things may happen ....|pg||
nt|dslee: dangerous bid by North - do this before :) over call and later on show 4 card @H if it can be done|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any reason to make 4@S  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denies 6 in a minor unless a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D can have 6 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Scores from first stanza|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup not a good 13 count but an opening within the meaning of the Act|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Teltscher 86 Hackett 29, Senior 13 Rosen 49, Hinden 35 Small 41, Crouch 40 de Botton 52|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the multi does seem to work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 combined but work to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: but E didnt|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: may happen ....|pg||
nt|josj: q.e.d.|pg||
nt|athene: objectively you prefer to be playing transfer responses, then the hearts can't be attacked |pg||
nt|neobas: 2@D artificial Gameforce "Checkback Stayman" I think|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dslee: do u think, E will bid 6 @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: difficult for south to give his partner void after 1@s x|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@D presumably asks for the better major|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time 3NT looks slightly better|pg||
nt|garnetts: East sees no reason to do anything other than bid 3NT--things are well placed for 4@H--best lead from North though |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 4@H not 3NT sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: with W do you lead low ht or q? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small should have good 6 to bad 8|pg||
nt|daman: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 top losers and 2 out  of 3 black losers in Hallberg's hand which need to be disposed of one way or the other|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike and Marshall|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: bid  South you have no defensive trick at all|pg||
nt|capercliff: some would play a X bu N now says "I would like to bid 7@c"|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not this pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: hello everybody we are here for the fench national championship|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: well a good club view would help the cause of n/s|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: might on a club lead even then not certain |pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: Q in pards bid suit i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours there is a lot of equity in messing up the u]auction as n/s have done|pg||
nt|capercliff: that way he includes partner in deciding whether to bid or not|pg||
nt|newmoon: Krishna should just 5@S (or pass) with his minimum.  He thinks 5@H is perhaps a 4-4 fit (better than 5-3 @S), but Ashok was cuing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: this pickles you pard |pg||
nt|josj: game was not missed on  1 in CR...|pg||
nt|neobas: Not sure why Cronier did that, 4@S is really the contract you want to be in regardless of what partner responds to 2@D|pg||
nt|dslee: nice def will be to lead @D low by N to get a @C ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: we can talk about that :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@C = fit to @D and values in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: even Xed|pg||
nt|athene: On a heart lead declarer has a slight decision to make|pg||
nt|dslee: does not make a difference but a nice play|pg||
nt|newmoon: same contract in OR.  There it went 1@S - (2@D) - 3@D...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a trump attack was needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry first time at this|pg||
nt|daman: he is gin for game|pg||
nt|daman: can make 5 really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he is lucky here can ruff 2 losers in dummy and just about negotiate |pg||
nt|daman: yes   maybe only makes 4    not enough soldiers for an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful when returning to hand ruffing the third@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: however has no choice as @da drops|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DK he can discard the last @S-loser - so give up 2 @Hs - but has to take @HA|pg||
nt|athene: ducking might look really silly if the lead were a singleton|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting metaphor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you guess hearts (you don't), it's 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: I lead the Q but who am I ?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont beligve 12 - but 10!|pg||
nt|daman:     not 680|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus 1 i was expecting plus 2 imposs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Soryy result not right|pg||
nt|daman: maybe 620|pg||
nt|lestergold: 650 my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 impossible|pg||
nt|daman: I think he has to lose a @S in the wash|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant place 3 black losers om two @Hs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: hi ralf & scores of specs....it's not just the players that have scores:)|pg||

pc|s9|nt|lestergold: Well Sandqvist ?Tosh a relatively newish partnership|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 13 tricks on this lead|pg||
nt|athene: but west would be likely to bid over 1@C with all the hearts|pg||

nt|dslee: EW has to gamble in 5@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: South bid 4@D...|pg||

nt|lestergold: ht switch|pg||

nt|vugraphzdb: Small has left the table to put on a jumper|pg||
pc|cA|nt|neobas: This also works for +1 :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the other room teammates de botton and malinowski the latter a world class player de botton a world class sponsor and enthusiast of the game|pg||
nt|sybarra: except Thomas didnt take the K |pg||
nt|tomi2: I think this is relatively randomly... two hands of equal strenght so I don't think on the long run you win/lose something by playing from the opening hand...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: probably "negotiating" the 8 tricks|pg||
nt|dslee: 4 is nothing, white position bid 5 :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: and 3 rounds of @c will set E under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sandqvist a brilliant but slightly wild card  of a player has a world silver medal to his credit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: best defence in my view tap declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can now see 6 of the 6 to bad 8 points on N|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|neobas: @HK coming down|pg||

pc|c6|nt|ady: good swing for Hackett|pg||
nt|roswolf: has he really blocked the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: he has the ace of @H to get back unless patterson leads one |pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart now will block them for good|pg||

pc|d7|nt|sybarra: but Cronier likely to take the @H hook isnt he\|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|neobas: Probably|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: Holland and Brunner partnership in real life Holland a fin player used to partner the late Arnstrong qell respected player |pg||
nt|neobas: Playing @Ds first won't give him count either... I think|pg||
nt|athene: at the table you have a much better chance of getting it right|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: west thinking|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: cannot really cost that much can it --this might now end play South |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that club switch ever going to happen?|pg||

nt|lestergold: Small is having a field day at the wheel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you a weak 2 would have worked equally well |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its no0t a victory for the multi as such merely a victory for the barrage that took place|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe a lowly trump promoted in south |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW? |pg||
nt|daman: being aggressive?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Michelle Brunner a frequent member of English distaff international team|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow usually plays with hackett senior very experienced senior player i dont know much about Levy|pg||
nt|josj: this time, 4@H does look easy...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|josj: but NS have a good vul. save|pg||
nt|sybarra: and blackwood should help them stay out of stam |pg||
nt|josj: he who makes the last mistake loses the pot...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: yes we are screen|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3 players in this room whose names start with "As"|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: North is Dr. Asoka Thenuwara|pg||
nt|newmoon: and 3 end with "A", Larry says|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: South Asanka Amarasinghe|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: SZ thinking about digging graves|pg||
nt|ady: part score here    likley 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: now the hand is scored as -1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: -1 is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: which hand? the last?|pg||
nt|pelu: how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is this david levy?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it was clear that North had nothing except @c support for passing 3 @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont know if EW can bid 5@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: one match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 5@H!? What a strange choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This mountain that SZ had to climb is suddenly taking on the appearance of Everest|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot think how West declared 5@H next door |pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that with the TOD west thought east had four |pg||
nt|daman: I think you might look at their card Nicky|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Yang psyched a pass over the Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1,  e/w lost an imp here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|daman: ask them the result|pg||
nt|josj: 13 boards seems an odd number...any reason for that?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: no it 's a match of 26 boards divided by 2 :)|pg||
nt|stc: A lack of concentration from declarer, I see no other explanation|pg||
nt|josj: this time, 6@C seems the best slam but it won't make whereas 6@S will|pg||
nt|athene: interesting silence from east|pg||
nt|newmoon: East:  Ashok Samjee,  West : Krishna Malani|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: agressive non bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: No auction given in the movie|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|blum1956: again the 3NT-4 Major choice|pg||
nt|othered1: Why alert the double,  Standard to double 1N for takout of @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to get to I think |pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: a somewhat heavy 3@D preempt|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: sorry for undo :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: diamond lead beats this|pg||
nt|dslee: how did this bid appear:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s. time enough to find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the rosen team fresh from having given the senior team a serious pasting|pg||
nt|ady: wrong red suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i predict|pg||
nt|daman: would we all have bid 3NT with 3334 9 count?|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told that -1 was claimed at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg still has his workl cut out for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: from someone who is at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are two tens i think normal to bid vul game at ips with west's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North can't really sit this,  since his double wasn't based on defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was wondering about the alert on Michelle's pass over 1C last time. maybe she alerts all her bids|pg||
nt|othered1: his redouble, rather|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure he cant sit this. he has good defence, knows he is facing spade shortness and five hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N makes on the cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Goes down if NS get their @S trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 Nt is alright too|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 3 nt  with  j987 |pg||
nt|josj: I have to admit this makes sense...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: but i can ask if you want|pg||
nt|josj: probably it's the time schedule|pg||
nt|josj: 52 boards a day, this way, not 56 which might be too long|pg||
nt|josj: half an hour extra|pg||
nt|josj: nd use iof screens always slowing down the proceedings|pg||
nt|stc: 5@h will win 4 IMP|pg||
nt|josj: and|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H can be stronger... but was purely a balancing bid this time|pg||
nt|dslee: W can open 1@D , I would do so and keep re-bidding @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe she was swayed by her two 10's|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, slam is just against the odds|pg||
nt|newmoon: This should be defeated 2 tricks|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|athene: perhaps with such a pure pre-empt he doesn't want to bid 3@C because it might just help opps too much|pg||
nt|newmoon: the 3@D opener certainly "worked" this time|pg||
nt|dslee: no no no no - no one will bid 3NT with N hand|pg||
nt|dslee: nothing worked, just that this is an extreme chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes a spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: E's @h spots are just good enough to deny the defence 4 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT down on @H lead & @S switch?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - misread|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being if you bid 3@C people will finesse your partner for all the queens and you know that will work|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|lestergold: from the frying pan.... into ,,,, the fire....|pg||
nt|othered1: The double, in practice, tends to deny a fit at all, but north's @S suit doesn't need a lot of support.  |pg||
nt|sharkey: placed @SK behind @SQ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a bit nerve wracking  however |pg||
nt|capercliff: no Carl, declarer gets his @d trick before defence sets up a @s|pg||
nt|josj: this  is going to be a real push|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok, i am told 3@C would be Ghestem|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: bakhshi has to alert  as he could have a longer @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H    needs club lead  to definately beat it|pg||
nt|josj: on  2 in CR NS took the final phantom save: 5@H v. 5@D|pg||
nt|josj: but 4@S on this oe looks a coffee hand so that's what I will do...|pg||
nt|josj: one|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|Walddk2: 4@H also made in the other room on board 1, with an overtrick even|pg||
nt|othered1: Not at all -- isn't 2@H makable?|pg||
nt|athene: well, so you have to bid 2@C or 4@C then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: this might beat it too|pg||
mb|5C|nt|haans: SZ scores :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the bidding in CR is so strange, that the operator dont wont to give it :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has two trumps and above all, EW are vul & 2D X is not game so even if they make it there is a limit to how bad it can be. N has shown a good hand so if S doesnt want to move ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: towards game I think it is reasonable for N to pass the double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 2@h is not so far away|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hm as i expected Sandqvist is worried about the defensive potential of his con tribution|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @h now and small return|pg||
nt|capercliff: but E knows who has the K now|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: What should South bid after 3@D - P - P - ?   with  AJx, AJ10xxx, x, KQx      |pg||
mb|6C|nt|lestergold: @d switch good enuf?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the teltscher team seemed to be way in front  yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: this will be a quick match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Halberg will make it with the help from the lead now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: high @h would be  encouraging for this pair the 6  is not clear the 10 would be best hoping for AK9  in South|pg||
nt|neobas: Red neither looks attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: has time to try the club as well|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: would not affect the result here|pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all, sorry, I hadn't seen the broadcast already started :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bas :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Bas|pg||
nt|neobas: Heya Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT CR as well|pg||
nt|neobas: Hej Carl|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good afternoon Bas|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, plse?|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H with the hand you gave sid|pg||
nt|dslee: not with the hand he has now|pg||
nt|newmoon: then North can make 3NT!|pg||
nt|newmoon: North was justified, I reckon|pg||
nt|dslee: not with singleton in ptr suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead also enough    only one discard of a club  so down 1|pg||
nt|josj: discard @H is best|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: A spade was led to the ace and one returned. Curtains|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have taken some deep trump finesses there|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|daman: he almost has to fall into it now    no?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: was so much easier to beat the hand from this vantage point |pg||
nt|josj: declarer will then need a trump finesse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: I am told that the contract was 6@C and not 5@H|pg||
nt|stc: 10:00 is VERY EARLY for most bridge players|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: oups +2|pg||
nt|dslee: anyways, NS bidding is jinxed - apologies if this is a strong word, but for the sake of the viewers, players will handle this in a different way|pg||
nt|newmoon: but... partner can have   AJx, AKQJxx, x, xxx     and 3NT cold again|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: but after the great lead the follow-up was disappointing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room, Whittaker reasonably played partner for a singleton spade rather than @CA after West bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't fault him|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Anyway, something went 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: I think 2@S was a good decision, likely going plus instead of minus if east had taken the right view|pg||
nt|athene: but that might go very badly wrong if (for example) east is holding up with @HKxx or something|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: a push|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: I am suprised to hear that :)  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Whittaker also from Scotland originally|pg||
nt|othered1: and 670 is an especially ugly minus|pg||
nt|athene: you might run into diamond ruffs trying to get to dummy, or just get cut off from dummy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: making now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But EW can still defeat 4@h with @d continustion|pg||
nt|ralfwil: continuation....|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h hasa fair potential as cards lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is different to pass the doubl;e of 2H. first off, if they make it NS will have a huge loss, and secondly N has a much better hand for defense against Ds than Hs. as against ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that, S probably has five hearts. here prudence wins the day|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: he will take the money and run|pg||
nt|josj: seesm automatic for declarer, wd|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: north was never stabding a double into game at the 2 level|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Scotland "exported" many strong players, most notably Michael Rosenberg and Barnet Shenkin to USA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Victor Silverstone, Irving Gordon, and a few others|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Was 1 off, not making|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder Scotland does not have a strong team today|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|haans: close to making|pg||
nt|lestergold: his redouble was bad on offensive potential of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: based not bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|newmoon: anyways, swing = 200 less 90 = 110  =  3 IMPs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: and even if 2H would fail, it probably wouldnt go down more than one, so as long as N thinks he has a good shot at 110, the IMP odds support bidding. the real question is can he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: count on going plus, knowing there is a big spade stack behind him. i think so, because he will be able to make his small trumps via ruffs as long as S has entries|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: unfortunate discard by East|pg||
pc|d8|nt|josj: W known to be 6-5-1-1 or 6-5-2-0|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|garnetts: This seems to go in line with the old adage --return partner's suit |pg||
pc|c8|nt|blum1956: NS needed to ruff a spade before switching to clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: The Q@C seems a very flash play to me |pg||
pc|d9|pc|h7|nt|othered1: or a trump endplay, as here|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Last entered trick no right|pg||
pc|c4|nt|newmoon: 200 less 110 I meant|pg||

nt|lestergold: at this rate|pg||
nt|daman: this has the potential to be passed out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also the clubs rate to be well placed for declarer on this auction, and a better source of tricks for offense than defence|pg||
nt|capercliff: hard to stay out of game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT going down here|pg||
nt|sharkey: East may lead a @S though...|pg||
nt|stc: If N opens NS will play game and go down|pg||
nt|tomi2: at least the guys know they play ghestem. In Germany most of TD and AC cases are because people look at KQJxxxx@C and forget about Ghestem or partner raises your real Ghestem with ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: ATxx in clubs etc. :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha, yes "the Ghestem Ghost"|pg||
nt|neobas: Always haunting|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in england at most EBU tournaments we have a "ghestem box" - anyone who forgets has to put £1 in, and at the end of the day, all the tournament directors go out for a meal ...|pg||
nt|athene: with the money from the box :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, ok, we don't actually but it's a nice idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a great idea |pg||
nt|neobas: Might have to suggest that to my dad :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks and easy 4 @H here for e/w |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C vul now?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: Well they got off to a very good lead and then made a fatal switch |pg||
mb|1H|nt|capercliff: that makes 8 tricks....|pg||
nt|sybarra: every card is wrong for decarer actually |pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like an endplay possibility|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, if S opens, NS will play game and go down as well :)  :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: is that a transfer or multi-type defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Holland likes to bid diamonds, then hearts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: and vugraph ...|pg||
nt|newmoon: Krishna is saddled with a huge problem now|pg||
nt|dslee: should pass|pg||
nt|dslee: red 3@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@D, or 3NT, and hope to go to next hand fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: no, not clear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if that's a weak 2 ...|pg||
nt|daman: nope  The Garve saved us from that|pg||
nt|lestergold: with garvey around you cant be sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: now the @H lead from E |pg||
nt|neobas: Who here believes North should pass 1@H to allow partner to X?|pg||
nt|dslee: if ptr shows values and he sees his hand with a quick trump trik, the simple bidd is pass|pg||
nt|dslee: and when opponents are red|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: phone call ..better run|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: No--but the Q@C seemed a very rapid play |pg||
nt|blum1956: not an easy decision for North spade lead probably made from J10|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: apparently david gold still contemplating the @SA|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view too fast to work out options |pg||
nt|lestergold: must show one of the majors or tyransfer?|pg||
nt|stc: indeed|pg||
nt|josj: the X should warn Chemla|pg||
nt|sybarra: the qj, and the kq  holding may also slow them down |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT here. Impressed?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card drury?|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think makeable with @H lead|pg||
nt|neobas: It is something every regular partnership should've discussed in my opinion|pg||
nt|stc: some play here XX showing support|pg||
nt|josj: I would XX here...|pg||
nt|stc: W endplayed on the lead !|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a third in hand opening but 1nt looks bold at these colours and with a sketchy stop|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is the wildness of garvey at unfavouravle vul he makes a bid that many of us wouldnt even do at favourable|pg||
nt|neobas: Strong 2@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up being enough only to buy the TD each a pint |pg||
nt|neobas: Especially if West can bid 4@H with three card support, an Ace and out|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: 4 @S for n/s if they could get in |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@Cx is only -1 tho...|pg||
nt|dslee: yes what does EW makes?|pg||
nt|dslee: take the money back home :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@D safer, at this early stage of the match|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: no :)|pg||
nt|josj: it depends: most of the participants here stayed in nearby-hotels overnight, I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: thank everybody to being here ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: jst for remind : 1 match = 2 segments of13 boards|pg||
nt|stc: W will suffer at each card|pg||
nt|josj: and poor E never gets in with his established @C|pg||
nt|tomi2: finaly thats the 2nd time in my young life I see strong twos in action :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: kept n/s out completely |pg||
nt|athene: many people would open 1@C on that north hand|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT says "partner I forgot my bifocals... I think I haved 2 more aces"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: once you have a reputation...it is difficult to deviate|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will get a plus score on this occasion for his efforts|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very tamely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h will go down after 4 rounds óf @c, otherwise makeable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you can if playing support XX |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't sit still with a 17 count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a quick one down?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push i expect|pg||
nt|ady: this should go ddown on the lay    3NT  may have mad with Q@D right though a an unlikely club lead would beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the weak No trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tosh backing in with a Q and a QJ i think very dangerous|pg||
nt|capercliff: hold up the @h twice and play 3 rounds of @c's, what does E pitch?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   no distribution for an action but 1 NT is possible  1 @s  would weak with dsitribution|pg||
nt|neobas: W on lead won't make a difference, I think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: no a quick 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: a passive lead mind you would let it thru but unlikely|pg||
nt|neobas: Same lead CR|pg||
nt|capercliff: double dummy can get out for -1 i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: pitch @D - limited communications after 4 times @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has to get the unblock in also |pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: work to do but the lead has created a trick and the spades are playabel for one loser|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: yes Roland - and I can make 6 on a non-@c-lead :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have been more impressed if you could have made 6@C on the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dangerous weak 2 with 6 solid tricks in ones hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer knows E is 4-3 in the majors now|pg||
nt|neobas: South in the CR ducked the lead twice, played a @C to hand and a @D to the K, after which defence could cash 3@Hs and 3@Ds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose it is not clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT asked East to choose a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Crouch knows that diamonds 5-0 now after the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will play the hand accordingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry what amn i talking about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Qx a particularly doubtful value|pg||
nt|capercliff: and after 4 rounds of @c's will have full outlay|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: hard for partner to read this|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can only make on a spade lead which is likely|pg||
nt|josj: Chemla not interested...|pg||
nt|sybarra: aceless wonder hand|pg||
nt|josj: 10 tricks seem far away but 9 should be there|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ralfwil: yes and the side suit is @h!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a @d trick may be created  as they lie|pg||
nt|sharkey: actually East pitches after dummy so wont make|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: two yes for one no :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch knows that Tosh has nothing. Otherwise North has no double|pg||
nt|sybarra: except with no @D lead, maybe shows S has none?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north cant be faulted but south will be ashamed|pg||
nt|othered1: Good pint, Shirley|pg||
nt|othered1: point|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is on the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pint sounds OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe the pint is better at this hour for us|pg||
nt|sybarra: 940 am here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may need a heart switch now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed someone eill need a blood transfusion after this|pg||
nt|stc: And quantin let W do the work for him|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: @S lead would have beaten this |pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooops  Gold did return a low @S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|josj: @D goes on a @C|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what their methods were over 1NT  ---tempting to bid if you get both suits in |pg||
nt|newmoon: Ashok hoping six running diamonds opposite, and punts 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: most   declarer can get is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: that cant be right|pg||
nt|capercliff: E did not switch to a @c?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and declarer did not play a @h voluntarily?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be huge,  they are playing 4 @S at the other table I am told |pg||
nt|neobas: With 5@Ds and 4@Cs I would, but I wouldn't feel too good rebidding 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind 1@C - 1Major; 1NT|pg||
nt|neobas: On the other hand, this might not be your hand and if you want to get a lead-directing bid in now is your chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: even vul,  couldnt S have ventured 2 @S here?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: that is a textbook error of course|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe a double psychology play :)|pg||
nt|athene: i trust my partner to supply a good stop in the other major|pg||
nt|athene: if he can't even do that little thing, i will find a new partner|pg||
pc|c8|nt|stc: @s now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: another 13 imps to Teltscher|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think 3N is a likely spot here|pg||
nt|daman: Mike    I have noticed a marked imrpovement with your spelling    are you dating a Grammar teacher?    or are you just typing slower?    lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: at unfave vul i cant see the point of the bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, and especially with a double. what if W redoubles? now you may get hurt in a variety of ways|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has to NOT play trumps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts and 3 clubs, or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is certain re diamonds|pg||
mc|8|nt|yo_yo: 12 imps|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and for me - never both majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: we need to cut Nicky some slack    this is her first time as a vugraph operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: Brian mainly known for his supremacy as a match point player world class|pg||
nt|daman: he is very good|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a very good player altogether|pg||
nt|daman: all pass?|pg||
nt|daman: or would you bid 2NT with the North hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: senior of  course a very fine bridge journalist produces all the world championshiop reports excellent|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|Walddk2: 5@D was a fine save against 6@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 2@H shows this then it might take a very short time to bid it |pg||

nt|lestergold: top 4 if ever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well  it was a weak @H suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h e/w looks normal|pg||
nt|neobas: Let's hope for NS North doesn't get pushy|pg||
nt|neobas: Might just open 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 small hts by N not exactly appetizing for going beyond 4 @S |pg||
nt|stc: if w open 3@h NS may end in 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: Board 3 was a push because N made the best lead, a trump|pg||
nt|neobas: If you're lucky - and play Walsh like I do - p might be 4M5@D and bid 2-way 2@C :)|pg||
nt|neobas: lol Bill|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: tough to get to 6@C but maybe not after that opening |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16 opp  7   difficult|pg||
nt|blum1956: using the negative free style North should bid 2@h and then the life becomes easy|pg||
nt|ady: only 23 hcp   but great fit  and source of tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: splinter  or fit jump  or voidwood  which?|pg||
nt|blum1956: but NS probably do not use it|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is hoping to buy a contract for his side))|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does the X show @S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if they do go to 3H you cant rate your chances of beating iot very highly. and if they do go down 50, what have you won? risk-reward ratio very dicey|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes --almost certainly spades with @D toleranace |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: It is a n 11 match round robin on 3 week end so victory points are at stake|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's mad to open 1@C on this south hand and not on the previous north hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: surely the dbl means more than "not penalty"!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they must have some more meaning than "not penalty"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will show off the strong club system|pg||
nt|neobas: 2@D a Game Forcing opening, it seems|pg||
nt|neobas: As for the subsequent bids, I am at a loss :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: or multi not sure|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes, I am not sure what is going on here|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like "any 11" |pg||
nt|neobas: I'm with you on this one Bill|pg||
nt|sybarra: these aren't jrs |pg||
nt|tomi2: having AKQJxxx@H I would not want to let my opps play 4@S vuln undoubled... either I think they are too high, then I try a double or I take insurance in 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: might just bid 6@C and hope for the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or jump to 4@C GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did North double over 2@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not double I mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another tough call for Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|garnetts: When people used to play monet doubles --there were many times a psychic penaltry double was used--good time for it here for example :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tradegy too as its frigid|pg||
nt|daman: it is gin|pg||
nt|capercliff: does anyone know their system?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: game   forcing ace  of @d  shown by 3 @d bid|pg||
nt|josj: nearly :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: interestingly, in OR West opens 1NT, then East bids 3@H = 5-5 majors.  They got to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Does that not show both red suits?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe better cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: like everyone else I have no idea what to do with hands like west--so might as well gamble|pg||
nt|othered1: There are 7's and there are 7's.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT 17-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly marshall|pg||
nt|athene: well south does have two aces and no bad points (unsupported or short queens or jacks)|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the worst 11 ever|pg||
nt|dslee: we welcome Kista (R Krishnan) to this room - welcome Kista|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: west saying @d support :)|pg||
nt|dslee: not going|pg||
nt|dslee: not going|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: as alerted to south|pg||
nt|dslee: sry private intended|pg||
nt|rv: DSM (Dhampur Sugar) is official Indian team along with India 2 (CV Rao), there are 6 additional sponsored teams and Ladies team from India|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: this is not plain sailing|pg||
nt|lestergold: here we see Towsned can bid aggressively when he wants to|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im trying to work out can this be made double dummy even?|pg||
nt|lestergold: answer is i dont think that makes ten tricks as cardsw lie here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult when the @S dont break|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i think tiownsend overbid herec partner didnt even have tio have 4 reasonable,hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bakhshi knows the @S dont break from the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 3@c expresses his values after the double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most would bid 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: why?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19 points? |pg||
nt|lestergold: west'shand is full of holes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 points opposie a pssoble yarborough maybe with a 3 card suit is not mandatory game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in either major|pg||
nt|neobas: According to kibs 2@D is GF, 3@D shows @DA and 3@Ss|pg||
nt|neobas: In which case I wonder what 4@D is|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: 4-2 spade split gives this an excellent play    would Bakhshi except an invitation ?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure NS play Michael 5+/4+ - S has absolut minimum, but very friendly steup for N|pg||
nt|othered1: dicey is a very kind way to put it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze?|pg||
nt|rv: Callaghan's 2@s is inspired, would be everyone's choice|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: now they know nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Especially with the state of the match - harking back to the debate earlier about tactics|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not hard since North choose to bid 3@H--5NT will do it now |pg||
nt|blum1956: either exclusion Blackwood  (if NS use one) or just RKCB and hope for  the @dA with EW|pg||
nt|ady: disappointing|pg||
nt|josj: @S split very nicely here so np for declarer|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reached the par contract now, 6@DX|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not yet Roland |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very polite David |pg||
nt|newmoon: ouch - misunderstanding|pg||
nt|dslee: well-|pg||
nt|dslee: this is undesired by EW I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 4@d was alerted as @d support by west|pg||
nt|newmoon: be wary of conventions that only occur once each 2 years...|pg||
nt|dslee: 6@D now then :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: A huge swing to Sri Lanka - system error|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: He surely is not contemplating 6NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is considering what to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: length is the paramountg consideration|pg||
nt|athene: and the hearts are better than @HA432|pg||
nt|neobas: @SQJx  makes it iffy|pg||
nt|sybarra: note that on previous hand, N opened |pg||
nt|dslee: both the teams are swinging - Mahesh, can we have Kista also commentry here :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@D?  Puppet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so yes, Ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: Last year Cooke and Garvey were in the winning Camrose team which was I expect a culmination of their drwam for years|pg||
nt|daman: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh comes from the "Scots wha' hae wi' Wallace bled" school|pg||
nt|othered1: Your line here?  Cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: im askwed if 2@h is forcing here i would say it was forcing in most partnerships ithese days|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously must be in theirs|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: they play 2@c multi and 2@d  Gf ace showing answers|pg||
nt|capercliff: flat board-next|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room |pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: North can likely infer that @S are 3-3 at most in EW  hands|pg||
nt|stc: 3@h makes, so 3@s is not bad, could make|pg||
nt|stc: probably not|pg||
nt|newmoon: logical was to transfer to @Ss, then bid @H.   Now no-one misunderstands|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5 small @H and a bust and it has a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a moot point borderline my point is that Towsend sholuld have consulted|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes pls|pg||
nt|dslee: welcome Kista:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: interesting lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: with an outside entry, Asoka should lead a @C|pg||
nt|rv: 2@h was cold though this contract won't play too well inspite of 3-3 break|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Lucky that hearts are 3-3. He can test if @CJ10 doubleton first by cashing one of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has always believed that he was the world's number one not noted for his modesty but to be fair i have always felt that he had a great talent for then game but in sufficent ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: discipline to sustain a position at the top table|pg||
nt|neobas: To a junior like me that seems like a rather old-fashioned system. Obviously I don't know it in-depth but Ace-showing answers are something of the past in my book :)|pg||
nt|josj: @C is best now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: but would he get the right result with a 4-2 spade split  if just consulting|pg||
nt|neobas: It got them to the right spot though|pg||
nt|stc: A@s and @d was the double dummy defense|pg||
nt|josj: but not easy to find|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: trump next I imagine |pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CJ to indicate values in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: @cJ for @S|pg||
nt|garnetts: trump is best--the spade can wait |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter and I must have been partners|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite normal these days not to lead a singleton in partner's suit against notrumps|pg||
nt|rv: North can over-ruff @ds and South @h|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: a double followed by a 3 level cue bid tells pard that he doesnt need much to bid game posession ofa 5 CARD SUIT WOULD THEN BE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT|pg||
nt|ady: I agree if east had just 3 small hearts and a bust then 4 hearts could cost a big number|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ssorry butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|daman: we have our share of those on this side of the pond as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry slight exaggeration but we are allowed to tease garvey|pg||
nt|neobas: Be right back|pg||
nt|dslee: ahhhhhhhhhh haaaaaaaa - this is the most unfavourable contract EW can reach|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club away on that spade wouldnt hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think selway should have played a club here a spade should have helped declarer|pg||
nt|daman: The Garve is not timid   he criticizes easily    lol|pg||
nt|athene: but still leading a diamond on this auction was quite a view|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: the winner of the 3 weekends gets to represent England in the Camrose |pg||
nt|rv: declarer will do well to even get 6 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: if clubs 3/3,  this rolls |pg||
nt|josj: decl. has no good way to come to his hand|pg||
nt|josj: but def. can do little harm as N can ruff @DA with his @SA...|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but now the A@d is a trick again|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: but oh well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is very good play|pg||
nt|stc: ruff, Q@H, trump|pg||
nt|josj: putting up the @DA also works :)|pg||
nt|josj: but does not seem a logical line|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he doesn't know|pg||
nt|josj: he did not know to put up @SJ either...|pg||
nt|stc: he already played S for AK@s|pg||
nt|josj: yes but the chinese finesse looked a bit odd|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|blum1956: extremely strange bid for the player of Brunner's level|pg||
nt|lestergold: better not continue these!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: top diamond or even a trump by south would do|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think bakhshi can set up a long dim and enjoy without losing trump comntrol|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it matters  if Townsend pulls 1 trumpt    can discard a club on K@S   and has time to ruff a spade and a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: hovering over a @h|pg||
nt|stc: was good against AK alone in S|pg||
nt|josj: sure :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|garnetts: Poor South might be feeling a bit shell shocked after the start to this match---pressure gets to all of us |pg||
nt|lestergold: There are T shirts in circulation listing the world's top ten players Garvey at the top of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would never lead something else than @H playing with my father!|pg||
nt|athene: it usually works much better to lead a suit where declarer has length, than where dummy has length|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always worry when declarer bid the nt over pard, I am pickling pards entire holding  |pg||
nt|athene: he could have tried a spade but A10xx is a bit horrible|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Then he just needs either hearts or clubs to behave|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: yes this is not the same situation as 1D-1S-1N-2H|pg||
nt|newmoon:  surely @C10 first   -  ouch|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: not designed by Gravey tho|pg||
nt|daman: they can't be selling at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive sat opposite garvey for a weekend tourney- it is not the world's easiest task|pg||
nt|othered1: Only some very old-fashioned partnerships play 2@H  nonforcing.  I have only one of them remaining.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: crpssruff at MPs. seems better to work on spades and trumps at IMPs. not sure|pg||
nt|othered1: are we frozen?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Many play it nf after 1@c-1@s-2@c-2@h, but few after 1@d|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: what is there to think about? |pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: what to order for lunch :)|pg||
nt|daman: like wrestling with a python I imagine|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hes okay for a beer away from then table!!!|pg||
nt|pelu: if lose to @SQ then a @H-ruff - but he is lucky|pg||
nt|lestergold: well some of the bridge world'smore colourful characters Halberg is getting on form seventy buty i hear no one can beat him in an arm wrestle|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small not known for his sweetness and lightness either|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: hts behave |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and spades 4-3 of course|pg||

nt|ady: other than bid 2@H  if their system allows I dont think Holland do much about  it   Brunner needs to do a lot more|pg||
nt|blum1956: is this a knock-out match?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: round robin  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Henry|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Henry!  Why  the distinction?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a bidding test here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H CR|pg||
nt|sybarra: should never make 5 |pg||
nt|josj: I can see 3 top losers :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too |pg||
nt|josj: even without glasses on|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defense can get their act together|pg||
nt|stc: end a swing, EW did not enter at all in CR|pg||
nt|newmoon: but still a loss of 13 IMPs and not 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: next segment after lunch 15.00hrs IST|pg||
mb|1S|nt|capercliff: 6@h is the top spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer has certainly been friendly to slams |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on  previous deal four @d  showed   @s acceptance with no other thing to cue|pg||
nt|josj: unlikely to disappear|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: next session at 15.00hrs Ist|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: first weekend of 3|pg||
nt|othered1: here south passedthe ugly 12-ount|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after clubs can use 2D as art 3rd suit forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@d makes as well of course|pg||
nt|capercliff: both contracts rely on @h being 3-2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope pard knows you use rock crusing 3 level bids|pg||
nt|neobas: Haha Shirley|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: part score hand    n/s  in spades best|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lebridgeur: he is vulnberable  and only 6 cards  sensible in first position|pg||
nt|neobas: 6@D it is, it seems|pg||
nt|newmoon: guess which hand these 2 will be discussing during the smoke break ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: 15 opp 15 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean slam for these boys?|pg||
nt|neobas: I wonder what 1@S is|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S t/o without spades; now west wants to compete to 3@C without actually saying he has any values|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: SZ coming|pg||
nt|garnetts: Tough hand for North --|pg||
nt|yo_yo: redouble is for blood i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double now look fine |pg||
nt|blum1956: EW probably catched up|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes xx was punitive|pg||
nt|sybarra: singleton honors worth ?  (zip)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike Bell also passed 3@D in the OR on 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  because after 1@c ... you have 2@d available as an artificial force|pg||
nt|othered1: Sounds reasonable, but I don't think I've seen that in action.  Don't get around much any more, I guess.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had probably played on establish the @d suit by winning the first @c by @cQ and played a @d to @dA and ruffed a @d another @c to K ruffed another @d and discarded @sJ on @cA and ...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that played @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  which you don't after 1@d and 3@c as an artificial force uses up a lot of room|pg||
nt|neobas: Second as well, in my opinion Meyer|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is vul,  so make can expect a "good" hand |pg||
nt|sharkey: W opened 1@D CR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Yes bas of course|pg||
nt|josj: now the NS @S tend to disappear|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Walddk2: I like Gan's choice of 1NT in the closed room, rather than double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Anyone for 1NT on the West cards raher then dbl? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jxx often a nice holding|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to see the @H-stop in 3Nt - in CR West reopen 1NT - so......|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there something wrong with X byt N?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that the absence of a 7th club does not deter the Garve from a vul 3 level pre=empt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not sure of their sys here but i assume 1C is some sort of artificial bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like 3N doesn'thave much play at all on @H lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S raising @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i understood this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam looks well below 59%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2¬@h doesnt mke|pg||
nt|ady: North decided to keep out of bidding     not unreasonable|pg||
nt|daman: I have an appointment in 10 minutes    so I will have to flee this match at that point|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 or 7? - as long as the suit is QJ109xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: however his cheeky opening has pushed e/w into  a pretty hpel;ess 3n|pg||
nt|pelu: woprked foine here - no chance in 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: matter of style/agreements|pg||
nt|athene: it's tricky if you are going to bid 3@C on that hand and on 15 counts as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west considering 3@C   not an immediate success|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect lead!|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done|pg||
nt|stc: looking for trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: only 2@D on 14 HCP???????????????|pg||
nt|sybarra: Simon Cope says:  no - relay shape ask I am pretty sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 60%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50% i mean|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S?|pg||
nt|neobas: I think I'd open 1@D and 3@D equally as frequent|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and stopped in 5    not satisfactory test :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: It may be difficult to get to slam unless W opens 3@D|pg||
nt|capercliff: the only downside to opening 3@d is that you are 3-3 in the majors|pg||
nt|stc: -2 even with friendly breaks in trump|pg||
nt|newmoon: kista says " A live vugraph broadcast has just started. Polish Premiere League Round 7 of 15 SEGMENT 1/2."|pg||
pc|dT|nt|neobas: I feel W has used the brakes too much in CR|pg||
nt|josj: yes E left the gate open but NS did not exploit it |pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: nicely done|pg||
nt|josj: the agreements are OK|pg||
nt|newmoon: kista says "words will be hotter than the smoke"|pg||
nt|newmoon: sorry|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: I agree, especially when you see where double leads to|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers unavoidable|pg||
nt|tomi2: but maybe he could speculate on his father having 6-4, he did not open any kind of weak two (I guess they play Multi) and overcalled 1@H vulnerable on not many points - so he ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: should have some shape|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I said it before and I will say it again. The EBU must require that all convention cards are submitted and then put on display on the website. It is unreasonable that commentators ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: must guess what certain bids mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll have a word with Max Bavin|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I agree with both of you  !|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: I would rather have passed the double than bid 2@D |pg||
nt|haans: original bid|pg||
nt|neobas: So then Doubling instead of 1@S would've been 4+@Ss?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: I have found that the cc's typically posted are only part of the story,  but would be nice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead for King|pg||
nt|henryb:  you only think that because he rebid 1N and not 2, Mike|pg||
nt|stc: first swing of the match|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 cards suits "up the line"  but with both,  I think X might be right |pg||
nt|josj: looks like playing mp|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: I must admit i would not have preotected with halberg's hand altho h ewas influnced by holding 9 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: close his eyes and play the top tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: hope for the best |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so I prefer to open 3 @d|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: (also in little tiny print) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that I have the EW card. I have because Crouch sent it to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Most don't get terribly deep into relay development|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took me 5 minutes to download the comprehensive version of the EW CC|pg||
nt|sybarra: the cc's hardly give the details for relays,  agree ED |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a shorter version I have on hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect Precision, with 2S inviting game in NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the1N rebid must show 18-1i9 points to explain the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2N looks safe enuf|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Couldn't see a card there|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it is reasonable to assume that  Henry |pg||
nt|lestergold: playing natural club south would rebid 2N|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes me too|pg||
nt|sharkey: W felt "guilty" due to his light opener in CR I think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: i would have tried 3@D :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or even open 1@d maybe?|pg||
nt|capercliff: in 2nd seat|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: ruff out, play trumps and then a spade|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: Yes of course Haans :) rofl |pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have tried 2@H with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland explained to me that out operators are new to this and it is very tought job--in my view Darren is doing brilliantly so far --may not be able to note all alerts this first ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: time |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Cheers, I am new but Roger is an old hand, you'll have David and Ant later who are both experts!|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: making 5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: Roland and I would have been in 3NT because we would have bid 1NT as west --so there |pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of going for a number would have detered me|pg||
nt|pelu: but some would pass the X - if pd strong then 500-800 |pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 imps about to appear for the Teltscher team|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt favorite|pg||
nt|sybarra: take no finesses|pg||
nt|sybarra: at yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: *at least yet |pg||
nt|lestergold: every time garvey gets away with one of his wild bids he is encouraged to continue forgets any disasters|pg||
nt|lestergold: has led a charmed life rcently to|pg||
nt|reisig: Somehow - I get partners that remind me!!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would you open 3@D if Non Vul?|pg||
nt|stc: sure, I don't think that N was really happy when bidding 2@s !|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: long dim takes care of one club loser but that is still 1 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: no devils coup available|pg||
nt|ady: this may be down 2    but definately 1  so nothing much lost for n/s being kept out of the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldnt be 2 off just needs to get the timing right for one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult for players of this calibre|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am askedf how old is garvey|pg||
nt|athene: as many specs have pointed out, lots of pairs would use 2nt by west over 2@H to show a weaker hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stc: of course X in S should show @s|pg||
nt|josj: yes, only way to show them in this auction|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: to all spects: pl. a name in your profil - most commentators dont chat with "John Do's"|pg||
nt|neobas: He brought six tricks and three card support to the table, I'd say I have nothing to be guilty about|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@d doesn't tell pard anything about his hand really|pg||
nt|newmoon: easy now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 800|pg||
nt|athene: of course there are textbooks which would frown on that 3@C opener, but having the texture in the suit is worth a lot|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: well i guess mid late forties but always looked about 25 to me|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@C is a real hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|nt|garnetts: taken the max --well done |pg||
nt|newmoon: the elusive 9th trick has been found, and +2 now|pg||
nt|newmoon: oh... @HQ ducked (safe hand) for +1 only|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: claim?|pg||
nt|athene: @CQJ109xx is going to be a 2-loser suit mostly even if partner hasn't got a fit|pg||
nt|athene: better than e.g. @CK97432 which might indeed get really killed|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes the average junior look like an old age pensioner|pg||
nt|neobas: @H pitch looks scary|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but a pair who play strong twos aren't going to go in for any funny business like that!|pg||
nt|tomi2: but playing this way you are not able to show a hand with 5+clubs and 4 dias, incase partners fit is in @D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blum1956: a swing for Hackett this time probably|pg||
nt|stc: But, on the bidding, EW may have even 4@h to play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|newmoon: North could have been squeezed on run of the clubs|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think 1NT is the most descriptive bid,as it does not promise a @H stop|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: best way to find 3nt  is not caring about stoppers|pg||
nt|ady: looks like the defence wont be able to get 2 club tricks    the 4th diamond will be a discard|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: now south can play club but selway must duck|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: discard A@S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|haans: beginners do that all the time|pg||
nt|othered1: this can pick up imps v. 3N down more|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|garnetts: I totally agree as I would also bid it with xxx|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: if you want to play "optimally", one of the hardest areas is choosing when 2nt should be lebensohl and when a scramble|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: because it's very close, a lot of the time|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|h3|pg||

nt|lestergold: and second club away on that diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N should fail if bid as S hand is squeezed before W hand is....E never gets a chance to make a mistake by discarding a D|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I like    3 @d in first or 2nd seat      |pg||
nt|sharkey: looking closer at CR bidding I think East was to blame for not getting to slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting question Carl, if I was green VS red I'm not sure what I would open|pg||
nt|josj: oh yes...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: for the result : http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletLienRapide?param=Q11DNO1|pg||
nt|athene: here, i would say, east should have support for both minors almost all the time so you are probably better-off using it as lebensohl - you don't need to bid 2nt with 4@D5@C because ...|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C should be ok most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzqj: just for remind you : 1 match = 2 segments of 13 boards|pg||
nt|dslee: last deal here now|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: well played|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: well to be fair the weak NT didnt help earlier|pg||
nt|ady: e/w need to keep out of game|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s frigidaire?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C or 1@D opening on last hand in anatural system is strictly a matter of style|pg||
nt|stc: part score battle now|pg||
nt|athene: but just change the auction even slightly and you might argue that scrambling is better, so it need a lot of discussion|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: The Complete Book of Balasncing Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: SZ rapidly approaching a target of 10 imps per board to win.|pg||
nt|sybarra: demonstrating on last bd, the power of the part scores  |pg||
nt|dslee: xxxx|pg||
nt|dslee: chop|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: and not actually a bad contract|pg||
nt|pelu: ok slam - but I dont exp that NS will come even close to bid slam|pg||
nt|athene: south might just respond 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cooke is the perfect partner for garvey he is a thoughtful disciplined highly intelligent player around whom Garvey can dance his dance of death|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe 4@d in that case|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps 3 NT may be an option...|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to play them all as scramble unless specifically agreed otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  5+ hearts  9+ hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|neobas: 3@H by South?|pg||
nt|neobas: Four, even!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps again here|pg||
nt|newmoon: 8-board matches are tight... like BAM and MPs.  Each trick is crucial, and any misunderstanding become a calamity|pg||
nt|dslee: both white with @S suit - shd be chopped|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ady: 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: unassuming cue bid not game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this may lead to game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surprised Bakhshi didnt double to show those @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may likem his diamond fit|pg||
nt|reisig: no alert for 2@h?|pg||
nt|pelu: I would hate to open 1@D on the N-hand :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Garvey deals out quite a lot of death against anyone but the toughest opposition|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: minor  openings at 3 level  should  be some how constructive if partner has not passed|pg||
nt|sybarra: pusilanimous bid of 3,  |pg||
nt|capercliff: i like the 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @H also |pg||
nt|stc: Top french pairs a very conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: sri lanka for all it is will win this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: systematic requirements i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H - let them guess|pg||
nt|neobas: Well, I would too, so that's why I expected South to bid 3 :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: @h lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: and may be it makes too|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's like 20/20 cricket, run rate required per over almost 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the category of "oh good"........|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: too strong  is South for 3@h|pg||
nt|capercliff: no problem now I think, only a @h lead would give declarer problems|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it makes on a cross-ruff?|pg||
nt|sybarra: its close to making,  sometimes pard has some clubs to add to mine |pg||
nt|capercliff: i think 4@h is pretty standard|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - just use @HA first trick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: at last a penalty double bid as penalty taken as penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: transfer weak twos --interesting |pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
nt|pelu: I know it the system - but still :)|pg||
nt|athene: they play strong club, 5-card majors, multi 2@D, so 1@D is very loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s wants to be played by south asltho here as A@h is right doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I'm sorry, we have to restart this room|pg||
nt|stc: see N in CR passing 3@c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||
nt|lestergold: why show hearts when they have alre4ady located spade fit|pg||
nt|stc: in fact in both rooms|pg||
nt|tomi2: if you open 1@D and are in the same situation later and bid 2NT as "good bad" then north can preempt one level higher, then responder does not know if opener has a shapely hand ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: with both minors or @D only. seen that often enough|pg||
nt|newmoon: another swing to Sri Lanka.  Well done, Sri Lanka!|pg||
nt|psridhar: look at the disparity in hand evaluation- other room W valued his hand as opg bid; here W did not even consider raising 2s !|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: dont worry Nicky anyoje takes on vugraph is very brave|pg||
nt|neobas: Hmm, on second thought maybe not|pg||
nt|capercliff: that might not be good enough, because declarer will eventually have to go out to a @d|pg||
nt|stc: Quantin-Bompis open very light and as a consequence do not X part scores - same as Meckwell|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has a simple bid to show a good raise in spade4s|pg||
nt|henryb:  West is close to too strong for a 2N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this decision to open 2N here is going to lead to game and i dont think can make|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is a pro-am bid, in my eyes.  Partner has no idea of trick potential in @D contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I think 2N would be fine if the hand were different:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: Holland 3@C  for major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see the point of a transfer weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Francis Hinden made 4@H  well done to her|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Frances|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s deny a @h cue?|pg||
nt|pelu: Sorry - I was weong they are "close" now|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluckly west's hand is better than some 20 counts but has hit an unfortunate misfit minimum opposite|pg||
nt|sybarra: East decided to just raise in the known 8 card fit,  not looking for anything more than game |pg||
pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: doesnt it just give opps an extra bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gained 12 imps for her team on 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt venture into this auction with that pile of festering horse manure with a gun to my head|pg||
nt|capercliff: and a second trump comes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: specs want to undertsand teh system|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone explain it|pg||
nt|lestergold: heavily artificial of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 21H must show spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n support 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d cue i assum|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key is the nebulous 1D opening and the 2@h response|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think most of would would bid the same even with constructive raises |pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there a reason they opened 1 @S in both rooms? not 1 @H?|pg||
nt|josj: yes, higher from 5-5 |pg||
nt|stc: other type of pairs will be in 3 or even 4@h which may be in on a sunny day|pg||
nt|josj: no matter how many they go down...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Roland, but in 20/20 10 per over is eminently achievable - especially if an inform Gilchrist is batting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah by South  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n good support im toldthe rest is fairly starightforward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually 2N is OK if pd is a passed hand. but facing an unlimited partner you are just begging to miss a slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that question |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|capercliff: now he can afford to go out to a @d and retain trump control|pg||
nt|neobas: Only a @H will set it now|pg||
nt|sybarra: testing  E now|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think it can be beat now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S asking for @H-control?|pg||
nt|henryb:  mainly unlucky that the diamond suit doesn't run|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the point I was dancing around|pg||
nt|lestergold: Holland too good in the majors to pass 2N|pg||
nt|neobas: Well done|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: old fashioned forcing nt might have solved this problem ending in 2 @D's or so |pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately i think with Towsned's minimum 12 count and awful spade suit his 3@d bid which is effectivbely a game try was an overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case 3NT is the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@H|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe im wrong|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the  @d   duck was fatal should have  cross ruffed|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: here comes another sp |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: i would think it must be by impication|pg||
pc|h4|nt|newmoon: playing precision helped.  This was opened 1@D with West (a'la Meckwell)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|neobas: I think that would've led to only nine tricks Meyer|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT would have been 5-11  NF|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: also you do not really need to ask for ther Q@H as you know North is not queen high for his actions |pg||
nt|garnetts: He is almost certain to have the ace |pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed very unlucky not an unreasonable bidding sequence|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe I am wrong as well :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: it was agood auction |pg||
nt|dslee: EW would had gained someIMP here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: This can go 2 down of Shi finds the diamond shift|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|garnetts: east needs to count here --North has played it very well so far |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i know, Ed, but i felt more like kick-boxing than dancing:)|pg||
nt|josj: 3@D should go down as well...if def. take their 4 tops and play @C from E|pg||
nt|neobas: Declarer trying to set up @Ds in hand rather than @Hs in dummy for a lack of entries to the long suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Not easy|pg||
nt|dslee: had they heard me :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: coujld easily be duplicated |pg||
nt|newmoon: and yes, West could have raised later|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: N had to lose a diamond at some point, so put the defense to test fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: ty all...next session in 10 minxs|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: mins|pg||
nt|dslee: or your T Nagar club weekly|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: I am not sure they can do that with 5 hearts as they have 2@D available for 9+ with hearts|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: their system is different|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  notice that even 2N is down since West gets squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry wrong descard there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, Artur might open 2N, but i predict 1D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well spotted henry--that makes 2 hands in a row where declarer could get squeezed|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|pc|c9|nt|haans: hold on to @DQ|pg||
nt|neobas: Cross-ruffing first only would've given more information about the hand layout to defence|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 10 imps on 5 where Frances opened the more normal 1@S|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzat: bye all|pg||
pg||
