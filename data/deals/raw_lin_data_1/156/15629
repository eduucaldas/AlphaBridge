nt|brolucius: Now present and correct.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The term 'easy grand to bid' is usually an exaggeration, but not here.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|danilo1: in IMPs, probably noone will care and just bid 7@H here ... but in MPs, guess 7@H will be poor score|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: wil be in 7N?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Jacoby 2NT shows a game-forcing raise to game (at least) in partner's suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: will all be in 7N, I meant|pg||
mb|3C|an|min or 18+|mb|p|mb|3D|an|asks|nt|danilo1: guess 95%|pg||
nt|brolucius: North can count the tricks for 7NT after a Blackwood sequence.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|an|big hand I guess|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Unless South has AK bare in clubs and the bare ace of diamonds, there will be a 13th trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: dirtector called, not sure why|pg||
nt|brolucius: In a world final you would expect (hope) that nearly every pair would bid 7NT.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|brolucius: There is no value in the Jacoby 2NT as such. It is in the rebid system that the method succeeds or fails. The basic version taight to beginners (three-level bid in new suit is a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: shortage; four-level another five-card suit) is fairly hopeless, giving no hint of how strong the opener is.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|an|o or 3 key cards|nt|danilo1: good decision by N ... he must take inititive ... partner may not see 7@H tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|brolucius: Players at this level will have a mechanism (as P and G obviously do) to show the opener's strength.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C now will show the king of clubs, I expect.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|brolucius: And North can now count 13 tricks, as discussed previously.|pg||
mb|p|mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, well done. We expected no less!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: Generally better to show a specific king in response to 5NT than to give a count of kings in the old-fashioned way.|pg||
mc|13|nt|brolucius: Sometimes one particular king is worth a lot and a different king not so much.|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzsw: good to have agreements about how to show an additional king after showing the first one when playing specific kings|pg||
mb|2H|an|5+ hearts, 4+j spades i think|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|an|some values|nt|brolucius: I have a horrible feeling that this may be the (unmentionable) F******* convention.|pg||
nt|danilo1: someone in IMPs may choose not to beid 2@C in this voulnerability, but I think in MPs, 2@C by South is sound bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: The word is banned on BBO, for obvious reasons.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: srry ... 2@H (not 1@H)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: South would respond with a Lebensohl 2NT on most weak hands, so 3@C shows better values, perhaps about 8-11.|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Second diamond trick is now lost. A tricky decision for West, since he needs to hold up when East has a doubleton diamond, but not when he has a singleton.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|brolucius: There have been various appeals held, where one side has claimed that a quick switch shows a singleton and a slow switch a doubleton.|pg||
nt|danilo1: good switch to @D by Robinson ... on time ... to keep @H communication open before @SK extracted|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: the @Djack likely suggested the heart queen|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzsw: a relatively quick round;  the pace in this event can sometimes be very slow|pg||
nt|brolucius: In some countries the @H2 lead would suggest an honor at the top (here the queen, which was an entry). In the USA it is common to lead low from three small.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not necessarily a bad board for N/S. In a way both sides can be happy with their performance. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Other BBO table was in 5@C, I am told, but of course that is only one table of many.  I have not yet been told whether they made 5@C, but I don't have high hopes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Two down, apparently. A deserved bottom.|pg||

nt|danilo1: I guess there is no running scores ... at least, there has not been yesterday |pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: here we have one pair for the Rosenbloom winner and one from the runners up|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: i will have updates every 4 boards or so (but maybe not near the end)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsw: at least I did yesterday|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hampson-Greco 9t after 4 Final sessions|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: E/W here are the pair who took two bottoms on the previous round, missing the grand and soaring to 5@C. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Let's see if they can put the bad boards behind them and do well (not easy...)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: correction,Zimmermann lost inthe semi  finals|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: With the singleton @DK, South might have taken a view and opened with a weak two.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: these two open very light|pg||
pc|dA|nt|danilo1: not easy bid for North now ... probably must not bid 2@S as that would show stronger hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: Exactly.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: US players tend to open much stronger hands with a weak-two than is normal in Europe, so I did not rule out a weak two from South. But it made no difference in the end.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|h6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some kibitzers are suggesting that he might have rebid 2@S instead of 2@H. It would have worked well but I would not do it on that hand. There would then be more chance of partner ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: lifting off. |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|danilo1: actually, I beieve most of the NS pairs will have same problem, independent if opening bid 1 or 2 @H (ev. 2@D) ... too  difficult to end in @S|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|danilo1: ... weak jump schifts on 1@H would help, but guess in this field, just few will play that|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: It is a sound rule that you should leave no gap between your 2@H and 1@H openers. So, there is no question of passing on the South cards.|pg||

nt|brolucius: West will surely open in hearts rather than diamonds.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Then 1NT by North looks good. No, he has bid 1@S.|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|danilo1: Dble by North now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, double to show a strong hand.|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@S now obvious by South|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can hardly bid more than 2@S, though.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Perhaps the words 'Magic 200' are flitting through North's brain.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|danilo1: but over 3@D (3/4@H by East), South, who passed first time is getting chance to produce some noise |pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H is the action of a madman (if I am allowed to say that). If I am not, then, well, it was a bit ambitious.|pg||

nt|brolucius: A kibitzer tells me that I am being unfair to madmen, with my comparison.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: To be fair, West was stretching a bit with his 3@D. But that was the sort of justified stretching (at Pairs) that I mentioned at the start.|pg||
nt|danilo1: For my taste, West 's 3@D bid is too much ... even in MP's ... Aceless hand, 2 bare King ... and Auction suggested opponents have more + Higher suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: In any case, 3@D may have been bid on the expectation that East would hold a value or two (because N/S had stopped so low).|pg||

pc|dK|pc|hJ|pc|s9|nt|brolucius: I expect some would say that East should have raised to 2@H on the first round, and then sat back, rather than spring to life so dramatically later in the day.|pg||
mc|7|nt|brolucius: The first mistake that the French pair made today was getting out of bed. It has not started well for them.|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I look at the West hand again, I think Danilo was right to say that 3@D was too much.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|s6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: Reverse-count signal in spades by North hints at four cards there.|pg||
nt|danilo1: due to bad cards position, 4@S would not work ... and not easy to reach 3NT ... so Dbling 2@H is the simplest - usually the best - choice|pg||

nt|danilo1: @CQ ruffed small best|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: only 2 pairs failed to reach the 7N on bd one|pg||
nt|brolucius: Out of how many, Joe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: 72 I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2 out of 70 (or perhaps 72). Wow, that is a good standard.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: one was in 6N and one in 5 @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 36 tables, so it was 2 out of 36, failing to bid it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: director here trying to get Fan to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: right, thx|pg||
nt|danilo1: but only half have been tested David :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: At your local club, there will be plenty of pairs pleased to have reached 7@H. And that would be a near-zero here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: they foudn the trump promotion byruffing sapde ace with dj|pg||
nt|danilo1: ruffing @CQ small will promote trump trick ... no guess for Fantoni|pg||
mc|8|nt|brolucius: Fantoni's misguess on the third round of clubs has left him wondering who has the missing club, it seems.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would be happy with +90 on the N/S cards, but time will tell.|pg||
nt|toral5: hello everyone|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi Sapan|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not so bad when the play is slow in a pairs event. If they play really quickly, you just have to wait for the next round to start. |pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: sry i missed the play but when Meck won the king of @D with the ace, he played @Sa which was ruffed with @Dj|pg||
nt|danilo1: so than ... last @H should promote @D10|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am asked about a site for running scores. I have no such information, I'm afraid. Does anyone know? Earlier someone said there was not one yesterday.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: 2@D is inverted, showing a strong hand. Some would prefer to bid 2@C with such a good side suit. You could then splinter in hearts if partner rebid his diamonds. |pg||

nt|brolucius: Is it not close between 7@D and 7NT? You have the chance of ruffing the clubs good when playing in diamonds.|pg||
nt|toral5: infact 7nt also makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are various squeeze chances in 7NT. The black-suit one works. But there might also have been a major-suit squeeze.|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: 7NT surely makes ... but has also loosing squeeze options ... need to decide the rite squeeze|pg||
nt|brolucius: This auction all hinges on what 2NT showed. Presumably it could not have been a 12-14 hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: given the nature of this event, there might be many in 7|pg||
nt|danilo1: but to note ... 7@D as well has loosing option|pg||

nt|toral5: declarer can play for black suit squeeze on south as wel as 3 suit squeeze on south.in that case betr to cash @H ak,@S king and run @D|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only three trumps, West is not entitled to bid the grand on a doubleton club. |pg||

mb|2C|nt|toral5: did fantunes make 7@D?|pg||

nt|brolucius: I see no reason whatsoever why 2S should not go for a big number after 1@D - 1NT, when North has such a moderate suit. But, I stand corrected. |pg||
pc|h2|nt|danilo1: real MP bidding ... 2@S, 2NT, 4@C, Dble ... all MP bids|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, it might do - but one of the ways to lose at pairs is to let non-vulnerable opponents play 1NT|pg||
nt|dburn: since you will score badly almost regardless of how many tricks it makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is why I described it as a pairs (and not IMPs) bid........... |pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: 30 total boards today, the last session of the event|pg||
nt|danilo1: agree, David (now I cannot be wrong . whoever of U2 rite) :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: you should bid it at IMPs also, since a way to lose at IMPs is to score minus 90 in 1NT instead of plus 110 in two spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|danilo1: Honestly, playing MPs, I would likely bid same |pg||
nt|brolucius: Right, I will take an early exit and prepare the lobsters for tonight's dinner. Thanks for watching!  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3@s would probably have made, and 140 would have been a top in a field full of BroLuciuses, all of whom would be plus 50 or 100 against 1NT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: but Fredin and Fallenius will do better even than that, since this is going to be plus 300|pg||
nt|danilo1: -300 is probably not much worse than -140 ... good MP logic is to risk to transfer 20% score to 0 or better|pg||
nt|danilo1: or ... -500 (same) ... less than 0 not possible :)|pg||
