nt|swanson: took|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so they started brd 17|pg||
nt|toral5: another dull push coming up|pg||
nt|ady: so declarr played a trump|pg||
nt|tlc: hi karen and alan :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are off|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fasten your seatbelts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I live 3 mins from Stamford Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director came in the room and said GO|pg||
nt|norby: very similar system grco ham and meckwelll|pg||
mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|tlc: Fasten your seatbelts...showtime!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|toral5: spectators are expecting some early fireworks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is the action man|pg||
mb|d|an|4 spades|nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Traian and last he made an error was in 1987|pg||
nt|algraves: no this is the well known meckwell and the great young Israeli pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 2n with East hand showing @C+@h split range?|pg||
mb|r|an|values|nt|athene: i guess it's the sixth heart that stopped him, rather than being so weak|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: now north needs a support re-redouble :)|pg||
nt|norby: i prefere 1 hearts with 6 heart, if 6 diamond and 5 heart better bid 2 suiter|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstroth certainly chose winning bid especially with Rodwell having other 2 suits:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
nt|athene: not so useful when south has denied five spades though|pg||
nt|norby: sorry 6 club and 5 heart|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: no one steals from West|pg||
nt|algraves: we are finding out what system they play|pg||
nt|athene: east's choice of rebid suggests it was indeed the sixth heart he was thinking about when he bid 1@H rather than 2nt|pg||
nt|rv: does 1@s substitute for supp X with north hand?|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to get that sixth heart into it - he might bid clubs later maybe if it seems like a good idea i suppose|pg||
nt|norby: stron hand only|pg||
nt|norby: strong|pg||
nt|algraves: he is 4333 and doesnt want to encourage anything|pg||
nt|algraves: A lot of bidding around Rodwell|pg||
nt|algraves: with the best hand at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod thinking now|pg||
nt|athene: he might raise hearts now|pg||
nt|algraves: I think XX showed exactly 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: is Greco's 2@s conventional if Hampson didn''t show 3@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: was not alerted|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: North opened 2@D (multi) in CR, almost forced EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 22 hcp 3NT  CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yuval Yener and David Burn|pg||
nt|athene: well, 2@S says he wants to compete but he is known to have only four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so logically he must be prepared for north to pull to 3minor|pg||
nt|athene: i expected 3@H from west but he doesn't mess about :)|pg||
nt|rv: normally Rodwell gives allowance for Meckstorth's aggressive bids, this time he doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: more imps now for nickel|pg||
nt|dburn: except perhaps East, who thinks his partner might have something|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW plays 2/1 with transfers in responses over 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: so this plays well with the friendly hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing too fancy|pg||
nt|kareno: David, you know my feelings on the subject - you must get in the auction when it is appropriate and this time \i feel it is definitely appropriate :)|pg||
nt|tlc: and the friendly clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: probably 9 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asking about leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably too much action|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks like quite a lot of bidding|pg||
mb|d|nt|algraves: for sure 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: this is where you are supposed to run the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play israeli standard souped up no doubt which is a straight forward natural approach |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
nt|algraves: undoubtedly very good card players and fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks that 5d was prefered in the closed as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco doubled in a flash|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he can make it if they don't lead a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: this is 2 down on accurate defense even after this lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: did have 2 hearts  1 spade   and K@D on 3rd heart   but not now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe the auction indicated a club lead - not sure exactly what the later rounds meant, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance for a swing from the word go|pg||
nt|rv: defense should get 3@cs and 2@h if they can shift to @h in time|pg||
nt|algraves: So Meck is playing with a lot of information but it wont help him much|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell making a comment about the tray being slow coming back|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Rodwell played Meck for more since he didn't bid 2@h or 2n in first round|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows the spades and the diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think unhappy with something|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
nt|norby: strange double of greco, probabily understimate rodwell?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: or, of course, not play on hearts at all - although I am not quite sure why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell thinking north took a long time to pass 4@H and that influenced the double?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think so|pg||
nt|norby: i think also with 5 hearts and 8 club:-))) |pg||
pc|h7|nt|rv: yes he needed to judge between under-estimating Rodwell to over-estimating Meckstorth:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost impossible to over-estimate meckstroth's aggression|pg||
nt|norby: sorry for my italenglish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only my Spanish/Italian was half as good as your English|pg||
nt|rv: np Norby, message (bridge language) is very clear:)|pg||
nt|norby: ty:-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco in the tank now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: have to say 3NT   ambitious  in CR    but came home|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he won't make it|pg||
nt|algraves: well he wont make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: may be ducking the spade was wiser|pg||
nt|rv: now @s back best|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jkotor: i think he is winning in the different boards|pg||
nt|pelu: carefull unblocing @DA|pg||
nt|toral5: claim time now|pg||
nt|toral5: praying that becker doesnt have @C 10 and single @S|pg||
nt|algraves: open cards now for Hampsom as they say|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid panicking and trying to cash clubs out, but it does all come down to the eight and nine|pg||
nt|rv: Hampson might just find it since Meck didn't @d  pitches earlier|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|swanson: Would the 9 or 10 be led for 10-9 doubleton, Jakub?|pg||
nt|algraves: yes Meckstroths opener seems to have fooled him a little|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|swanson: from|pg||
nt|jkotor: 10 is 109 for 98% of Polish|pg||
nt|jkotor: but 2 from 92|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm sure he was confident that meck had the heart K for his opening bid...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|toral5: ..|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 10 from 102, yes? |pg||
nt|rv: well defended|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jkotor: Hx is Honour lead in 4/2 polish style|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Martens thinks and takes the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: yes, Hampson knows declarer only has the quick diamonds, no long cards, and he didn't take them earlier when he could have done|pg||
nt|algraves: good start for Hampson and Greco|pg||
nt|norby: surrender meck please:-))|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he does not look like surrendering|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth has a count and must know he can neither drop the @CK or pin the @C10|pg||
mc|8|nt|rv: according to many neutrals this pair of Greco-Hampson are one of the form / most impressive pairs in this world championships, consistent good performance and many winning ...|pg||
nt|rv: decisions|pg||
nt|algraves: One doesnt like to make a big deal of pscho babble things but it is important to be decisive in these situations|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||
nt|dburn: ducking the spade would have been a bad idea if South held the king of hearts, which was what Pachtman was playing for|pg||
nt|algraves: well yes but then heshould have just played on hearts at trick two|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he was going to do that, he might as well have played on hearts earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: inresting in this matchwe have Norway NS at both tables - in CR: Brogeland-Sælensminde|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: match tied|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jkotor: 10-16 this vul|pg||
nt|algraves: you want the other guys to know that you are prepared to back your judgement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, extra boards and we have them ready|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|algraves: oh well , easy when you see them all as they say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: effectively 47 brd shootout|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yuval10: 1@h by E would've been 3 cards support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  0-2 hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 2@c denies|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: West thinking now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell Pachtman discussing system the other side of the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@d is forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL someone was complaining to me yesterday about the transfer responses - I had to explain that they are almost standard in some quarters of the expert community\|pg||
nt|yuval10: says nothing about @s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: @d sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: both sides of the screen writting explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i can see none of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Hamman asks about the bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c and 2@s after @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: a question is written|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D just shows 5+@ds GF or is it conventional?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 more to Diamond|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzta: 2h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman gave him 2 fingers|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play a standard start with a very modern approach after that with transfers and information requesting waiting bids etc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's actually 'natural' after he already denied as many as three|pg||
nt|algraves: anad more to come no doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck did not know he is on lead lool|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and HH landed in 3d|pg||
nt|algraves: the future will be to bid games giving away as little as possible|pg||
nt|algraves: and try and position NT contracts  if possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asked him do you know you are on lead?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|toral5: nice 2nd dbl from helgemo|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking now|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like a make here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: thinking what to discard from dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks normal to pitch a diamond and play @HAx hoping for another trick somewhere|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|ady: but there will be a 2nd discard|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jkotor: with blocking @c@c|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lets see now|pg||
nt|pelu: prob need to finess @D9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice support dummy has|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: going for hearts|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|toral5: @D 9 cant be promoted cos north has a 4th @S pitch on @C|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: A small club now and south will make @CQ and @HK and no more|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||
nt|ady: now must go up with ace|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer has to win and hope @D are stopped|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment he is thinking|pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: better to duck with @dK|pg||
nt|algraves: well so he can try and ruff a spade|pg||

nt|vugraphzta:  it is too fast :(|pg||
nt|jkotor: unless he takes 3 tricks :)|pg||
nt|algraves: but will only make 5|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|swanson: The defense might have cashed out for down two.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: 17 decided by the lead it appears|pg||

nt|jtr: Why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: diamond king in his hand...|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|passell: hi all  I hope this will be as great a match as yesterdays|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: 6@d makes but is a Bad contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  in 5@D, assuming a heart lead, declarer can make it two ways: 1: guess the spade right or 2: finesse clubs and take a pitch.  but there's also one way to go down (guess the spade wrong)|pg||
nt|passell: spade guess even after lucky club position|pg||
nt|bessi2: but 5@d is by no means secure|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|passell: more likely to go after spades|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|bessi2: seems straightforward to take the @s finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|bessi2: which he does|pg||
nt|dburn: went for the immediate pressure play|pg||
nt|kareno: Surely|pg||
nt|warrens:  not over yet, defense stil has to cash out|pg||
nt|dburn: but Platnick wasn't under any, or so it seemed|pg||
nt|passell: heart is easy|pg||
nt|bessi2: true.. but with the 4@s bid.. shouldnt be too taxing|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||

mb|3H|nt|jkotor: yap, very good 3nt by Chechs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aww....|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate position in hearts    though always a good chance if 10@H is with west|pg||
nt|athene: i like 3@D over 3@H - when opps have spades, all other suits rank the same|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010nonJuniorPhiladelphia/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf   for Meckwell|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: 2nt by east will be natural here?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|toral5: incase he decides to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
nt|athene: from a lead point of view, a diamond lead is less likely to cost than a heart too|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a X in East - but only if pd has a 5 card suit :)|pg||
nt|norby: forgive me but i comment both bad and good think of players|pg||
mb|4D|an|alerted|nt|chessmaste: So far the deals have been good for the leading team - little chance of a swing|pg||
nt|algraves: he can guess the clubs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar asked : normal stayman auction, answer yes|pg||
nt|algraves: but only two will still see him home 3 in each red , 2 clubs and a spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|udo: 3 NT looks quite normal,,but i cant see 9 trciks|pg||
nt|udo: after @S lead|pg||
nt|udo: a,i see, @H  come in|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, a @d to the Ace then @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Lucky @d break in an odd way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well if he finds the diamond position he just plays on hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as usual I am last of 3 at typing|pg||
nt|udo: this @D break has its advantage,,u see  first round there is no future|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: 5@c seems OK|pg||
nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
nt|algraves: some how it is always hard for the defense to hold these to 9 tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|algraves: well they the full 20 for their slam try auction|pg||
nt|rv: I am told that it used to that each player needs to play 33% of boards in finals till recently, of late rules have changed and it is 33% of cumulative boards across all k/o matches|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i lefy CR after a club lead- Rosenberg was in deep thought|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact he may get home even if @ds are 4-2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves: so he guessses clubs straight away|pg||
nt|tlc: he still has to guess whether to drop the doubleton K or to pin the 9 tho|pg||
nt|algraves: so no he has 9 with spades still to be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes last set... and the table was slow...this set looks like flying|pg||
nt|algraves: well, he wont go wrong there east could have Q9xx|pg||

nt|toral5: yes and almost as gud as 0-3/4 hcps|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Roland - absolut normal to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C better than 5@D as 2nd spade ruff with 10@C holds|pg||
nt|rmb1: This has play, take two ruffs and draw trumps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: the Rosenblum and McConnell teams are playing the same boards, ostensibly at the same time, but the Rosenblum Teams play 15 boards a session and the McConnell 16 boards|pg||
pc|c7|nt|algraves: i mean the opps have 27 - 29 hcp , everything is breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: McConnell = women's event|pg||
nt|jtr: As long as they cant cash the @d and a @s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: and the @hs behave of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now the surprise|pg||
pc|d7|nt|algraves: now meckstroth wants to play the next club from hand in case west has K9x|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jkotor: IMO he can double for T/O, @h jump will correct to NT|pg||
nt|dburn: this is presumably because the women have time for 16 boards in two and a half hours, while the men can manage only about 11|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: not plain sailing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness-Helgemo vs Pachtman-Ginossar|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|algraves: so an imp riding on Rodwells play of trumps|pg||
pc|s7|nt|swanson: Pass is possible because 1@C is forcing, but that is far from a guarantee that North will find it easier to describe his hand later.|pg||
nt|ady: needs care|pg||

mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|norby: like 3 diamonds and not 3 hearts because hearts 5-0?????lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: we are having a very flat session til now,this brd no exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thought for a while and dbled|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nickell piling it on on every board|pg||
nt|ady: was not straaight forward    |pg||
nt|algraves: and it is now increasingly ancient history|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: may be end|pg||
nt|jkotor: just have to jump|pg||
nt|udo: some specs point out ,hamman hates @D s,,,:)) so maybe therefore @h-play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: now 3@h - 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Game is iffy to bid here after 1NT.  Hamman can show a good spade hand by bidding at the three level over Zia's xfer, but will Zia go on?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some might have passed with Zia's hand - Hamman will smile|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe 3@d :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think North will stop below game whatever South does|pg||
nt|swanson: How big can his smile be, though?|pg||
nt|jkotor: "i d like, but i m affraid"|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|toral5: simple straight bidding in the other room cos north passed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|5|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: zia-hamman started very well this set|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: well predicted|pg||
nt|yuval10: big result to Wolfson in the CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are thinking for 10 mins and then they arte throwing the cards on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT forces 3@C, unless doubler is strong, then he ignores the transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: seems like second transfer|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@H is a retransfer.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H may be re-transfer|pg||
nt|tlc: well done to get to the cold (albeit lucky) 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: this game is cold even if N would find the very inspired K@c lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't|pg||
nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what Ginossar intended to do if Pachtman had actually bid 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: after N opened 2@s, it seem illogical to finesse to the T in that suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: in @h rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: good players tend not to open weak 2's with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asked earlier for the session times to be changed and it seems the wish was granted|pg||
nt|algraves: well it seems he wants to get on @H straight away and if they are good for 5 tricks, then just give up a @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play Lebensohl by a passed hand then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing much to think about here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: can i tell him?|pg||
nt|algraves: anything but hearts from the top is illogical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you must tell him in Hebrew, Traian. Is that a challenge?|pg||
nt|algraves: my Hebrew is weak but I can call a lifeline|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: huge for me....i do speak the language|pg||
nt|rv: 2@C is fourth suit game force (FSGF)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: cant Zia ruff a 2nd spade with 10C   and draw trumps?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Not sure.  We knew where @CJ was|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: cards stil on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand|pg||
nt|toral5: helness thinking of a possibility of trump promotion|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks no problems here with friendly oppo|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson 100% for NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: But he ended up playing for @CJ with West (or guessing to drop @CJx with East)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|toral5: incase helgemo raised with aq|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL I have about six words of Hebrew|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, at this point it looks like a final between Diamond and Nickell, but still time for their opponents to come back|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|algraves: not comletely cold form Greco point of view and moreover an imp here or there can decide match|pg||
nt|algraves: so he wants 9 and then more than 9|pg||
nt|norby: the bidding 3nt is 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|norby: in this case 4-2-5-2|pg||
nt|norby: 2nt is relais with stop in club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no 100% line. He doesn't know that diamonds come in|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the cameraman trying to film greco's card..but they are folded under the table lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: greco's cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, he would just set up the missing tricks in spades|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Greco will start with @SK and if ducked will shift his attention to @h suit?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Jim types faster as well as commentating better|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: too fast for me :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hand shown|pg||
nt|rv: so much for my prediction:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: You can call Yuval, he is nearby|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|swanson: A heart lead would have defeated 4@H because the discard must be taken immediatly - the East can ruff the third round.|pg||
nt|rmb1: East must play a diamond now as the defence's only source of tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rmb1: Enough for five tricks?  I am asked.  Declarer has entry problems, may not get to enjoy the spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: can transfer any message via juniors' friends, which are also playing at the same time the world championship for juniors' teams|pg||
nt|algraves: so Rodwell will switch to clubs and hold this to three|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i missed the NOT...i do not speak the language|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then I am not sure you qualify as our operator :)|pg||
nt|algraves: this may be a long set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck said sorry.. and he is taking his ahare of the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manual for Vugraph Operators, page 17, paragraph 5, lines 8 and 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: share|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps west will help meck out and just claim ...|pg||
nt|algraves: I have thought that some variation of the chess clock principle but where it applies to total team time at all 4 seats|pg||
nt|algraves: not including system explanantions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: funny enough the director kept last set the exact time of each pair|pg||
nt|algraves: so you have a total team time of say 2hrs|pg||
nt|tlc: If Joey were the Operator, could he just yell NEXT at the appropriate time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now..who want to know the result?|pg||
nt|algraves: so that takes into account that NS and EW may have much different problems|pg||
nt|algraves: and if you have a very fast pair , well that helps if you have a very slow pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes and greco-hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: and vice versa|pg||
nt|algraves: so after you play you hit the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess you could only do it during the play|pg||
nt|algraves: but that would be a big help|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@c discard looks logical|pg||
nt|kareno: Many years ago, when he was sstill a student at MIT, I asked Mark Feldman what he was thinking about on every bid and play.  He told me he was reviewing every hand he had ever ...|pg||
nt|kareno: played for solutions.  And he was serious!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he will play spades|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tlc: will be surprised if the @C queen isnt played as well|pg||
pc|d7|nt|odysseus69: this is exactly the type of board you want when sitting on a lead|pg||
nt|norby: i like diamond and diamond|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves: yes best not to make predictions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No danger any more as @HA is an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all laughing now....|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|ady: lot of talk from specks   about hand 19     Zia played high trump early from hand  -  maybe better to not touch trumps early   A@S   and ruff a spade  and then diamond finesse   ...|pg||
nt|ady: and if tghe play goes the same way   diamond back   ruff another spade with 10C    then has ace and another club to draw trumps  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Rosenberg made 3NT on 19 - |pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves: so his sequence of cards suggests 6 to QJ98|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzta: Helness said TOUGH TO BEAT and all laughed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Live streaming video will be back for the final tomorrow. 4 segments of 16 boards|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Cool feature, hope you agree|pg||
nt|algraves: so he will make 5 |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|rmb1: I know @C6 is an entry but he has to knock out @CJ and @SA first,|pg||
nt|algraves: so rodwell has no losing play and declarer should claim 3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|rmb1: I think East had to play @H when in with @CJ|pg||
nt|algraves: this shows the " power of the closed hand" in that defense had very hard time discarding on this |pg||

nt|kareno: Lucky Rodwell \:)|pg||
nt|algraves: best defense is 500 against 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Pachtman thinking THESE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM US|pg||
nt|algraves: but west may remove double to 2!|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S |pg||
nt|tlc: same auction to this point in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves: so practically speaking best to collect undertricks at 100 per|pg||
nt|rv: playing std 2/1, Rodwell's hand would be considered too strong for splinter (10-12 is preferred range), playing precision 13-15 makes more sense|pg||
nt|rv: Meck's 4@s is kickback asking for keys|pg||
nt|rv: they play suit above agreed suit as RKC at 4 level:)|pg||
mb|5D|an|alerted|nt|algraves: anyone balance out there with double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: nope discretion the better part of valour|pg||
nt|tlc: at MPs maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously Rodwell intended to pass any response but this is the one he really hoped to hear I would guess|pg||
mb|6H|nt|swanson: 2NT probably shows a maximum spade hand with two honor and three cards in spades.|pg||
nt|toral5: should he hook @H here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: rod could have KQJx/Jxxx/K/KQJx|pg||
nt|rv: 5@d must be asking for specific kings, 5@C would be trump queen ask which Meck has  in any case|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: right on Karen|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Routine here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 easy tricks - no options for anything else|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is routine hand . on the Last hand our world champion suggest 3 rounds @D then 4th @D if no Jack as the 8 of @C a strong card|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's jump to 6@h shows no kings|pg||
nt|norby: good bidding , easy and effective|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck saying TOO MANY KINGS|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5dia asks 0 or 3|pg||
nt|algraves: then you can wait with many options|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rd was asking for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 5d|pg||
nt|algraves: imp riding on the lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|norby: probabily 4 spades is ask for aces.......|pg||
nt|algraves: no only 6 always|pg||
nt|norby: and 4nt is 3 aces|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jkotor: why 3@h now if anyway 3nt?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you have to say, this is a bit of a silly contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: needs to guess the red finesse|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: noone can explain what happened here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, North has implied majors too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rodwell could have been 4450, no reason to re-open|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell went to the bathroom|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|algraves: well sometimes they are in big trouble and you have more high cards than they do. so you might get a penalty or a partscore swing|pg||
nt|robinswr: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|norby: of course 0 or 3|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|norby: but meck think or hope 3:-))|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would think 5sp asks for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: mack : i am making six ...just looking for the other trick|pg||

nt|kareno: Yes, even with diamond queen duplicated.  Just check for aces.|pg||
nt|passell: yes after a forcing raise west will find out about short spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|bessi2: 3@s any shortness I am guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: Confirmed by spec|pg||
nt|passell: with all the controls I prefer to ask with west hand instead of telling|pg||
nt|bessi2: east has a powerhouse vs a minor shortness.. vill verify that before checking aces and blasting to slam|pg||
nt|kareno: And we expect this will be a push at 6@h|pg||
nt|passell: yes  east will have to hope for a club control|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: katz and platnick writing back and forth but i can't read it|pg||
nt|bessi2: and depending upon their agreements whether west can also hold a King along with 3 aces with a splinter in which case east will check for the grand.. |pg||
nt|kareno: Do you need a periscope in there?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: i need players who write bigger|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|bessi2: however..not many bid splinter with such strong hands so west can hardly hold a King also|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|passell: 4spades is blwd perhaps|pg||
nt|bessi2: Platnick procedes with caution.. after all.. they could still easily be missing AK of clubs.. unless 4@s is rkcb ofc|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|an|0 or 3 key cards|nt|passell: I think it is blwd|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|vugraphztb: yes|pg||

nt|passell: signing off if zero|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Ahhh, for the possible zero that is impossible :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: west if forced to slam with 3.. and bid 6h to deny the Q of hearts i presume|pg||
nt|passell: he would have shown a king with 3|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: kqjx xxxx x kqjx|pg||

nt|odysseus69: i think its "white cliffs" as the local cockneys say|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He "knows" spades are 4-2 after the double so the finesse seems called for|pg||
nt|robinswr: and 4diamonds rkc if clubs are trump|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Yes, there is a risk but it is surely with the odds to finesse|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kareno: I usually try 'one down' when I'm aboutt five down :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@S 4-card support with a min balanced hand|pg||
nt|udo: all kings and queens North/East|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1h- t/fer= 2 spades - a weak NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 2@S was too high I think|pg||
nt|norby: kickback is convention at 4 spades|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: According to the Rule of 15, Helness has an opener. HCP + spades must add up to at least 15 if you go by Pesrson's Rule|pg||
nt|toral5: match getting closer now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pearson's|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: 4@S   looks 1 over the top |pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Without the redouble 2@S would be invitational; now it is preemptive.|pg||
nt|algraves: on the claim, Hampson told Meck that there was no chance for extra spade trick KQ< KQX of HX south|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the lead|pg||
nt|jkotor: no K|pg||
nt|jkotor: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will not be sticking their necks out during the auction now, after the previous good results.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: everyone stares at the dummy|pg||
nt|ady: a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|algraves: lucky 6|pg||
nt|tlc: finally an easy hand for everyone...altho only 5 was made at the other table|pg||
nt|udo: yes, with all finesses wrong looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: The try looks dubious facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the good old days this would have been a passout. 12 aceless 4333 was no opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1892|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia waiting for hamman to lead|pg||
nt|jtr: @c lead may help a little|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to David Birman|pg||
nt|davidb: hi  again |pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: On a serious note, it is no crime to pass the East hand in 1st vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|udo: maybe that lead helps in @c, but still down , imo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i lost the play... i had to close the screen|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think they lead the 10 from this holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Ginossar went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and i had to protect the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: might've played @d to the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky zia claimed quickly 2 down|pg||
nt|udo: since the round of last 16,,when u go to restroom, u get an bodyguard:))|pg||
nt|jtr: A couple of singles passed the slips for Wolfson|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all of those weaned on weak nt would not consider a move over 2 spades- |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west is back now|pg||
nt|udo: playing weak NT it goes prob. 1NT pass pass pass|pg||
nt|rv: here Hampson's X shows primary @c+@hs possibly, 2n would have primary @cs+@ds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rmb1: Back now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|odysseus69: on the surface e-w cards look good for 4 hearts - but the 4-1 trump break means curtains - kind of game everyone is bidding|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|algraves: Yes I guess it is possible to misquess diamonds if west plays low and you put in ten|pg||
nt|kareno: Only way I can see making only five is with Ace and a diamond led.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 probably the right card though|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps..actually the percentage play|pg||
nt|algraves: 9|pg||
nt|rv: good stop though even this might be too high on trump shift now|pg||
nt|algraves: so even with a trump switch Hampson can guess @H for three tricks and down one losing trick in each suit|pg||
nt|athene: trump shift is very good, kills two possible tricks in dummy (ruff, @DK)|pg||
nt|norby: somepeople prefere 3 club at double over 2 spades, but double is perfect bidding for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck in the tank now|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding is revealing - they know north has something like 7411|pg||
nt|algraves: a " bad buy " as they say for Hampson|pg||
nt|rv: I like X to show @c+@hs and 2n to show @cs+@ds|pg||
nt|algraves: picture Greco with @C K and @H Q|pg||
nt|athene: if the double shows hearts and clubs, maybe south should bid 2nt, saying "i am not sure if we want to play clubs or diamonds"|pg||
nt|athene: i am just looking for ways to play 3@C rather than forcing yourself unnecessarily to 4@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: well i have a feeling they have discussed this and that 3@D is the bid that is in compliance with the partnership agreement|pg||
nt|norby: club is the best come back|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table...stil thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: while we are waiting. a lot of messages on the auction. Hampson was prepared to show a strong @C overcall|pg||
pc|c9|nt|toral5: cd easily have been an ALL PASS brd:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|toral5: helness did wel to open here as the cards lie|pg||
nt|algraves: he was always willing to " bid it out to 4@C" looking for the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|rv: good defense|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|tlc: wins with QT or AT on, only loses to AQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzta: east thinking|pg||
nt|ady: if the spades were played as shown this nearly slipped through|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thinking some more|pg||
nt|rmb1: East can see cards are not good for declarer, but still anything could be the wrong thing to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is getting very impatient now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: writing notes to the cameraman...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east put the cards on the table and thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia shaking his had |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: head|pg||
nt|algraves: sorry not vul but looking for game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play again, but Zia says nasty, nasty|pg||
nt|jkotor: easy -1 now, everything clear|pg||
nt|swanson: Zia needs both club honors (3-3) to his left - with than assumption the @SK is almost certainly offside.|pg||
nt|jkotor: only chance for E is AK@c in partners hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia leads a low club to the queen and it wins|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rv: folks on North's double, do you prefer some form of sohl by South hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least he can't get hearts wrong as the 10 drops if he plays to the jack. No entry to dummy to get it wrong later|pg||
nt|norby: now play diamond hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: well he can play low to 9 as well|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|norby: and after ace of diamond play ace of spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|yuval10: with ATX it doesn't matter..... you lose 2 @d's anyway|pg||

nt|reisig: I thought T/O was std :)|pg||
nt|passell: yes  a popular usage|pg||
nt|kareno: Richie, it isn't standard you know :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I think we saw it as penalty yesterday one segment.|pg||
nt|passell: not even a trump switch will beat this|pg||
nt|bessi2: to pretty standard from my neck of the woods.. but not sure I would have bid it with that hand|pg||
nt|kareno: That's yet another issue.|pg||
nt|passell: yes I agree wrong shape and wrong point range|pg||
nt|passell: hard to get partner to compete in spades when it is right|pg||
nt|bessi2: no way to misguess hearts for 2 losers.. so looks like just made. declarer losing a trick in each suit|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|passell: yes even a misguess the 10 of hearts falls|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bessi2: unless heart to jack and queen and a heart back. could misguess it such a situation possibly..|pg||
nt|passell: yes  the ole sucker play|pg||

nt|bessi2: West|pg||

nt|yuval10: don't think 3@d will confuse NS much|pg||

mb|2H|nt|bt: an interesting hand coming up, , can ns make 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2NT = @D ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what else?|pg||
nt|stoffers: Looks like 9 tricks in either @h or @s here, even only 8 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they make 3?|pg||
nt|bt: helgemo has a tough choice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||
nt|stoffers: he had to bid like he did i guess|pg||

nt|yuval10: then S can cuebid and show his great hand against @s suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell writing a book for pachtman |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that Rodwell erred when he covered @C10. That is not correct, it does not matter. The error came when Meck tried to cash @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: His opener was not a thing of beauty|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: some wouldnt open the south hand, i hear :-)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble is that he might bid 2NT here with shape and little values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, AKQxxx you can show when asked after a weak 2. It's a rare bird but here it is|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tlc: surprised no 4@d cue|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

nt|jkotor: 2@c|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5NT 2 keycards outside diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@c now asks non @d kings, but 6@d would ask for @c help specifically|pg||
nt|algraves: east cant lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
nt|udo: work in 5 hours:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: or  Hvor er din åbningshånd, makker?|pg||
nt|bt: there is a subtle squeeze on east in pointed suit but thats after going one down already|pg||
nt|stoffers: I am surprised that one of the world's best players gets it for his light opening. I think he has played more hands than us together and have an idea of whats best in the long run. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the one you had when you opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nope... english plain|pg||
nt|stoffers: I wouldnt open, but its a border hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now...thinking|pg||
nt|bt: sorry, but i didnt hear anyone critizising|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness I mean|pg||
nt|bt: its a fact that players like meckwell make a good living on light openers|pg||

nt|odysseus69: mmmm|pg||
nt|swanson: The problem is they won't be able to improve on the result.|pg||
nt|bt: i would think ns at the other table would bid similarily|pg||

nt|athene: one point worth a mention is hampson's choice of 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are gathering speed here|pg||
nt|rv: this is not Buffett Cup scoring still 1 IMP may just be crucial in final analysis:)|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a GF balanced hand it can work much better to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thats wonderful|pg||
mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|jkotor: 4@d and what after 4@s?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: desperate measures- but even then 7 spades is so much|pg||
nt|algraves: you know edgar Kaplan did an exhaustive study and found that big club pairs slam bidding was better if the opponents got into your auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 1@H-D-2H-2S maybe|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4 to zimmerman on 22, where i think 2@h is a much better bid than 1NT. Quite deserved then..:)|pg||
nt|algraves: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: in R-M precision it just shows clubs or balanced, might be only 2 clubs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: we can all see 7@S makes, but it is going to be very difficult even to get to six|pg||
nt|swanson: It is possible that N-S will push to a grand, knowing they are behind big time.  But the bidding is starting at a high level.  |pg||
nt|bt: 1@H-D-2@H-2@S i mean lol|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@S/5@D save in picture;but 5@H also making|pg||
nt|stoffers: will Helgemo bid 2@s?|pg||
nt|bt: well i would think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: he just did|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: 6 at least now|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d X 4@d X at other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 7 card fit in all of West's suits|pg||
nt|odysseus69: laydown game on minimal values|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: both tables at least in 6|pg||
nt|stoffers: Note Helness double here, if he is gonna pull a 2@c bid for Geir to 2@d, it wouldnt show extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: down 2 = 300/450|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You were wrong re 23, Lars. Brogeland passed the South cards|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a game force you should never bid 1spade over 1 heart with only four spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|swanson: A big bid by Zia.  He was evidently planning to bid 4@S over 4@H.  But would that show another place to play or would it be a strong had with spades?|pg||
nt|swanson: hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double showed spades|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell 1n shows 11-13 here?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|toral5: may be a namyat 4@C would have shut out north from entering|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jkotor: both tables in 5@d NS now :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will they know what 4NT means - time for spades now|pg||
nt|kareno: \i didn't know that.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in game now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|toral5: but strul did wel to bid 5@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jkotor: 6@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: both|pg||
nt|swanson: This would be uncharted waters for most partnerships.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if South bids 5@S now, North may well bid 7 - no, 6@C |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzta: not finished|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was more positive than pass- enough for Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman looking for action...asking questions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment hamman writing stuff for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|norby: yes 11-13 bal|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|swanson: Now 6@S and then 7@S?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: time for spaes now|pg||
nt|bt: aha ... lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he passed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only hopr for defence is if Zia decides to play anti-odds for K doubleton club with West - no chance really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is too flat to act|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|algraves: game bidding harder|pg||
nt|rv: now defense can cash 8 black suit tricks|pg||
nt|norby: club now or never...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: surely this must be a 2-suiter  |pg||
nt|jtr: He will eliminate first|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jkotor: for a push|pg||
nt|rv: Greco's @d3 would be some form of smith echo?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: 7@S not super after the 3@D bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can establish a third club trick but no entries|pg||
nt|jtr: So losing to Kx wont matter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Jack for spade switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not yet|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: last pass from Hamman was very quick- should have at least given it a thought|pg||
nt|swanson: Evidently Hamman knew how little Zia might have for the auction.  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: not good at all except that it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia unwrapped another cough drop before the dummyhit the table|pg||
nt|jkotor: what if Zia have: QJxx xxx x AQTxx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East and West get some water while Zia contemplates the hand|pg||
nt|swanson: But maybe he could hold: xxxx, Qx, x, AQJxxx?  Nothing is clear after the 3@D opening.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||
nt|swanson: He had something to say about Philadelphia also.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: contrary to popular belief in constructive auctions Zia usually has his bid - he embarks on some psychological adventures but they are the exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wouldn't W.C. Fields rather be here in Philadelphia?|pg||
nt|pelu: EW in 4@S over 4@H in CR|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@sX|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Yes, they did get to 4@H regardless, but East 'saved'|pg||
nt|toral5: this means it wil be a small pick up for struls team|pg||
nt|norby: finesse in hearts for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: with diamonds 3-3  will make   |pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: Diamonds carefully from the right hand|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|nt|ady: but will cash diamond and exit with club      |pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: he couldn't have possibly asked for @h continuation if they are playing rev smith echo (lo-hi in declarer's suit asks partner to continue)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pc|c5|nt|algraves: so he cant quite handle it at this point|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: I think that's what he said about dying....|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rmb1: Roland described Bocchi commentating today as a "scoop"|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he intended @d3 as asking for @c shift since @h continuation can't be right with @hAKQ9 in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did and I mean it|pg||
nt|norby: scoop??|pg||
nt|rv: Geoff possibly misread the signal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, don't you understand that word?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a compliment|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is notoriously difficult to defend if no suits have been mentioned - here we see it's even hard when the bidding has been a bit more revealing|pg||
nt|norby: of course|pg||
nt|rmb1: Oops - was private|pg||
nt|norby: like italian, same word sccoop|pg||
nt|rv: Norby commenting here is like Nadal commenting on Federer in Wimbledon final:)|pg||

nt|swanson: His tombstone reads somthing like: on the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: boards running out...|pg||

nt|kareno: No|pg||
nt|algraves: he needed diamonds 3-2 |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|vugraphzta: rodwell had the paper in his pocket|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: this really has to be a flat board- he needed to underlead the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W are not feeling so comfortable as they were early in the set - they have given back at least a couple game swings.|pg||
nt|jkotor: meckwell need swings, lets wait for their move|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 IMPs to Strul on board 23   200 + 200|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Greco|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: all laughing about Helness diamond suit|pg||
nt|ady: been asked if Zia can open 1@D  anyone know|pg||
nt|algraves: it is critical to make a play now based on some view of where you can take 3 more tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: i made an extensive analysis|pg||

nt|stoffers: Hehe, i didnt, i saw it before :)|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 6@C coming up now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had|pg||
nt|algraves: so a NT partscore for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meck|pg||
nt|tlc: a kibitzer mentioned that Helness played this in 5@h and got a @H lead!  still guessed it right|pg||
mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|mdgraham: reckon they will have cause to regret board 21  |pg||
nt|toral5: lucky i wd say|pg||
nt|algraves: he would have eventully switched to @D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: He never gets to play in his solid suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's better than 50%|pg||
nt|bt: minor suit slams are not the strength of standard systems imho|pg||
nt|rv: possibly @DT as well|pg||
mb|d|an|alerted|nt|Walddk4: Why is that lucky?|pg||
nt|toral5: very thin 1@H here|pg||
nt|davidb: something to say against leading low from  3 small in this typical situation .|pg||
nt|norby: play king of hearts, make 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@hD = 800 :)|pg||
nt|bt: 4@H cue stands out, and is strangely symmetric|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: West could D = extra vaues - and East could pass|pg||
nt|ady: North happy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for sure|pg||
nt|tlc: bd 26|pg||
nt|kareno: Ira Rubin used to call notrumps, "grabbits,"  first to bid them grabs them :)|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|vugraphzta: Zia waggled the one spade bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 4@H = i have extras, hearts controlled and am interested in higher, could that be wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room is being broadcasted in the VG theatre|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so we have a lot of cameras around us|pg||
nt|stoffers: I think most top pairs wil reach 6@c on this hand. So many points and trumps together. Hard to find out its on a finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Certain symmetry.  East has AQ... in South's suit, so bids the suit that North has AQ.... and noone can bid any more|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: and 2 cameramans|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: problem w 3@S is that it is ambigious|pg||
nt|toral5: most pairs will surely land in 6@C|pg||
nt|toral5: atleast the top ones|pg||
nt|stoffers: går an å spille på ja|pg||
nt|rv: 1@C is strong @c, double by Meckstorth shows 5-8 in classical precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Sry, that was private, meaning he COULD go down playing N for K@h and Q@s|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H by west wd have made life easy for becker i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I assume 2@H agrees clubs without 4 spades, so 3@S is not natural, is it?|pg||
nt|toral5: 6@C does have a play.he might play for a vienna coup on north|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i did not notice an alert|pg||
nt|toral5: and as the cards are the roof will fall|pg||
nt|toral5: with @S q IN|pg||
nt|bt: thats a good point, the devious 1@H may lead him wrong|pg||
nt|bt: when south has @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, a losing option|pg||
nt|toral5: and full chances to go wrong cos of THAT super thin 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: after the bidding is best chance the sueeeze when S show @DA - but will Strul play for that?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker still thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy for us to see what's right because we have all 52 cards to look at|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and stil thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hear that Kit Woolsey got it wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He played for the squeeze|pg||
nt|toral5: did kit recieve a 1@H oc?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: 2nt opening is 19-20|pg||
nt|algraves: no big deal but note that the overcall by Hampson did not hurt their bidding gave away information|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|rv: folks who themselves play precision generally don't like to Intefere with artificial methods like CRASH/Suction against others who play precision, possibly some sympathy for ...|pg||
nt|rv: comrades:)|pg||
nt|norby: more easy after 1 heart overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: does greco have singleton heart honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell stil thinking|pg||
nt|norby: i dont understand why greco dont bidding 2 diamond.......|pg||
nt|rv: I believe Greco-Hampson play Mathe against strong @c, Hampson could have doubled to show majors|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|toral5: ouch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: EW had it all to themselves in that room|pg||
nt|bt: winning imps against robinson, lol|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 25 only 4 out of 8 pairs bid the fine 6@c - not top-standard :(|pg||
nt|rv: he chose to bid 1@h and hide his @s suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: this will need some play|pg||
nt|jkotor: I think Cayne 14 imps behind after board 25, other Polish (Balicki-Zmudzinski) with Lauria-Versace trying hard|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are way too high - but there was little chance of stopping in time.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant make 4 spades whatever defence does|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia explaining that he can bid 1 NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is why he wiggled or waggled the 1 @S bid|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|bt: some suffer after 1@D-(1@S) when 2@C is not forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul did not play but Helgemo already preapred diamond ace for play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Woolsey opened a Precision 2@C and then North was out of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: prepared|pg||
nt|bt: what was explanation of 4NT?|pg||
nt|davidb: entry problem for finessing twice|pg||
pc|s8|nt|swanson: The lack of spade spots meant there was little play and with unfavorable diamond situation this will be down several.|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jtr: This wont look easy from declarer's point of view|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: do not know|pg||
nt|toral5: 4nt alerted as?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: it was alerted|pg||
nt|norby: with the cards of hampson i prefere bid heart and spades , like 2 club or double against club strong or PASS|pg||
pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: needs 6  trump tricks but  not quite possible|pg||
nt|norby: is strange that me and the pair american play so different:-))))|pg||

pc|d2|pg||

nt|rv: if you have to get in, I much prefer double to show majors|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: 3 more tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d7|nt|jtr: Oh|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|toral5: becker surely dint take it as rkcb in @C in leiu of bidding 5c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe club to jack?|pg||
nt|jtr: Mind you South cant attack @ds to advanat|pg||
nt|jtr: advantage|pg||
nt|jtr: As finesses are taken into him|pg||
nt|algraves: so this reveals all to Rodwell who now knows entire shape|pg||
pc|hA|nt|swanson: I am told that GIB says it can be made - but GIB has the hand record.|pg||
nt|kareno: Ten of hearts looked like suit preference.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves: as Hampson did not continue diamond he had only one|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bt: some wise commentators suggested 4@H, that might have simplified things, lol|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jkotor: open cards maybe could won|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|bt: playing for the squeeze in 6@C is antipercentage but if you are down to a good team maybe its good strategy|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: if q will fal......|pg||

nt|henryb:  If South pitches 2@h, declarer can take the @c finesse, and if S pitches his clubs I think there is a double with diamonds in the middle|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|henryb:  For those looking at a DD solver, start a high heart, and then check|pg||

pc|s8|nt|bessi2: though I suspect they might open 3@d in the open room|pg||
nt|kareno: This lead might convince declarer to go after trumps quickly to his detriment.|pg||
nt|passell: yes this could get ugly|pg||
nt|kareno: The pitch on spades is in the wrong hand so it cannot make anyway I think.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: but 3n can|pg||

pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: West has no problem finding 5 discards so this must be 1 down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|algraves: he want to signal diamond thru|pg||

nt|rmb1: Zia has had some awful hands this segment|pg||
nt|algraves: so technically excellent all around|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|ady: 2 tens spoil a perfect hand for Zia|pg||
nt|tlc: anyone open 2@h with E's hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|jkotor: seems to be close finish|pg||
nt|stoffers: Who uses penalty doubles in the passout seat anymore? Noone i know|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 1NT that is|pg||
nt|bt: the west hand used to be a automatic double, i dont know what the world is coming to|pg||
nt|ady: might be in dummy trick 1|pg||
nt|algraves: note Hampson staying awake to play K of @s which made it too danerous for Rodwell not to cash out|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzta: Helness asking Becker about leads|pg||
nt|toral5: north has 9 tricks if he BOLDLY guesses @C,else hapy with 8|pg||
nt|pelu: down 4 or winning - all on the @S-layout |pg||
nt|toral5: he will surely hook @S for 120|pg||
nt|rmb1: He will be please to put it down as dummy and find something to read|pg||
nt|ady: could have been a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman: Thank you partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: This match looked absolutely hopeless for Nickell then boards ago and yet it is down to the wire.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Polite as ever|pg||
nt|ady: thank you very much indeed partner|pg||
nt|kareno: Not I.  3 at a different vulnerability perhaps.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|algraves: it is critical to find a relaxed attention at the table. awake but not uptight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you stop short of game here? The answer is probably that you don't|pg||
nt|algraves: and then ride that energy , like a horse|pg||
nt|norby: 2 hearts??|pg||
nt|athene: nice 3@H, taking lots of important bidding room away from west|pg||
nt|norby: vulnerable?|pg||
nt|rv: what would panel bid with Rodwell's hand in this one? he may bid 4@h on way to 5@d?|pg||
nt|norby: 5 cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep... that was the bid|pg||
nt|norby: no good hearts?|pg||
nt|norby: no points?|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|norby: other bridge sorry|pg||
nt|robinswr: you have to mid against meckwell or they'll steal you blind|pg||
nt|rv: Hampson's 2@h was definitely risky at these colors|pg||
nt|norby: great distribution, i forgot|pg||
mb|5D|nt|swanson: ten boards|pg||
nt|jtr: 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: I they bid it they deserve to be world champs|pg||
nt|davidb: 6NT  can be made from N |pg||
nt|algraves: welll  I wonder if they can get out in 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure he will win - but if @s-finess lose then 9 red winners for EW|pg||
nt|jtr: if|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 1@D - 2@D is a position where EW are stealing though|pg||
nt|algraves: apparently not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|toral5: yes:):(|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D will pretty much always have sound values|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: he just decided he had the most he could have for a passed hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|odysseus69: if 6NT East has to avoid diamond lead|pg||
nt|davidb: good  bidding |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: convention cards are exchanged|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia says oh, it is one of those|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 28 EW are not vulnerable - so if Meckstroth-Rodwell bid game, it is only 6 imps|pg||
nt|swanson: Hamman has shown four spades with this auction and could have held only four hearts, so Zia corrects.|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia just said 6 clubs is the spot probably|pg||
nt|jtr: now i do|pg||
nt|athene: (north decided)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|algraves: well against Meckwell in particular you do need to get your good suits in as they really like to bid the pushy 3NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: 9 of hearts suit preferance for spades|pg||
nt|athene: if east is going to bid 2nt, north wants to get a heart lead, i guess|pg||
nt|algraves: so you try and help partner with the lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately bridge scoring doesn't give a rebate for vul doubled undertricks if you are passed hand:)|pg||
nt|algraves: and Hampson does not want to wake up tomorrow wishing he had bid 2@H|pg||
nt|algraves: he would sleep OK if he went for 800|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the way he plays|pg||
nt|robinswr: amazing how often it works out that when in doubt bid|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he would just wake up tomorrow thinking " i wish partner had had better heart support for my overcall" :)|pg||
nt|algraves: or just bad luck|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rmb1: Cash AKQ to establish another winner - for defence|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: so it looks like they need to bid six |pg||
pc|d4|nt|oosmanb: 5@CX next door!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jkotor: 5@cx other room, so likely Zia has done it|pg||
nt|pelu: that hand proce whu I dont like to pen 1NT with a 5 vard major :)|pg||
nt|ady: might come to a spade|pg||
nt|rmb1: North will take any further tricks he is given!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asked me about the other matches.. lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i can not say that his level of concentration is ...lets say HIGH|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: wow -that would do |pg||
nt|odysseus69: stupidly I said "all over" and immediately the roof fell in for Martens|pg||
nt|jkotor: or rather Polish/Czech team gave it away|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards are being tossed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: salad should be tossed. Cards should be played.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia says what are you doing to me guys?|pg||
nt|swanson: It is amazing how often this type of situation happens - you have to play hard until they director refuses to give you any more hands to play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: according to north and south, Zia has taken all of the tricks, but Zia just asks if he has 5 tricks andamman confirms :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might get this right - low from doubleton on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asked about the lead and was told that his opponents lead low from doubletons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2nd/4th against suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I think it is low from a singleton, but I might be wrong on that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia is playing a diamond through Jassem|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@h other room, may be very important guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem ruffs with the king of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently they are in 2@H next door|pg||
nt|toral5: zimmerman did bid and make 6c for an 11 imp pik up|pg||
nt|pelu: new keyboard, pl, :):)|pg||
nt|kittyc: I really dislike the 1NT opener with such a suit oriented hand but almost all the players did it so what do I know|pg||
nt|toral5: and he got a @Slead in to AJ:(|pg||
nt|stoffers: He got a spadelead, and had no loosing option in play either|pg||
nt|kittyc: playing BART it is less necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking what card to play|pg||
nt|pelu: NS told him that @SQ was in S - S X a 3@S-bid - so easy win|pg||
nt|jtr: Even a @s switch beats 6NT on a non@d lead|pg||
nt|jtr: Although i am very tired|pg||
pc|h8|nt|odysseus69: thx all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all off to the other room - thanks Ala|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all good night from Philly :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia: you can cah the 9 of clubs later|pg||
nt|rmb1: Wolfson by 17, Zimmermann by 55, other match already over|pg||
nt|ady: west will likrly play a low spade   will be difficult for Hamman to get that right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|algraves: Norberto though , his partners more volatile so he would be more careful|pg||

nt|ady: get any extra points for taking last 2?|pg||

nt|ady: last board of the match    well won by Nickell|pg||
nt|kareno: Lastt hand of the set, yes?  Many thanks to our spectacular operator!!  And to the specs for keeping us honest and laughing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Thanks to David, Traian (op), WBF and USBF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: we started with 17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 31 must be the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 15 brd rounds|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahhh for the comparisons.  So we have two to go.|pg||
nt|algraves: this is a bad hand type for precision so meckstroth upgrades to a club rather than open a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: women last brd 32 our is 31|pg||
nt|norby: i appreciate hampson and greco but sometime in the bidding they have completely difference of the italian style, i understand aggressive bridge but 2 hearts is bridge poker|pg||
mb|3D|nt|stoffers: i would|pg||
nt|bt: and meckwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: and versace|pg||
nt|robinswr: on board 27 not opening 3diamonds could have cost 10 imps|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I agree |pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: east was opened a weak NT by those who could, katz passed it|pg||
nt|kareno: How silly |pg||
nt|algraves: Ew can make something |pg||
nt|algraves: so they have to compete for the partscore|pg||

nt|stoffers: Well, not much happened here, as it was tough for HH to find the @d fit|pg||
nt|kittyc: good 4H bid - kep t the oppo out|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: 4@H can make - u can pick up the @C-suit: B to K and A, 9 to 10 and Q and @C5 to finess @c&!|pg||
nt|pelu: @c6|pg||
nt|kittyc: in oher rooms south showed both suits (eg if East bids 2S then South can bid 3D)|pg||
nt|bt: thats to make 5 isnt it|pg||
nt|kareno: 64 is a better number of boards to include all the dealer and vulnerability possibilities|pg||
nt|tlc: dbl T/O|pg||
nt|rv: 1n in this position and seat is 11-13?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: around 30 hcp for e/w   but not fitting to well|pg||
nt|athene: no, 14-16|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kittyc: yes, 4 is cold|pg||
nt|rmb1: tomorrow for the semifinals ... that's today for those us in Europe (00:53 am)|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I am down the midde Canadian|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a singleton its usually right to bid over 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: heart suit worth more than 6|pg||
nt|algraves: from an earlier time|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tlc: usually showing a maximum 1@d bid|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I agree Karen seems silly of WBF to play only 60 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ok i will|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell went quietly|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzta: this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|kareno: In the ACBL we have seen the numbers of boards degraded so swiss matches are now only 6, not a good thing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: from tom we have 16 i think|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is one down at least|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H shortage - maybe both minors- |pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: can be no great swing in for this hand    so Woolfson should be through  17 imps ahead|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think East thinks that an overtrick or two here is going to win the match |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well he is thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: 3@C would have made undoubtedly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i mean tomorrow we will have 16...last day|pg||
nt|kareno: But session fees have gone UP to compensate for fewer boards :(|pg||
nt|algraves: so east is playing with the houses money as they say|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: sorry that for 11 tricks - but still a nice finess: @c5 , @c6, @c8 to setup @c4!|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|algraves: so the young israelis played well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kittyc: yes Woolsey made 5 in 5 after 2 suited bid|pg||

nt|rv: 6@d is not a good contract, but can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all of them drinking water|pg||

mb|p|nt|tlc: Thx Roland..and to Karen  and Alan..great job Traian!|pg||

nt|passell: no you are correct|pg||
nt|passell: he has to be very careful  2 rounds of dia then hearts|pg||
nt|bessi2: the most straigthforward line is 2 round of @d then 3 rounds of @h to pitch the spade then start clubs|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: needs 3rd diamond with long heart, given hearts are 5-2,  then needs something good to happen in clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm watching also live the rescue of those Chilean miners which is spectacular.|pg||
nt|passell: with the dia 10 dropping he can ruff 2 spades in the dummy|pg||
nt|passell: not so live  but thrilling|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: ah yes|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed... 2 round of diamonds notices the 10 of @d fall.. then start hearts.. he doesn't need the clubs as it turns out|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: here's the link.  Another one just came up  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/39632101 39632101|pg||

nt|passell: now he will have to guess|pg||
nt|passell: play for the dia to be a true card|pg||
nt|passell: with clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|bessi2: now he must play club to ace.. heart jack-pitch spade, club towards queen...|pg||
nt|passell: yes  |pg||
nt|bessi2: they can force dummy then but then can crossruff|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|s9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|dA|mc|11|nt|Walddk4: There is another swing coming I predict|pg||

nt|norby: after overcall spades i think the best line is 2 trumps and 3 round of hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set. Next in 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|alerted|nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Traian, our terrific operator in Philadelphia!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our many excellent commentators|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H strongish balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-13 balanced|pg||
nt|algraves: 6NT has 12 top tricks|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|algraves: 6 @D, and 2 in every other suit|pg||
nt|athene: you can make 7nt can't you? backward finesse in clubs and then heart-club squeeze :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|4H|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|4N|an|1|nt|Zmud99: 2@H : 12-14 without a 5 cards suit|pg||
nt|robinswr: 6hearts is a bad contract since you could go down if hearts 4-1|pg||
nt|norby: i say goodbye at all the kibbitzer , and only small goodbye at my friends commentator ........|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: thanks all|pg||
nt|algraves: but it is more normal it seems to play in the safety of the strong @D since cannot verify @S situation|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|norby: better 6 diamonds but not easy|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|algraves: @H is to be avoided as trumps since you can go down on bad trump break with 6NT or 6@D cold|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the lesson of this hand, dont be too quick to play 4 4 major in 6 or 7|pg||
nt|algraves: if you have the tricks elsewhere|pg||
nt|algraves: for all you writing in saying 6NT is down on spade lead, look again you have 2 spade tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson in the tank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: While they are on a break in the Rosenblum Cup, enjoy the youngsters at the two tables we have up now. Israel v Russia, quarter-final in the Under 26 event|pg||
nt|algraves: geesh|pg||
nt|algraves: we are not sure what all the bidding meant but presumably they are  so we can just wait|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|algraves: well well|pg||
nt|algraves: Meckstroth " punting " on opening lead|pg||
nt|rv: 4@h is kickback, 4n showed 1 key, 5@h asks for specific kinhs and 6@C showed only @cK|pg||
nt|rv: KINGS|pg||
nt|robinswr: make safe lead against grand assuming you're sure they not off ace|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: on 4n, 5@C by Hampson would be asking for @dQ, 5@d is to play, 5@h is to ask for specific kings|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|s5|nt|norby: ace king of hearts and all the squeeze with queen of club in east|pg||
nt|robinswr: he would never make this in a million years unless he had the hand record|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|h2|nt|algraves: so a potential big swing to Nickell because this is not going to make|pg||
nt|norby: win queen second in hearts or amany position with queen of club in east|pg||
nt|rv: Nickell in 6@d in CR on brd 31|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|algraves: potential big swing to Nickell as this is not going to make of course|pg||
nt|rv: potentially 2 huge swing boards in last 2 deals of this set|pg||
nt|norby: with overcall spades? |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|norby: noooooooooooooooo|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 down. The winning line is double dummy as Steve said|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: it is a make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a heart, Traian|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Really??|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: truuuuuuuuuuuuuust me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wooooooooooooooow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure|pg||
nt|norby: director sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell just left the room in disgust|pg||
nt|rv: has Rodwell just thrown Rosenblum Cup down?:)|pg||
nt|norby: bad explanation 4 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: just kidding, still a long way to go though this could be crucial in the final analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the TD asks why?|pg||
mc|13|nt|norby: sureeeeeeeeeee director, for you rodwell discard q of hearts in this situation???????????????|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, see you later|pg||
nt|rv: this is the only major bridge event missing in trophy cabinet of Nickell team, maybe the jinx continues:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: in 55 minutes or so|pg||
nt|rv: thanks all, pls stay on for this exciting match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't forget the juniors!|pg||

mb|4C|nt|robinswr: 4diamonds shows this hand in standard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And Greco was also on his way down when an accident happened|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|kareno: I hear there's a director call about the auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: shows 4 hearts 6 good diamonds and game force|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: can you tell us about the accident |pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|nt|robinswr: rodwell pitched the q of hearts in the endgame|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hampson was declarer, sorry|pg||
nt|robinswr: don't know why experts don't play 4spades rkc when hearts are trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north played 7@D on an unrevealing auction (he hadn't shown heart length); he took the best line of cashing the top hearts and running the diamonds, hoping for @CQ onside and a ...|pg||
nt|athene: squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: at the end west had to discard from @HQ @CQxxx|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: There is apparently some question about whether the auction was unrevealing.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, and if Hampson's shape had been 1-2-6-4 it is correct to pitch a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe Rodwell was misinformed, we don't know|pg||
nt|robinswr: i wonder what 4 clubs is here|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz "we may belong higher and not in hearts"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All we know is that Rodwell left the room in disgust according to our operator|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Anyway, thanks all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|kareno: See you all then |pg||
nt|robinswr: the score is 20 if it is different then the director made a ruling against ns|pg||
nt|murat e: biri piki öbürü körü taþþaðýmý da trefliyi ha|pg||
nt|robinswr: south was telling west what the bids mean|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you play 4spades rkc for hearts, you can bid 5diam asking for the queen over the 5club (1 key) response|pg||
nt|robinswr: and if you play that 5spades (4nt then 5nt) doesn't promise all the keys you can try for different strains|pg||
nt|robinswr: 7diamonds made when rodwelll pitched his queen of hearts in the 4-card ending|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2hearts was artificial showing a balanced hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think 4hearts was ace asking|pg||
nt|robinswr: but not sure how artificial it was after 3diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: obviously for some reason he thought declarer had more clubs|pg||
nt|robinswr: of course there are only a few imps at stake|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4:00 next session|pg||
nt|robinswr: 24 imps|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is why its important to get explainions in writing when behind screens|pg||
