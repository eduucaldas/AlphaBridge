nt|vugraphzta: and we will start NOW|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: enjoy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Raija|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|tlc: As ELP said in the 70s.."Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends" .. especially in an exciting match like this!|pg||
nt|algraves: so  4 either major by EW|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kareno: And a big hello from me and my cats in Las Vegas :)   rehi, Jim :)|pg||
nt|tlc: 1NT here showing @cs i believe|pg||
nt|passell: yes clubs|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|rv: I fancy Diamond to win this one:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vicky888: Hello all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-13 HCP, unbal 5+@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Good evening people|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thsi is a dream table for bridge lovers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 4 players from top 10 for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 3rd seat  point count can be [much] lower|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@c would seem ok too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fantoni stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: in the closed 3c went down|pg||
nt|kareno: Traian :)|pg||
nt|passell: hi karen  how are things in sunny lv?|pg||
nt|kareno: David :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|toral5: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Sapan :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Giving them a little bit of a headstart|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: You should be here, Mike.  Perfect weather.  Your house must be missing you!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Karen@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Karen|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@s some sort of flower bid.|pg||
nt|toral5: hi karen:)|pg||
nt|kareno: I suspect it is east who is thinking - north has said his piece.|pg||
nt|algraves: ns 5 or 6 losers in a minor |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk10: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Karen, David, Jim|pg||
nt|algraves: so a routine start|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: in the closed we had action from the word go|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vicky888: this should make i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for multitasker  you can try to follow bidding/play in other vugraph rooms using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|othered1: EW are Precision-based.  NS's system is unto itself, with things like weak NT, all 1-bids forcing, and intermediate 2-bids that can have lots of playing strength|pg||
nt|kareno: Roland :)|pg||
nt|rv: ar favorable vul, Fred might have come in again with 4n to show both minors with longer @cs|pg||
nt|daman: Zia bid 4NT over 4@S    long @Cs with secondary @Ds|pg||
nt|algraves: notice the Meckstroth style of never disclosiing information if he doesnt have too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|toral5: 3@C will be in easy make especially aftr a dbl frm west|pg||
nt|kareno: Good trump lead by west|pg||
nt|toral5: and now no @C guess|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtr: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|tlc: roland, karen, mike..nice to see everyone again|pg||
nt|Walddk10: and Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Warren :)|pg||
nt|tlc: hi warren|pg||
nt|passell: this is the kind of match bridge is all about|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg thinking|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: Not really favorable though, equal|pg||
nt|rv: at equal vul, it is not such a percentage action, hence he passed|pg||
nt|algraves: theoretically 4@H on some hand might be better but he thinks it is poor bridge to disclose infomation needlessly|pg||
nt|daman: Greco bid 4@H in the CR|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision system has the advantage that ALlan mentioned, opening limited to 15HCP|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 8 IMPs to Diamond      first blood|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck and Moss having a chat|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since Greco-Hampson also play Precision, it was a matter of style, not system|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Gitelman has no clear idea of declarers distribution so is guessing somewhat at this point . trying to come up with scenarios that lead to 4 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they apologise to Fred for te noise|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but Fred said Its OK i am undistructable|pg||
nt|algraves: he does know the meck is limited to 16 as he did not open 1@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: For those who don't know the term, 'flower bid' means a fit showing jump.|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: yeah.thts wt i was typing to a kib:)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|othered1: EW have found thenormal 3N and from the better side|pg||
nt|athene: South must know there's very little chance of beating the contract, with the strong dummy and well-placed @DK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|toral5: @D 8 is gud here.so 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa jiggles his leg while Greco thinks|pg||
nt|kareno: With the diamond in the pocket, it's an easy hand for declarer.|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll be jiggling his leg a lot this match I think :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco asking about leads|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to David Burn|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni explaining|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco asks some more|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Fantoni took out of his pocket a paper explaining leads...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now all clear and he is thinking...Greco|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so first board will noot be flat|pg||
pc|s7|nt|toral5: trumps now ll restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: Oh please don't throw me in the briar patch,, says Eric Rodwell!!|pg||
nt|jtr: I doubt if there was much the derfence could do|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|tlc: very happy lie of the cards on this hand..should be no further problems|pg||
pc|s2|nt|passell: tap declarer and duck 2 hearts|pg||
nt|passell: impossible to find|pg||
nt|jtr: only in the movies|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell staring at the 3 of clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Rodwell's biggest concern is a very bad spade break.  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: and if his partner has the @HK that's onside too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|toral5: ouch a @D discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: players show their hands|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|toral5: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|passell: its a shame every bridge player in the world cant be watching this match|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@c was chosen next door|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: so he just has to hope that Meckstroth's 4@S was really, really pushy - well, that's not impossible :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzta: Meck: i am gona make this|pg||
pg||
qx|c1|st||md|3S7H64DAQT2CAKJ632,SA84HQ97DK53CQ954,SJ965H832DJ864C87,SKQT32HAKJT5D97CT|sv|o|nt|3for3: Some action on the first board..|pg||
nt|kareno: Great matchup for you this morning, specs!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia discussing defenses with Hamman|pg||
nt|3for3: EW can make an easy 11 tricks in @S's|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kareno: North has some diamonds but will have little inclination to bid|pg||
nt|3for3: The question is whether Zia will let them play that with his promising offense|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia coughs|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|3for3: 2@C/3@C/p/4@S and Zia will face a guess whether to go on|pg||
nt|3for3: OK, so my first prediction gone awry|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kareno: Equal vulnerability I would be prudent|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Hamman shrugs and asks Greco if he is 5 5 shape and Greco shrugs in response|pg||
nt|3for3: Greco's 4@H bid might entice further action|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think NS will be happy if they compete at 5-level|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p!|nt|3for3: Hampson will be|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Zia not known for reticence.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Yves|pg||
nt|3for3: I think EW invert pass and double here.  Pass says he wants to double.  That forces North to make some choice, without pass and Redouble to wiggle to the best spot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphztb: Hamman says it is not perfect and Greco says it never is|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 800 nice start for diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like down four to me.  |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Hampson says we take time at trick 1 because Zia immediately called for a small card|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes karen|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@c 2@h 1@s 1@d|pg||
nt|kareno: Only compensation for Hamman is that he doesn't have to play the hand.|pg||
nt|3for3: The 9 of clubs is worth alot of IMP's on this hand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: that's why he didn't bid 5@d ? lol|pg||
nt|kareno: However it looks like 5@d is down one fewer than this|pg||
nt|othered1: Can declarer control @D if he's tapped?|pg||
nt|3for3: It is in top tricks, not sure they can handle the 41 club break either|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: while Greco considers his defense, please note that bids are entered only after the board is pushed under the screen.  That way the players can tell nothing of the tempo of their ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: pd's bids by my clicking :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphztb: Zia says it doesn't look very good and claims down 4|pg||
mc|7|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Quite a few are watching, Mike, but you're right, this is the epitome of match bridge.|pg||
mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|toral5: 4@H or 3nt?|pg||
nt|kareno: Zia opened the south hand 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all fantunes 1-suit openings are 1-round-force|pg||
nt|othered1: I can't imagine north will not push to game, even though their overcalls don't have to be very sound.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: here we see the problems of ambigous 1@D-2@C sequences|pg||
nt|algraves: good point|pg||
nt|athene: you can end in 4-2 fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can be weaker if (5/4) @H & @S  but usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|jtr: Surprised Garner didnt express and opinion about 4@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: light double...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kareno: I would just get to the heart game quickly with the south hand.  Maybe Stayman first but then hearts.|pg||
nt|toral5: ya stayman is betr|pg||
nt|jtr: an opinion|pg||
nt|algraves: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: dangerous board for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Tez|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|toral5: but 4@H on 2@D wont normally show 6-4?|pg||
nt|kareno: If north hasn't got four spades, then hearts looks right on a known 6-2 or 6-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: many people playing standard methods like to bid the west hand 1@D - 2@C but it does have its drawbacks|pg||
nt|daman: the perils of this canape sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck writing stuff for Moss|pg||
nt|athene: playing strong club of course you are rather more forced into this sort of thing|pg||
nt|algraves: well, this sequence shows both minors and they have ways to sort it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: and if the 1nt oc tends to be offshape,5-3 @S can be missed and land in a 6-1 @H fit:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Notrump overcall with singleton heart?????|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable I'm sure they'll get to game.|pg||
nt|athene: with 2-2-(5-4) west would tend to rebid 1nt to avoid this problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought Meck bud 1@d-2@h with 4@s and 5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: Meckstroth has inferences from this sequence and knows bidding on makes no sense|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|toral5: but thts against the odds.likely is he has atleast 2@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Fantoni did express one|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well... Fantoni expressed a strong opinion now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|tlc: mmany would play this sequence was a mild slam try,,,|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know if they have gradations of these raises.|pg||
nt|daman: North will lead a trump|pg||
nt|athene: yes, EW do play 1@D - 2@H as flannery shape|pg||
nt|peachy: nice lead, but as expected :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: some imps dor nickell here|pg||
nt|algraves: it is the other way 5 @S and 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: but that is 5-4 not 4-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is with 4-5 you just bid 1@H and you won't miss a spade fit as partner will rebid 1@S with four|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-4 if it goes 1@D - 1@S you can miss a heart fit though|pg||
nt|algraves: Moss has chosen the standard lead holding declarers first bid suit|pg||
nt|algraves: basically trying to win @D tricks later|pg||
nt|algraves: by stopping @D ruffs now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Well, the opening was stronger here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: But even so|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: action in the 2nd board...|pg||
nt|jtr: Cant see any interst here the way the cards lie|pg||
nt|jtr: Although declarer will not be so sure|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  It looks to me as though declarer is likely to get 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: 4@h would be equal lengths in majors or longer hearts and that's the end of this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: yes!!|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H has to be longer @H for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all players look away and think about the hand|pg||
nt|kareno: How many boards this round?  32?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I believe it is 14 boards.  All rounds today have been 14 :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Hey:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 4@s seems makeable.....|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: Lots of handling charges here|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|tez: i prefer 3@h ..looks like 2 down|pg||
nt|peachy: Since the diamond ruffs arent ha[p[ening, Rodwell developing spades|pg||
nt|algraves: well it is more on elimination lines|pg||
nt|algraves: playiing for 5 trump 2 @S and one in the wash|pg||
nt|peachy: Puttin Moss on lead obviously what declarer wants|pg||
nt|henryb:  Moss could play on @h now, to get the tap, or just play a second trump|pg||
nt|algraves: Moss realizes that he is going to be endplayed in @D and is tryiing to think through a counter|pg||
nt|peachy: I think Moss has no "evidence" to change his plan, more trump|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tlc: this removes any ambiguity|pg||
nt|kareno: Now the diamond in case west has the ace?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|yvesj49: in france 4@c shows 5/5 at least....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Tez|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|algraves: well that is why he is there and we are here|pg||
nt|athene: the obvious counter to diamond endplays is to keep hearts in your hand as exit cards|pg||
nt|peachy: And surely I am mistaken, since that didnt happen|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|tez: 3..hi Yves|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|algraves: well that forces Rodwell to pull trump or losse his @S A|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kareno: I'm surprised they are still playing 56 board matches at this point in a World Championship.  In the US major KO's we start with 64.|pg||
nt|toral5: yes:(|pg||
nt|toral5: is sementa heading for trouble?|pg||
nt|toral5: on a @D return?|pg||
nt|kareno: He doesn't want to burn his club entries.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa played a heart and discarded a high diamond, and it appears Greco discarded the diamond jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: clubs are now being played|pg||
nt|toral5: but he will end up making as the cards lie|pg||
nt|kareno: You think?|pg||
nt|toral5: has the play been haulted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play of the cards :( |pg||
nt|toral5: wt happens here on a @D return|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: I think declarer is in trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, east holds the jack ov clubs so no guess in that suit.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|toral5: final is suppose to b 96 brds?|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if a trump back rather than the @h might have worked better|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, north isn't playing with open cards, as we are.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but Fulvio thought 3@c in Claudio's seat lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco thinking|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @s ace and @h for the jack ?|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, west played 5@Cx and north led trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry and..back to thinking|pg||
nt|tez: all tickets to 3 down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Systems of all four pairs are rather different, so it's possible we'll see few identical auctions (perhaps strong NT openings, excepted)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good new !|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzta: more imps for Zimmermann here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes thinking|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: I still don't think he can navigate a trick in the wash|pg||
nt|peachy: Looking at it closer, the number of tricks (7) should still be the same|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|yvesj49: i won|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yvesj49: normal line|pg||
nt|tez: fulvio will play @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: claudio to play|pg||
nt|dburn: that would be a remarkable effort even for him|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or trump|pg||
nt|tez: for appercut..pd maybe has 10 of @c|pg||
nt|dburn: first it isn't his turn, second he doesn;t have a diamond|pg||
nt|tez: nunes sry|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe a world class puppeteer could pull that off|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: diamond jack in his hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i won again lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: easier with screen than cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and back to thinking now after a quick...sorry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Moss needs to get Gittelman to lead another @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jtr: Sneaky|pg||
nt|kareno: So I'm told that Meckwell have a variety of accepts of transfer to show various types of good hands.|pg||
nt|henryb:  So maybe he should shift to the @h7|pg||
nt|athene: small heart rather than the jack, yes|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows partner has the AK @H or the !K|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: EW already have 2 IMPs in their jeans    they are trying tonvert that to 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: convert*|pg||
nt|peachy: they dont know it though|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|dJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i wonder why fred played the heart ace|pg||
nt|algraves: so declarer will lose 3more in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see no chance for declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010nonJuniorPhiladelphia/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf  EW system card|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is known to have a singleton heart so the ace can't deceive partner|pg||
nt|rv: as per original seeding at the start of the tourney Nickell were seeded 2nd and Diamond 11th, Zimmerman were the original top seeds and lost to Diamond in semi-finals|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: but it might deceive declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|algraves: for down 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, surely not|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzta: this was the play guys|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Hampson said that north and south play standard carding|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|othered1: And don't go out of their way to signal, as I recall.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: 1@D/2@C shows 9 plus in the minors, but could be either way|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Hampson/Greco play forcing club so the suit lengths here are only approximate |pg||
nt|yvesj49: bas contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yvesj49: bad*|pg||
nt|3for3: which sometimes leads to a 42 fit|pg||
nt|othered1: a price you pay for the omnibus 1@D opening, but here standard players might duplicate it.|pg||
nt|3for3: I sure wouldnt!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: that's a problem with precision club 5@c and 4@d|pg||
nt|kareno: I would, for instance, lacking reverse values|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer to bid my long suit in standard |pg||
nt|3for3: In standard, it wouldnt occur to me to bid 1@D with West's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia is thinking, holding his head with his right hand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: you bid same with 5@d 4@c lol|pg||
nt|3for3: 1@C with the intention of raising spades, or rebidding NT seems right, in standard.  Hampson does not have that choice however|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|kareno: It's the notrump rebid with a singleton I dislike.|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: hampson and claudio discussing the last board... now the bidding|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1 off with @h lead|pg||
nt|dburn: not by any means a record, and not even particularly abnormal for this tournament|pg||
nt|daman: this is a pianola hand    just a matter of overtricks if any|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing to this hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tez: easy defence for 1 down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: flat board|pg||
nt|tlc: there's a fair amopunt of evidence to support those assestions :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Never give up on a partscore |pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: @CQ lead and @d shift will swiftly lead to 10 tricks for declarer |pg||
nt|henryb:  only issue is to cash @d immediately|pg||
pc|cA|nt|toral5: in local games we often say looking at 3 jacks:3 PLUS 1|pg||
nt|kareno: I predict down one.  And I offer tea (_)? and cookies to all OOOOO as we watch it happen :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, probably not:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and some more thinking now|pg||
nt|tlc: and i'm sure meck loves his "soon to be executed @D monarch"|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|othered1: North, especially, can be pretty deliberate|pg||
nt|athene: it might be essential to cash diamonds as declarer could throw a diamond on his @CK or his diamond on dummy's heart|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|tez: need @h 8 at the hand|pg||
nt|athene: also a small chance south has @DAx and can get a ruff|pg||
pc|d7|nt|passell: probably suspects because of the lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pbmarstr: 9 now and another IMP to Z|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: It is a bit like claiming as a declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: If you always claim then when you dont claim the defenders know there is a problem|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|algraves: so on the first hand , Zia got a bit frisky and bought a hideaous dummy in 5@C X for 800 and 8 imps away|pg||
nt|athene: quite possible that east opened 1nt with 4 spades and 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kareno: Let's see if he can sniff out the club position.|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Greco asks about Hamman's hand on the last board|pg||

nt|rv: Diamond won all their k/o matches comfortably, their closest match was against Lavazza in R16 which they won by 25 IMPs|pg||
nt|algraves: wow|pg||
nt|algraves: this hand wild|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: 3 NT will have better chances than 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes answered UNDICI FULVIO|pg||
mb|1S|nt|passell: best part of my game endplay for down 1|pg||
nt|athene: the NS club fit never came to light in the other room|pg||
nt|rv: Nickell had couple of close shaves including getting out of jail against Martens in R16 and tight match against Wolfson in semis|pg||
nt|algraves: NS are 2 Down in 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @C slam looks good and big @C opening may facilitate reaching it.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 6@c to bid|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL but there was an accident e/w in the CR.|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|athene: i'm told one south opened 1@C and actually bought it in 2@C on the auction 1@C - 1@H; 2@C|pg||
nt|tlc: the other room apparently had a Bergen related accident...East dbld the 3@c bergen raise and west thot he had clubs and got too high|pg||
nt|jtr: Fair game here|pg||
nt|athene: north decided to ignore the clubs - probably a matter of lead-direction|pg||
nt|athene: but i wouldn't want to hide that 6-card suit in a 65 shape|pg||
nt|athene: come on north bid 2nt|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S down 1 with a @D lead|pg||
mb|2N|an|minors|nt|athene: seems a little bit wet perhaps not to overcall 1@S with the west hand|pg||
nt|rv: Moss might get in with 2n if it still shows minors on 1M-2@C relay|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jtr: un =1 dici=10|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Contract not at the right hand though|pg||
nt|jtr: Need to play it accurately though|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C reverse drury|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C just drury isn't it|pg||
nt|peachy: yes|pg||
nt|athene: south might not think he wants a diamond ruff, but of course he does when his partner has the @SK!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|toral5: here comes my style 1nt:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, East will need to gain the lead again to beat it in ntheory|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni will think for a while about this|pg||
nt|jtr: I used to bet against Fantoni making contracts until i ran out of money|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: It is impossible not to take the spade Q I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and hope in his eyes...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in hand now|pg||
nt|jtr: Even if he wins and plays one back East will need to find the @d switch to be sure of beating it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and stil thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table of this match is on livestream   http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|jtr: If you need to use the bathroom specs, now would be a good time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this table is on the VG theater in front of spectators|pg||
nt|tlc: 2NT a limit raise or better in hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: well Gitelman has interesting problem. his majors suggest defense, his clubs owe partner a raise|pg||
nt|rv: very aggressive rev drury by Rodwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Dont bet on North playing within the next five minutes|pg||
nt|athene: moss isn't stopping surely now his partner hit his six-card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking about 3h bid now|pg||
nt|rv: Moss will pass since he has already bid his hand and has all values outside of @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: If declarer allows Spade Q to hold the trick he will be able to endplay W later|pg||
nt|passell: especially if rosenberg false cards the quenn of diamonds at trick 1|pg||
nt|kareno: Good stop n/s|pg||
nt|algraves: well rv that is their style, their style is aggressive so the Drury is normal for them|pg||
nt|athene: he might pass 4@C but will he pass 4@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck writes down explanations for him|pg||
nt|algraves: Meckwell are actually very disciplined pair|pg||
nt|algraves: like every pair they have a style|pg||
nt|algraves: it may not be your style|pg||
nt|algraves: but it is for sure their style|pg||
nt|rv: good pass by Moss, he has bid his hand and has all values outside of @c suit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, people often confuse having an aggressive system with having an aggressive style - the two things are different|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by both Gitelman and Moss|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Moss in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell has a hand too good to raise to 2@S as a passed hand intheir methods|pg||
nt|algraves: Meck smells a rat|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west surely too good for 2@S with the fourth trump|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Rodwell didn't have mixed raise in their methods on a passed hand, ideal hand for that|pg||
mb|4H|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|jtr: Ducking wasnt a feasible play though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been very interesting [double dummy] to duck trick 1   maybe then Brogeland gets endplayed|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, east made no try |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Easy 3nt without a diamond lead and since they are blocked, even with an unlikely diamond out |pg||
nt|athene: E-W might be Flannery-ites, judging from 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have a card for them|pg||
mb|4S|nt|toral5: @D lead as the cards lie was killing|pg||
nt|kareno: Ellen :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, 4 can make if you read it|pg||
nt|kareno: 4 makes with the lucky heart lie|pg||
nt|kareno: But better not finesse the spade.|pg||
nt|passell: playing the queen at trick 1 might induce a heart finesse|pg||
nt|kareno: spade lie, I meant|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth 4@h might be strategic, ostensibly showing more, just tempting Fred to bid again|pg||
nt|athene: now north will surely pass because he isn't in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|athene: he would have had more reason to bid if it went 4@S P P round to him|pg||
mb|d|nt|yvesj49: i prefer 3@c in west|pg||
nt|caitlin: they may get there|pg||
nt|yvesj49: tos how 6 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance again for diamond team|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S is stronger in their methods than in standard Precision, as an omnibus 1@H response handles 8-11 point hands|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 3@H show @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamson writing explanations for Claudio|pg||
nt|algraves: well no here Rodwell could be 3-5 or 3-4 so he was suggesting a final contract with 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: East may just go passive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: Neither minor looks attractive|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think Brogeland should have played @S 6 to indicate no interest for @H. Count is not interesting here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the name field on BBO alowes 10 limit so i asked him to choose his name|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and this is his choice|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he can write for me too ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: here we go|pg||
nt|peachy: Gitelamn has some defense so he is not going to sac, I think|pg||
nt|peachy: well, surely not now:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Great switch|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Silla got it right anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still 3 imps to the italians|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2@H shows also @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: both these is tough bridge for hand 4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzta: Meckwell udca|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Povl Sommer|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure what Moss's double is in this situation, does it show "shall we bid on/save suggesting double" with extra shape or outside values and suggesting defense?|pg||
nt|peachy: NS aqueezed the last drop from this hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|toral5: ahh.suit is blocked|pg||

nt|yvesj49: natural method can arrive at the same contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzta: Hampson in the tank |pg||
nt|caitlin: does this place@CK with Fantoni?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no way to go down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @h are pretty lol|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - what would he lead if he didn't have it?|pg||
nt|tez: natural play..@h ruff 2 times..if overruff with king..finished|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: true David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson stil thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand now|pg||
nt|tez: only down singleton @h and !k of !k offside|pg||
nt|othered1: relative to the lead, IIRC, the Italians in general don't go out of their way to double for a lead|pg||
nt|rv: I presume it is the latter here, some partnerships play the former treatment from hand which is limited and has more shape|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows that Fred has some defense to bid 4@C|pg||
nt|algraves: or enough offense to make 5@C a good save|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree with panel's views|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck put the cards on the table and thinking|pg||
nt|bg: no thx watching vugraph today|pg||
nt|athene: some people play this sort of double - by a hand which isn't expected to bid again - as "action" - the idea is you have a good hand for defence AND bidding on, but it seems a bit ...|pg||
nt|athene: illogical to me - the two things are opposite|pg||
nt|yvesj49: board 4 meckstroth plays 4@s x|pg||
nt|algraves: well illogical or not it is going to result in 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|rv: I think it should be played as either "showing more shape and less defense" or "outside values with defense"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: so south's pass of 4@D may not be all that meaningful|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jtr: Silla?  Like the sea monster Scylla?|pg||
nt|athene: zia plays it as "i want to sac, but you can pass if you have loads of defence partner"|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Robinson shows his cards to Meckstroth|pg||
nt|rv: I like the former treatment by a "pre-emptor or limited hand with fit" doubling high level auction to show more shape and asking partner "shall we bid on"|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|pbmarstr: Anyway, another 3 IMP to Z for bidding a better game|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3rd 1N opening in a row?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: close room in 6@c !|pg||
nt|yvesj49: closed*|pg||
nt|othered1: Two pick-ups where EW here have been more aggressive than the great Norwegians at the other table, who themselves usually aren't considered conservative|pg||
nt|algraves: or found Fred with a hand to remove to 5@C and go down only 1|pg||
mb|1D|nt|algraves: or sometimes go -790|pg||
mb|1H|nt|toral5: dull 4@S coming up|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D from north, strong club style|pg||
nt|passell: hamman and zia had a strange accident on the previous board|pg||
nt|algraves: it is all risk reward scenarios|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|athene: their 2@C opener promises six, and even if it didn't you wouldn't want to open it on that hand|pg||
nt|jtr: West may bid this time|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He will|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d by Fred here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yvesj49: let's see fantunes system.......|pg||
mb|3D|nt|algraves: 2@S not forcing in Meckwell style|pg||
nt|rv: in a contested auction 2@d is not played as inverted raise, cue (2@h) is used as substitute for Inv raise in this case|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sommer: a lot of tricks (11) in a @Hcontract, EW|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nobody bids 2@d with west hand ?|pg||
nt|othered1: NS's 12-14 NT can include 6m, 5-4 (but not both majors) and 4-4-4-1 hands|pg||
nt|tez: me|pg||
nt|yvesj49: OK tEZ WE ARE 2|pg||
nt|algraves: 3@S a make|pg||
nt|athene: can you set up the long heart here for a diamond pitch?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Who bids Stayman with the west hand?|pg||
nt|toral5: not me|pg||
nt|caitlin: never|pg||
nt|kareno: I do because I play two way Stayman, Canadian style so I can offer a choice of games with this hand.|pg||
nt|toral5: i said dull 4@S cos i miscounted grecos hcp.its 2 late nite here:(|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4-3-3-3 no Stayman here|pg||
nt|kareno: And WHERE would YOU like to play this hand?  :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|tez: nonevuln good suit..|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: 1@D-1@S-2@S:(|pg||
nt|caitlin: as it turns out 4@S|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@d equal length|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 2 D are equal length in majors|pg||
nt|jtr: hopefully not 1-1|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: too slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well... Fantoni is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i will tell him to play faster|pg||
nt|jtr: Good|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Gazilli?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Re the slam on board 4, Wolfson- L Cohen bid it, Meckwell did not, and Gu-Lu bid it, Pasman-Simons did not. So a 12 IMP swing in all 3 matches|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@D NS|pg||
nt|athene: club lead, diamond shift would certainly kill 4@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Interesting that Meckwell, with methods not all that dissimilar to Greco-Hampson's, missed it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Claudio thinking now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|yvesj49: reading his system ? lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio and Greco discussing the bidding on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|othered1: On board 4, Meckwell had to deal with a 11D overcall and a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meantime Claudio cards on the table|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: From a spec:  Zia would play a @d here  |pg||
nt|kareno: Could work!!|pg||
nt|toral5: only 8 tricks even aftr @C hook|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson needed to be escorted to the restroom|pg||
nt|kareno: But I'd still rather be in 4@s :)|pg||
nt|sommer: they may bid the game now|pg||
nt|sommer: done|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that we have anywhere to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Can Strul take their foirst IMP in this session?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are 15 down this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: time for some norwegian magic|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see how|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but for a change Fantoni is thinking|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead at trick 1 and that's the end of the defence|pg||
nt|algraves: well that will be the play issue, as to wethe he makes 4 , seems so really|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: east 4@H bid from west, facing a sound raise, with good opening bid and six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: easy 4@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is a standard queen, but it varies at times|pg||
nt|sommer: sure..it was E's bid, wich was tough|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose guess both rounded suits|pg||
nt|jtr: This one is a gimme|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad there aren't any statistics for average time per hand  per player|pg||
nt|jtr: Nobody has a sad enough life to calculate it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye thinking now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes would be high on that list -- maybe even higher than their WBF ranking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking nunes about nt range|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking...he learned from fantoni|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not the fastest player|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well...he is stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky he is not playing with Fantoni|pg||
nt|jtr: Nunes can be slow too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|jtr: I think it was he that took enarly 20 minutes to play a hand the other day|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i had him 2 or 3 times on vg this week and did not seem slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in politically correct speak    they are     deliberate|pg||
nt|jtr: It all revolved around KJ9xx opposite Axx|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not slow, but he likes to think when he has a problem|pg||
nt|jtr: He eventually dropped the doubleton Q offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but cards in his hand|pg||
nt|jtr: It was Fantoni i am told|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kareno: I think 2@c shows a good hand but I don't know the structure.|pg||
nt|jtr: Meck was sort of endplayed with the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: screen closed... east askeng leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back up now,,,|pg||
pc|cT|nt|caitlin: one example of few in favour mof bidding stayman|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S may have been a strong relay and 3@S a maximum response, but I'm unsure about that.|pg||
nt|tlc: it almost appears they are playing transfers after 2@C..2@D=@H,2@H=spade pref,2@S=club raise...just guessing..anyone know?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: Debbie was watching|pg||
nt|jtr: is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer can come to a slow @c trick for 8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|algraves: so making 4 for a push|pg||
nt|algraves: easy hand after last one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asksabout card ing and the response is udca|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A suspicious mind|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|caitlin: stats show not bidding stayan with 4-3-3-3 is far superior|pg||
nt|kareno: If you play forcing stayman, then you can get more hands right :)|pg||
nt|toral5: now duboin has the easiest of shifts...|pg||
pc|s3|mc|10|nt|athene: 3@D did make things a little tougher for EW - without it, 3@S is constructive for sure|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio opened 1c lol|pg||
nt|athene: maybe double 3@D would be a game try in spades|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really use 3@H because you need that as natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod said i will claim quickly and he did|pg||
nt|algraves: well I dont think they wanted to be in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not saying Meckstroth actually had a game-try hand|pg||

nt|athene: probably 4@S :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I dont think so|pg||

nt|jtr: Some 4@s bid next door|pg||
nt|rv: slam time here|pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16 NT this seat|pg||
nt|daman: a sensible auction in the CR|pg||
nt|algraves: you might choose not to open 1NT in standard but in Precision the alternative 1@D is awkward|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell may trf at 4 level and do RKC or trf at 2 level and splinter with 4@d|pg||
mb|4D|an|alerted|nt|vugraphzta: Greco and Sementa are joking at the suggestion that Greco would duck a diamond|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 3nt here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinsonsw and Boyd both point to their bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this what he said|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s 10-15 in theory|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=non-force, 10-13 HCP, 5+@S, unbal, not 4+@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Sort of pushed into it|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother splintering, personally|pg||
nt|algraves: and it is meck style to open a lot of NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: passed out?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no operator error|pg||
nt|kareno: Just undo :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: three passes and Sementa opened 1 @C then Greco bid 1 @S Duboin bid 2 @D and Hampson doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: after 4 passes I cannot undo <<<<<<<<<<<<<<.8|pg||
nt|toral5: lavazza played 4@S in other room:)|pg||
nt|toral5: match getting closer|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: this looks like a solid 4@S EW|pg||
nt|athene: well, EW missed the game in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: (4@H, previous board)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bids are not entered until the board is passed through the screen so that the clicks are not heard :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Daniel Gulyas and Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||
nt|sommer: not sure 1@C is strong (only) ..is it polish-like with forced 1@D?|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|athene: 1@d hearts i'm told, and 1nt strong (18-19)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: also, I do multiple clicks when playing the cards :)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess EW play the style where they just complete the transfer with any weak notrump|pg||
nt|sommer: 1NT looks like a 18-19NT or something|pg||
nt|kareno: Lower level here will change the auction and the pressures on n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: the lack of paint in the tray makes this action much more comfortable|pg||
mb|4S|an|alerted|nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks while Boyd writes an explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Nunes playing may be faster|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h has chances|pg||
nt|passell: looks like 5 diamonds even with a trump lead|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess Rod will do something though|pg||
nt|athene: west can just take control, take the pressure off his partner|pg||
nt|rv: he must be assesing his options, looks like he has chosen former option of bidding at 4 level|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|alerted|nt|athene: 2@H another transfer, so the strong hand gets to play it in spades|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure if 1nt denied four hearts - probably, i would think|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson rubs his head before going back into a reflective pose while considering his bid.|pg||
nt|athene: so west knows that this way he is sure to be dummy and have a nice rest|pg||
nt|algraves: key card|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s is kickback asking for keycards in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Eric-Geoff' style|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not so sure Mike|pg||
nt|passell: yes it looks like the j of diamonds is likely to score a trick|pg||
mb|6H|nt|toral5: guess undo again|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I could not undo, but I redealt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd writes an Rodwell nods|pg||
nt|gulyas: this probably shows both Ms 4-4|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I will be impressed if Nunes make this contract|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow south failed in 6@c|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 24 imp's board....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: how?|pg||
nt|athene: keycards in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: strange|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing with screen..no penaly |pg||
nt|dburn: not especially strange|pg||
nt|dburn: they led a diamond, so he tried to cash spades but West ruffed|pg||
nt|dburn: then, he played West for three trumps rather than two|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but @h are pretty......|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky 1c opening can be a lot of things for fantunes....did not discose to much lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jack 3rd|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: disclose|pg||
nt|yvesj49: expensive board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: So double sounds like it was some sort of Snapdragon|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..ya, but why prefer 3NT to 4@S from E?|pg||
nt|gulyas: with those very strong minor holdings, he decides to play it there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell asks a ? and Boyd quietly explains|pg||
nt|sommer: @Dlead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asking questions and Robinson talks quietly|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@Hlead from @S and @Dshift is good, but hard|pg||
nt|sommer: ..from S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks if the 2 @S bid shows 5 @S and Boyd says yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HJ looks good enough for me|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you would expect declarer to rise the ace and play spades right away|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want a diamond through him|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I think that is what I heard :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamonds are more of a worry than hearts|pg||
nt|tlc: if you run the club 7 and guess right, arent there still chances?|pg||
nt|jtr: Entry problems to hand|pg||
nt|rv: sry keys for @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: another claim coming up|pg||
nt|athene: in the buffett cup they might have bid 6nt :)|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell is very direct in his slam bidding usually|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: probably just nine now, establishing the spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd denied 4 @H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzta: screen closed..nunes asking boye about carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and defense|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He has a small chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  maybe @C before 2nd @D so partner can help direct defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|kareno: Exactly - and three pesky diamonds in west.|pg||
nt|passell: I think the jack of diamonds has to score a trick here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: upside down signals|pg||
nt|passell: its hard to find a better defender than Rosenberg|pg||
nt|kareno: Or declarer for that matter - great declarers make great defenders.  |pg||
nt|jtr: Even finessing the @c9 he cant get back to hand to ruff 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Without promoting the @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asks TELL BE ABOUT THE JACK OF HEARTS|pg||
nt|kareno: Would a diamond now do damage or just expose the jack to capture?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rosenberg said HE WANTS THE UNUSUAL SHIFT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tez: if greco give 8 of @h..it will be interesting|pg||
nt|algraves: so another push|pg||
mc|12|nt|toral5: rusinow leads for ew i guess|pg||
nt|daman: the CR is 3 boards ahead of us|pg||

nt|athene: a sightly odd decision to go for 3nt with a 4-4 major-suit fit; it's a lot more common with a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of people have been told that it's uncouth to use blackwood so they avoid it even when it's much the best|pg||
nt|algraves: well not quite, but it the not getting cute part is bang on|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: EW carding   upside-down Attitude  standard Count|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I was just trying to say: the reason why they DON'T claim 9 (or 10) tricks in 3NT - make the opps work for it, its a very long tournament|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pbmarstr: Another perfect result for Z|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: how do u tackle this very @H suit combo in case of silent opps?|pg||
nt|tlc: 1@h=spades after the X|pg||
nt|jtr: X i guess is one minor or the majors?|pg||
nt|passell: 1heart shows spades|pg||
nt|jtr: oops silly sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: double is takeout of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I was thinking a 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: he didnt duck to @c..so 1 or void in @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: flat board 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: well, he might have opened one - not sure how far he would have to upgrade|pg||
nt|rv: Kickback is a convention where folks bid above trump suit as RKC once fit is established in GF auction, 4@d for @c keycards, 4@h for @d keycards, 4@s for @h and 4n for @s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: east has a lot of points but a lot of losers, and three small hearts is very bad news|pg||
nt|athene: maybe passing 2@S isn't ridiculous|pg||
nt|kareno: One point with a bad hand and vulnerable.|pg||
nt|jtr: Not much worse than an earlier upgrade and that was what i was thinking about|pg||
nt|jtr: My brain forgot to change gear:0|pg||
nt|jtr: Must get an automatic next time|pg||
nt|warrens:   the other upgrade had a 5-card suit and was non-vul|pg||
nt|tlc: the earlier upgrade had a 5th spade|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at the other table North knew South had diamonds, so he bid diamonds (or at any rate, he transferred to diamonds)|pg||
nt|dburn: and South made a lot of tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: here, no one knew anyone had diamonds, and East will make enough tricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: And 1NT should do ok this way|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Willenken thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|tlc: seems  right to win on the table and lead clubs..|pg||
nt|passell: continuos heart lead will make communication difficult for 7th trick  or a spade shift|pg||
nt|kareno: That seems the natural line of play.|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, something will have to give for the defence|pg||
nt|dburn: at least, he will now - if anyone had known anyone else had diamonds, the defenders could have led diamonds and shifted to spades at some point, and that would have beaten 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east stil thinking....|pg||
nt|passell: yes looks like this will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we have a cameraman walking with a camera in her hand around the room|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose he could play for 2@s tricks and let the defence give hima  trick in the minors|pg||
pc|s5|nt|algraves: so this will come down the end game for 5 or 6|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kareno: Not enough entries for two finesses I think - |pg||
nt|yvesj49: puppet ?|pg||
nt|tez: you can see with king of @s|pg||
nt|rv: it is more useful for RKC in minor suit where 4n may to too high for asking aces and stopping at 5 level|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Zimmerman 21-0 for the set   think how much more it could have been|pg||
nt|jtr: Likely one more here|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in theory it's superior as you have more room for the lower trump suits|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: 2@C exactly 3@H Drury  [2@D=4+ fit]|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell has to protect diamonds and the ten of clubs and wont be able to do that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sommer: 1@D was just transfer with @H .. http://usbf.org/docs/2006usbc/SSF/06boydrobinson.htm|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead for the defense.  |pg||
nt|bessi2: it is surely an option.. his pd could hardly hold a better hand for 2@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quick play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: director happy|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess the moral is, whether you are insuring your jewellery or playing bridge, it helps to know how many diamonds you have|pg||
nt|jtr: But he may get squeezed doing that|pg||
nt|athene: the only danger is when the RKCB suit might be potentially natural|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzta: players to the bathroom .... all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: break here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or rest room lol|pg||
nt|tez: here too.brb|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably because they are playing too fast|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 coke 2 grappa lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i will not redeal unyil players back at the table|pg||
nt|udo: riesen|pg||
nt|udo: sy, priv|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: taking close-ups from players|pg||
nt|jtr: That is what he chose|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he has played on a suit that allows the defence to shift to... you've guessed it, diamonds|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes and take 2@ss 2@cs 3@ds|pg||
nt|kareno: So he's going for two spades, four hearts and a minor suit trick.|pg||
nt|tlc: but now a @D will beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell put the cards on the table now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|gulyas: I agree, passing is certainly a possibilty|pg||
nt|jtr: He did well not to play a @c|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if his partner had clubs he could have led them|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|toral5: if hes forced to ruff 2@S,def has 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: i think i should betr slep.i m seeing @H as 4-0|pg||
nt|jtr: Meck could easily have them  But maybe then he would have led one|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|athene: i think M-R have some interesting comment in their notes like "4 of unfocused major is keycard"|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kareno: That defense should be clear to Greco after this spade play.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: is Fantoni @H8 then @H4 asking for @S?|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess so|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: I beat you in sentence length if not speed|pg||
nt|passell: diamond pouring it on in other match|pg||
nt|tlc: a ping pong match this hand has become..|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|toral5: now fate of the contract only on @H guess|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kareno: Wheels within wheels.  North should wonder why east did not continue spades.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa just plays with his tricks that lie before him|pg||
nt|rv: ok Meckwell are 10 years ahead of rest of the world:)|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't want to wheel that one out at the table without a lot of trust that partner knows when a suit is in focus :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: Pinged again|pg||
nt|tlc: yup :)|pg||
nt|tlc: a spade instead of club wouldve found him home|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will make 5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h9|nt|gulyas: but as it is, 4-1 trumps and a couple of finesses offside make this go down|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: Final pong maybe|pg||
nt|passell: looks like declarer might have gone after clubs early|pg||
nt|kareno: This is known as a contest between the declarer and the defense.|pg||
nt|tlc: this is why 1NT hands are so much fun to watch...|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like the declarer is going to win - and go down.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson jokingly says, I don't have the rest? And Meckstroth repeats down 2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h8|pg||

nt|caitlin: yes 2-way was very popular here but not now|pg||
nt|toral5: greco wd b amused to see 2@H opening frm his pd|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: since the players can hear the clicking of the mouse, the bids are not input until the board is pushed under the screen :)|pg||
nt|toral5: looking at his @H holding|pg||

mb|4S|nt|caitlin: and 4@H is down|pg||
nt|toral5: did he overcal 2@S??|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: othing can be told from Greco's expressionless face|pg||

nt|jtr: 4@d for E/W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Peter -- 1-suit with major OR  any strong 5+5+|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 4@s by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: yes.. i agree with 2@s.. kx in hearts is a terrible holding|pg||
nt|jtr: Even though this room started late?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this what he said..|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: The hand with the distribution must take the pressure in the auction.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rather nothing|pg||
nt|sommer: lower values - better game|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s opening forcing 1 round..13+|pg||
nt|jtr: I thought 8 minutes a board with screens?|pg||
nt|tlc: let me guess:2@C is meckwell?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think he is logged in bbo.. WE CAN ARGUE WITH HIM LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: 14 i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  in meckwell, 2@C=@C + Major, so this must be something else|pg||
nt|athene: who had seating rights this set? i.e. whose decision was it to put the similar systems the same way?|pg||
nt|rv: Top 4 placed teams in Juniors and Youngsters will get to choose their QF opponent with c/o as well|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if you need swings you sit the opposite way|pg||

pc|cA|nt|toral5: duboin with the highest hcps was watching ,til 3 players bid:)|pg||
nt|jtr: And here it comes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lol|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: I must say I would be bidding 4@s with south's hand.  No trump tricks, not many tricks ar all but a spade fit.|pg||
nt|tlc: apparently 2C was landy, showing the majors|pg||
nt|warrens:   oh, now it's @D or Majors.|pg||
nt|warrens:  thanks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2@C was majors - 2@D a @H transfer|pg||
nt|kareno: Just high enough and not too hign ;0|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, on this lead anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: A @h might not have been so easy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: And a source of tricks in clubs.|pg||
nt|gulyas: another game missed I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rather the 1 nt bid was alerted by wiggling the 2 @H bidding card|pg||
nt|bessi2: the natural method works better here then gazilli for example in which case e-w would be plaing 2@s|pg||
nt|sommer: getting rid of @HJ helps:)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|tlc: a heart lead appears to be the winning lead on this layout|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: north really ducked there?|pg||
nt|gulyas: in precision, you bid this very fast: 1@C-1@D-1@S-1NT-2@H-4@H I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell did duck the J @H!|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he keeps the @HJ to overruff in spades, potentially|pg||
nt|rv: can|pg||
nt|rv: can|pg||
nt|rv: can't see this going down with @SQ favorably placed and 22 break|pg||
nt|athene: the best the defence can do is force dummy with clubs, so declarer can't pick up the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: but that's still only three tricks total for them|pg||
nt|algraves: right so this will make one way or another|pg||
nt|algraves: as in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad thinking|pg||
nt|athene: i guess on a club here, rodwell will come to hand and ruff his last club before playing trumps|pg||
nt|athene: he can't play a trump and risk the defence drawing trumps and cashing a club|pg||
nt|rv: this is 60 brd match comprising of 15 brds in each of 4 segments|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 64 boars today|pg||
nt|algraves: no it is a 64 board match|pg||
nt|rv: all matches till R16 comprised of 14x4 brds, from QFs onwards they are playing an extra brd in each segment|pg||
nt|rv: oh sry|pg||
pc|dT|nt|toral5: i am also bidding 4@S.pd cd easily ve 6@S|pg||
nt|kareno: And there goes the club trick.|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|athene: this gives declarer more options, which sort of makes it a harder hand to play|pg||
nt|athene: you might now be able to survive a diamond loser sometimes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod in the tank now|pg||
nt|rv: has Nickell team won this event? I suspect this is only missing major trophy in their cabinet:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yvesj49: have to find  Q @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio thinking|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pbmarstr: Looks like the CR result will be copied|pg||

nt|tlc: as David already pointed out :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sommer: E has a good hand for Gazzilli! ..2@C is EITHER natural or 17(16)+ . That MIGHT have taken EW to game|pg||

nt|pietraccio: , |pg||
pc|s3|nt|toral5: this is making now|pg||
nt|kareno: AND the diamond trick.|pg||
nt|toral5: to late for the shift:(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 2@d overcall and 4 @s in east....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: A two trick compression by the defense.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa is yelling at Duboin|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|athene: well, whatever happens he is making an overtrick now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see anyone getting to game without the help of powerful hallucinogens|pg||
nt|bessi2: not so sure about that.. west would bid 2@s over 2@c showing a bad hand and east then has no bid I would think|pg||

nt|sommer: I think, E would have a "little" 3@H:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, both the last game (4@S bd7) and this (bd 8) were so-so games, but since the first one was in vul, they went for it|pg||

mb|2S|an|alerted|nt|jtr: Even on a @s lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@S=6+ @S's|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: its simple - say the other table misses the game: if non-vul, you are +6 if you make, -6(-5) if you don'T|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd rubs his chin while he thinks|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you are vul, you lose 6 if it didn't make, but gain 10-11 if it does|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: So far the Zimmermann team has played a perfect session and there has been nearly no possibilities to gain IMPs for Strul.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: 3nt is a winner here.|pg||

nt|jtr: In NT that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: It is confirmed by a lot of specs that Rosenblum is only missing trophy in Nickell's impressive trophy cabinet(s), similar to how French Open was to Federer till recently:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Sometimes hands are just tough|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sommer: no endplay ... no make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way to make this - you can ruff the @HK down but you don't have the entry to cash the @HQ|pg||
nt|sommer: Boyd was tempted by his 4-loser hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 1 @D usually promises 2 @D|pg||
nt|bessi2: only way to let this through is if meck ducks the Q of clubs but I dont see that happening|pg||
nt|athene: E-W in the other room given a much easier ride; east could show extras and stop in 3@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: with both @CA and @HK wrongly placed for declarer, he is likely to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks for a review of the bidding|pg||
nt|gulyas: good lead there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: had had placed the 4 @C bid near the table, withdrew it, and then placed it there again :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: this is a rather nasty play problem though.. he might even finesse the hearts trick 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, but still 1 down|pg||
nt|bessi2: either that or cross to the ace of hearts to play a club.. playing Rodewell for axx in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks for a further explanation of the 1 @S bid made by Rodwell, which denied 5 spades|pg||
nt|sommer: he may go for @CAxx in N too|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but still -1 at least|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think he will finesse hearts trick 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: -1 most likely, either losing the 4th @C or the @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd makes no move to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: keeps shifting in his chair :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks another question of the bidding|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Moss's 3@c is transfer to @d?|pg||
nt|athene: Maybe Moss is wondering if 4@S is Kickback (re. previous discussion) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is thinking|pg||
nt|rv: have the rules changed, earlier every pair had to play a min of 33% of boards in finals to be eligible for title, I am told Nickell, Wolfson etc played only 1 set in semis ...|pg||
nt|rv: yesterday, have the rules changed for each pair to play only 25% of boards?|pg||
nt|algraves: bridge bidding at the top expert level continues to evolve in two ways|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Moss stil thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: one that will be come more and more common is non disclosure of uneccessary information|pg||
nt|rv: or is it cumulative 33% of boards across all k/o matches to be eligible for title and WBF MPs?|pg||
nt|algraves: and 2, savinb space via new agreements and mid auction transfers|pg||
nt|algraves: such as this treatment|pg||
mb|5C|nt|toral5: last brd proved to be very costly.|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to run into a trump promotion with 2-2 trumps but he certainly can't afford to cash a second top trump if they are 3-1 and then be denied a club ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: they are not safe at 5 level with a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: south has certainly shown a very strong hand with this sequence (otherwise 4@S rather than 3@S) and i guess north thinks two aces and a spade, when he might have a void, is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: or any lead maybe|pg||
nt|algraves: they are at risk of 1@C 1@D and 1 trump loser|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sommer: agree with @Hfinesse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..now:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: signals in trump suit are asked with 2 possible answers given|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: N/S at the other table have had a fairly horrid time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the problem now is that once they get into control-showing territory, it can be hard to stop out of slam when you DO have enough controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: new leader at the end of this board|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: the 1@H bid might itself be light but you would not expect south to bid 2@S on a known 3-card suit with no values|pg||
nt|athene: so you know he has something|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just hoped it was the @HK, reasonably enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: orry folks, techinical difficulties|pg||
nt|gulyas: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|sommer: wlc back|pg||
nt|jtr: Meckwell arent use to having so many pooints for their 3NT contracts|pg||
nt|jtr: They usually make them with fewer|pg||
nt|algraves: unlucky hand for NS|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|gulyas: are we down yet?:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Greco writing to explain the 4 @C|pg||
nt|toral5: fit leader 4@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is probably down, but 4@S could be close|pg||
nt|athene: the defence just have to get their club set up here before it vanishes on a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: south had better not lead his singleton!|pg||
nt|algraves: i am in no hurry|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toral5: 4@S|pg||

mb|3H|nt|kareno: 4@c would suggest clubs (if that's east's second suit) or else hearts.|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: i said ACTION HERE|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: i bet @C ace is going away|pg||
nt|kareno: Whoops - there goes a club trick.  But there aren't eleven tricks (or even close if defense leads trumps).|pg||
nt|kareno: Could be down one from this point, though.|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards lie,trump lead and @C ace was best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco puts his cards down and holds his head between his hands|pg||
nt|toral5: and than @D.tht wd ve been 800 i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa is fidgeting and his leg jiggles|pg||
nt|toral5: aftr this lead greco will escape for a smal loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco makes no move to play a card|pg||
nt|kareno: Greco a slooooooow player|pg||
nt|toral5: can greco manage 3 @D ruffs?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Dismond has picked up 27 IMPs so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: "Sorry" from Greco|pg||
nt|sommer: good 4@S and sac|pg||
nt|athene: north with five spades and the void in hearts doesn't want to double and double, because that will lead to partner passing too often|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4@s might have been a close affair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks Robinsons if his bid shows a minimum and Robinson concurs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-18 HCP, not 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: action heroes ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod asking fred about the 3s bid|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell is thinking , " I know i can take a lot of tricks inhearts. do I really want to bet that both 4@S and 5@H are down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and Fred explaining|pg||
nt|athene: does this double just say "i don't want to bid 5@H" or what?|pg||
nt|athene: it seems odd unless it's regressive in a forcing pass situation but i doubt that applies?|pg||
nt|algraves: oh I apologize|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: well, is down with best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio thinking now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Claudio thinks 'we play with 104 cards !!!' lol|pg||
nt|tez: 5@h 1 down|pg||
nt|kareno: Some tables could finish 12 boards in 45 minutes :)|pg||
nt|algraves: I think they may have differnent type agreements |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson wiggles his fingers over the dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: And south goes right, as usual.|pg||
nt|tez: 2dpwn sry|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|algraves: welll we wont know |pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzta: danger lurking|pg||
nt|athene: that's some view from Rodwell - the most misfitting shape Meckstroth can reasonably have on this auction is 3-4-2-4, i guess|pg||
nt|peachy: this was a tough competitive auction|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps rodwell hopes for four spades opposite, and NS getting frisky|pg||
nt|algraves: there wasnt any defense that I can see|pg||
nt|peachy: I must admit I would have bid 5H, but my agreements are not as firm obviously|pg||
nt|algraves: even a @D lead moss just ducks and has ten tricks|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so the lead changes hands again|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bessi2: in the Wolfson-Fleisher match one table made it while the other wend down in 4@s I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards before leading|pg||
nt|jtr: Great @d switch by Helgemo next door|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these guys love to lead from Jxx|pg||

nt|toral5: ?????|pg||
nt|toral5: undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for holding up the play|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C might have eleven tricks? five spades, four clubs in south hand, two ruffs in north hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzta: woooow|pg||
nt|dburn: well, perhaps not quite right|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe not so right :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: optimistic|pg||
nt|caitlin: woke me up!!|pg||
nt|othered1: it was right not to play 4@HX . . .|pg||
nt|tez: with acelees hand 4 nt..i dont agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred back in the lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agree with yu tez|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @c for sure|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: of course, no-one is going to play in a mere 5-4 club fit with a splendid 5-3 spade fit available|pg||
nt|tez: np other leads|pg||
nt|dburn: why would anyone lead the ace of clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco choosing not to lead one of his bullets|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: Boyd will see a small hope, when @DJ falls, but he will be disappointed|pg||
nt|tez: we belive they will not ruff to @c ace|pg||
nt|othered1: with partner's double of 4@S, how could east lose an ace?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't believe they will either, but if partner has the king of spades and the ace of hearts is not cashing, it might be a good idea to establish spades for our side and not clubs ...|pg||
nt|dburn: for their side|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg thinking|pg||
nt|tlc: interesting if he takes the wrong major suit finesses and eric exits a low club..|pg||
nt|warrens:  a @H to the jack now?|pg||
nt|algraves: Welll since we can see all the cards and Rodwell has won about 200 world championships what we would have done is nt very relevant|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gulyas: certainly hard to find:)|pg||
nt|jtr: But they can get the @cs going|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: sorry|pg||
nt|tez: some spec says 4NT shows even number of controls|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzta: Boyd is emotionless upon receiving the bad news|pg||
nt|athene: well, 4-0 hearts isn't so bad - it means 4@S might be making|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he is not doubled:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd leans his chen on his left hand and thinks further|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: or rather his chin :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brogeland led right suit -- just [in this case]  wrong card|pg||
nt|jtr: And declarer may not read the @d situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes cards on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D3 was ostensibly 4th best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in his hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and......back on the table|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He probably know Boye has the @H king after some thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i should go get a coffee|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|passell: ducking trick 1 might have left him better placed|pg||
nt|warrens:  no good exit for Rodwell|pg||
nt|tlc: whanyone know M-W agreement as to what the lead of the J asks for?|pg||
nt|tlc: anyone|pg||
nt|passell: low club no good he would win 6|pg||
nt|warrens:  a low club should do it|pg||
nt|passell: rusinow  asks attitude|pg||
nt|kareno: No idea of the jack lead.|pg||
nt|passell: yes low club|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he would get 2 @s, 3 1H's, 2@D's and 2@C's, but he has to decide whether to finesse in diamonds or spades|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  3 @h's|pg||
nt|tlc: he could,,but he may believe the D hook on|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he could maybe exit another @c and see what happens|pg||
nt|passell: dicking the opening lead woulda made this easier|pg||
nt|passell: ducking  sorry bad computer skills|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Mike|pg||
pc|h2|nt|toral5: but did he play @C q?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Now two rounds of hearts after club ace inflicts some damage.  But must play a diamond after that.|pg||
nt|toral5: this is 800 now|pg||
nt|toral5: same position wt v discussed on an initial trump lead by duboin|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes, Greco played a small spade and trumped it and then lead the @C queen!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: This should have speeded things up.....|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: So instead of down one, it'll be two .|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: extra trick|pg||
nt|algraves: he was 500 down at 5 level and a spare J or two away from beating 4@S a trick|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzta: More thinking for Boyd|pg||
nt|sommer: -3 now - cant take all trumps|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think the way to beat 4@s is repeated heart plays be the defence.. pls correct me if I am mistaken|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Does not help to hold back the @D Q if Boye has 4 diamonds then|pg||

pc|s7|nt|gulyas: if E flashes all his goods in the red suits, declarer will probably misguess @Cs|pg||
nt|bessi2: 8-9 tricks depending on the @c guess|pg||
nt|athene: east was a little bit passive here, especially at love-all, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but for all he knows south could have length in both red suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth leaves with the director for the restroom|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Due to a defensive error|pg||
nt|jtr: either 8 or 10 tricks i think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: if declarer knew the lead was Jx he would duck the queen but of course it could be J10x(x)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: Bath coup trick one.|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he continues|pg||
nt|kareno: For the specs, that is a duck hoping west continues into the tenace.|pg||
nt|kareno: The ten by east obviously denying the jack of hearts so west will shift.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson fingers different cards, but not a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: WC players rarely continue with signal from pd guiding them. Do you agree Karen?|pg||
nt|caitlin: WC-world class|pg||
nt|kareno: Ellen, what can I say?|pg||
nt|caitlin: she is having her tea:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bidding and play to the first few tricks is glacially slow, and then unbelievably fast, like an avalanche|pg||

nt|caitlin: agree or not!!|pg||
nt|sommer: 2-3 imps pick-up are welcome for NS|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: also Meckstroth-Rodwell have been known to use the strong club as a pre-emptive weapon, opening it light and talking opps out of good contracts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: or singleton jack|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jtr: Not an error; a wrong view:)|pg||

pc|dA|nt|gulyas: just the way I like to play it too:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. east was in a very tough spot|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a strong hand, but bad distribution to reopen|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell ys absent mindedly with his mustache while trying to decide the best line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: playing with his mustache is what I meant to say :)|pg||

nt|athene: usual wisdom is to be very slow to come into the auction after one of these 3-suited bids|pg||
nt|tlc: 2@D being 11-15,with 4414,4405,3415, or 4315|pg||
nt|athene: since you know all the suits are breaking badly|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S short diamonds 11 -15|pg||

nt|algraves: 2@D i mean|pg||
nt|algraves: this is impossible problem for Gitelman|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: some more questions now|pg||
nt|algraves: good point|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and now he is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad said sorry and cards are on the table|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he will raise to 3@s which Fred will pass |pg||
nt|athene: if north thinks through the play, though....it won't play that well even when south has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|athene: for example if south's side suit is clubs, west has a stack over him|pg||
nt|athene: if south has diamonds, he can't go to dummy and finesse as west is ruffing diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: hamman didn't think it was worth a raise, on the same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: but admittedly zia isn't fred|pg||

nt|yvesj49: what's 2@d opening ?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d majors..weak hand|pg||
nt|othered1: minimum 3-suiter with stiff @D, I think.|pg||

nt|tez: i thk..i m not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco stil thinking|pg||
nt|yvesj49: specs said me 3 suiter |pg||

nt|athene: i think it's a reluctant pass, personally :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|caitlin: btw Martens 88 Nickell 71|pg||
nt|algraves: There is a nice little tip first put forward by al roth about discounting the first couple of tricks you hold when partner enters after pre emption|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: this will be a swing to sombody|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Short of tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: somebody|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: fantoni is thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|jtr: A @s lead and inspired views could make this|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Strul needs desperately some good boards to hope for a come back in the last session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the final board of the set   15|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni stil thinking|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking ... do not go away|pg||
nt|jtr: Tell him it will be more intersting if he leads a @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: director must give the keys of the room to the players lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: pass ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Ah A compromise|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Or diamonds|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Can win now I think. The right diamond wiew and the right choice in clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but an intersting ploy David      claim and let the opponents figure it out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards in his hand now|pg||
nt|othered1: east just trying to run for cover -- west could have only 3@H, I believe|pg||
nt|tez: pass is forcing i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think so|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D opening is part of precision system, it shows @D short 3 suited (4-4-1-4, 43-1-5, 4-4-0-5) hand 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: wouldnt X have been responsive, allowing him to get out in 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzta: 2nt is natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell inquires further about the 1 nt bid|pg||
nt|yvesj49: But double punitive i thonk lol|pg||
nt|othered1: I don 't think you double them out in 2@H, vul, to pass them out in 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamson writing and Claudio reading|pg||
nt|yvesj49: start tomorrow what time ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Claudio asking questions...ans some more writing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they write cards for the family ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nobody reading the bulletin now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lolllll|pg||
nt|migry: why would you want to get out in 2NT with 9 opposite a 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|passell: hamman passed an defended 2 hearts a winning decision|pg||
nt|migry: sry - 8 5-4 almost 9:)|pg||
nt|tlc: he didnt overcall 1NT either..|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kareno: So Nickell have closed the gap a bit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we have music Greco says, as a piano plays in the background|pg||
nt|kareno: North happy to be able to pass!!|pg||
nt|sommer: difficult but makeable|pg||
nt|sommer: this makes it easier|pg||
nt|athene: that was really east's 2nt not north's?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yvesj49: nice weather in philadelphia but opponents are strong lol|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: I like the overcall folks.  You must get your good suits into the auction when it's safe.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa leaves to quiet the piano player|pg||
nt|kareno: I heard that Rodwell is still playing so he's innocent :)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might well finesse against the @H10 at some point and go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell puts his cards down on the table to think|pg||
nt|athene: he can lead the @HQ on the first round of the suit to delay the decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards and thinks some more|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: First challenge managed|pg||
nt|jtr: Next a low @s maybe?|pg||
nt|jtr: After @dA|pg||
nt|jkotor: Q@s ! @s|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Then the spades will be blocked|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he has to establish tricks somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think he can make this against good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i am told there will be time penalties...|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: In VPs?|pg||
nt|jtr: I hope you dont get any Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i hope not....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably we will start the next session immediately after this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lets finish this session first.. i say|pg||
pc|h2|nt|passell: yes  he went quietly|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yvesj49: very good lead|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, that is the 8th trick|pg||
nt|jtr: @d finesse not fancied|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is still thinking.... |pg||
nt|tlc: looks a trick short...he can build 9 tricks, but not before def gets 5..|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems 800....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: match getting closer again|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and closed match again|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth better run for 6 tricks, now he might go 5 down|pg||
nt|ritong: he could not help:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|pbmarstr: I think Boye will have to trust in a defensive blunder|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment counting how many tricks he has|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe playing North for Ax@c is best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and he said Incredible board|pg||
nt|jtr: Then he can be endplayed even if he wins @cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: closed the screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ours is actually one of the closest matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: and slowest!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking questions |pg||
nt|jkotor: cause all Polish lost yesterday :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes looks realy distressed now|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: N has to play @C Q, and S has to play low to beat the contract|pg||
nt|jtr: He should see us!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he was shaking his head|pg||
nt|jtr: Yep So are we|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: boye does not look to gather any momentum...lol|pg||

nt|bessi2: a great technical play from Rodwell|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Boyd seemingly fidgets in his chair|pg||
nt|sommer: @Cshift needed to cause problems nowwww|pg||
nt|athene: squeezing every last drop out of his club spots - well when you overcall on such a threadbare suit you have to |pg||
nt|athene: sorry out of his spade spots|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd silently counts to himself|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: restart time for final set is scheduled for 30 minutes|pg||

nt|drewsky: What of declarer cashes 2 clubs....what does north pitch ?|pg||
nt|passell: another heart is ok too ducked|pg||
nt|kareno: Someone asking if a spade from dummy would draw the king from north.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry|pg||
nt|passell: can only cash 1|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer hasn't got two clubs to cash ??|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: now @HQ to king and ace, and @SJ, maybe|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: this is painful to watch|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: declarer's probably is he is getting a bit forced in diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: but if the defence force too much all that will do is strip west's exit cards so he will surely be endplayed in clubs |pg||
nt|sommer: endplay possible even for overtrick!|pg||
nt|bessi2: an interesting line would have been to cash the ace of spades play q of hearts.. ruff diamond and exit in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: well, you sort of don't mind fifties, but after a while they get a bit embarrassing|pg||
nt|algraves: Meck may regret not running to the hills as now he is booked for 3 down instead of 2 but that is his nature|pg||

nt|bessi2: indeed.. I wonder how he played it|pg||
nt|yvesj49: by email|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@H depends on the opening lead by greco|pg||
nt|jtr: @c wastage|pg||
nt|tlc: 4@c = pas/correct|pg||
nt|algraves: why would he want to ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on the flip-side   didn't Brogeland-Salensmind win one of the big pair events in this year's Summer NABC|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: quick down... this will be fast|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kareno: Thanks to our excellent operator for a job well done.  Keeps us informed on bids, plays and knee jiggles too :)  I love how you bring the room to life for us.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of pointing and writing|pg||
nt|toral5: 12 imps at stake here only on the opening lead|pg||
nt|sommer: tough to bid 2@S now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell says he should have taken the intrafinesse in spades instead of hearts perhaps?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but good!|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S now?|pg||
nt|rv: best defense is to win @d, @SK, @SA, @s ruff followed by a @c back|pg||
nt|athene: yes, just cut west's hand out of it completely|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|sommer: done:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tlc: so nickell has quietly sneaked into the lead...|pg||
nt|tlc: nice duck..u want brad to continue @D|pg||
nt|algraves: Fred will take his @S ruff now to get job one done which is to beat the conract|pg||
nt|athene: it's not trivial for south though - that would be wrong if it was west who had the @D3|pg||
nt|rv: I think Fred will win with @DJ and play @SK to get Moss's attitude for continuation of defense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: I thought S may get excited:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|caitlin: that's it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: killing lead|pg||
nt|toral5: beautiful lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow, found the diamond!! For the push.|pg||
nt|jtr: To be fair, HH have had a tremendous set|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1 spec told me we have to send director to hell !!!!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pbmarstr: Ace, king of @D should be of some value. Ought to cue 4 @D|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|tlc: i dont know if they know how to play the last segment with a lead....|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they know how to play from ahead?  I KNOW they know how to play from behind :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bessi2: many play this sequence as showing a better hand.. raising to 2@s immediately with that hand.. but they clearly dont play it that way|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|pbmarstr: This time off two aces of course|pg||
nt|caitlin: disagree!!|pg||
nt|rv: if Moss's discourages @s, he will try to cash @DA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: East may have a plan|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps they can drop a few IMPs these last couple bds so they're ready...|pg||
nt|jtr: Slowly formenting it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|algraves: no he wont|pg||
nt|algraves: he does not know how many spades declarer has so he cant read encourage or discourage|pg||
nt|rv: well defended especially @DQ by Fred asking Moss not to continue @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now spade ruff and a club and imps on the board|pg||
nt|warrens:  did Fred win the Q of @D?  does that run the risk of misleading Brad?|pg||
nt|athene: isn't there a danger the @DQ will do precisely that?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|kareno: Yes, I'm sure she has nice, expensive knees :)|pg||
nt|algraves: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: my guess was correct and confirmed by many   EW won the 2010 LM Pairs -- a 3-day 6-session event|pg||
nt|athene: north will think another diamond is cashing|pg||
nt|athene: @DQ was just very dangerous |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: it is barely possible that Greco will play this one quickly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzta: Nunes put the cards on the table..practising some thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: He should be an expert at it by now.......|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: W: EKxx-Ex-Dxxxxx-x|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is a timed event|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dK|mc|10|nt|algraves: that is the second Gitelman false card that has been mis interpreted|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there was no way moss could get it right anyway - even if south wins !J first time, he doesn't know the diamond count|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes... i just wanted to say that|pg||

nt|panja: he was guarding against @DK stiff in W hand...that is why the small @D first time|pg||
nt|fokal: some unbalanced hands here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|othered1: Finally, @C good and long enough toopen 2|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|toral5: dont know wt will be the final contract here|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia asks how many boards they are playing and is told 16 by Greco|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|panja: difficult for W to judge the hand, he has to take the conservative view that E is more likely to hold long Clubs than some 4-card Major on the side|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia asks about the 2 nt bid, which ws not alerted by Greco, and it looks like Hampson wrote natural :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|toral5: lol|pg||

nt|athene: are these 14-board segments?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth was glad his pd had a minimum :)|pg||
nt|sommer: guess so, yes|pg||
nt|dburn: too quickly for Fantoni, at any rate|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah Something made!|pg||
nt|daman: yes   he falsecarded on Board 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told 15|pg||
nt|sommer: 56 in total|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, they play 4x14 bfs|pg||
nt|gulyas: bds, sry|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or 15 (60)|pg||
nt|athene: why not 16? 16 is a nice number - it's a power of two!|pg||
nt|athene: 14 and 15 - well, they aren't a power of anything|pg||
nt|sommer: 15 it is ..60|pg||
nt|gulyas: it has something to do with WBF policy, how many bds a player can be forced to play on a given day|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all sessions before this were 14 boards in the Rosenblum, but yesterday they played 15 boards in the McConnel|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last 2 boards -- i'm a bit amazed that director hasn't been in the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is in the room|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he has retired?|pg||
nt|algraves: well he knows that declarer has only 8 tricks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kareno: Last hand of the set.|pg||
nt|toral5: karen u mind listening to a silly theory?|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 @C and @H A|pg||
nt|rv: Fred might have thought he might have cashed @DA if he had only @DAQ since partner has denied @DJ|pg||
nt|tlc: wouldnt fred have led back a low spade if he's wanted @D continuation?|pg||
nt|phil: (hi all) - I think the @dQ was an intelligent card - the J should say "I'm not looking for a spade ruff, just a cash out"|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I'm told in Nickell match both tables found @d lead without a clue|pg||
nt|toral5: its actually silly,but belladonna said this in his interview:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone have the video link?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco first alerted the diamond and then waved it off after seeubg the 1 @C opening|pg||
nt|caitlin: When are we back?|pg||
nt|athene: yes but he might have cashed the @SK just in case north had a diamond void|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|Walddk2: No more video today; tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: yes, Moss is at fault in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: No 'we.'  I won't be back today.  Sorry :(|pg||
nt|athene: i think after the @DQ it has to be south's fault when it all goes wrong|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: I think 56 is the magic number|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: What can he do? Disqualify both pairs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Thanks Roland.|pg||
nt|toral5: beladonna told in his interview to eric jannersten:whn u hold 2 EQUAL suits,add up the suits.and lead the suit with HIGHER total.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room has its own director|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h limited to about 13 points, unbalanced|pg||
nt|tlc: 2 more till the break...nice job Traian,,and thanks to the other commentators: Kare, Mike, and the Davids...and Drew if he passed the entrance exam :)|pg||
nt|tlc: that would be Karen...|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks Jim:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, Jim to you too!!|pg||
nt|algraves: when you false card and partner goes wrong it is your fault|pg||
nt|athene: when you falsecard partner, he always thinks either more or less than you expected him to - usually more|pg||
nt|phil: a parallel is winning the A from AK and leading a singleton - the King would deny the singleton|pg||
nt|athene: and it's almost always fatal|pg||
mb|5N|nt|jtr: Well, he can apportion fines maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: being the VG theater room|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: it all started in Beijing 2008|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stop play??   and as David says -- apportion fines|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ohhhhhhh   you're big room vugraph    so started later than other rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 15 min late|pg||
nt|jtr: It will be known who was slower if he was here all the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but to be honest i can not point my finger|pg||
nt|rv: good GS in @s in Moysian fit here|pg||
nt|algraves: it is not even close to being a parallel|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S = 3-suiter, short hearts?|pg||
nt|rv: I suppose 5n is choice of LS or GS here?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 5nt is pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|athene: south could still have a 4-card minor and just prefer 3nt, if he has good hearts, if it's a choice of games|pg||
nt|rv: only 7@D makes double dummy, but 7@S is better contract because of quality of trumps|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jtr: You need it for typing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: He was a fabulous player.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa scratches his head|pg||
nt|drewsky: well, not easy to see everything from my 1-phone....especially without reading glasses|pg||
nt|athene: but if they are in slam it will be better to play the 44 fit|pg||
nt|athene: yes i know there is no 4-4 fit on the hand, but i am saying that is why north bids 5nt |pg||
nt|algraves: I have a feeling that 3@S showed this 4-1-44 shape |pg||
nt|athene: north bids 5nt to say "we want to play slam but i am not sure which denomination"|pg||
nt|athene: south could have a 4-card minor for 3nt|pg||
nt|rv: Moss might just raise this|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|athene: south feels that he would never bid 3nt with four spades though so 6@S can't be misinterpreted|pg||
nt|ritong: and encounter 5/1 break|pg||
nt|tlc: another unlucky slam for NS if he bids 7..|pg||
nt|rv: real bad luck if they bid to excellent 7@S and go down because of 5-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Moss thinking|pg||
nt|athene: yes, they gain 13 moral imps and lose 17 real ones, or some such arithmetic|pg||
nt|ritong: not vul  14|pg||
nt|algraves: so 6 NT has 12 tricks, 7 @S has 13 with 5-2 @C and 4-2 @S|pg||
nt|algraves: as declarer can ruff a club|pg||
nt|algraves: but the 5-1 @s break dooms it|pg||
nt|algraves: so lets wait and see|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking at the moment...we have to wait|pg||
nt|xenya: 7@D is on|pg||
nt|athene: moss might take the view that finding a 4-3 fit slam is good enough in itself - no need to push for the grand|pg||
nt|rv: unlike in Gymnastics or Diving, we don't have any artistic or technical IMPs in bridge:)|pg||
nt|athene: but he has so many points he will expect any small slam to make anyway|pg||
nt|tlc: NT range here is 14-16?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: 4@c will not excite Boyd|pg||
nt|sommer: 1NT is 15-17...|pg||
nt|sommer: agree with upgrade|pg||
nt|rv: or moral IMPs as Henry put it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: as do I|pg||
nt|sommer: E's hand is more 16 than 14|pg||
nt|athene: this won't take too long|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson was caught red handed and everyone laughs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: finally|pg||
nt|algraves: well Fred may have bid this way with 4333 and AQX in hearts |pg||
nt|ritong: brad also knows that fred does not like his hand|pg||
nt|tlc: brad will briefly wish he had raised...|pg||
nt|rv: Moss will be unhappy when he sees dummy, he will a lot happier once he plays second round of @s:)|pg||
nt|ritong: if he did, he would no doubt have bid 6@h|pg||
nt|algraves: but we do have 35 hcp  that is enough for 6 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred went to the bathroom with the director|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Brad thinking now|pg||
nt|daman: right now he probably looks like someone who spilled turpentine on their pizza|pg||
pc|h2|nt|toral5: in my unpublished book,the gr8est.|pg||
nt|kareno: Call me anything but late to dinner (per my late father).|pg||
nt|passell: was your father Henny youngman?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|caitlin: Aww well thank you Karen....you always make commentating enjoyable and insightful! You still in Philly?|pg||
nt|toral5: he,benito and forquet..:)true legends of the game|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c can be made with the Morton's Fork coup.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's very, very unlikely to be bid, however.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i like to comment this sort of boards lol|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope.  Wouldn't have minded Henny for a father though.|pg||
nt|athene: when he finds the trump break he will look like someone who spilled turpentine on his pizza but then he found out it was his opponent's pizza|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|jtr: Oh dear, this might go down now|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: too eager to meet|pg||
nt|jtr: A @s lead next door gave a trick effectively|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: maybe not so unlikely lol|pg||
nt|kareno: Morton's Fork would be leading low to dummy's heart in this case.  If east ducks, heart goes away.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|kareno: Oh, can't be made because east can ruff second diamond - sorry, I tricked myself.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kareno: I love Morton's Fork coup so much I named my trading company after it years ago.|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: is there a technical term for sticking a Morton's Fork into partner on opening lead?|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyway, let's watch Duboin try to make six clubs.  Heart loser going away now.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can East be squeezed in the majors? Barnet Shenkin suggests that he can|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: But, Milton Berle style, he stole many good lines :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|caitlin: but will Greco get the ruff?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kareno: If only east had a doubleton diamond, Morton would work :)|pg||
nt|toral5: east will be under severe presure to guard Majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin shakes his head no and then sits back in his chair|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|tlc: you need the iVUgraph app Drew...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is there not a squeeze if declarer rises @HK at trick 1?|pg||
nt|toral5: CANT afford to cash @S.else no entry in hand for setting a M suit squeeze on east|pg||
nt|jkotor: but E can play @s after A@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more sighs from Duboin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jakub|pg||
nt|ritong: i suspect brad will burst out laughing|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|caitlin: fastest I have seen |pg||
nt|rv: is trying to ruff @cs absolutely safe in 6@s, I thought he will draw couple of rounds of trumps here:)|pg||
nt|algraves: so it seems safe to cross in @D and ruff club|pg||
nt|athene: then they will all play the famous parlour game "guess what contract zia wandered into next door"|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer has communication hearts then|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco says you have to leave the cards out|pg||
nt|kareno: Tough hand.  South preparing squeeze but spade return will break that up I think.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|toral5: @S will kill communication now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jkotor: still gib wins it somehow, but after @c now, finesse @d and?|pg||
nt|jtr: Not a single game swing the whole set  Not that there have been many game contracts|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it will but not after @HK at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: club to hand, @D finesse, @DA and the trumps -- 2 tricks ago|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll try to ruff out the heart jack.|pg||
nt|kareno: And down he will go.|pg||
nt|jtr: 33IMPs in bits and pieces|pg||
nt|jtr: 37 now|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Brad was imagining he was in GS when he started delcaring this hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kareno: True, Roland.  You need to look very far into your telescope to see that at trick one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye for now :)|pg||

nt|fokal: since @s are 5-1|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||

nt|yvesj49: how can we stop hamman ? lol|pg||
nt|toral5: ahh.finally a 2 digit pick up in this match|pg||
nt|panja: funny % situation...with the @S spots....in 7@S you can cater to a 52 Club break....but not in 7@D...but against a 51 trump break both are bad....7@S just slightly better %|pg||
nt|othered1: Zia's 1-bids are usually quite sound, so north will be looking for 7|pg||
nt|fokal: what does 1@s mean ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: slam on board 9|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|toral5: reasonable 6@S they bid.4-1 break :(|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|3for3: 6@D for 3rd round control, in my partnerships|pg||

nt|yvesj49: Zia is triyng to stop soon|pg||
nt|toral5: zia can be as gud as qx @D|pg||
nt|fokal: I know most US players bid 2@ss with only 3 cards, but I though it was with unbalanced hands, well here, since 1@s shows 4 good @s I guess you can bid 2@s as long as you have Hxx|pg||
nt|panja: they will play in @S..|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 7@d pas pas pass lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Hamman shows up fingers to show Zia's keycards presumably for hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: but if they find out about the @DQ, they will bid 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: has the @D fit or a mini-fit known here?|pg||

pc|d7|nt|3for3: I have no idea what 5nt was.  hamman had all of the kings outside of spades|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but 37-0   |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will be back in aprox 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: with the last set|pg||
nt|rv: we play 16 boards in every segment in finals, so this and 1 more|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry Fred and claimed 12.... why sorry.... i misspalyed it .... and laughed|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly, yes |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H 1-round-force|pg||
nt|jtr: A chance at last for Strul|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 26 minutes to play one board, and to drink a coffee no time for shower lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in france it's 18:34|pg||
nt|jtr: Thinnish values for game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: for fantunes|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, private|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: usually 14+ HCP, but maybe 12/13 with 5@H & 4@S   [as we see here]|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: At last a chance to get some IMPs for Strul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N= 5+ HCP, 3+@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now East in the tank..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director said you should be finished by now|pg||
nt|tez: in turkey 19:37 :) |pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the structure from here -- probably 3@H saying reject game try    [without interference]|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bet theses guys will bid slam|pg||
nt|dburn: better let them use Blackwood|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|jtr: To be fair on the players time wise, all these part scores do take up a lot of time|pg||
nt|dburn: then, they won't bid a slam - if you make them guess, they might|pg||
nt|yvesj49: key cards BW is boring here|pg||
nt|jtr: But i guess it will be bid|pg||
nt|passell: this is the match of the year  cant wait for the last segment|pg||
nt|athene: zia didn't try for a diamond ruff here - just drew trumps and knocked out the heart|pg||
nt|rv: 4 segments of 16 boards will decide this match |pg||
nt|athene: and ended up dropping the @DQ|pg||
nt|algraves: 6@S a very good contract|pg||
nt|athene: although it looks against the odds|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sommer: very lucky 10 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 1nt because he doesn't think he is good enough for 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand gestures on the alerts|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very heavy 3@S there|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S, declarer won't want to draw all the trumps because he wants a heart ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: ..exept with @Slead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth and Rodwell still discussing the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told EW play "strong weak-2@S opener" so 1@S - 1nt; 2@S is a good hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the last hand of this set|pg||
nt|jtr: Few 'routine' contracts|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe 2 Aces out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thwy will be pushed there probably|pg||
nt|passell: 1100 here if dbl|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Hmapson is helping them|pg||
nt|tlc: me neither..really exciting!|pg||
nt|rv: 3@S must be showing semi-solid/solid suit|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: so 1@S - 1nt; 3@S is a very good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Philadelphia Vugraph Archives at  http://www.bridgefederation.ch/2010/wtc/index.html  courtesy of Yvan Calame|pg||
nt|dburn: they use Turbo, but the effect is the same - they will discover that there are two key cards missing if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|rv: Moss will bid 4@d here|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: Fred hasn't had so much luck this set with "solid" spade suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I imagine they will restart as soon as they can compare.  This is the third of four sets.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Gitelman will pass here which should be forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Fred's 3@s shows solid suit and doesn't promise extras though as per knowledgable specs|pg||
mb|5S|nt|gulyas: in that case, this is almost forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asks about the 9 @C lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the end|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i lost|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the match now|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@H last train slam try?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: all my money|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i go to the bank for the 2nd round|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching back shortly|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it was a great show|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set...sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: great to watch|pg||
nt|passell: finally a good hand for Bobby Wolff he refuses to play key card|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Similar auction|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nobody doubled. Still a chance|pg||
nt|jtr: Standard Norwegian i am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes ... a chance to improve the 0|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A decent slam in norwegian. Needs S to lead diamond ace. But thereafter good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes did not lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so screen stil down|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe Traian could ask them just to play on?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i need a break... forget about them|pg||
nt|jtr: I bet|pg||
nt|passell: same auction at the other table except hamman bid 3nt instead of passing 2spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I am told a standard Norwegian slam is where the opponents cash 2 aces then wait for their trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|jtr: I cannot myself comment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: fast play i guess|pg||
nt|tez: enjoyed a lot:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they did not bother playing it lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: back very shortly! ty Traian,our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|daman: tilt|pg||
nt|rv: maybe 5@h by Moss here with @CA and @h values|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: :(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: he has 3 trumps, an A, and a possible ruff, not a bad hand|pg||
nt|tlc: so,, more IMPs to nickell,, they took the low road here and landed in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@D is a cue for spades, moss feels he hasn't really got any extras|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|jtr: An Irish slam for those that ask, is where the opponents take their 2 trump tricks and then wait for their Ace(s)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sommer: now..a @C?|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the first trick might have been wise if the lead was a doubleton|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|bessi2: oh no.. this is still making since he played a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: odwell leads high from a singleton :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: <meckstroth agrees <<<|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to set up a club trick using the trumps and @DA as entry|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pbmarstr: No the slam has excellent chances. All you have to do is lead Q of @D from hand and S to take the Ace|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine this was an invitational sequence.  |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bessi2: he is on his way down it seems|pg||
nt|athene: he surely didn't duck this queen|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, this was not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson goes hmm on the drop of the spade queen|pg||
nt|athene: he led to the @DA and played a heart up|pg||
nt|sommer: @C3 would work!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bessi2: exactly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sommer: wow..the @C3:)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jtr: East hand looks pretty good to decline it|pg||
nt|algraves: so the Meckwell interference took away the comfort level to have a more secure auction|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sommer: he can claim now:)|pg||
nt|athene: he is planning to draw trumps ending in dummy and just lead the @C7|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson talking to Meckstroth and chuckling|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he gets lucky even with @Cs 5-1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson shows his hand|pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth could have returned a small club after winning the queen, but it wouldn't have helped|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|athene: decalrer could just ruff high, draw trumps, and set up the club|pg||
nt|athene: dummy's club spots and @S8 are nice cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the players have left and bye for now >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>:)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|sommer: guess this was the last...tnx all:)..tnx kibz for your remarcs|pg||
nt|gulyas: tx all - sry abt the score, but the connection was lost, and running scores are down, too|pg||
nt|gulyas: Nickell was up by abt 25 the last time we knew|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but we can say Nickel leads "a bit"|pg||
nt|sommer: 25-6 it was|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was 31-6 at some point|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear that Zia went down in the same 4@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the lead is more now|pg||
nt|gulyas: making a wild guess: Nickell up by at least 35|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, more news: Zia made the 4@S, but the score maybe 39-6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: woow...|pg||
nt|algraves: and earned 13 imps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|pbmarstr: See|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh no!|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree, even nv.  It is a good hand.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: He played too quickly!|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it was at all a given that south was going to make 6@S here if he bid it|pg||
nt|athene: why not play east for the @DQ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzta: woooow|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks Traian  Great job|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Do they play a serious/nonserious 3N?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia talks about the past spade break|pg||
pc|c4|nt|toral5: interchange the @D q position|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps they play 4@C as shortness|pg||
nt|3for3: and 3nt as balanced slam try|pg||
nt|fokal: not that easy to play. On @c lead, you can't play on the @hs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|panja: have to be careful here..to be able to ruff a @H in time.to discard a @D..else @D finesse that goes wrong|pg||
nt|fokal: if East ducks the first round|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|toral5: he will end up making cos of @D q fall|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|toral5: he CAN go down now|pg||
nt|fokal: I'm not sure he is going to win this contract|pg||
nt|othered1: Intersting that on board 10 Meckstroth did not open 1N, preferring 1@D and would up defending 4@SX for -10 imps.  |pg||
nt|toral5: if he gives @D length in east than % is to finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hum.....|pg||

pc|s9|nt|fokal: well declarer doesn't know that W has 4 @hs|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @c from dummy ???|pg||
nt|toral5: what if he had played LOW @H at trick 2?god wont punish when @H will be 5-1|pg||
nt|toral5: i bet he is down now|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the cards have been flying and Ziais left with the KKJ @D|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Zia took the finesse|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|toral5: so 1 down?|pg||
nt|kareno: rehi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: but Hampson was squeezed and the result is made 6, so he must have played the king, he was switching back and forth|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching the show|pg||
nt|ritong: three slams in a row can be called a show i guess|pg||
nt|daman: could be a big swing right back|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in 35 mins with the next set|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: EW traditional polish club when vulnerable, agressive strong club not vul|pg||
nt|jkotor: prec style 2@c 11-14, 5+ unbal|pg||
nt|toral5: here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Nickell in front for a change|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you can set up the hearts when east wins his ace on the first round|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: this, though, could not really be called a slam|pg||
nt|athene: but what if he unsportingly ducks the first heart and returns a diamond to take the entry out|pg||
nt|algraves: 30 points and 9 @D|pg||
nt|algraves: you can see how they got too high|pg||
nt|rv: NS might have dodged slam bullet after North's pass and Meckstorth opening:)|pg||
nt|algraves: but not now with meck opening|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: wow, Greco passed that hand in third seat!|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 5@H is a good save for N-S here but with some defense in each hand and no shortness, E-W will probably buy it for 4@S.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = nF by 90% of Polish|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like west found a gr8 @D lead to beat 3@S in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and some more thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: as u see 4 card opening in major by the norwegian pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the cards now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still no sign of making a bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just trying for a swing board, knowing Meckstroth will be right there with 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that a crime? He does not have an opener :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|algraves: no nobody trying to cause swings in this match|pg||
nt|athene: well, passing looks a bit of a girlie action to me|pg||
nt|ritong: crime was perpetrated otherr room|pg||
nt|algraves: well that is why we are here and they are there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred put the cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thinking|pg||
nt|rv: Fred could bid 3@s here to setup GF since 3m might be non-forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: they got to 6@d after getting doubled in @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: something is wrong in paradise|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if Moss's 2@s is Inv+ or promises another bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  on the last board, if East holds up on the first @H, declarer has to guess the position to make, which Zia did|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: difficult for north to resist with tht hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: correction: only 4 card in @h and 5 in @s|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: yes - no-one can see quite why he took that view|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: he had a count at that point so isn't it 5:2 that the @DQ is with east?|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes. and apparently he dropped it|pg||
nt|rv: with 55 in reds, I much prefer 3@h or 4@h with Moss hand instead of nebulous 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west just was obviously in trouble on the discards and zia backed his table feel|pg||
nt|rv: Fred is definitely confused here trying to figure out what Moss has|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred back in the tank now|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he will eventually pass since he is not sure if 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he is stil thinking|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 3@S is interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: besides, it makes:)|pg||
nt|athene: most would play that as showing a top honour, for the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bingo|pg||
nt|dburn: usually "don't lead a spade"|pg||
nt|athene: yes it means that if he has bid spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: if only 5@c West will have a 4-card major|pg||
nt|algraves: I think they play double dont lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought anti-lead doubles only applied from a player who has actually bid the suit though|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's double of 3@s says don't lead @s, normally he should have a good alternate lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will go to the break with a realy close match|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he pscyhed double thinking opps could have a slam after 3rd seat Meckstorth opening|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk3: Martens did the right thing|pg||
nt|jkotor: yup, with 4@d-5@c -> 1@d, unless they play different than others|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are starting with board 16 and playing 14 boards this session|pg||
nt|toral5: 4 losers in this game.so we begin with a push|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|toral5: lol|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|yvesj49: no slam after the double|pg||
nt|othered1: What's 3@S?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good question.....|pg||
nt|panja: some form of puppet to describe responder's hand further|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia is writing an explanation of the 3 @S bid, but since I cannot see the cards at times, I surely cannot see what he is writing lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|nt|othered1: a scary redouble|pg||
nt|toral5: if they play 3nt,please thank @S 10|pg||
nt|panja: the unintended consequence of the 3@S bid is that defenders know the best lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: all pass just made lol|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia pulls out the 4 @S bidding card and then puts it back in his bidding box|pg||
nt|panja: this would have been pretty bad at MPs|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess 3@s was some sort of move to slam.  Now they have to pick the right game.  Either works fiine with the lay of hearts and diamonds.  Actually 3nt just plain cold.|pg||
nt|toral5: can zia pass?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good idea|pg||
nt|toral5: i guess it MAKES|pg||
nt|3for3: i doubt zia will pass|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|toral5: but a very premature x by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|panja: why is it a premature double?|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s xx would be a fine result actually but they look headed for a red suit game.|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about all this - Zia plays most of those redoubles as showing the ace|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
nt|panja: on any non-Spade lead there are 13 tricks for NS|pg||
nt|toral5: why its NOT premature?entering in a healthy sequence?|pg||
nt|dburn: so he will bid too much|pg||
nt|yvesj49: to play ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia and Hampson are writing while Hamman is thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: They're now getting into the stratosphere|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|yvesj49: and greco in the restroom ? lol|pg||
nt|toral5: tragedy now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|kareno: And too high.|pg||
nt|3for3: very wow|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Zia says Bob, you tell them what you've got, as I said hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|yvesj49: incredible after west's double|pg||
nt|yvesj49: east*|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|toral5: a kib says:greco please lead high @S,hampson pl give CORRECT count|pg||
nt|3for3: note that north and east are on the same side of the screen|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume e/w have some signals for length on this lead.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|3for3: so no chance zia gave greco the wrong explanation of anything|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: If the system is too complex for these particular guys to navigate correctly, maybe it's simply too complex to use. How many good results will be needed to pick up this disaster?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yvesj49: 2 down|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|yvesj49: 1*|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|kareno: 1|pg||
mc|11|nt|dburn: this wasn't "complex" - as I say, Zia just thought Hamman would have the ace of spades for his redouble|pg||
nt|kareno: They are certainly accident prone.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bye all see you later (alligator)|pg||
nt|toral5: tnk u all|pg||
nt|kareno: au revoir :)|pg||
nt|othered1: thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|toral5: whr is the alligator?|pg||

nt|toral5: bye bye|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
nt|toral5: bye karen:)|pg||
nt|toral5: and DONT go 4 another meeting|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: another BBO operator will be working the closed room for the second session, but allig8r (Ala) should be back for the last two, I believe :)|pg||
nt|fokal: Bye everyone|pg||
nt|fokal: biz|pg||
