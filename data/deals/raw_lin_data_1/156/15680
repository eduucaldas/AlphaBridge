mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: some play that after 1M-dbl-redbl-2m, pass is forcing - but East was third in hand and West was a passed hand, so maybe that should not necessarily apply|pg||

mb|2C|nt|athene: certainly when you are relaxed and not nervous your judgement is better, so if you have a good board you are more likely to play well on the next, i think|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: That will mean something odd will happen now |pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|athene: west must have known that if his side started doubling, NS would end up in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: probably that's why west in the other room just bid 4@H - although maybe his double of 2@C would not have been penalty i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|athene: i suspect west thought his pass was forcing there|pg||
nt|athene: this is one of the problems when you go out of your way to try to penalize opps rather than just bidding your own contract|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might have predicted this would happen--it is crucial if you make a penalty double that pass is forcing |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|athene: if you can't penalize them you often find yourself in a worse position|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|garnetts: As usual when I predict something this happens --still North needed some solace |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: Finally N will have something to smile about when he discovers @S or not 3-3 and 4@H a make|pg||
nt|athene: well, i am not sure it's clearcut - sometimes for example you might pass partner's takeout double with a stack in just the one suit, but you don't necessarily want pass to be ...|pg||

nt|pelu: EW was in 5@DX (easy making) - East moved to 5@H - 5@S and 6@H by West|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|nicksan: North's 1 @S is a fasionable method to show values without 4 spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so maybe 5@C was best, in hindsight|pg||
nt|vbman: now h lead might be dangerous for defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: which is normal after the dbl|pg||
nt|vbman: needs to finesse and survive the tap|pg||
nt|vbman: 10 is normal though|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|peachy: 3NT also was wrongsided for heart lead|pg||

nt|athene: if west had thought his pass of 2@S was not forcing i am sure he would have just bid 4@H over 2@S|pg||

nt|garnetts: he will be reliving this for the next few weeks ---flashbacks --happens to me all the time --the scars from years ago|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

nt|athene: well, if north has the @HK there's no way to make|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|hQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: so you might as well play for him to have the trumps and not the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and he surely wasn't doubling with a void in trumps - i just don't understand the play at all|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests he can't handle the breaks in the rounded suits anyway|pg||
nt|garnetts: one thing that is a little strange --a couple of hands ago South made a void showing bid after an overcall--I was thinking why not here also |pg||
nt|garnetts: or even some fit jump like 3@D |pg||
nt|athene: let's say he started with @CQ - ok, north wins and forces again in diamonds - now if you draw all his trumps you haven't got any trumps in hand so no entry to the hearts, right?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S is squeezed in @d and @h after another @d ruff, so W can make if he plays @cQ|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: that hand surely is a max for a 15-17 nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hej Ralf, welcome back|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hi Ralph|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland and David!|pg||
nt|garnetts: sorry Ralf my English getting the better of me :(|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course if partner has exactly the right hand you might miss 3nt but on balance i think you will get there most of the time you want to be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hello Bill|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the minor suits aren't the trick sources EW are hoping, here|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a normal contract and it will need some play|pg||
nt|athene: heart spots are nice though (@H7)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Oh dear :(  Old adage lead partner's suit ) |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: it's 4th from longest and strongest, roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is|pg||
nt|athene: in general i have sympathy for people trying plausible alternative leads to partner's suit but i'm not sure about this one - you do have two hearts not one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I still don't understand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: Or better still in this case the J@S  :)  lol|pg||
nt|athene: also clubs are very likely to be opponent's suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: isn´t a @s lead more natural from S point of view?|pg||
nt|athene: and you don't have an entry|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @SJ is a definite possibility|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cal me old-fashioned but I would lead @H9|pg||
nt|athene: for a club to score a goal you really want partner to have three; and if declarer has the ace it wants to be doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: that's asking a lot|pg||
nt|garnetts: When I have no great reason for leading another suit other than the one partner bids I lead that suit--including over what might be a short club--it keeps them happy |pg||
nt|athene: there are other layouts where a club is not killing but still safe, sure...|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: seems N doesnt want to play a card here|pg||
nt|athene: so the lead gives a trick, gives a tempo AND squeezes partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: but other than that it's OK|pg||
nt|garnetts: he wiull play a spade--it seems he might  think partner has a stiff heart |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't blame him|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: maybe he can get away by playing a PASS card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but then might as well play a heart |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give him a NT card|pg||
nt|athene: well, north will be thinking about south's distribution|pg||
nt|garnetts: I remember leading another suit like this once and my partner's discard was an ace--the feel good factor |pg||
nt|athene: let's say she has five clubs - she has to have two diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: Notice the word once |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 'I opened 1@H partner; maybe you did not see'|pg||
nt|athene: if she had five spades she would lead one of those, surely|pg||
nt|athene: so she has to have two hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess there are other possibilities - for example declarer might have only a singleton diamond? would you overcall 1nt with 2-5-1-5?|pg||
nt|garnetts: My dear wife Jane Preddy once asked her partner in this situation--are you hard of hearing |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: E asks if N has realized dummy has played a card. would be a silly situation if N was waiting for E to act|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I see it N has to discard a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: at least 5min have passed by |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Artur is usually very quick, so he sure has a problem after this long in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: webcam from this table: http://bridgefestival.no/refresh1.htm|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: back to square one--oh well I once went to the bar to await a card from Barnet Shenken--before claiming ten tricks --it took 21 minutes :)|pg||

nt|athene: one drawback of north's huge think at trick 1 is that is pretty much told declarer everything - although i guess he knew it already|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure he did |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: but when it's a 5-minute think you know north has no suit he can spare a card from so he has to have 4-5-4-0 and all the cards almost for sure|pg||

pc|h5|nt|pelu: in OR East - after small @C to @C8 - play @CAK and N discard 2x@H - later endplay for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ciaran: well done by north - making E commit  early|pg||
nt|ciaran: that was well played - likely to be safe to cash the clubs since north opened and is marked with the missing points|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|nicksan: This will be the last board of the first half, and another 5 IMP's to Trondelag will bring them to a deficit of only 5. All to play for in the second half. |pg||
