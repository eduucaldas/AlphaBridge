nt|swanson: took|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so they started brd 17|pg||
nt|toral5: another dull push coming up|pg||
nt|ady: so declarr played a trump|pg||
nt|tlc: hi karen and alan :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are off|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fasten your seatbelts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I live 3 mins from Stamford Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director came in the room and said GO|pg||
nt|norby: very similar system grco ham and meckwelll|pg||
nt|pelu: here we go and start with a potensional slam|pg||
mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|tlc: Fasten your seatbelts...showtime!|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: spectators are expecting some early fireworks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is the action man|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|algraves: NS on @S Guess for 6|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Traian and last he made an error was in 1987|pg||
nt|algraves: no this is the well known meckwell and the great young Israeli pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 2n with East hand showing @C+@h split range?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: i guess it's the sixth heart that stopped him, rather than being so weak|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstorth|pg||
nt|algraves: EW have 8 tricks in  @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell-Meck in 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: now north needs a support re-redouble :)|pg||
nt|norby: i prefere 1 hearts with 6 heart, if 6 diamond and 5 heart better bid 2 suiter|pg||
nt|rv: Meckstroth certainly chose winning bid especially with Rodwell having other 2 suits:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
nt|athene: not so useful when south has denied five spades though|pg||
nt|norby: sorry 6 club and 5 heart|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: no one steals from West|pg||
nt|algraves: we are finding out what system they play|pg||
nt|athene: east's choice of rebid suggests it was indeed the sixth heart he was thinking about when he bid 1@H rather than 2nt|pg||
nt|rv: does 1@s substitute for supp X with north hand?|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to get that sixth heart into it - he might bid clubs later maybe if it seems like a good idea i suppose|pg||
nt|norby: stron hand only|pg||
nt|norby: strong|pg||
nt|algraves: he is 4333 and doesnt want to encourage anything|pg||
nt|algraves: A lot of bidding around Rodwell|pg||
nt|algraves: with the best hand at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rod thinking now|pg||
nt|athene: he might raise hearts now|pg||
nt|algraves: I think XX showed exactly 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: is Greco's 2@s conventional if Hampson didn''t show 3@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: was not alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you want to be in slam 6@D is better than 6@S because of the lesser risk of a ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D with 5@S is new animal for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: North opened 2@D (multi) in CR, almost forced EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 22 hcp 3NT  CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yuval Yener and David Burn|pg||
nt|athene: well, 2@S says he wants to compete but he is known to have only four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so logically he must be prepared for north to pull to 3minor|pg||
nt|athene: i expected 3@H from west but he doesn't mess about :)|pg||
nt|rv: normally Rodwell gives allowance for Meckstorth's aggressive bids, this time he doesn't|pg||
nt|pelu: no EW bidding - lead @d|pg||
nt|algraves: well it is just standard 2 over 1, not a diamond raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess the 3@C bid will make you guess the spades|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzta: more imps now for nickel|pg||
nt|dburn: except perhaps East, who thinks his partner might have something|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW plays 2/1 with transfers in responses over 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: so this plays well with the friendly hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing too fancy|pg||
nt|kareno: David, you know my feelings on the subject - you must get in the auction when it is appropriate and this time \i feel it is definitely appropriate :)|pg||
nt|tlc: and the friendly clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: probably 9 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asking about leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably too much action|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks like quite a lot of bidding|pg||
nt|algraves: yes exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodwell didn't open the Greco hand|pg||
nt|algraves: no reason particularly to guess spades in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Nickell seems to thrive if they are 40 behind. So maybe a slam swing here will be useful :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D better that 6@S - risk in 6@s a @D-ruff|pg||
mb|4N|nt|algraves: for sure 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|dburn: this is where you are supposed to run the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play israeli standard souped up no doubt which is a straight forward natural approach |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
nt|algraves: undoubtedly very good card players and fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks that 5d was prefered in the closed as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco doubled in a flash|pg||
nt|pelu: but also a @S ruff could be setup with 3 @s and @DA on same hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but a lesser risk|pg||
mb|5S|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he can make it if they don't lead a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this is 2 down on accurate defense even after this lead|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is definitely better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: did have 2 hearts  1 spade   and K@D on 3rd heart   but not now|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but maybe the auction indicated a club lead - not sure exactly what the later rounds meant, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance for a swing from the word go|pg||
nt|rv: defense should get 3@cs and 2@h if they can shift to @h in time|pg||
nt|algraves: So Meck is playing with a lot of information but it wont help him much|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell making a comment about the tray being slow coming back|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Rodwell played Meck for more since he didn't bid 2@h or 2n in first round|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows the spades and the diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think unhappy with something|pg||
nt|algraves: so they stop off a key card and the trump q very disciplined|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
nt|norby: strange double of greco, probabily understimate rodwell?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just impressed they knew what was trump|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: or, of course, not play on hearts at all - although I am not quite sure why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell thinking north took a long time to pass 4@H and that influenced the double?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think so|pg||
nt|norby: i think also with 5 hearts and 8 club:-))) |pg||
nt|pelu: S know rhey are missing 1Ace and @SQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: yes he needed to judge between under-estimating Rodwell to over-estimating Meckstorth:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost impossible to over-estimate meckstroth's aggression|pg||
nt|norby: sorry for my italenglish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only my Spanish/Italian was half as good as your English|pg||
nt|rv: np Norby, message (bridge language) is very clear:)|pg||
nt|norby: ty:-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco in the tank now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: have to say 3NT   ambitious  in CR    but came home|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he won't make it|pg||
nt|algraves: well he wont make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: may be ducking the spade was wiser|pg||
nt|rv: now @s back best|pg||

nt|iceking: Big question here is can Nickell come from behind once again|pg||
nt|athene: hello again everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|iceking: Hi William welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D is balanced 8-10|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: the idea is you get into game (3nt or 4major) quickly and unrevealingly|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|iceking: 3@H probably 4 card raise |pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth might get interested facing four-card support, but he does need rodwell to have very specific cards in his eight count|pg||
nt|athene: @SKQ @DK|pg||
nt|athene: asking a lot for partner to have NOTHING wasted|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth deep in thought|pg||
nt|iceking: might be a bad start for Nickell if they bid this one |pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand he might quite fancy a slam missing queen to four trumps and an ace|pg||
nt|athene: given the state of the match|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed |pg||
nt|phil: 3N would be serious wouldn't it? |pg||
nt|athene: he would bid slam if he knew what he was facing - but he would bid it in diamonds|pg||
nt|iceking: might bid 4@C to get the tempo right for 4@D quebid from pd|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: bids are not input until the board is passed underneath the screen.  By this method, the players have no idea of the tempo of bids from my clicking.  Still, I miss passes and add ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: passes, so please catch me :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|athene: 4@C will be bad news - but north has such a huge hand for a passed hand, he might go on himself anyway now that south has shown any slam interest at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: here 3nt probably serious|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth writing another note to Moss|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see any reason Meckstrooth guessing trumps here|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose Meckstroth *might* decide that the other room will be in six and will take the percentage play in trumps (AK) so he might take the finesse to get a swing, since flat ...|pg||
nt|athene: boards are no use|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|passell: 6 diamonds much better than 6spades avoids dia ruff for 1|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth gives a signal to Moss that 6  was a shut up bid|pg||
nt|athene: but 21 imps down with 16 to play is not perhaps the time for plays of that kind|pg||
nt|iceking: yes 6@D would be better spot |pg||
nt|athene: it's not that desperate|pg||
nt|iceking: he isnt worried only down 21 imps |pg||
nt|passell: a rare bad system hand with 2diamonds taking up room to get his suits in play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|iceking: as we see the correct spade play is put down dummys K |pg||
nt|athene: i would say 1@C-2@D is a good start|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: he can never handle 4-0 break unless East has all trumps|pg||
nt|passell: cant get back to the dummy anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: coffee, very large, is delivered to E and W, while Meckwell already have their's|pg||
nt|iceking: true will not have entry to dummy if W continues @D |pg||
nt|iceking: this could end up as very importand guess |pg||
nt|dburn: Fred had better drink some of his nonchalantly, in order not to look like a man with queen third of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss sighs and puts his cards down on the table|pg||
nt|passell: moss did well not to bid  I think he would have picked up trumps for sure if he did|pg||
nt|athene: west knows nothing about meckstroth's hand except that he has a spade suit|pg||
nt|iceking: the more time Moss takes maybe Meck can sniff out he doesnt have SQ am i dreaming?|pg||
nt|athene: he might be thinking about a club void in east's hand - but then there would have been a lightner double maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss picks up his cards and then puts them down again for more thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: not dreaming at all - someone looking at @sQ might not be taking so much time to defend|pg||
nt|iceking: been told Zia made a 3@C preempt in open room, not good news for Nickell|pg||
nt|passell: zia did bid at the other table  so likely he will get spades right|pg||
nt|iceking: and after playing for 12 days is Meck still that sharp he will sniff this out|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand hasn't zia said that it can be good to pre-empt with side queens, as declarer will never play you for them?|pg||
nt|passell: very unlikely  but you never know|pg||
nt|iceking: well 12 days isnt correct been shorter time|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps that sort of jaunt is only from his younger days|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss taps his finger on the felt of the table, but leans back again for more thinking|pg||
nt|passell: hard to imagine playing anything but a diamond here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|iceking: now drum rolls|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s OR|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth puts his hands on the table and thinks|pg||
nt|passell: 23 imps swing on trump play|pg||
nt|iceking: good start he is thinking:)|pg||
nt|phil: can he possibly have any reason to get this right? |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss stares at Meckstroth|pg||
nt|passell: hard to play moss for 2-1 |pg||
nt|athene: he might think that spades are more likely 2-2 because opps didn't do anything with a lot of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: only the time it took Moss to play to the second trick - whether that's a "reason" or not, I don't know|pg||
nt|iceking: he should know Moss does not have Qxx or his table behavious would have been rather un ethical am i right?|pg||
nt|passell: might play moss for spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth asks what EW play over Meckwell's 1 @C opening and gets a lengthy explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth says sorry pd but I wish I could claim and Moss says you can, but for down 1|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont think Moss can sigh there and take long pause with Qxx in trumps |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Gitelman says you are down 1|pg||
nt|iceking: ouch |pg||
mc|11|nt|passell: might have made it after moss comment|pg||
pg||
qx|o18|st||md|4SQJ74HAKJTDKCA862,ST9852H86DJT2CQT5,SK3H54DQ875CKJ743,SA6HQ9732DA9643C9|sv|n|nt|swanson: Delicate but obviously the lead style has merit - there are many great pairs which use them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||
nt|dburn: ducking the spade would have been a bad idea if South held the king of hearts, which was what Pachtman was playing for|pg||
nt|algraves: well yes but then heshould have just played on hearts at trick two|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he was going to do that, he might as well have played on hearts earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we start final 16 boards with a double digit swing -- but in which direction?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: inresting in this matchwe have Norway NS at both tables - in CR: Brogeland-Sælensminde|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: match tied|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s down|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jkotor: 10-16 this vul|pg||
nt|algraves: you want the other guys to know that you are prepared to back your judgement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, extra boards and we have them ready|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   Meck misguessed @S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|algraves: oh well , easy when you see them all as they say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|algraves: kudo to Brad Moss for not overcalling the big club opener in other room and tipping off the @S shortness|pg||
nt|algraves: Passing is under rated these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: effectively 47 brd shootout|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: 1@h by E would've been 3 cards support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  0-2 hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 2@c denies|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: West thinking now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell Pachtman discussing system the other side of the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@d is forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL someone was complaining to me yesterday about the transfer responses - I had to explain that they are almost standard in some quarters of the expert community\|pg||
nt|yuval10: says nothing about @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: @d sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: both sides of the screen writting explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i can see none of it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzta: Hamman asks about the bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c and 2@s after @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: a question is written|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  standard signals  [if Hamman gives any]|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can afford to misguess clubs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D just shows 5+@ds GF or is it conventional?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 more to Diamond|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzta: 2h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman gave him 2 fingers|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play a standard start with a very modern approach after that with transfers and information requesting waiting bids etc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's actually 'natural' after he already denied as many as three|pg||
nt|algraves: anad more to come no doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck did not know he is on lead lool|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzta: and HH landed in 3d|pg||
nt|algraves: the future will be to bid games giving away as little as possible|pg||
nt|algraves: and try and position NT contracts  if possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asked him do you know you are on lead?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|toral5: nice 2nd dbl from helgemo|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT played the other way up, likely to make |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|toral5: looks like a make here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: thinking what to discard from dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks normal to pitch a diamond and play @HAx hoping for another trick somewhere|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: but there will be a 2nd discard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me remind specs that the Nickell team came back from 40 IMPs down with 8 boards to go the other day, so nothing is decided|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DJ lead and small from East the safeplay is to finess in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They won the last 8 boards 47-0!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jkotor: with blocking @c@c|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzta: lets see now|pg||
nt|pelu: prob need to finess @D9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice support dummy has|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S10 might have been Smith -- saying i like @H   but only because hates everything else|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: going for hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: I am a gambler :) I bet a coke on Diamond :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just top of a sequence when following to declarer's suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|toral5: @D 9 cant be promoted cos north has a 4th @S pitch on @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you giving odds  and/or imps??|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rmb1: A small club now and south will make @CQ and @HK and no more|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||
nt|ady: now must go up with ace|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer has to win and hope @D are stopped|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment he is thinking|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but after 1@C - 2@D you aren't going to bid |pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|iceking: 32 now |pg||
nt|iceking: 15 left we seen Nickell done it before|pg||
nt|athene: but if Moss is a known "keep quiet" sort of guy of course that isn't such a big consideration|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|phil: Moss plays poker - its the quiet player you have to be wary of :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: 15 imps|pg||
nt|udo: 15:0 after 2|pg||
nt|algraves: 31 imps with 14 to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: so meckwell defend accurately and of course Greco settles for his contracdt|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jkotor: but what is 1 trick between the true friends !|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs some more|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good NS result next door|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT    on for n/s  as they lay|pg||
nt|tlc: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will play in 3NT of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: do they know how to be in front feels|pg||
nt|rv: Both Wolfson and Nickell played only 1 set each (25% of boards) each in semis|pg||
nt|norby: i dont like 2 nt with 2 small heart......difference style|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: i have to admit to  strong bias in favour of Wolfson and hope i have arrived in time to see a late rally|pg||
nt|jtr: not the start needed by Wolfson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+   EW get to choose which minor to open when 4@c & 4@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves: and the hand lies relatively well for declarer so he will make it easily enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|norby: never the dummy have king second or q third?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco asking about 3c bid.. Rod writing explanations at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: some moe questions now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: not today, maybe tomorrow or maybe yesterday, but never today|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jkotor: yap, very good 3nt by Chechs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aww....|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate position in hearts    though always a good chance if 10@H is with west|pg||
nt|athene: i like 3@D over 3@H - when opps have spades, all other suits rank the same|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010nonJuniorPhiladelphia/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf   for Meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: i mean 3@D rather than 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: 2nt by east will be natural here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: incase he decides to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
nt|athene: from a lead point of view, a diamond lead is less likely to cost than a heart too|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a X in East - but only if pd has a 5 card suit :)|pg||
nt|norby: forgive me but i comment both bad and good think of players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H may bypass equal/longer @D in 1-bid hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chessmaste: So far the deals have been good for the leading team - little chance of a swing|pg||
nt|algraves: he can guess the clubs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar asked : normal stayman auction, answer yes|pg||
nt|algraves: but only two will still see him home 3 in each red , 2 clubs and a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of that may be obvious but i think it is good to reenforce inferences for many of the spectators|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|udo: 3 NT looks quite normal,,but i cant see 9 trciks|pg||
nt|udo: after @S lead|pg||
nt|udo: a,i see, @H  come in|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, a @d to the Ace then @hs|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jtr: Lucky @d break in an odd way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well if he finds the diamond position he just plays on hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as usual I am last of 3 at typing|pg||
nt|udo: this @D break has its advantage,,u see  first round there is no future|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jkotor: 5@c seems OK|pg||
nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
nt|algraves: some how it is always hard for the defense to hold these to 9 tricks |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|algraves: well they the full 20 for their slam try auction|pg||
nt|rv: I am told that it used to that each player needs to play 33% of boards in finals till recently, of late rules have changed and it is 33% of cumulative boards across all k/o matches|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i lefy CR after a club lead- Rosenberg was in deep thought|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact he may get home even if @ds are 4-2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves: so he guessses clubs straight away|pg||
nt|tlc: he still has to guess whether to drop the doubleton K or to pin the 9 tho|pg||
nt|algraves: so no he has 9 with spades still to be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes last set... and the table was slow...this set looks like flying|pg||
nt|algraves: well, he wont go wrong there east could have Q9xx|pg||
nt|tlc: for 3 club tricks anyway..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/ronpa-gino.pdf  for E-W's convention card|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: 1 imp match at the moment|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: asked for the screen to come down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking rodwell stuff...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now screen back up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ron Pachtman is the faster of the two. Ginossar has his tanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: having a drink now....does not look in a hurry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Live video streaming in this set is from the closed room of the playoff match|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: That is certainly part of our job, being educational|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: You don't know if N-S have a fit|pg||
nt|toral5: yes and almost as gud as 0-3/4 hcps|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Roland - absolut normal to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C better than 5@D as 2nd spade ruff with 10@C holds|pg||
nt|rmb1: This has play, take two ruffs and draw trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the Rosenblum and McConnell teams are playing the same boards, ostensibly at the same time, but the Rosenblum Teams play 15 boards a session and the McConnell 16 boards|pg||
pc|dT|nt|algraves: i mean the opps have 27 - 29 hcp , everything is breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: McConnell = women's event|pg||
nt|jtr: As long as they cant cash the @d and a @s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|jtr: and the @hs behave of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now the surprise|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|algraves: now meckstroth wants to play the next club from hand in case west has K9x|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jkotor: IMO he can double for T/O, @h jump will correct to NT|pg||
nt|dburn: this is presumably because the women have time for 16 boards in two and a half hours, while the men can manage only about 11|pg||
nt|algraves: so Zia is down now, he had to guess the @C to make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: not plain sailing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness-Helgemo vs Pachtman-Ginossar|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|algraves: so an imp riding on Rodwells play of trumps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|swanson: Pass is possible because 1@C is forcing, but that is far from a guarantee that North will find it easier to describe his hand later.|pg||
nt|ady: needs care|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||

nt|udo: didnt even test @D:)=|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: They will let the men play 16 boards per set in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|algraves: he was worried about qT8x with east|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: west better to duck diamond|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jtr: Hmmm I rather think he wanted his cake and to eat it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jkotor: W is mostly weak nt, so no singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and meckstroth going down in 3@D|pg||
mc|6|nt|jtr: Hoping to test the @hs bfore @ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's questionable whether Zia played the clubs with the odds|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|iceking: yes knows EW do not have fit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: will Moss lead trump|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell using fingers to explain Meckstroth's shape|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a heart, getting a ruff?|pg||
nt|iceking: or get his ruff|pg||
nt|athene: of course @HA and another really gives a lot away if you can't find a fast entry in partner's hand for your ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Van Cleeff taking pictures, so the players are apparently waiting for him to finish|pg||
nt|athene: and it might just be getting a legitimate trick back anyway even if you do|pg||
nt|iceking: he should have a good idea how the @H are|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|athene: so i am not sure it's at all automatic |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell holding his hand over his face, but then lowers it so a picture could be taken :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|iceking: probably thinking about run this|pg||
nt|iceking: so extra down |pg||
nt|athene: he's right to put the ace with west - and east might have led small from @HJ10 there|pg||
nt|iceking: S hopes W has something like Jxx Ax AKx Jxxxx and was trying to make it |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss gives a big sigh as Van Cleeff is trying to take a closeup pix of him|pg||
nt|athene: but moss might be thinking about the cunning ace and ten anyway|pg||

mb|p|nt|norby: like 3 diamonds and not 3 hearts because hearts 5-0?????lol|pg||
nt|algraves: he judged that south more likely to have singleton Honour than North to have KQX, if 2-2 didint matter what he did|pg||
mb|2C|nt|toral5: we are having a very flat session til now,this brd no exception|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: now 3@h - 3NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh sorry  they're still playing  19    i should have checked my source :(|pg||
mb|2N|nt|swanson: Game is iffy to bid here after 1NT.  Hamman can show a good spade hand by bidding at the three level over Zia's xfer, but will Zia go on?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some might have passed with Zia's hand - Hamman will smile|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe 3@d :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think North will stop below game whatever South does|pg||
nt|swanson: How big can his smile be, though?|pg||
nt|jkotor: "i d like, but i m affraid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: simple straight bidding in the other room cos north passed|pg||
nt|algraves: and he guessed wrong|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C was 100% game force|pg||
nt|pelu: opening 1D and the D from N very informativ - for decl - again pass works best :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzta: zia-hamman started very well this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: well predicted|pg||
nt|yuval10: big result to Wolfson in the CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are thinking for 10 mins and then they arte throwing the cards on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT forces 3@C, unless doubler is strong, then he ignores the transfer|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jkotor: seems like second transfer|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@H is a retransfer.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H may be re-transfer|pg||
nt|tlc: well done to get to the cold (albeit lucky) 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: this game is cold even if N would find the very inspired K@c lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't|pg||
nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what Ginossar intended to do if Pachtman had actually bid 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: after N opened 2@s, it seem illogical to finesse to the T in that suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: in @h rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: good players tend not to open weak 2's with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asked earlier for the session times to be changed and it seems the wish was granted|pg||
nt|algraves: well it seems he wants to get on @H straight away and if they are good for 5 tricks, then just give up a @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play Lebensohl by a passed hand then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing much to think about here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: can i tell him?|pg||
nt|algraves: anything but hearts from the top is illogical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you must tell him in Hebrew, Traian. Is that a challenge?|pg||
nt|algraves: my Hebrew is weak but I can call a lifeline|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: huge for me....i do speak the language|pg||
nt|rv: 2@C is fourth suit game force (FSGF)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cant Zia ruff a 2nd spade with 10C   and draw trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking now|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry S bid 3@D over 3@C and down 1 -50|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Not sure.  We knew where @CJ was|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: Greco keeping alternate contracts open|pg||
nt|norby: routine wash.-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't blame him -- slam just depends on finding trump Q  or underlead @DQ    maybe some squeeze possibilities|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: cards stil on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand|pg||
nt|toral5: helness thinking of a possibility of trump promotion|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks no problems here with friendly oppo|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson 100% for NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rmb1: But he ended up playing for @CJ with West (or guessing to drop @CJx with East)|pg||
nt|algraves: well good practical shot by hamman, he knows he is stuck|pg||
nt|algraves: cowardly not to bid it really and he is anything if not fearless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if misguess @HQ   does @S return kill a double squeeze?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|toral5: incase helgemo raised with aq|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL I have about six words of Hebrew|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, at this point it looks like a final between Diamond and Nickell, but still time for their opponents to come back|pg||
pc|s5|nt|algraves: not comletely cold form Greco point of view and moreover an imp here or there can decide match|pg||
nt|algraves: so he wants 9 and then more than 9|pg||
nt|norby: the bidding 3nt is 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|norby: in this case 4-2-5-2|pg||
nt|norby: 2nt is relais with stop in club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no 100% line. He doesn't know that diamonds come in|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the cameraman trying to film greco's card..but they are folded under the table lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: greco's cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, he would just set up the missing tricks in spades|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Greco will start with @SK and if ducked will shift his attention to @h suit?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs have answered full spectrum    no, yes, maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|algraves: well there is always Q lies over the J|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|algraves: that is an old rubber bridge saying as when the cards are scooped up sometimes the tricks stay in the old order for the next deal|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: Jim types faster as well as commentating better|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can call Yuval, he is nearby|pg||
pc|sA|nt|swanson: A heart lead would have defeated 4@H because the discard must be taken immediatly - the East can ruff the third round.|pg||
nt|rmb1: East must play a diamond now as the defence's only source of tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rmb1: Enough for five tricks?  I am asked.  Declarer has entry problems, may not get to enjoy the spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: can transfer any message via juniors' friends, which are also playing at the same time the world championship for juniors' teams|pg||
nt|algraves: so Rodwell will switch to clubs and hold this to three|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i missed the NOT...i do not speak the language|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then I am not sure you qualify as our operator :)|pg||
nt|algraves: this may be a long set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck said sorry.. and he is taking his ahare of the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manual for Vugraph Operators, page 17, paragraph 5, lines 8 and 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: share|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps west will help meck out and just claim ...|pg||
nt|algraves: I have thought that some variation of the chess clock principle but where it applies to total team time at all 4 seats|pg||
nt|algraves: not including system explanantions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: funny enough the director kept last set the exact time of each pair|pg||
nt|algraves: so you have a total team time of say 2hrs|pg||
nt|tlc: If Joey were the Operator, could he just yell NEXT at the appropriate time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now..who want to know the result?|pg||
nt|algraves: so that takes into account that NS and EW may have much different problems|pg||
nt|algraves: and if you have a very fast pair , well that helps if you have a very slow pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes and greco-hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: and vice versa|pg||
nt|algraves: so after you play you hit the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess you could only do it during the play|pg||
nt|algraves: but that would be a big help|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@c discard looks logical|pg||
nt|kareno: Many years ago, when he was sstill a student at MIT, I asked Mark Feldman what he was thinking about on every bid and play.  He told me he was reviewing every hand he had ever ...|pg||
nt|kareno: played for solutions.  And he was serious!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he will play spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tlc: will be surprised if the @C queen isnt played as well|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: this is exactly the type of board you want when sitting on a lead|pg||
nt|norby: i like diamond and diamond|pg||
pc|sT|nt|algraves: yes best not to make predictions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No danger any more as @HA is an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all laughing now....|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: lot of talk from specks   about hand 19     Zia played high trump early from hand  -  maybe better to not touch trumps early   A@S   and ruff a spade  and then diamond finesse   ...|pg||
nt|ady: and if tghe play goes the same way   diamond back   ruff another spade with 10C    then has ace and another club to draw trumps  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Rosenberg made 3NT on 19 - |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|algraves: so his sequence of cards suggests 6 to QJ98|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness said TOUGH TO BEAT and all laughed|pg||
nt|algraves: and percentage is low to King for singleton Q|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Live streaming video will be back for the final tomorrow. 4 segments of 16 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland   newer ACBL CC available from 2010 Team Trials under  www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|algraves: Zia may not have to play them at all with this line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss in 7@H!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to John Stewart|pg||
nt|stewball: hi all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Cool feature, hope you agree|pg||
nt|algraves: so he will make 5 |pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rmb1: I know @C6 is an entry but he has to knock out @CJ and @SA first,|pg||
nt|algraves: so rodwell has no losing play and declarer should claim 3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|rmb1: I think East had to play @H when in with @CJ|pg||
nt|algraves: this shows the " power of the closed hand" in that defense had very hard time discarding on this |pg||
nt|norby: before he is waiting to see if the jack of diamond drops and after play spades|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|stewball: Moss in 7 in the other room|pg||
nt|pelu: so 17 IMP on stake here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|algraves: and running long suit in NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|algraves: now another @D and exit club for trumpendplay|pg||
nt|algraves: so Hampson has to ruff with 9|pg||
pc|s9|nt|algraves: I guess he thinks he will cassh KQ of diamonds before exiting|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: nice line Zia!|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: oh my   Rodwell lead against 7@H was .... @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, pretty in 6|pg||
mc|12|nt|algraves: Hampson had to ruff with 9 to give him a guess but he would have gotten it correct|pg||
nt|algraves: well done by Hamman and Zia|pg||
nt|pelu: can Mos now find a double-squeeze?|pg||
nt|algraves: elegant line |pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: EW might well be in slam in the other room on these cards|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is natural and game-forcing, right?|pg||
nt|passell: another slam on a queen guess   |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 6@H probably in both rooms |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|iceking: and both will guess it as its correct line to guess @H here|pg||
nt|phil: lots of squeeze chances too|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss did not alert, I believe, the 3 @H bid, but Gitelman did alert it to Rodwell|pg||
nt|passell: percentage to get it correct  all equal except sing Queen|pg||
nt|iceking: reason S might have stiff Q|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth needs his system card|pg||
nt|iceking: so this should be a push in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if he makes 6 he'll make 7 won't he? |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: please have someone bring Meckstroth's system card|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: double squeeze around spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|phil: right|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|iceking: right there is also double squeeze|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|athene: 5@S looks odd - doesn't east know by this point that the @HQ is missing?|pg||
nt|iceking: @S lead though breaks it and continue @S if he gets @H correct or|pg||
nt|athene: so 5@S (if it's a grand slam try) is a bit weird|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|nt|iceking: if he gets heart incorrect i meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow, this will be fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: WOW|pg||
nt|iceking: oh boy|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell asking questions of Gitelman|pg||
nt|athene: now the double squeeze is for the contract, not the overtricks|pg||
nt|iceking: did 5@S ask for extras and 5nt showed extra trump|pg||
nt|passell: probably lead a trump now|pg||
nt|phil: not the call I would expected 35 up|pg||
nt|athene: and once more we see just how bad it is to lead a trump against a grand slam|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell's convention card, I believe, was passed to Moss, but Meckstroth still needs his system card.|pg||
nt|athene: but of course if north doesn't lead a trump, moss might decide there is only one reason for that...and play a heart to the jack|pg||
nt|phil: been told 6@h next door so a lot riding on this one|pg||
nt|passell: cant imagine leading anything else unless you think opponents have screwed up|pg||
nt|iceking: this could be brutal board for Nickell|pg||
nt|athene: as a kibitzer suggests, it's just barely possible that they are bidding this to flatten the board|pg||
nt|iceking: depends what info Rodwell got from Gitelman they are screenmates right|pg||
nt|athene: thinking that EW in the other room will bid it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: oh boy|pg||
nt|jkotor: now even I would make it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell and Gitelman are screenmates|pg||
nt|iceking: i wonder what he told him 5@S was |pg||
nt|phil: would love to know Fred's explanation of 5N|pg||
nt|passell: yes once he later plays ak and a dia ruff he cant fall out of it|pg||
nt|athene: in case anyone is wondering about the double squeeze mechanism - the idea is, you can just cash the minor-suit ace-kings and @SK and run the trumps; now on the last trump north has ...|pg||
nt|athene: to keep a diamond and south has to keep a club so no-one can keep a third spade|pg||
nt|iceking: if it asked for extra trump you might lead something else|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine that Gitelman's 5@s was an effort to get Moss to bid seven with a seventh heart|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|phil: isn't this a classic compound once North has the diamond length - you can make even if North has the club length|pg||
nt|athene: the ending is @Hx / @S8 / @C5 in west hand and @SAx / @Dx in east hand|pg||
nt|jkotor: what about simple squeeze in minors?|pg||
nt|iceking: if thats the case is it still automatic too lead trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: Dear Tony,|pg||
nt|dburn: but that jack of hearts was a bit odd|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckwell give no note that disaster has struck|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|dburn: suppose South had the singleton queen?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|iceking: yes should go up with Dummys K |pg||
nt|passell: yes  pay off to trump lead from the queen agaist 7|pg||
nt|athene: only the rueful rabbit leads from @HQxx (he has the @HQ in with his diamonds)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: diamond ruff just to try to isolate the menace with north|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth stops to think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is just a "simple" double-squeeze now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, now he knows it will be a compound squeeze|pg||
nt|passell: this was perfect for him catching north with long dia  doesnt have to guess the squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: even if north had a club guard he is getting squeezed out of it very soon|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: zia solved the @HQ guess dilemma in a neat way in six in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: he just refused to play trumps|pg||
nt|athene: ended up with a 3-card ending |pg||
nt|passell: after this board meckwell will know they are in big trouble   the gloves will come off|pg||
nt|athene: exited with a club and the defence had to find the @HQ|pg||
nt|iceking: iam still little shocked about this 5@S bid from Gitelman|pg||
nt|athene: that is reminiscent of a famous Belladonna hand in "bridge with the blue team" where he finds the queen of trumps exactly the same way|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|pc|c3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|iceking: so 48 imps 12 boards to go |pg||
mc|13|nt|athene: if meckwell take that board without a flicker they are tough competitors indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell says that 3 @H was not explained and Rodwell apologizes and then says I am sorry|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: 30 imps in not many boards|pg||
nt|algraves: gosh he didnt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Nickell led @SK at trick  so Diamond knew to hold on to all his spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: For various reasons, H&H have not played for Norway since 2007, and it's not because they don't qualify|pg||
nt|pelu: in all 4 matches the total IMP-swing is 20!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||
nt|toral5: i think fireworks are reserved for the last 2 sets|pg||
nt|algraves: so 3 rounds of @D , if no J then switch to @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's there and I think he can|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|odysseus69: odds are lengthening against Nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: this hand does not play well for NS in anything and they are vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Reminiscent of the closing boards yesterday when Nickell score 47IMPs in 7 boards to win by approx. 5|pg||
mb|2D|nt|toral5: do HH play 2@H here as natural or @S raise?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT rebid suggesting more than an opening NT, 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: another good board for leaders|pg||
mb|3N|nt|swanson: That was a big blow - 4@S is far from certain to be bid even if North opens 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia writes a maximum with 3 spades|pg||
nt|jkotor: Max, with HHx@s?|pg||
nt|algraves: now Pachtman has a decision about wether to re open|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2@H would be a good spade raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Redouble is 9+ hcp|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness said aha nice |pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  aggressive   partner balancing|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not the South is interested|pg||
nt|yuval10: X over NT for EW means @s and suit, as we learned yesterday, and W would never dream of bidding it with such a horrible suits|pg||
nt|kareno: Lucky Rodwell \:)|pg||
nt|algraves: best defense is 500 against 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Pachtman thinking THESE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM US|pg||
nt|algraves: but west may remove double to 2!|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S |pg||
nt|tlc: same auction to this point in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves: so practically speaking best to collect undertricks at 100 per|pg||
nt|rv: playing std 2/1, Rodwell's hand would be considered too strong for splinter (10-12 is preferred range), playing precision 13-15 makes more sense|pg||
nt|rv: Meck's 4@s is kickback asking for keys|pg||
nt|rv: they play suit above agreed suit as RKC at 4 level:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: anyone balance out there with double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: nope discretion the better part of valour|pg||
nt|tlc: at MPs maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously Rodwell intended to pass any response but this is the one he really hoped to hear I would guess|pg||
pc|c8|nt|swanson: 2NT probably shows a maximum spade hand with two honor and three cards in spades.|pg||
nt|toral5: should he hook @H here?|pg||
nt|stewball: here's trick 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  carding  upside-down count & attitude   Smith not mentioned|pg||
pc|cT|nt|robinswr: rod could have KQJx/Jxxx/K/KQJx|pg||
nt|rv: 5@d must be asking for specific kings, 5@C would be trump queen ask which Meck has  in any case|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yuval10: right on Karen|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jtr: Routine here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 easy tricks - no options for anything else|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is routine hand . on the Last hand our world champion suggest 3 rounds @D then 4th @D if no Jack as the 8 of @C a strong card|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's jump to 6@h shows no kings|pg||
nt|norby: good bidding , easy and effective|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck saying TOO MANY KINGS|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5dia asks 0 or 3|pg||
nt|algraves: then you can wait with many options|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rd was asking for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 5d|pg||
nt|algraves: imp riding on the lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|norby: probabily 4 spades is ask for aces.......|pg||
nt|algraves: no only 6 always|pg||
nt|norby: and 4nt is 3 aces|pg||
nt|algraves: so no further problems here to make at least 3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jkotor: why 3@h now if anyway 3nt?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you have to say, this is a bit of a silly contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: needs to guess the red finesse|pg||
nt|stewball: and @s will be 9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|odysseus69: noone can explain what happened here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, North has implied majors too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rodwell could have been 4450, no reason to re-open|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell went to the bathroom|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|algraves: well sometimes they are in big trouble and you have more high cards than they do. so you might get a penalty or a partscore swing|pg||
nt|robinswr: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|norby: of course 0 or 3|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|norby: but meck think or hope 3:-))|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would think 5sp asks for kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: mack : i am making six ...just looking for the other trick|pg||
nt|norby: better when trumps is hearts play rkcb at 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: request for link to video please|pg||

nt|stewball: kind of an odd lead..i could see it if he had an entry|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|swanson: This sequence would seem to offer a choice of games with emphasis on spades (rather than a direct 3NT over 2NT).|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess down the middle is to pass it out|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: the North hand isn't strong enough for 3N=slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia is impassive|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer has to guess which red suit finesse to take.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|algraves: Moss in 7@H in closed room and their is a line of play that makes |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it appears Brad Moss is executing the double squeeze in 7@H|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jkotor: friend is telling me J@h, if no K, then kill it take @s, and finesse @d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: jack of hearts to test was usual Zia style - if no king then play diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|toral5: that can be costly if @H q off.|pg||
nt|toral5: presuming defence wont allow @D ruff,helness does have a problm here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|swanson: I don't think 3NT should be a slam try over 2NT on this auction.  North could always cue bid.|pg||
nt|jkotor: and I think we have the end of the story now|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Moss leaves to go the restroom after putting down the dummy|pg||
nt|passell: will have to guess to go after spades instead of diamonds to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rusinow leads and upside down signals, it could be various holdings where the J would be lead, as expained by Rodwell|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth says he will play the dummy cards|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth confirms that Gitelman bid 2 @D over the 2 @C ask for a 4 card major|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|phil: the lack of a club continuation should signify Meck does not have two spade entries|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell needs some time to think|pg||
nt|iceking: he will probably just play @S to Ten now|pg||
nt|athene: with this spade suit you prefer to lead to the ten first, then the king, if you are going to attack the suit|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|jkotor: not sure if this is @h transfer or just Max, 2 popular schools in Poland|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.on a bad day only it loses and costs 200.stil odds is to finesse aftr dbl|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks are available here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2210 scored|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@S 4-card support with a min balanced hand|pg||
nt|udo: all kings and queens North/East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing now   2@d = @D & @H/@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1h- t/fer= 2 spades - a weak NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 2@S was too high I think|pg||
nt|norby: kickback is convention at 4 spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Now even 47-0 isn't enough, on the other hand, they have more boards to get the missing IMPs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: According to the Rule of 15, Helness has an opener. HCP + spades must add up to at least 15 if you go by Pesrson's Rule|pg||
nt|toral5: match getting closer now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pearson's|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: 4@S   looks 1 over the top |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|swanson: Without the redouble 2@S would be invitational; now it is preemptive.|pg||
nt|algraves: on the claim, Hampson told Meck that there was no chance for extra spade trick KQ< KQX of HX south|pg||
nt|algraves: Well done Brad Moss, a good slice of luck to Diamond and good play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the lead|pg||
nt|jkotor: no K|pg||
nt|jkotor: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W will not be sticking their necks out during the auction now, after the previous good results.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: everyone stares at the dummy|pg||
nt|ady: a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|algraves: lucky 6|pg||
nt|tlc: finally an easy hand for everyone...altho only 5 was made at the other table|pg||
nt|udo: yes, with all finesses wrong looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: The try looks dubious facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the good old days this would have been a passout. 12 aceless 4333 was no opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1892|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia waiting for hamman to lead|pg||
nt|jtr: @c lead may help a little|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: told he is on lead in fact|pg||
nt|jtr: Tell him, next hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to David Birman|pg||
nt|davidb: hi  again |pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: On a serious note, it is no crime to pass the East hand in 1st vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|udo: maybe that lead helps in @c, but still down , imo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i lost the play... i had to close the screen|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think they lead the 10 from this holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Ginossar went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and i had to protect the screen|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yuval10: might've played @d to the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky zia claimed quickly 2 down|pg||
nt|udo: since the round of last 16,,when u go to restroom, u get an bodyguard:))|pg||
nt|jtr: A couple of singles passed the slips for Wolfson|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all of those weaned on weak nt would not consider a move over 2 spades- |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: west is back now|pg||
nt|udo: playing weak NT it goes prob. 1NT pass pass pass|pg||
nt|rv: here Hampson's X shows primary @c+@hs possibly, 2n would have primary @cs+@ds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rmb1: Back now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: on the surface e-w cards look good for 4 hearts - but the 4-1 trump break means curtains - kind of game everyone is bidding|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|algraves: Yes I guess it is possible to misquess diamonds if west plays low and you put in ten|pg||
nt|kareno: Only way I can see making only five is with Ace and a diamond led.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 probably the right card though|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps..actually the percentage play|pg||
nt|algraves: 9|pg||
nt|rv: good stop though even this might be too high on trump shift now|pg||
nt|algraves: so even with a trump switch Hampson can guess @H for three tricks and down one losing trick in each suit|pg||
nt|athene: trump shift is very good, kills two possible tricks in dummy (ruff, @DK)|pg||
nt|norby: somepeople prefere 3 club at double over 2 spades, but double is perfect bidding for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck in the tank now|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding is revealing - they know north has something like 7411|pg||
nt|algraves: a " bad buy " as they say for Hampson|pg||
nt|rv: I like X to show @c+@hs and 2n to show @cs+@ds|pg||
nt|algraves: picture Greco with @C K and @H Q|pg||
nt|athene: if the double shows hearts and clubs, maybe south should bid 2nt, saying "i am not sure if we want to play clubs or diamonds"|pg||
nt|athene: i am just looking for ways to play 3@C rather than forcing yourself unnecessarily to 4@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: well i have a feeling they have discussed this and that 3@D is the bid that is in compliance with the partnership agreement|pg||
nt|norby: club is the best come back|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table...stil thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: while we are waiting. a lot of messages on the auction. Hampson was prepared to show a strong @C overcall|pg||
nt|stewball: it seems fred bid 7 knowing he was missing the trump Q|pg||
nt|stewball: maybe he was expecting a trump lead or hamman/zia to bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly right John -- with big lead, try to maintain parity    or so they say|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fred had a great first board when Meckwell went down in slam, so it seems a little strange that he bid the grand slam if he knew they were off @HQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|toral5: cd easily have been an ALL PASS brd:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|toral5: helness did wel to open here as the cards lie|pg||
nt|algraves: he was always willing to " bid it out to 4@C" looking for the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|rv: good defense|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|tlc: wins with QT or AT on, only loses to AQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzta: east thinking|pg||
nt|ady: if the spades were played as shown this nearly slipped through|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thinking some more|pg||
nt|rmb1: East can see cards are not good for declarer, but still anything could be the wrong thing to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is getting very impatient now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: writing notes to the cameraman...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east put the cards on the table and thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia shaking his had |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: head|pg||
nt|algraves: sorry not vul but looking for game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play again, but Zia says nasty, nasty|pg||
nt|jkotor: easy -1 now, everything clear|pg||
nt|swanson: Zia needs both club honors (3-3) to his left - with than assumption the @SK is almost certainly offside.|pg||
nt|jkotor: only chance for E is AK@c in partners hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia leads a low club to the queen and it wins|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rv: folks on North's double, do you prefer some form of sohl by South hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least he can't get hearts wrong as the 10 drops if he plays to the jack. No entry to dummy to get it wrong later|pg||
nt|norby: now play diamond hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: well he can play low to 9 as well|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|norby: and after ace of diamond play ace of spades|pg||
nt|stewball: unless i misunderstand thier auction,moss denied it|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|yuval10: with ATX it doesn't matter..... you lose 2 @d's anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can, but no matter what he does he only loses one trick|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzta: zia : sorry i can not make it partner|pg||

nt|norby: mistake of meck...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Hi all|pg||
nt|bt: thx and good 2 c u all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: minor games look good|pg||
nt|swanson: That was a very quiet looking hand on which to win 10 IMPs.  BUt the Nickell team needs three more of the same.|pg||
nt|kareno: No losers in spades but are there enough winners for a grand slam?  |pg||
mb|d|nt|jkotor: what is your call after 1@h from E?|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see how many @d's will E bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess 4|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Mecksroth took zero time to play that a guess is a guess , lets get on to the next board|pg||
nt|algraves: he probably always plays it that way|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, his partnership has little think time to spare :)|pg||
nt|udo: zia 1 @H:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 looks good to me|pg||
nt|udo: to good for a vuln weaktwo ?|pg||
nt|udo: or weak3|pg||
nt|davidb: E  thunks  they playing with 2 decks of cards|pg||
nt|davidb: think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: NE writing notes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 'thunks'|pg||
nt|udo: 2@D and later 3!@C looks fine, |pg||
mb|3H|nt|jkotor: I m also for X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@h = 5+@s or 11-13 bal, game force|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't think 3@d will confuse NS much|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably best to start with simple 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: an interesting hand coming up, , can ns make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H opening is creative; not sure how many would do that|pg||
nt|udo: dont think 2@D will be passed out,,,after this start|pg||
nt|davidb: nice imaginative bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2NT = @D ?|pg||
nt|kareno: Does 3@d break up their relays if anyone knows?|pg||
nt|udo: but when u have this 2 NT, thats perfect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT likely and that will go down with clubs 3-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad -- wanted to see if Hampson was going to bid 2@S or lebensohl 2N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: N can bid easy 3@s now|pg||
nt|rv: Meck would have surely defended accurately if this was 3rd or 4th day, this is 12th day for folks who started wth Mixed Pairs:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what else?|pg||
nt|stoffers: Looks like 9 tricks in either @h or @s here, even only 8 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they make 3?|pg||
nt|bt: helgemo has a tough choice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||
nt|stoffers: he had to bid like he did i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: problm for helgemo here|pg||
nt|yuval10: then S can cuebid and show his great hand against @s suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell writing a book for pachtman |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that Rodwell erred when he covered @C10. That is not correct, it does not matter. The error came when Meck tried to cash @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: His opener was not a thing of beauty|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: some wouldnt open the south hand, i hear :-)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble is that he might bid 2NT here with shape and little values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, AKQxxx you can show when asked after a weak 2. It's a rare bird but here it is|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tlc: surprised no 4@d cue|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass might've already showed some good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@d voidwood|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's the only reason|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 is not a bad contract without a @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and more writing...i can see 3-4 pages until now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H  2NT  ;  3NT   solid suit|pg||
nt|rv: fatigue does set in|pg||
nt|norby: also rodweel , better no king of club|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he had to exit with @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Read above :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 9 tricks in @S and 8 in @h |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|bt: @DK looks fairly obvious but who knows|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: his opener needs beauty therapy|pg||
nt|bt: upgrading KQ doubleton, lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8 losers, KQ doubleton, vulnerable. Call me a chicken, but I pass|pg||
nt|toral5: 200 looks bad here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lets see what Helness will say when dummy will come down|pg||
nt|udo: nite all, wish u a great last hands,,,,,,|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine contract, roughly 73.45%, but no luck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all roads were going to lead to 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I ubstracted a little from the 78% because Zia pre-empted|pg||
nt|pelu: but prob same contract in CR - so the % dont count :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bathroom break after this board...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bt: live by the sword ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looooooooooool|pg||
nt|algraves: in that you can save a potential heart finesse to later|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck started writing too now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jkotor: some people bid 2@h|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks if it is his lead and then plays the heart king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT 2 keycards outside diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@c now asks non @d kings, but 6@d would ask for @c help specifically|pg||
nt|algraves: east cant lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
nt|udo: work in 5 hours:)|pg||
nt|davidb: good  save vs  4m that makes|pg||
nt|athene: now they have to hurry to cash their diamond|pg||
nt|robinswr: they play all the boards (yesterday and against my team)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|vugraphzta: he said SOLID OPENER|pg||
pc|h6|nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or  Hvor er din åbningshånd, makker?|pg||
nt|bt: there is a subtle squeeze on east in pointed suit but thats after going one down already|pg||
nt|stoffers: I am surprised that one of the world's best players gets it for his light opening. I think he has played more hands than us together and have an idea of whats best in the long run. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the one you had when you opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nope... english plain|pg||
nt|stoffers: I wouldnt open, but its a border hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now...thinking|pg||
nt|bt: sorry, but i didnt hear anyone critizising|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness I mean|pg||
nt|bt: its a fact that players like meckwell make a good living on light openers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and a lot of sighs|pg||
nt|stoffers: Just 15 specs and some coments that looked like it :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|passell: no problem without trump lead|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will make |pg||
nt|yuval10: N figure up he've heared enough|pg||
nt|athene: not too tricky - danger of discards on spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: after E will fail to lead trump ( from his void ) , 3 @c ruffs will make the contract easily|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|rmb1: I guess declarer loses two hearts and a diamond, but losing spade goes on a heart|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 6@s in the CR, so new leaders|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: He is surely much better than the rest of us, but that should not mean that we can't question the opening. No-one critizised him|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It works for him, fine|pg||
nt|toral5: i m sure MOST would pass souths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: dont care about the spect - they are spect and Helgemo the player :)|pg||
nt|toral5: no question of criticizing at all|pg||
nt|bt: now the other question is how to get away with light openers like this in a natural framework and no conventions, thats a mystery to me|pg||
nt|toral5: meckwell will SURELY open|pg||
nt|toral5: and so will versace:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because they judge so well and are great card players, Lars|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he gave a distinct look to the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|toral5: ya i agree they are super card players|pg||
nt|pelu: opening is the best attack - and u dont have a 2@D overcall later on 5 cards suit and vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in hand now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stoffers: so, spade is best now, but he cant shorten himself enough can he?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|stoffers: But this is two down, wich isnt that good bridge :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why is it 2 down?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Virtually same difference in the other semi-final. Diamond up by 26|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Maybe I missed something|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|pc|hT|nt|pelu: @S ruff, @D to A @S-ruff, @CA and @D - then East must him him the last 2 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe it is now, but if he had led a diamond instead of cashing @HA I can see 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: push|pg||

nt|ahollan1: would Zia open   with @HA @DA and void ???    nah|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure East must have @DA if West then he could discard a @D and have a @S to endplay N|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs are right    needed to preserve @C in dummy  so @DKx opposite @DJx|pg||

mc|6|nt|pelu: Rodwell also in 3Nt - as expected - and @H lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no  Meck playing from South after DBL - 2N [lebensohl]    @D lead, @H switch|pg||

nt|stewball: i'm speculating|pg||

nt|algraves: no that 7@H a killer hand|pg||

nt|odysseus69: mmmm|pg||
nt|swanson: The problem is they won't be able to improve on the result.|pg||
nt|bt: i would think ns at the other table would bid similarily|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he asked Becker : 3 spades and 4 diamons ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: answer YES... Helnes : i can do one better|pg||

nt|rmb1: Robinson need more than pushes|pg||
nt|yuval10: have to go now - thanks all and see you later!|pg||
nt|kareno: Thank you!!|pg||
nt|athene: one point worth a mention is hampson's choice of 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are gathering speed here|pg||
nt|rv: this is not Buffett Cup scoring still 1 IMP may just be crucial in final analysis:)|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a GF balanced hand it can work much better to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thats wonderful|pg||
nt|algraves: I will hire John as my lawyer and sue the rules committee|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back to play now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jkotor: 4@d and what after 4@s?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: desperate measures- but even then 7 spades is so much|pg||
nt|algraves: you know edgar Kaplan did an exhaustive study and found that big club pairs slam bidding was better if the opponents got into your auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- rather than guessing  how's our game|pg||
mb|d|nt|bt: 1@H-D-2H-2S maybe|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4 to zimmerman on 22, where i think 2@h is a much better bid than 1NT. Quite deserved then..:)|pg||
nt|algraves: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: in R-M precision it just shows clubs or balanced, might be only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: it is hard enough as it is|pg||
mb|3H|an|pre|nt|mdgraham: we can all see 7@S makes, but it is going to be very difficult even to get to six|pg||
nt|swanson: It is possible that N-S will push to a grand, knowing they are behind big time.  But the bidding is starting at a high level.  |pg||
nt|bt: 1@H-D-2@H-2@S i mean lol|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@S/5@D save in picture;but 5@H also making|pg||
nt|stoffers: will Helgemo bid 2@s?|pg||
nt|bt: well i would think so|pg||
nt|stewball: would surely corrupt the endgame|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzta: he just did|pg||
nt|stoffers: indeed|pg||
mb|4C|nt|odysseus69: 6 at least now|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d X 4@d X at other table|pg||
nt|algraves: its like the shootout in hockey who needs it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it offers too much shooting, but maybe it is just another form of competition  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 7 card fit in all of West's suits|pg||
nt|odysseus69: laydown game on minimal values|pg||
nt|stewball: any 4@s bidders as S?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jkotor: both tables at least in 6|pg||
nt|stoffers: Note Helness double here, if he is gonna pull a 2@c bid for Geir to 2@d, it wouldnt show extras|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: down 2 = 300/450|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You were wrong re 23, Lars. Brogeland passed the South cards|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a game force you should never bid 1spade over 1 heart with only four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: A big bid by Zia.  He was evidently planning to bid 4@S over 4@H.  But would that show another place to play or would it be a strong had with spades?|pg||
nt|swanson: hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double showed spades|pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell 1n shows 11-13 here?|pg||
nt|stewball: i mean any other 4@s bidders:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: may be a namyat 4@C would have shut out north from entering|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: both tables in 5@d NS now :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will they know what 4NT means - time for spades now|pg||
nt|kareno: \i didn't know that.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in game now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|toral5: but strul did wel to bid 5@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jkotor: 6@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: both|pg||
nt|swanson: This would be uncharted waters for most partnerships.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if South bids 5@S now, North may well bid 7 - no, 6@C |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzta: not finished|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was more positive than pass- enough for Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman looking for action...asking questions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment hamman writing stuff for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|norby: yes 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|pelu: why 4@C from Zia - just to be sure that S will play the @Ss correct?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|swanson: Now 6@S and then 7@S?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: time for spaes now|pg||
nt|bt: aha ... lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he passed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only hopr for defence is if Zia decides to play anti-odds for K doubleton club with West - no chance really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is too flat to act|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves: game bidding harder|pg||
nt|rv: now defense can cash 8 black suit tricks|pg||
nt|norby: club now or never...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: surely this must be a 2-suiter  |pg||
nt|jtr: He will eliminate first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forgetting he was going to be on lead ??|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|stewball: he likely assumed a 5 level decision was coming|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jkotor: for a push|pg||
nt|rv: Greco's @d3 would be some form of smith echo?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: 7@S not super after the 3@D bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can establish a third club trick but no entries|pg||
nt|jtr: So losing to Kx wont matter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Jack for spade switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: not yet|pg||
nt|stewball: and wanted some help|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|algraves: nice lead by greco as he reads the auction well|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: last pass from Hamman was very quick- should have at least given it a thought|pg||
nt|swanson: Evidently Hamman knew how little Zia might have for the auction.  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: not good at all except that it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia unwrapped another cough drop before the dummyhit the table|pg||
nt|jkotor: what if Zia have: QJxx xxx x AQTxx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East and West get some water while Zia contemplates the hand|pg||
nt|swanson: But maybe he could hold: xxxx, Qx, x, AQJxxx?  Nothing is clear after the 3@D opening.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||
nt|swanson: He had something to say about Philadelphia also.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: contrary to popular belief in constructive auctions Zia usually has his bid - he embarks on some psychological adventures but they are the exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wouldn't W.C. Fields rather be here in Philadelphia?|pg||
nt|pelu: EW in 4@S over 4@H in CR|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S fine for me - @HK = no value opp partners singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck did bid 4@S over similar auction  [Gitelman 3@D instead of 3@H]|pg||
nt|algraves: now he knows his partner has 5@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: 4@sX|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: Yes, they did get to 4@H regardless, but East 'saved'|pg||
nt|toral5: this means it wil be a small pick up for struls team|pg||
nt|norby: finesse in hearts for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: with diamonds 3-3  will make   |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds carefully from the right hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe @DA now to see if partner can overruff dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D2 must mean yes|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|ady: but will cash diamond and exit with club      |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|rv: he couldn't have possibly asked for @h continuation if they are playing rev smith echo (lo-hi in declarer's suit asks partner to continue)|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: plus 200?|pg||
nt|pelu: it will double the IMP-swing for the match :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you have been there, done that|pg||
nt|rv: Greco|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|pelu: that 4@C from Zia looks desperat :)|pg||
nt|algraves: Greco was able to deduce that Hampson doubled on the sort of hand he had|pg||
nt|algraves: and led Ace of @C to keep the ruffing option open in case declarer void in @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N or make mild slam try with @D?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok slam again|pg||
nt|stewball: they should have the tools to 6@d here|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|kareno: Or KQ doubleton of hearts west |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slam even without @HQ, so Hampson will investigate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=@D|pg||

nt|toral5: after a long time we have a slam|pg||
nt|pelu: can Greco give super-accept?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is|pg||
nt|pelu: yes a normal accept - 2NR could be weak or strong|pg||
nt|algraves: this is not the sort of hand to play NT as you want to either ruff a @H if dummy has doubleton |pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play that 2N can also include weak 5@C & 5@D  so 3@C says  i don't like @D  3@D says I like|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/greco-hampson.pdf|pg||
nt|algraves: or use you trumps to ruff out black suit or suits for 12 th trick or to set up squeeze|pg||
nt|algraves: once you find the @D fit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|passell: great 7nt here  4-1 diamonds still might make on lie of the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H probably RKC @D    hmmm   4N Quant??|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@D mini-roman, 4441 opening values (with @D).  |pg||
nt|pelu: I would have a problem now - we play that 3 in major now is a short suit :(|pg||
nt|algraves: of course 6NT makes as the percentage play in @H is low to Q and if it loses finesse the ten next time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D: good for diamonds - 3@c would be less fit/hand|pg||
nt|algraves: but 6@D laydown for one of the 3 good reasons to prefer the suit contract|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Zia inquiring about the 3 @D and the 4 @C bids|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4@S rkcb I GUESS|pg||

nt|rv: I would have opened 1@h with North hand|pg||
nt|pelu: is 4Nt balanced slaminvit in @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: it is difficult bidding slam w Axxxxx opposite Kxxx when missing an ace, and asking for aces |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked if 6nt is quantitative|pg||
nt|passell: surprised w didnt bid 3diamonds first|pg||
nt|kareno: Me too - 6nt is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wofson back in the lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: South could have made last hand if he chose to believe @D K as singleton, we leave it to you at home to work it out|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: 2C alerted - maybe non-forcing?|pg||

nt|jtr: So Zia may go down:)|pg||

pc|s8|nt|jkotor: yup, in Poland level 2 in NF|pg||

nt|swanson: Jassem didn't like his @DK in a club contract, but still - partner made a big bid and it is a vulnerable game.|pg||

nt|norby: absoluty dont like 1 nt with 5-4 majors and 2 ace second........for me is terrible but........i undestand 2 king second|pg||

nt|algraves: still a few boards to go but the Diamond team has played extremely well, all things considered as they play in their 12 th straight day|pg||
nt|algraves: perhaps they have been a little luckier but not by much and they are full value for their big lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzta: the jack is normal, Zia confirms|pg||
nt|jkotor: low @d is for the bulletin :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: and it works :)|pg||
nt|algraves: so the misdefense on 24 cost 6|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you open you have to think about your rebid and sometimes you have to open wrong to avoid a bad rebid|pg||
nt|rv: classical 3n response on 1M precision opening, showing 13-15 with 3M cog|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell had the paper in his pocket|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: this really has to be a flat board- he needed to underlead the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|swanson: E-W are not feeling so comfortable as they were early in the set - they have given back at least a couple game swings.|pg||
nt|jkotor: meckwell need swings, lets wait for their move|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 IMPs to Strul on board 23   200 + 200|pg||
nt|pelu: so board 23 was 9 IMP for Strul|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: showing 4333 13-15, cog|pg||
nt|rv: choice of game (COG)|pg||
nt|algraves: I suspect they regular count and attitude trick one|pg||
nt|robinswr: on the lead of ace they  play standard signals|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: reco thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco|pg||
nt|algraves: he is looking for 3 more tricks|pg||
nt|norby: double squeeze make 6|pg||
nt|rv: did Meck tell him he is playing for only extra tricks here as well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck said i am not going down|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|toral5: yes.i was discussing with pelu cos i thought he is referring to brd 24|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all laughing about Helness diamond suit|pg||
nt|ady: been asked if Zia can open 1@D  anyone know|pg||
nt|algraves: it is critical to make a play now based on some view of where you can take 3 more tricks|pg||
nt|rv: can he always be trusted?, just kidding I am sure these guys have healthy respect for each other:)|pg||
nt|algraves: ah out of misery|pg||
nt|robinswr: meck can be trusted|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how did he guess that correctly??|pg||
nt|stewball: going wrong there would make for a much more interesting hand...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzta: 70 imps with 5 to score|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: maybe underlead in CR?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can only guess that 1@D denies a balanced hand|pg||
nt|jtr: But it isnt really Rosenberg's style|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: needs to play a spade early|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It makes if Ginossar plays the king|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: woow|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: got to play low  or 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How is he supposed to know?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They lead low from any 3|pg||
nt|davidb: Zia has a perfect hand  to invite vs a  vuk 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: incredible set for the old legends|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I will refrain from saying "white cliffs" - once was once too many|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Moss offers water around :)|pg||
nt|dburn: trying to drum up more company for trip to restroom, no doubt|pg||

pc|s4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|dburn: well, whatever black-suit play he finally made would risk losing to South anyway|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|iceking: maybe the was a risk of @C shift|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if you have decided to just take the spade finesse, then ducking i guess is wrong|pg||
nt|athene: as it does risk them running the clubs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but that seems a bit of a far-out position to take at trick 1|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: Meck is squeezed as we see will Gitelman read it|pg||
nt|athene: hard for meckstroth that his spade pitch if he bares the king will be such a big one|pg||
nt|athene: although perhaps at this level that shouldn't be a consideration for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: sorry, to tank is an American colloquialism for deep thought or thinking hard :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h4|pc|s3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: i didn't think that was especially an americanism - we say it in england too :)|pg||
nt|iceking: now |pg||
nt|iceking: can he get this right |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: I did not see the last few cards played as I was answering questions, but this is what I think has been played.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he can - he has about as much to go on as he did before|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the dummy is correct and Gitelman's hand is correct, but Meckstroth's cards I cannot see|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||

mc|9|nt|iceking: another heart breaker for Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: that is what Meckstroth said as they all got up to go to the restroom together|pg||
nt|iceking: we are down to miracle times|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: and Meckwell know it.|pg||
nt|passell: hamman guessed the heart a trick 1 at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: From their mannerisms, they are usually so completely impassive and they are not at this juncture, you can see the stress on them|pg||
nt|iceking: there is a bathroom break i think|pg||
nt|athene: they won't feel happy about that board but it's not that bad - declarer could get hearts right at trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss and Gitelman are exuding confidence|pg||
nt|athene: it's not as though they let through a no-play game|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure Meckwell know now they are down alot and need something to happen |pg||
nt|athene: and holding up the heart then leading to the @CK would work too so they will just assume it's flat|pg||
nt|iceking: there are 6 boards left |pg||
nt|passell: yes it seems clear to duck 2 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: all players are in the restroom, or so I believe :)  I need to use the Ladies room myself lol|pg||
nt|passell: maybe afraid of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: there are 6 boards left in this final|pg||
nt|athene: the scores on 27 & 28 don't look great for Nickell|pg||
nt|iceking: so what will they do now|pg||
nt|athene: not disasters but not the potential for huge gains either|pg||
nt|iceking: blow things up |pg||
nt|iceking: and hope for some miracles|pg||

nt|bt: i was just writing that :-)|pg||
nt|bt: great minds think alike|pg||
nt|stoffers: You are sooo slow :)|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: today we are playing 15 brd rounds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First to 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: then he has do duck to 3. tme and play N for @CA|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell also in 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: i made an extensive analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yesterday we 14 brd rounds|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hehe, i didnt, i saw it before :)|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 6@C coming up now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had|pg||
nt|algraves: so a NT partscore for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meck|pg||
nt|tlc: a kibitzer mentioned that Helness played this in 5@h and got a @H lead!  still guessed it right|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: reckon they will have cause to regret board 21  |pg||
nt|toral5: lucky i wd say|pg||
nt|algraves: he would have eventully switched to @D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: He never gets to play in his solid suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's better than 50%|pg||
nt|bt: minor suit slams are not the strength of standard systems imho|pg||
nt|rv: possibly @DT as well|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: Why is that lucky?|pg||
nt|toral5: very thin 1@H here|pg||
nt|davidb: something to say against leading low from  3 small in this typical situation .|pg||
nt|norby: play king of hearts, make 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@hD = 800 :)|pg||
nt|bt: 4@H cue stands out, and is strangely symmetric|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: West could D = extra vaues - and East could pass|pg||
nt|ady: North happy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for sure|pg||
nt|tlc: bd 26|pg||
nt|kareno: Ira Rubin used to call notrumps, "grabbits,"  first to bid them grabs them :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Zia waggled the one spade bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with very different sequence|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bt: 4@H = i have extras, hearts controlled and am interested in higher, could that be wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room is being broadcasted in the VG theatre|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so we have a lot of cameras around us|pg||
nt|stoffers: I think most top pairs wil reach 6@c on this hand. So many points and trumps together. Hard to find out its on a finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Certain symmetry.  East has AQ... in South's suit, so bids the suit that North has AQ.... and noone can bid any more|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzta: and 2 cameramans|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: problem w 3@S is that it is ambigious|pg||
nt|toral5: most pairs will surely land in 6@C|pg||
nt|toral5: atleast the top ones|pg||
nt|stoffers: går an å spille på ja|pg||
nt|rv: 1@C is strong @c, double by Meckstorth shows 5-8 in classical precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Sry, that was private, meaning he COULD go down playing N for K@h and Q@s|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H by west wd have made life easy for becker i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I assume 2@H agrees clubs without 4 spades, so 3@S is not natural, is it?|pg||
nt|toral5: 6@C does have a play.he might play for a vienna coup on north|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i did not notice an alert|pg||
nt|toral5: and as the cards are the roof will fall|pg||
nt|toral5: with @S q IN|pg||
nt|bt: thats a good point, the devious 1@H may lead him wrong|pg||
nt|bt: when south has @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, a losing option|pg||
nt|toral5: and full chances to go wrong cos of THAT super thin 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: after the bidding is best chance the sueeeze when S show @DA - but will Strul play for that?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker still thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy for us to see what's right because we have all 52 cards to look at|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and stil thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hear that Kit Woolsey got it wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He played for the squeeze|pg||
nt|toral5: did kit recieve a 1@H oc?|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 2nt opening is 19-20|pg||
nt|algraves: no big deal but note that the overcall by Hampson did not hurt their bidding gave away information|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|rv: folks who themselves play precision generally don't like to Intefere with artificial methods like CRASH/Suction against others who play precision, possibly some sympathy for ...|pg||
nt|rv: comrades:)|pg||
nt|norby: more easy after 1 heart overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: does greco have singleton heart honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell stil thinking|pg||
nt|norby: i dont understand why greco dont bidding 2 diamond.......|pg||
nt|rv: I believe Greco-Hampson play Mathe against strong @c, Hampson could have doubled to show majors|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: Discard a @H and play @H|pg||
nt|stewball: note that N didnt dbl 2@d|pg||
nt|algraves: he played Meckstroth to have 4@H and not throw the third one when dummy had only one left. he made an error|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|toral5: ouch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: EW had it all to themselves in that room|pg||
nt|bt: winning imps against robinson, lol|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 25 only 4 out of 8 pairs bid the fine 6@c - not top-standard :(|pg||
nt|rv: he chose to bid 1@h and hide his @s suit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will need some play|pg||
nt|jkotor: I think Cayne 14 imps behind after board 25, other Polish (Balicki-Zmudzinski) with Lauria-Versace trying hard|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are way too high - but there was little chance of stopping in time.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant make 4 spades whatever defence does|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia explaining that he can bid 1 NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is why he wiggled or waggled the 1 @S bid|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|bt: some suffer after 1@D-(1@S) when 2@C is not forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul did not play but Helgemo already preapred diamond ace for play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Woolsey opened a Precision 2@C and then North was out of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: prepared|pg||
nt|bt: what was explanation of 4NT?|pg||
nt|davidb: entry problem for finessing twice|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson: The lack of spade spots meant there was little play and with unfavorable diamond situation this will be down several.|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: This wont look easy from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|pelu: I would X - and then play against 2@DX - making|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzta: do not know|pg||
nt|toral5: 4nt alerted as?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: it was alerted|pg||
nt|norby: with the cards of hampson i prefere bid heart and spades , like 2 club or double against club strong or PASS|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs 6  trump tricks but  not quite possible|pg||
nt|norby: is strange that me and the pair american play so different:-))))|pg||
nt|stewball: no trumps to lead and not many quick tricks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|rmb1: There are 15 boards per segment, 60 in each match.  This final segment ends with board 30|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jtr: Pitch @d then @c|pg||
nt|rv: if you have to get in, I much prefer double to show majors|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: 3 more tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|algraves: private|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|nt|jtr: Oh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toral5: becker surely dint take it as rkcb in @C in leiu of bidding 5c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe club to jack?|pg||
nt|jtr: Mind you South cant attack @ds to advanat|pg||
nt|jtr: advantage|pg||
nt|jtr: As finesses are taken into him|pg||
nt|algraves: so this reveals all to Rodwell who now knows entire shape|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|swanson: I am told that GIB says it can be made - but GIB has the hand record.|pg||
nt|kareno: Ten of hearts looked like suit preference.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|algraves: as Hampson did not continue diamond he had only one|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|nt|bt: some wise commentators suggested 4@H, that might have simplified things, lol|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jkotor: open cards maybe could won|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|bt: playing for the squeeze in 6@C is antipercentage but if you are down to a good team maybe its good strategy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he claimed saying i cash ak of spades in q will fall i make 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: if q will fal......|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: makeas the same 6 tricks in hearts |pg||
nt|rmb1: more symmetry|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the heart queen coming down in 3 must help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm i was sure Zia decided he wanted to continue the tap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which i think leads to down 2    but don't quote me|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman stil thinking|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzta: he said I am going to make and now explaining|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dJ|pc|c7|pg||

nt|dburn: might barely end up defending 3@d doubled|pg||
nt|iceking: Rodwell will dbl this and not much Meck can do about that |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: so how will this go on @S lead |pg||
nt|passell: surely meck will pass needing some big ones|pg||
nt|iceking: and its possible ew are in 3-4 fit or what do they open with 4-4-3-2|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth sips some water and is probably making calculations|pg||
nt|athene: he'll surely pass but he won't be expecting to get that rich|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth asks if the 3 @D bid shows 5 diamonds and Moss shrugs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|passell: moss is happy with his hand|pg||
nt|iceking: sure he is but do we like this 3@D bid what is wrong with 2@D |pg||
nt|athene: if east is going to bid 3@D on that hand i wonder what hand he would bid 2@D on|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: it is getting very noisy outside, with players celebrating|pg||
nt|passell: especially with the game they are having|pg||
nt|iceking: just looks like a very normal 2@D bid at least it does to me:)|pg||
nt|passell: looks like probably 1 down|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb 2@d has special meaning (such as @h trf)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss taking his time.|pg||
nt|iceking: been told ew play 1@D always unbal so most of the times its a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|iceking: that ofcourse changes my view alot|pg||
nt|iceking: and maybe explains Gitelmans bid |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth asks that the hall be cleared, as there are lots of rowdy players outside, but they are mostly in the area outside the ballroom and the director says he can not clear ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: them away|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: he will do his best to keep the hall cleared, but it is still pretty noisy with celebrants|pg||
nt|dburn: try the fire alarm|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: twice, I have gone out and asked for quiet :)|pg||
nt|dburn: and if that doesn't work, try the fire extinguishers|pg||
nt|iceking: Moss doesnt want to do any mistake here, he probably things if he makes this its all over|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth was very irritated when he asked if there was any way that the hall could be quieted|pg||
nt|iceking: so this hand might take some time |pg||
nt|dinos1: think he'll take 2nd @s and lead low @h|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell making more apparently unconscious gestures with the nervews|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|passell: club finesse ruff a club then low heart looks better|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|pc|d2|nt|passell: winning and dia back is best here|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Junior players are celebrating, but I cannot tell which teams :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Frenchs for sure....|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: o, the 10 @S was not played from dummy and I did not see what @S spot, the 2 or 4 was played by Meckstroth. Sorry :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth did duck the @DK|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: I have been learning all kinds of information on the celebrants however :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: when I type, I miss plays, so sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moss has not played another card|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: only the 2 tricks have been played|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: may be relying on the time-honored principle that if you don't play anything, you can't go down|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: we might as well start telling some world news soon |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|dburn: after about three days the Director will come and fine both sides the same amount for slow play, but that changes little|pg||
nt|iceking: As many pointed out the last miner is on his way up now |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell, visibly tired, says sorry and thinks some more|pg||
nt|iceking: yes just take your time |pg||
nt|iceking: Fantoni would be proud of this tempo even:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the dummy is correct, except for having the 10 @S instead of the 3 @S|pg||
nt|iceking: so after 35min its time for Rodwell to take some time and try to remember what on earth has happened on this board|pg||

nt|bt: no 15brds|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had a bathroom break here|pg||
nt|algraves: so it seems the club finesse was safe at that point|pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: they say, lol|pg||
mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|vugraphzta: back in play now|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Zia should have cashed the heart early - guess he can make then.|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@H EW|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 boards - now Nickell need more that 1 miracle :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Zia talking about the last hand and coughing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stoffers: first trick, J@c-Q@c-K@c. then 2 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think we can congratulate Nickell team|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@s NS?|pg||
nt|jkotor: NS can put EW into 5@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: W cannot pas 4@s :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem apparently explaining about possible hands for Martens|pg||
nt|bt: unless decl goes up ace off course|pg||
nt|bt: dont know why he would though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 3nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will Zia find another bisd?|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Greco did not reopen double with lightish values and a void. ONe needs to avoid re opening with voids as your defense is really limited|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: Will Hamman?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: of course|pg||
nt|rv: Traian you are doing a terrific job|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: or 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, 6@c plays quite well for EW, too |pg||
nt|stoffers: I am soooo glad noone ever taught me jack denies...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: NS make 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 2@H guarantees 4@H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzta: the cards are going too fast for me and he claims|pg||
nt|swanson: This might be another ten for Nickell - it is easy to imagine that N-S would double a 'save' of 5@C against 4@S.|pg||
nt|rmb1: This should be quick|pg||
nt|kareno: Competing for the partscore. and happy to push e/w up a level.|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this was very fast at the table|pg||
nt|tlc: the balance has now secured a plus position for NS|pg||
nt|algraves: Rodwell reluctant to lead A of @S of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell thinking now|pg||
nt|algraves: but wont lead a red suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzta: Zia says that they can make 4 @S lol|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is consdiering a Tref|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: of course lol|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heart lead into heart bidder - often best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are bidding like juniors... they are in heat 1 and they know it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: my grandmother would turn in her grave  3NT with 22 points|pg||
nt|jtr: Great lead though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C checkback  2@D  2-5-3-3|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bt: sometimes too much knowledge is bad, i agree|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves: finally goes with partners suit|pg||
nt|jtr: But West has a lot of discards to make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|stoffers: i am just a wizard..shal i tka the next 10 tricks also, lool|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Greco-Hampson bid a 3NT on a combined 20 count earlier. It was cold|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: I would have thought this was rather dangerous by Hamman  Could neasily run into a double if @ds arent behaving|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: Still, Zia could have more|pg||
pc|hA|nt|algraves: and is pleased|pg||
nt|jtr: Much prefer 3@d to 2NT with the offsuit holdings|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West has no problem finding 5 discards so this must be 1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D7 lead is Zia -- not systemic|pg||
pc|h6|nt|algraves: he want to signal diamond thru|pg||
nt|tlc: there's always the saying that "it's hard to lose the post-mortem by leading partner's suit"|pg||
nt|algraves: rather than a trump promotion|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stoffers: wasn't it zia that mentioned that convention in 'bridge my way' ?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rmb1: +1 when @SQ appears|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks     some will play in 4@H   which will also make   in spite of  a ruff in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia claiming |pg||
nt|algraves: this guarantees his 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|norby: yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|algraves: although it doesnt matter what meck does|pg||
nt|algraves: so he takes safe course|pg||
pc|s6|nt|toral5: heading for 4 losers in trump suit now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|norby: 100 %|pg||

nt|bt: 1@S or 1!N?|pg||
nt|bt: 1N i mean|pg||
nt|rmb1: Zia has had some awful hands this segment|pg||
nt|algraves: so technically excellent all around|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fred misguessed hearts on 26 but still made 3NT. He guessed the endplay|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ady: 2 tens spoil a perfect hand for Zia|pg||
nt|tlc: anyone open 2@h with E's hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jkotor: seems to be close finish|pg||
nt|stoffers: Who uses penalty doubles in the passout seat anymore? Noone i know|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 1NT that is|pg||
nt|bt: the west hand used to be a automatic double, i dont know what the world is coming to|pg||
nt|ady: might be in dummy trick 1|pg||
nt|algraves: note Hampson staying awake to play K of @s which made it too danerous for Rodwell not to cash out|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Helness asking Becker about leads|pg||
nt|toral5: north has 9 tricks if he BOLDLY guesses @C,else hapy with 8|pg||
nt|pelu: down 4 or winning - all on the @S-layout |pg||
nt|toral5: he will surely hook @S for 120|pg||
nt|rmb1: He will be please to put it down as dummy and find something to read|pg||
nt|ady: could have been a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman: Thank you partner|pg||
mb|1N|nt|swanson: This match looked absolutely hopeless for Nickell then boards ago and yet it is down to the wire.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Polite as ever|pg||
nt|ady: thank you very much indeed partner|pg||
nt|kareno: Not I.  3 at a different vulnerability perhaps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: it is critical to find a relaxed attention at the table. awake but not uptight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you stop short of game here? The answer is probably that you don't|pg||
nt|algraves: and then ride that energy , like a horse|pg||
nt|norby: 2 hearts??|pg||
nt|athene: nice 3@H, taking lots of important bidding room away from west|pg||
nt|norby: vulnerable?|pg||
nt|rv: what would panel bid with Rodwell's hand in this one? he may bid 4@h on way to 5@d?|pg||
nt|norby: 5 cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep... that was the bid|pg||
nt|norby: no good hearts?|pg||
nt|norby: no points?|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|norby: other bridge sorry|pg||
nt|robinswr: you have to mid against meckwell or they'll steal you blind|pg||
nt|rv: Hampson's 2@h was definitely risky at these colors|pg||
nt|norby: great distribution, i forgot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so they even get to decide which 3 card suit to open!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|swanson: ten boards|pg||
nt|jtr: 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: I they bid it they deserve to be world champs|pg||
nt|davidb: 6NT  can be made from N |pg||
nt|algraves: welll  I wonder if they can get out in 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure he will win - but if @s-finess lose then 9 red winners for EW|pg||
nt|jtr: if|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 1@D - 2@D is a position where EW are stealing though|pg||
nt|algraves: apparently not|pg||
nt|stewball: aside from the results in the other room,Greco/Hampson have given up nothing here|pg||
nt|stewball: very strong set|pg||
nt|algraves: Hamman just looking to create something different.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|toral5: yes:):(|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D will pretty much always have sound values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  systemic agreement is 1@C with 3@C & 3@D   so blame state of match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or what Allan said :)|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows his team is in trouble one way or another|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: he just decided he had the most he could have for a passed hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: if 6NT East has to avoid diamond lead|pg||
nt|davidb: good  bidding |pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right John -- Greco-Hampson spot on this set|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: convention cards are exchanged|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia says oh, it is one of those|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 28 EW are not vulnerable - so if Meckstroth-Rodwell bid game, it is only 6 imps|pg||
nt|swanson: Hamman has shown four spades with this auction and could have held only four hearts, so Zia corrects.|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia just said 6 clubs is the spot probably|pg||
nt|jtr: now i do|pg||
nt|athene: (north decided)|pg||
nt|algraves: I think that is why he put in the J of @H in 3NT to be honest|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|algraves: well against Meckwell in particular you do need to get your good suits in as they really like to bid the pushy 3NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: 9 of hearts suit preferance for spades|pg||
nt|athene: if east is going to bid 2nt, north wants to get a heart lead, i guess|pg||
nt|algraves: so you try and help partner with the lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|rv: unfortunately bridge scoring doesn't give a rebate for vul doubled undertricks if you are passed hand:)|pg||
nt|algraves: and Hampson does not want to wake up tomorrow wishing he had bid 2@H|pg||
nt|algraves: he would sleep OK if he went for 800|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the way he plays|pg||
nt|robinswr: amazing how often it works out that when in doubt bid|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he would just wake up tomorrow thinking " i wish partner had had better heart support for my overcall" :)|pg||
nt|algraves: or just bad luck|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rmb1: Cash AKQ to establish another winner - for defence|pg||
nt|algraves: ten of @H I mean|pg||
nt|algraves: they have been very tough from the word go|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: so it looks like they need to bid six |pg||

pc|hK|nt|vugraphzta: i missed the play sorry|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yet another catchall 1@D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rmb1: Thanks to David, Traian (op), WBF and USBF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: we started with 17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 31 must be the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 15 brd rounds|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahhh for the comparisons.  So we have two to go.|pg||
nt|algraves: this is a bad hand type for precision so meckstroth upgrades to a club rather than open a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: women last brd 32 our is 31|pg||
nt|norby: i appreciate hampson and greco but sometime in the bidding they have completely difference of the italian style, i understand aggressive bridge but 2 hearts is bridge poker|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: and versace|pg||
nt|robinswr: on board 27 not opening 3diamonds could have cost 10 imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 4@H can make - u can pick up the @C-suit: B to K and A, 9 to 10 and Q and @C5 to finess @c&!|pg||
nt|pelu: @c6|pg||
nt|kittyc: in oher rooms south showed both suits (eg if East bids 2S then South can bid 3D)|pg||
nt|bt: thats to make 5 isnt it|pg||
nt|kareno: 64 is a better number of boards to include all the dealer and vulnerability possibilities|pg||
nt|tlc: dbl T/O|pg||
nt|rv: 1n in this position and seat is 11-13?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: around 30 hcp for e/w   but not fitting to well|pg||
nt|athene: no, 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  27 taking different turn in other room    P-1@D-1@S-3@D[gitelman]//P-P-DBL-P   now Meck in the tank|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kittyc: yes, 4 is cold|pg||
nt|rmb1: tomorrow for the semifinals ... that's today for those us in Europe (00:53 am)|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I am down the midde Canadian|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a singleton its usually right to bid over 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: heart suit worth more than 6|pg||
nt|algraves: from an earlier time|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tlc: usually showing a maximum 1@d bid|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I agree Karen seems silly of WBF to play only 60 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ok i will|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 27 ends in 3@DX |pg||
nt|pelu: he passed - and making/-1 very close - I exp down 1|pg||
nt|algraves: They have 9 top tricks 2@H, 1@D 2@C and 4 @S|pg||
nt|algraves: so defense has to be careful not to let 10th one through|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dummy @S cards look awfully good -- are you sure Greco can't ensure 10 tricks since @DA onside?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has a lot of commucation-problems - but take @HK and play @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking attack @C before @D|pg||
nt|pelu: bit that from vrong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe same after @HK pitch @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play to ruff @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe i'm biased from seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco still thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: u can only ruff 1 @C - East can overruff @H and play @S 2x|pg||
nt|stewball: looks like a hard make if the @d A is off|pg||
nt|algraves: Hamman may have had to lead a trump to beat this|pg||
nt|stewball: perhaps the @h J had suit pref implications|pg||
nt|algraves: sort of counter intuitive with K 5th , it seems right to try for force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems that it should, doesn't it John?|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see: @HK (@D) and @D will give decl 10 tricks - but - as normal - not sure :)|pg||
nt|pelu: still in trick 1 in 3@DX|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: tak Bjørn :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: rodwell went quietly|pg||
nt|stewball: hmm,,this is unexpected..to me anyway|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzta: this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|kareno: In the ACBL we have seen the numbers of boards degraded so swiss matches are now only 6, not a good thing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: from tom we have 16 i think|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is one down at least|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H shortage - maybe both minors- |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: can be no great swing in for this hand    so Woolfson should be through  17 imps ahead|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think East thinks that an overtrick or two here is going to win the match |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well he is thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: 3@C would have made undoubtedly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i mean tomorrow we will have 16...last day|pg||
nt|kareno: But session fees have gone UP to compensate for fewer boards :(|pg||
nt|algraves: so east is playing with the houses money as they say|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|pelu: sorry that for 11 tricks - but still a nice finess: @c5 , @c6, @c8 to setup @c4!|pg||
nt|bt: so if u get a 2suited overcall makng 5 is easy i guess|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now Hamman can prevent @C ruffs|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|algraves: so the young israelis played well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kittyc: yes Woolsey made 5 in 5 after 2 suited bid|pg||
nt|toral5: i think 11 makes if he runs @C jack|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but gives it back??|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|algraves: and this match is a toss up at the half|pg||

nt|kareno: They surely have.  |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Israel came 3rd at the European Championships this summer after Italy and Poland. Israel is a strong bridge nation|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: can see 8 tricks but where is ninth?- nfound it|pg||
nt|stewball: hamman may think declarer wouldnt play like this without the @c 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the @S spots mean declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||

mb|p|nt|Zmud99: 2@H : 12-14 without a 5 cards suit|pg||

nt|norby: i say goodbye at all the kibbitzer , and only small goodbye at my friends commentator ........|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: thanks all|pg||
nt|algraves: but it is more normal it seems to play in the safety of the strong @D since cannot verify @S situation|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|norby: better 6 diamonds but not easy|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|algraves: @H is to be avoided as trumps since you can go down on bad trump break with 6NT or 6@D cold|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the lesson of this hand, dont be too quick to play 4 4 major in 6 or 7|pg||
nt|algraves: if you have the tricks elsewhere|pg||
nt|algraves: for all you writing in saying 6NT is down on spade lead, look again you have 2 spade tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson in the tank|pg||
