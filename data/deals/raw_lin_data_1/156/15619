nt|phil: I would think Joel bids 5H here|pg||
nt|tez: he was underbidding while we played together:)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|genesaxe:  The 6 H save isn't especially cheap, if most don't bid a slam.  E/W can optimize and get 2 ruffs, 1D, 2C.|pg||

nt|genesaxe:  It has to be: you started a club, and Smith and I played that anything 4S and above would create a force.|pg||
nt|phil: If West is 'planning' on bidding 6D all along, he needs to be very careful in his mannerisms....my experience is that people love to coffee-house and bid a slow, painful 6D, which ...|pg||
nt|phil: is very wrong|pg||
nt|genesaxe:  Everyone is behind screens; so, you only have one person seeing your play-acting....|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: director here because of time issues |pg||

nt|phil: a 4N opening for specific aces was suggested - I think that is a fine idea, although as you can see an ace was not needed|pg||

nt|vugraphzsw: last here.  back in a little more than one hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: thanks for the great comments and to the specs|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|henryb:  and the link I got is to the Mixed Swiss teams|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|vugraphzsw: special thanks to Henry and Gene and the other commentators|pg||
nt|genesaxe:  Even Rodwell will duck and not bid here.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|henryb:  If he was going to lead a @c towards his hand, why not win the @dK at trick 1|pg||
nt|genesaxe:  Perhaps rise A, and play a diamond, pitching the H loser?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: next session in one hour -- 4:30 in Philadelphia|pg||
nt|henryb:  At last report Levin and Weinstein had built a useful lead, but you will be able to see in about 30 minutes on the WBF website|pg||
nt|genesaxe:  If Gawrys plays a loser on a loser, then he can guess out the shape (3-4-4-2) and perhaps only lose 2 clubs.|pg||

nt|genesaxe:  Good for Rodwell, so he can play a H through.... same issue however...  now Gawrys has to decide NOW, or he gets tapped out.|pg||

nt|vugraphzsw: from dec's point of view, rodwell could have started with 5 hearts and 3 clubs (the 2 of clubs has not been played)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: 2 of hearts i meant|pg||
pc|sK|nt|genesaxe:  N captures 3 tricks on defense.... a triumph for little cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now it does not matter. If he cashes the @s, Zia gets the last 2. if he plays the @cQ Zia ruffs and plays a trump|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzsw: thanks all|pg||
