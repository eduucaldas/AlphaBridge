nt|janroberts:  Sorry to whine, but I miss having the running scores:(|pg||
nt|3for3: Only one score is running as of now...|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|3for3: That would be Rabinowitz, we believe it is 41-0|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|janroberts:  Holy cow|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|3for3: I like a raise to 2@H here, even without 4 card support|pg||
nt|janroberts:  a shut-out. Who do they think they are?  The Phillies?:)|pg||
nt|louisg: Looks like the light opening bid leads to a bad game here.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: Isn't 24 balanced standard to be in game these days?|pg||
nt|louisg: Unfortunately, yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT is a pretty reasonable effort|pg||
nt|guru:  Hopefully Korth can re-group at half (after board 14).  They probably will have 2 different partnerships |pg||
nt|bigtrain: certainly i would want to be there at this colour|pg||
nt|vugraphzju: rowland asks if E Kotkin must have a 5 card heart suit. M Kotkin says it's unlikely since they have ways to check if E Kotkin has 3 only.|pg||
nt|3for3: throw in the Ten of diamonds, and 3nt is quite good|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: with or without the @D10 you want to be there vulnerable|pg||
nt|louisg: only 50% with the DT, right?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|3for3: better, as the spades might be friendly|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|louisg: and opening leader might have 5 spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: better than that|pg||
nt|vugraphzju: sorry, I should have said if M Kotkin has only 3 hearts.|pg||

nt|henryb:  N-S made 120 in the other room, so another 9 imps, 50-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|louisg: undo|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|3for3: perhaps slam on the last board?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|3for3: probably not after that start|pg||
nt|louisg: 6S not that good, but can probably make|pg||
nt|henryb:  the other room played 3N making 5 when South chose to rebid 3@d|pg||
nt|louisg: I don't think they will sniff at it though|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|henryb:  4@d now looks right|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 6@S isn't even 50%|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: and requires a successful guess on top of that|pg||
nt|vugraphzju: 3C was a game try.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|louisg: That would suggest that 3S was NF, which doesn't make sense.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  the enemy has to lead something, Walter, and either round suit makes the slam pretty good: 3-2 spades and diamonds 3-3 or 4-2|pg||

pc|sA|nt|guru:  Allison, how long of a break do we have between halves?|pg||
mc|12|nt|bigtrain: its basically an optimist's slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  true, and neither does a diamond|pg||
nt|3for3: 14 more boards coming up soon|pg||
nt|henryb:  Korth gets an imp|pg||
nt|bigtrain: long run loser though|pg||
nt|vugraphzju: That brings the first half to a close. We will return to the second half in about 30 minutes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzju: We will leave this room open for a few minutes while we update the score. We WILL have running scores in the second half.|pg||
nt|vugraphzju: See you back here in about 30 minutes.|pg||
nt|3for3: thanks to all the spex, the commentators, and of course Allison fo wondeful VG operation|pg||
nt|louisg: Yes, thanks very much Allison.|pg||
nt|vugraphzju: We're closing down now for about 20 minutes to compare scores. See you soon.|pg||
