nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||

mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Seems as we need a bit BBO help here: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Walddk4: welcome to Martin Johnson|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi johan, spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Sr2@D|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  W loves to open 1 Nt on many hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: di nuovo dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  very optimistic|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: se giocano lebenshol dichiarano 3nt, se non la giocano ora è tosta dire 3nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: maybe just misclickd alert|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  this board I would have bid 2@H with south hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|timverbeek:  but I play that as 8-11 5crd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north can not be expected to realize 4@H is cold, south had to bid again|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb:  More timidity from Ticha, who should bid 3@s after partner bids 2|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might do if NV|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Good pass bye east i think |pg||
nt|eugenio123: giocheranno lebenshol|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  Ticha is the player who did not bid 3@d on 82|pg||
pc|sK|nt|timverbeek:  is it forcing?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

nt|vugraphzjt: a kibitzer is telling me that Katherina is only 15|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: so we can excuse her with her young spirit and lack of experience |pg||

nt|timverbeek:  in signalling|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes but that did not matter|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But that doesnt matter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|timverbeek:  luckily for NS, only an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they had a little conversation about it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|possessed: an aggressive one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: really|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  She is very aggressiv but this ...:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: looks like another 4@s hand|pg||
nt|athene: similar thing, 1@C is weak balanced or a big hand|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 3nt senza storia|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: will end up at 800|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is close, but 3nt is better than 4@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|timverbeek:  hmm South a little passive in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as someting can be of here,|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  passing twice is very passive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and west should at least explore that possibility|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|gronkvist:  E has relly good cards for prepassed hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  would you open 3@D with the southand Johan?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes the second time i thought should wouldbid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|possessed: they can survive with 200 now, not too bad against 100|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2 down again|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and why not?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @s K and a weak suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ie. bid 3nt over 3@H|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|timverbeek:  ok, your pretty pure|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  this one may be less successful|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In first position its more temptating|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS is only 16 and 15 y and Irma Petersen plays her first champoionship|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|henryb:  as in down off the top|pg||
nt|psyck: they may take 1st 4 tricks now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW were second last EC in 2009 in Brasov|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|henryb:  Top on a board is 50; the top 4 scores are within 10 matchpoints; 5th is 100 matchpoints behind|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there was not much in the way of clues to spade layout|pg||

mb|4C|nt|vugraphzjt: but one grand slam can change a lot |pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ntmon: 3@H seems to be 'OMAR' convention - other major confirms slam intentions|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ntmon: then series of cue-bids|pg||
nt|ntmon: and indispensable BW|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: i think they will stop in 6|pg||
nt|ntmon: most probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: after finding out they don t have Q @S |pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ntmon: i think that W did not exclude 4-card fit|pg||

nt|eugenio123: by now I will comment in english to let you all understand|pg||
nt|eugenio123: nowadays it's normal to open with 12 points so I guess burgio will|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so a tight match so far|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  other table preempted in second round|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hello Yuval|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|gronkvist:  Yes they have and 4@h should bee a relly good hand often|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Hi yuval :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eugenio123: all pass I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hey :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So the only boards with som imps was the 3@c -1 that Fra find 4@h in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 nt or any FG hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Indeed|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|timverbeek:  wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|gronkvist:  It not my cup of tea to play this way but you have too if u should play with the youngsters ;)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: a chance for glory :|pg||
nt|yuval10: i predict just made|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but this is winning|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gronkvist:  N is very optimistic player i said before ;)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|psyck: heading for 3@s, 1@h, 3@d, 2@c tricks maybe|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2 down again |pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will be hard to stop in 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|psyck: this defense makes it easy for declarer, not there there was much defense could do|pg||
nt|henryb:  working hard on setting up declarer's tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|timverbeek:  think optimism scores more points than pessimism |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  so I like it :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: her name, by the way, is "Petersen"...as "Irma Petersen"|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
