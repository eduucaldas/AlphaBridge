nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||

nt|henryb:  so much for my predictions|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||

mb|p|pc|h9|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||

nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
