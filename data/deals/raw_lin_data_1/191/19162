nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||

pc|cK|pc|dJ|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|s5|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||

nt|henryb:  so much for my predictions|pg||
nt|eugenio123: let's hope a normal auction and a normal 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
nt|athene: but fortunately for declarer east can't get in again to cash that @S10|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h7|pc|c3|nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||

nt|henryb:  The road to bad boards is paved with greed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: W couldn't believe N opened with a singelton|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 1nt??? why not 2 or 3@C?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if he had @DK10 doubleton why would he lead the jack?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: cant ask her right now :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||

nt|eugenio123: that's just another way to see this game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yep|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: otherwise declarer has time to develope 2 @d tricks and takes 10 tricks for a great score|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
