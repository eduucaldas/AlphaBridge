mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  2@c puppet to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||

nt|Walddk4: welcome to Martin Johnson|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: hi johan, spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Sr2@D|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  W loves to open 1 Nt on many hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|gronkvist:  very optimistic|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  this board I would have bid 2@H with south hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|timverbeek:  but I play that as 8-11 5crd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north can not be expected to realize 4@H is cold, south had to bid again|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But she knows her partner who loved to use X|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||

mb|3N|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 1nt??? why not 2 or 3@C?|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with the north hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||

nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||

pc|hK|pc|sQ|nt|psyck: that could be the difference between top & bottom here|pg||
nt|yuval10: the margin between 1st and 3rd right now is really so little.... 13 points when a board = 50|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dT|nt|yuval10: now 11 tricks|pg||

nt|psyck: W continues his distaste for @dA|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8 board to go, only 3.5 points seperating between 1st and 2nd, only 11 between 1st and 3rd. everything can happen|pg||

pc|s5|nt|eugenio123: easy 4 @h|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|psyck: some would chose to play in NT with 4333 shape with W I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are the new leaders , but only 2.5 points ahead of the Israeli pair Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gronkvist:  Safety to finesse that way|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|yuval10: can EW help their country-mare's cause?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  I have a kibitzer who says you should only play the 5-3 when the short hand has a ruffing value|pg||
nt|athene: west might have considered leaving 3nt with 4333 but his weak hearts perhaps were a worry|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure how good 3NT is with the natural @h lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s9|nt|timverbeek:  another heart would give declarer problems|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  to late |pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: 3N would require dec to guess right which minor finesse to take|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9 tricks won't be a good success against 10 tricks in 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: 10 tricks not so easy in 4@s either|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: but he is on his way to it now|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @c prevent an overtrick,,,,if he plays @h declarer needs to jump with the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays @h then declarer is between top and bottom - K@h means 11 tricks and a top, low @h means 9 tricks and a bad score|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: but perhaps use extra diamond entry|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: now she's in troubles|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 1 off if S plays @s's twice|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|timverbeek:  yep|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes and 10 of @c|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: now only 10 with no @h tricks|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  aj|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's an opening for declarer|pg||
pc|h3|nt|timverbeek:  still guessing|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|yuval10: but she didn't convert this one too|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and luckily for south|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  west put the 10|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  declarer could have ruffed with the !|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  Q|pg||
nt|yuval10: after N ruffed with the 9@s it's not much of a guess i think....|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  crossed to dummy with king|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h4|pc|d7|nt|athene: north doesn't know declarer has the @CJ so his discards are not so obvious as they are to us|pg||
nt|yuval10: Ginossar-Pachtman surrended an overtrick here so 20% for them on the board|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and pitch a diamond on the heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|d9|nt|yuval10: if S has AJX @s i'm not sure you can make it|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  with 4crd support and such a good hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  I would bid 5@H |pg||

mb|1S|nt|yuval10: 4@s is of course a good bid when 4@h seem to be making for EW|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@S|pg||
