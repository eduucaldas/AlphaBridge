nt|hedyg: the only merit of the N hand is its 6-5 shape|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3m almost always forcing in France :p|pg||

nt|hedyg: now 3@s by W|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he wants to do too well  when there is an interference, the target is to check this suit is stopped  too much work to check every suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ritong: because it creates nebulous auctions|pg||
nt|ritong: most of the time|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2NT showed @s stopper, but not controls|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c seems indicated, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now all E knows is that W has neither ace (would bid XX) nor K(would bid 3NT) of @H|pg||
nt|phil: 3@s is too touchy-feely to me and a last try for 3N.....|pg||
nt|ritong: there is an upside here, though  east knows they miss @h Ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|phil: right|pg||
nt|ritong: but still, he offers grand|pg||
nt|ritong: or prhaps a choice of suits|pg||
nt|phil: 5@s implies 1st round control of hearts in this context - agree? |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@s seems to still be looking for a grand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: absolutely!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: So then this hand would not be able to bid any more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: since it forces to the 6 level he must be trying for 7, else just bid 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Personally I do not agree|pg||
nt|ritong: so, as said previously, this hand is dangerous, due to the small/grand context + a void|pg||
