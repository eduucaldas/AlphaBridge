mb|2D!|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||

pc|dT|pc|cT|pc|dQ|nt|athene: if north did double then south might bid 4@D - if you can make a partscore your way it's always just bad news to let opps get away with losing a 50 or two|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||

nt|henryb:  so much for my predictions|pg||
nt|eugenio123: let's hope a normal auction and a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the Girls series they play 16 X 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: as oppose to the Juniors where they play one set of 20 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: per match|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yuval10: that's of course a force because only 10 teams are playing in the girls'|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|yuval10: Juniors has 22, Schools 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
pc|sA|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
nt|athene: but fortunately for declarer east can't get in again to cash that @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: E cold have taken 2@d ruffs, not 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: *now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|psyck: or more|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer most likely will find the Q@d , after seeing AK @s A@c in South|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||
