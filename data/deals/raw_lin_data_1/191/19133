mb|1C|mb|2H|nt|psyck: yes, will be a poor score for the leaders, they can affort it for now though...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: the no fear weak jump...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: 9 losers, geez|pg||
nt|athene: good offence-defence ratio though|pg||
nt|psyck: no one cares about the vul nowadays either :)|pg||
nt|athene: the hand is worth four tricks in hearts and zero in any other suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: as in not much : none|pg||
nt|pelu: 8 toptricks, but some work for the 9.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: well no one has penalty doubles available much any more|pg||
nt|tejjyid: aren't ratios with 0 denominators banned?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it did suggest a lead and that was good from Hemberg's point of view|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: she did not have to give anything away|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: well this helps declarer out|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's certainly worked |pg||
nt|Walddk2: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: but if south had continued hearts, north might well have led a diamond after winning the @SA anyway|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: south did have something of a problem because declarer could have had more in clubs and less in diamonds, when a diamond shift might be good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fair point|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand, if north had a really good diamond suit she might have led it at trick 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and as she has no entry to her hearts anyway, a shift might have been right|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Declarer has to time this well|pg||
mc|9|nt|tejjyid: I think getting the @H lead ducked for a 4th defensive trick puts NS ahead already|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, that went fast|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can see some pairs making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: another consideration: if west was weak in diamonds and was going to go for the clubs, would she really duck at trick 1 with two heart stops...|pg||
nt|athene: i guess she might still sometimes - so it just is a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Houlberg showed her hand and conceded a trick to @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so an early claim|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No screens in use|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter back to watch his daughter in action|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is quite good for N-S as EW can make a number of spades|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sybarra: 3 @S is max I think |pg||
mc|6|nt|athene: if you play a lot of matchpoints you soon realise that getting stolen from by NV opponents is always a disaster|pg||

nt|tejjyid: interesting board, I'd like ot see how itpans out in the final scoreup|pg||
nt|athene: i bet north thought 3@C was forcing|pg||
nt|athene: reverse after a 2 over 1...|pg||
nt|sybarra: as a passed hand? |pg||
nt|pelu: 2-0-1 + reverse = forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 boards in this session, then a final session with 14 boards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after the reverseafter a 2/1 , I bet she did too|pg||
nt|athene: well, that might make a difference, but she still made a two over one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 47 rounds of 2 boards altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I still prefere a 3@D bid to the 3@C though|pg||
nt|athene: these middling (15, 16 hcp) 5-4 hands often lead to games falling through the cracks |pg||
nt|tejjyid: why keep secrets?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Open Teams tomorrow and Thursday, and open pairs Friday, Saturday and Sunday|pg||
nt|athene: that's why i like opening them 1nt :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think the aggressive reverse is a god treatment, but then getting cold feet subsequently wasn't|pg||
nt|athene: you can see why south decided to pass 3@C even if it was theoretically forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, yes and no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, she forced to game with 2@H, then it seems strange to pass in midstream|pg||
pg||

nt|tejjyid: it IS a inimum reverse, that's true. But double-crossing partner is poor strategy in thel ong term|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm 100% with Roland here|pg||
nt|pelu: back to B3 - why not bid 1@s in East after 1@c - 1@h?|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, i was thinking of 1@S too :)|pg||
nt|athene: well she only has four spades|pg||

nt|pelu: here 2@D transfer would work better - why tell opp that u have a 4 card 1@s|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|athene: unusual to play two-way stayman after a strong notrump|pg||

pc|d6|nt|athene: spade lead might give declarer other problems; not sure it makes life so easy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dQ|nt|athene: you have to win in hand to preserve an entry to the hearts i guess|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|henryb:  South should learn to throw losers and keep winners|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|hT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: low @C just guarantees 9 tricks|pg||
mc|10|nt|henryb:  keeping the fifth spade would have held it to 3|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|pelu: do u all agree in @hK? now N down know who has the 13. @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  The E hand is a problem. Not strong enough for 2@s and 3@s is probably conventional in some form. But 4@s looks like too much to me|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|athene: east decided north would never give ruff and discard if it was costing|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: but that presupposes that NS know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|athene: never respect your opponents THAT much|pg||
nt|henryb:  and ruffing in hand looks silly doesn't it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tejjyid: it does look odd|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: sometimes leading K from Kxx in partner's suit can work out ok|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: back to the lead og @Hk - i will talk to her :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but there is always the danger that partner might play you for Kx|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe East thought North was protecting her KJxx of @S?|pg||
nt|psyck: If the @hK was with the intention of holding the lead to play through dummy, maybe should shift to 1c when it held|pg||
mc|9|nt|tejjyid: Leading the K is OK if you switch afterwards|pg||
nt|henryb:  normal result in the end|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  Peter, was 3@d forcing?|pg||

nt|pelu: Not sure, but i hope :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: everyone knows that with a minor fit you often want to play in 3nt rather than the minor|pg||
nt|athene: that's fine|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|athene: but that does not mean you can't SHOW a minor fit|pg||
nt|athene: and still get into 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: it isn't going to help opps much - they will see it when you put dummy down anyway|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: joint decision making - a lot to be said for it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Clubs, as Edgar Kaplan said, were lost in the thirties. It took until the sixties to lose diamonds. And these days we are working on hearts.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: a lot of systems like SAYC tend to steer people away from ever showing minor fits|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: they say "well, you probably want to play in 3nt"|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|tejjyid: It;s old Henry, but it;s kind of true|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dT|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hT|pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||

pc|d5|pc|hJ|pc|c4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|nt|athene: south just needs some way over 1nt to say "hey, i have a good hand with clubs, whaddya think?"|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: and if north then bids 3nt, ok, fine|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|henryb:  Of course, my tendency with the N hand would be to double 1@s for penalty if possible, otherwise to pass|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: not sure anyone understood the word you used there|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: the one between "for" and "if"|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Doubles are for takeout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm with Henry though, I would be manouevering to defend @S as North|pg||
nt|henryb:  And I see no reason to bid 1N with a singleton in partner's suit and a minimum opening bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how good that will be maybe average?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Above average I think|pg||
nt|pelu: no below average some will for sure trake 11 tricks in NT|pg||

nt|henryb:  430? I would have made 490 after the spade continuation: I think finessing the @c was marked|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|pelu: 490 = +18, 460= +11|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a nine-card fit missing the queen it's very close whether to finesse anyway so any slight indication like an overcall often tips it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and agressive 4 @H, puts is to opps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: double will get them into 4@S|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  7@d would make, as would 7N, but not as secure|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: west knows the @DQJ are about the best doubleton QJ ever|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  6N by E makes on any lead and any distribution of the opponent's cards|pg||

nt|athene: people might think that west will naturally go for notrumps with all that stuffing in hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|athene: but it is not quite so obvious to choose 6NT over 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: partner has 6@D 4@S so she has a singleton in one or other suit|pg||
nt|psyck: could get to 7 now with all key cards & extras shown|pg||
nt|athene: so yes you would choose 3nt over 5@D, but not necessarily 6nt over 6@D|pg||

nt|henryb:  West melds 100: 60 queens and pinochle|pg||

nt|henryb:  now which finesse will be taken?|pg||
nt|pelu: she can go down - play N for @CK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: and the usual trump lead vs grand|pg||
nt|athene: you can combine chances a bit? try and ruff some clubs and then fall back on the heart finesse?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not - there is the fourth round of spades to worry about as well|pg||
nt|pelu: u dont have so many entries in dummy|pg||
