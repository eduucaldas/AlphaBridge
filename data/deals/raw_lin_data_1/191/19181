mb|p|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d9|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|nt|gronkvist:  But W could always make it but it would be harder|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|athene: if north did double then south might bid 4@D - if you can make a partscore your way it's always just bad news to let opps get away with losing a 50 or two|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Beginners might have cashed @CA first, but these players are too experienced for that. They know that an honour from the West hand first is the way forward|pg||
nt|eugenio123: in this board we may see a real war|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I hope we will|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: look that both sides have game|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I know |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|3C!|nt|eugenio123: unv vs vul I agree the 2suiter despite her suits are poor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: Canonne explained to Peteresen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: that 3@C is Q & @D |pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: @H & @D ofcourse|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: south should bid something like 4nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: a moment of thinking for Thizy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: put her cards on the table :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: to show her gret interest in partner's suits|pg||
nt|eugenio123: great|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I regret 4@s by east, no sense! too strong, too many trumps and a fantastic distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: me too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: especially after N @H & @D bid and probably good K@D |pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: 4@H should be much better for example|pg||
mb|5H|nt|eugenio123: I would've bid something like 3@h/@d and then showing fit in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|eugenio123: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: Hi Ralf|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@H i cheap if you locate @CQ in 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hello Roland Eugenio and Stefan|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eugenio123: I continue saying 5@h is not the correct bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess you do after North has shown a two-suiter|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I would've bid 4nt |pg||
nt|eugenio123: so now there's the problem: who is defending? who is attacking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: again Thizy cards are on the table |pg||
nt|eugenio123: UNV  vs VUL will let them decide to bid 6@h probably|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: nice choice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the par result in theory|pg||

nt|Walddk4: welcome to Martin Johnson|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: hi johan, spectators|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Sr2@D|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||

nt|henryb:  so much for my predictions|pg||
nt|eugenio123: let's hope a normal auction and a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the Girls series they play 16 X 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: as oppose to the Juniors where they play one set of 20 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: per match|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: that's of course a force because only 10 teams are playing in the girls'|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3C!|nt|yuval10: Juniors has 22, Schools 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  pass on S was conservative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s4|pg||

nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But 7 down is a good score for EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|psyck: an aggresive choice with that hand|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 2@H over 1@S with north hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  extremely normal 1@S by north|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|timverbeek:  you will loose so many part scores|pg||

nt|henryb:  The road to bad boards is paved with greed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  east is lucky north had a bid |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are playing negative free bids....which means South is slotted to have a very poor hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  thats true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the inferences work the other way too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|yuval10: W couldn't believe N opened with a singelton|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|timverbeek:  but with xxx xxxx KQx Axx south could have passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  and then your missing a lot if you pass|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|eugenio123: 1nt??? why not 2 or 3@C?|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with the north hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if he had @DK10 doubleton why would he lead the jack?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Now she must find a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: cant ask her right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: that's why|pg||
nt|eugenio123: that's just another way to see this game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: found it :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  WD|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yuval10: otherwise declarer has time to develope 2 @d tricks and takes 10 tricks for a great score|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S a better contract here|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and think west should bid 4@S|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hand seems worthless in 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|timverbeek:  but after a heartlead from north.....|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S is without chance|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mignon87: 2@d by north over south's 1NT would have shown 18-20 points with any shape|pg||
