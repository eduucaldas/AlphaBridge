nt|bagman: E is likely to lose 4 aces and the @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: Not sure if leading the Q is right - if you rest in 4@S and assuming 2 diamond losers you just need to cater for 1 spade loser|pg||
nt|smirny: but after we had some bad boards as we could find S fit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|basu_4139: probably asks cue somewhere|pg||
nt|basu_4139: a 3H cue takes N into the perfect position.I believe a 3N shows a mild H.Any one suggests otherwise?|pg||
nt|smirny: we changed back to DBL 4 and 1S 5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes on this board that's probably right - but generally|pg||

nt|andy_h: assuming no club ruffs looming I think the best play is a small trump from W (dummy). Obviously North would have a hard time ducking with Kx so if North plays low you stick in the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||
