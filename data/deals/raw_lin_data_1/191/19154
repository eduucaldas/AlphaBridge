mb|3C|nt|andyv:  would you open 1@d instead of 1@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: depends on my methods - I do what I am supposed to do|pg||

nt|poohbear: Birman should get this right|pg||
nt|poohbear: not that it matters really. The defense can cash 2@hs and have no choice as to what to do|pg||
nt|poohbear: but partner has given proper count in @cs|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 1N E/W next door, as south didn't overcall|pg||
nt|poohbear: IF Birman had @hs other than the King he would shift to that suit . So a @c continuation indicates he has the king and partner can play them from his side|pg||
nt|poohbear: can underlead even|pg||
nt|poohbear: We will see if padon does indeed underlead @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Birman is in deep thinking|pg||
nt|poohbear: a @h seems to be 100 percent safe no matter what declarer has in @cs|pg||
nt|poohbear: and if he does play a @h he should play K|pg||
nt|poohbear: so there are no accidents|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: and McIntosh has stayed true to his roots by continuing his aggressive overcall style - I prefer this one to the last one|pg||

pc|s6|nt|poohbear: Dbl asking for declarer's first bid suit ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems as if S interperted it as "lead your suit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: fortunate game|pg||
nt|poohbear: Problem is declarer will find out where all the HCPs are and cant misguess @cs . However might misguess @hs|pg||
nt|copeyj: @H coming in for 4 tricks and @Ck onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  with J@h falling, E has 9 or 10 tricks depending on how many @ss, S holds up|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think declarer will play @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: win the @s and start @ds|pg||
