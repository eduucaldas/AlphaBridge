pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Women are not always East and South in Denmark, so in order to get she/her straight I'll announce where they are when we get new pairs to the table after each round of 2 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the field contract i think - 3nt looks probable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to CK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: pairs in 3N will likely get the @dQ wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: all depends on the @D play|pg||
nt|psyck: this 4@h should score quite well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rico and Leise Hemberg a married couple from Odense (the birth place of Hans Christian Andersen)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||

nt|psyck: 3N should do well too if declarers there play safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS MIGHT GO A LOT DOWN|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: 20 tables in play, 39 rounds of 2 boards in an endless Howell movement|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|thorvald: its pairs, so im not sure if I would duck the club and try to safe it home in 3NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: yes, that is always the worry in pairs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: I would bid once more with north hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: typical pairs lunacy|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 74 is too much to not bid again, whatever the vul|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: But 4@H would likely go down and they can beat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not bidding will have its upsides here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and will |pg||

pc|hT|pc|d3|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: but as mentioned, still a gr8 score for EW as N went low in the bidding|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: North bidding like a senile senior a spectator claims|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sigsgaard is NOT a senior|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|thorvald: but senile ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hmm|pg||
mc|8|nt|psyck: well, not a junior either for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In his 30's, Thorvald?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i have far too many senior moments - and i dont qualify ...yet:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: my feeling is that a plus score for n/s will score very well|pg||
nt|thorvald: But he was right as futher bidding probably would have propelled EW in 5 @C - and yes he is mid 30's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Short break after each round of 2 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And since this is a Howell movement we will get two new pairs to the table after every round|pg||
nt|psyck: i think very few will get to 5@c|pg||
nt|thorvald: On the north hand I qould either decide to bid twice or bid a lot more than 1@S in the first round|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this a well supported event Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be average+ for NS, of course those NS allowed to play 4M will be topping|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's an annual festival|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|psyck: yes with a sac available at this vul for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed ck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For teams as well as pairs, and a golf/bridge event|pg||

nt|thorvald: At the first 2 boards, 4@h was avg + as 7 pairs managed to take 10 tricks or more in 3NT, and 3NT down one was average|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: from the standings, it looks like the members of 'one-eyed jack' club are doing well|pg||

nt|psyck: Hello Peter|pg||
nt|roswolf: although 11 t5ricks might be made in @H|pg||
nt|thorvald: NS can make 5 in either major playing the opening hand for @SQ|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, +200 is generally good, as pointed not easy for NS to get in & be allowed to play too there|pg||
nt|pelu: so +200 just the same as 3@H + 2 :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Yes, but 4@C is making, so avg+ for NS is my guess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridgemates|pg||
