nt|psyck: yes, it was on it's way to -4, not easy for operator to get all cards right when they play fast towards end|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jchiu: 2@D, as in closed is multi,k showing a six card preempt in one major|pg||

nt|psyck: maybe their multi includes strong variations also, or E may have bid more than 2@h|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|psyck: easy 3N, 5@c more difficult, but makable due to @c8 & @d break i guess|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|jchiu: the argument in favour is the ability to show the shape better, which tends to outweigh the risk of going float, especiallya t junior bridge|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jchiu: with this transfer, Lhuissier can reverse as he has always intended|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, the 3 suited hand is impossible to describe with a 2@c opening|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psyck: some play Kokish expensions to show 54 in minors, after which 3@h bid could show this hand after 2@c opening too|pg||
