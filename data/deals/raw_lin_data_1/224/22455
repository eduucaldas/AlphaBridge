nt|poohbear: If Gitelman hadnt been looking at the Jxxx of @ds he would have been forced into the @s shift|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chmitty: not so easy to play ... suppose you ruff a @d now, you can't play trump anymore from dummy next|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chmitty: declarer basically playing for @s 3-3 or @d 3-3|pg||
nt|chmitty: both failing here|pg||
nt|ritong: ruffing a @h just in case cannot hurt|pg||
nt|ritong: unless he gets overruffed|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see that by playing Ace @h @h ruff, and trumps, that would squeeze North, but I don't think Moss can play this way|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|chmitty: best defence leads to 2 down as declarer is facing transportation problems to cash both @d and @h|pg||

nt|poohbear: I believe they use udca|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ritong: right, but they might cash out, threatened by @ds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue playing confidently|pg||
nt|chmitty: if declarer unblocks @d at trick 2 (as suggested by audience) @h will be blocked|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss understandably deep in thought|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Other table very deliberate|pg||
nt|algraves:  these days 2 imps a board per team seems normal but this is very low scoring|pg||
nt|poohbear: interesting play |pg||
nt|poohbear: Intuitively I would exit Spade Jack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: @dJ came out in a flash :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this will endplay West if it is ducked|pg||
nt|algraves:  Kibitizers on flooding he airways with the exact number of imps per board|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think he will take and return  a @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No @s return knowing @sJ in Grue's hand :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss deep in thought|pg||
nt|algraves:  Moss is watering his diamonds hoping they will grow |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Every IMP counts! :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I don't think has any choice but to take... what to return may be the problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gitelmans spade pitch will cost a trick unless partner ducks the @d  . |pg||
nt|penseur9: that's is East as to...|pg||
nt|penseur9: let's see what he decides :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Could Gitelman have afforded the @s9 first discard?  Upside down|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: one of the advantages of playing a big club is the ability to bid hands like N naturally by opening 1@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: both sides discussing things. Bessis asking about where 1@c would start. I think D'M asking about how good Diamond might be - did he have a different auction available|pg||

nt|poohbear: 8 imps to Amoils on board 22 when Cheek opened 3NT down 3 . Other table 5D x down 3|pg||
mb|1D|nt|henryb:  Since they are behind the time schedule even with Joe-Boo at the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: TIme on clock OK +2 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: redouble, perhaps|pg||
nt|kareno: Unfortunately not a swing hand (unless someone bids slam without checking for aces)|pg||
nt|ritong: intending to raise @hs later on|pg||
nt|ritong: but a chunky 2@h or the equivalent would be fine too  hand is ugly|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ritong: stiff honors are not the best features, in general|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: redouble was fast, Brad thought long about how many @S to bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: your opinion about the 3NT bid Henri ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Henri(s) :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pragma|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue "he provides the running suit? :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 10 form Jack or shortness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss thinking deeply|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT certainly has the merit to diminish the chance they find a sacrifice|pg||
nt|chmitty: good point|pg||
nt|algraves:  so playing precision where 1@D is limited gives Grue a chance for very accurate description 5-6 13-15 pts|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ritong: on the other hand, if they do have a cheap sac, perhaps they will lead something else than @s and i won t make 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: but, all in all, if i bid the contract i have under my eyes, should be plus at the end of the year|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cheek refusing to lead what declarer expects|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  Cheek has to weigh 3 contracts, game in red suit or 4@D|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT not an option really|pg||
nt|algraves:  typically gamble the contract that has the best chance of a good swing|pg||
nt|penseur9: trump play will decide if it makes or not|pg||
nt|algraves:  This is very close|pg||
nt|algraves:  lets see how it goies|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss thinking carefully|pg||
nt|penseur9: very|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems like a stretch to bid 5D with no working cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|algraves:  for sure declarer has 5 trumps, 4 black tricks and a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Black Aces cover Grue's black holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: @d109 huge|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: still need to produce 9 other tricks |pg||
nt|algraves:  so the battle will be over trick 11 for declarer and / or trick 3 for defense|pg||
nt|penseur9: exactly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That game is named "bridge" :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: isn t that a cute dummy, freddy boy?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oops - swing to Diamond.  Double?  Not my style with the north hand.|pg||
nt|algraves:  This is the type of hand where you want to avoid the weak  4-4  . Two strong long suit fits . Make one of them trump. Use the other for tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|penseur9: this will hurt the Diamond team|pg||

nt|algraves:  6C down on a Heart lead |pg||
nt|penseur9: possibly will also be bid at other table... otherwise ????|pg||
nt|algraves:  Bridge is a gambling game first and foremost and presents many opportunities for chance to play a role. They could easily have this auction on a different set of hands with similiar values and end in a very good contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: distribution is nearly always the determining factor|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes and the location of the high cards for the fit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chmitty: on the other hand, lead a @h may be good if you hit the 5 cards in the suit in your partner's hand, even though he is weak, when the 5 cards in @d may not help|pg||

nt|ritong: because 2@h would be too pedestrian|pg||
nt|chmitty: I doubt that on a long term you get to a better contrcat than 1NT by bidding rather than pass, but the point is that it makes it much more difficult for the opponents to enter in ...|pg||

nt|penseur9: the 2 hour break might give time for the Diamond team to recoup...|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|c9|nt|kareno: He had to duck that diamond.|pg||
nt|ritong: fortunately for bertheau, this hand does not decide the match  but he is currently swearing at himself i m sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Does Fred have enough info to guess right if N leads @D now?|pg||
nt|corplaw:  not much of a guess; J in N vs Jx in S|pg||
nt|ritong: but north did not duck|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he likely has not @d AJ under his eyes|pg||
nt|kareno: True - if north ducks the diamond there is a trump endplay after ruffing out the club.  My bad :)|pg||
nt|corplaw:  declarer might have had QC instead of QD|pg||
nt|corplaw:  then duck would look very foolish|pg||
nt|corplaw:  but if N smoothly ducks diamond, W might play S for AD and lead another up instead of trying for endplay|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: If declarer doesn't have @DQ, he would play 3 rounds of @C first?|pg||
nt|kareno: Wheels within wheels|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred: Nothing makes any sense.|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
nt|corplaw:  if declarer had Ax, KJx, Kxxxx, AQx, can't play three rounds of clubs at that point as needs entry to play up diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit overstated, perhaps, but true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Both sides just agreed to ask me if this board matters for the match outcome, so I told them.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: ciao a tutti|pg||
nt|chmitty: ciao ciao|pg||
