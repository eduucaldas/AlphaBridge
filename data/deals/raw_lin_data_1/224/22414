pc|h5|nt|davpro: 5@h didn't make, but I guess the vulnerablitiy made Cullin bid one more time. To be sure|pg||

nt|algraves:  partnerships need a default response when having a weak hand. Some play retreat to suit as weak, others play show shape.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: is E really thinking?|pg||

nt|thenapster: 4cl its almost automatic |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: W is devoid of source of tricks after 3 Aces|pg||

nt|dburn: well, if you would open that hand and then bid 4@c - you'll be a man, my son :)|pg||
nt|thenapster: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: declarer might have to guess hearts (finesse 9) to scramble home here|pg||
nt|thenapster: for me west MUST bid 4sp|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|athene: no, he is ok anyway|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe West's 4@c was "serious", maybe not - but this slam is nowhere near as good as you think it is|pg||
nt|thenapster: so if you dont plan to bid over 4h try to bid other way|pg||

nt|athene: it is often better to take some risks to get into your 4-4 fit rather than defend 1nt|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|davpro: This is not a good 3NT. Well it is, but 3 kings behave aswell as the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: because a 4-4 fit can only take 4 tricks in defence to 1nt|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: much better if you are playing in it|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|hedyg: this might take a while|pg||
nt|algraves:  East had many ways to win by bidding 4@S of course. For those of you scoring at home as they say , Passing is a very narrow target, so you bid and hope for a number of good scenarios|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|algraves:  so 4@S the more effective bid on this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: only if N removes the X|pg||

nt|athene: but i guess he was put off by the 1@S bid (assuming that was natural)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Lots of boards left :)|pg||

nt|sundiszno: 6 can be made on a non-@d lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Entries?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, not trivial for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you just concede the @D10 to establish communications in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: concede the @DQ sorry|pg||

nt|athene: on a diamond lead, will bocchi take the queen and then finesse the ten? he needs all the dummy entries he can get|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|szalay: easy 9 tricks with @H hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|thenapster: i think he will for sure,does it enough?kx sp onside and jh as well,might work somehow|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lots of options in the play; for example if you had to bring in clubs with limited dummy entries, you might start by leading them from hand|pg||
nt|athene: that gains if east has @CKx or CQx, if you read the position|pg||
nt|athene: @CKx or @CQx|pg||

nt|athene: usually the best way to make use of these cards is persuade the defenders to open up suits|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: no auction given from the other room, so we will never know how they managed to get to 4@H and not be doubled|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: many would go for 3@S with the south cards, but madala thinks, if i am going to contract for nine tricks, why not make it game?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told west opened 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: north seems to have a fairly obvious double of that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was worried his partner would bid 4@S too often|pg||
nt|thenapster: i think so too...clear double for me|pg||
nt|thenapster: so what?great shape and controls|pg||
mb|3H|nt|MolvaM: 3@c is?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Don't know, puppet?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: is that lead systemic or devious?|pg||

nt|thenapster: last hand he lead 10@d from j10|pg||
nt|thenapster: so...|pg||
nt|athene: madala would really like to tackle clubs from his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He can't ever get to hand?|pg||
nt|athene: in case west has @CKx or Qx, which is not at all unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead would have been way better for him|pg||
nt|athene: he might then have been able to make three clubs, two hearts, three spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Falk isn't that nice :)|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps even if he didn't pick the spades he could score the @DJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Sorry, break over|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think (honestly) that Falk shoulkd have been happy if 4 @h was a downer - and pass. Some other layouts it makes, and 4@s is still 800. So the x created a problem for E - prd ...|pg||

nt|thenapster: next match start in few minutes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kvzacc: 2s and 3h are also made, not a good sign for dumbo|pg||
nt|koksoy: yes...  partner  has passed  hand..   sacrifice can not be  succesful  on  red vercus white..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs predict 800 if def leads trumps but with @hK onside I thk 500 is the limit|pg||
nt|koksoy: but  their teammates made 4@S  so  they  will  only loose  2 imps ý  guess|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: operator, when do we start the 3rd segment pls?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfg: 7PM|pg||
nt|thenapster: will he duck?|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause really east wondering what to do here?|pg||
nt|athene: i am thinking maybe west should have played the @D6 as a clearer count signal|pg||
nt|athene: is east thinking that declarer must have another diamond|pg||
nt|athene: because west would "surely" play the 6 from Q643?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: E doesn't know about the A of H is worried|pg||
nt|athene: and if so, maybe ducking the first diamond will make declarer's life a little harder|pg||
nt|athene: the motto is, if you are giving a count signal, make it as clear as you can|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: as a kib points out, the crucial card in this board is the spade queen - making a slam favorite to lose|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: you could just claim 2 off undoubled :) same score|pg||
mc|8|nt|jbgood: bye all and thanks for your nice inputs|pg||
