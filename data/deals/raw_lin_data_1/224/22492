nt|uni_cicam: hello everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, hello everyone|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|tomi2: first question, Milan you probably know more - isnt Michal Kopecky too old for juniors? you cant be juniors all of your life! :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I am here to help you understand the bidding of the Czech pair, both players are my regular partners|pg||
nt|tomi2: I remeber I played against Michal and you back in 2006 and unfortunatly I bacame older since that :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, he turned 26 this year. He is more a playing coach of the rest of the team |pg||
nt|anton72: hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome from a sunny Amsterdam :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Good starting hand :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be an easy slam to reach and an easy sacrefise in 7@c/@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: bulgaria white are currently 3rd, england U20 are 14th|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all welcome :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results and standings www.nbbportal.nl/1003 --> competitie|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi again Dennis...hi Bob|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 2@S opener (muiderberg) if available|pg||
nt|bebechira: Bulgaria White 3rd now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kingcur: Poland currently in 6th position, but they gave the strong Iraeli team a 22-8 beating in yesterday's last session|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: from today on the teams play another 12 rounds Swiss|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 boards per match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NL Red currently leading the Swiss with 105 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Israel is 4th with 98 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: after the Swiss the 4 top teams play semi-finals on thursday|pg||
nt|bebechira: England U20 are 14th|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i would never open 2@s with that N hand, 1@c my choice|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzzx: hello|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that does give you access to Open Room Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|stc: one big swing difference, the match is open|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the TD stopped punishing such behaviour after both teams agreed. so there are no more time penalties in the final|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Guten Abend allerseits|pg||
nt|400 volt: Beide Paare spielen einen schwachen SA in der Eröffnung|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi this time sesson it is not sensible to guess final contracts -so colorful they where last session |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: TD gave them 10 minutes extra and decided that both pairs were responsible for the last delay so assigned NO penalties|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!N here or 4@h? 4@h ofcourse best but 3!N with 5-3-3-2 over 4-3-3-3 is quite common|pg||
nt|kingcur: and here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sorry 1@s thougt 5@s only|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Das Ost-West-System ist relativ natürlich gehalten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: an agressive 3@c opener here again|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Dutch style :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: strangely enough south did not transfer over 1NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|400 volt: Good evening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: das n/s system hingegen bringt über 200 seiten auf die waage :)|pg||
nt|danmac: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult break in spades in this first hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if 4@h can be a form of weak bid pass from tofte might be dangerous and chooses to bid 5@h:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: W not bidding with his 4c @S support...|pg||
nt|bebechira: she will|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still tough for ns|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3@S nowadays the common way to show more trumps than points|pg||
nt|bobholl: would consider 4nt on west hand and after 5@C 5@DE|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: A@s hilft|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is round 9 of 17 of the Swiss|pg||
mb|5D|nt|400 volt: This is the semifinal of the German Open Team Trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky asks about 3@c, gotard makes some kind of "it's natural" shrugging motion |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, sorry for the confusion just now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS a polish pair, but they do NOT play Polish Club|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS playing weak NT 11-14|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: Piekarek's DBL = 3@S|pg||
nt|anton72: we will be happy if operator giving us some info about artifical bids|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all and welcome|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW plays a different 2 Nt module|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: interesting to see if he can make|pg||
mb|d|nt|400 volt: Ja, da sind einige ungewöhnliche Sachen drin|pg||
nt|stc: reicht aber nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: der kontrakt geht nur, wenn west im ersten karo stich mit dem as steigt|pg||
nt|stc: auch nicht, A@D und @H, hat immer noch ein @c zu verlieren|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads  2nd/4th|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: netherlands white is a team with some new Dutch junior players|pg||
nt|kingcur: test|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@s extra and cuebid? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Cor Balfoort|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kingcur: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Frank Budai|pg||
nt|kingcur: from a very sunny and spring-y Holland|pg||
nt|anton72: i am not fully familiar with systems ...just Roland invite me few minutes ago :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: I will if I know|pg||
nt|anton72: thank you ...sure :)|pg||
nt|anton72: N avoid the standart lead in clubs ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome back all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the last match for today. Tomorrow we play another 6 rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Yet, the results were as expected: All teams in the semifinals were expected to get to the semifinals|pg||
nt|400 volt: But there is a very clear favourite - the team "Jamm & Co"|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5@h should not be a good result for e-w .. although 7@c/@d is only -500 so might not be that bad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3NT the right contract here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: heading that way I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: west can bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: If East has singelton @h she will surely bid again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results www.nbbportal.nl/1003 --> competitie|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well judged bid from south|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  so 6 @c missed |pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: from the player's notes: 2NT = 9-12 or 16+, 3@s and 4@c cues|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@h will probably fail as East can hold up his @hA twice|pg||
nt|kingcur: but they got to the only game that does have a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: ew lead 3/5 throughout i believe|pg||
nt|kingcur: so all specs consider yourself lucky I'm not sitting in the sun :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have really enjoyed holland when i have visited - particullarly amsterdam|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi all :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  11 quick tricks:)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3NT should be an easy contract for Michal after @D lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS avoid the bad spade situation after east's overcall|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3NT obviously failing by the lack of a spade stopper and the minor suit game by three top tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well spotted Dennis|pg||
nt|bobholl: probably k@H lead and 1 up|pg||
pc|hK|nt|stc: auch @d geht|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Good evening  |pg||
nt|bebechira: i met Dennis in Veldhoven last year...he is an outstanding VG operator :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: east probably wondering where the @s are|pg||
pc|hA|nt|stc: oder @s :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: bidding is over vor some minutes but still no opening lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Welcome back, folks. |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results of the 1st round can be found at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|xenya: a cautious auction has led to a good stop |pg||
pc|h2|nt|dimi: this will be an easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lead of a king would have shown a good suit, queen denies|pg||
nt|kingcur: Tim Verbeek acting as substitute for Berend vd Bos' regular partner, Joris van Lankveld. The reason being that Joris has an examn to bring off first|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dkkello:  standard bidding here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|baldfriede: Declarer just has to develop a trick in @s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads  Slawinski   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the website of the bridgeclub 'het Witte Huis'|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dzieñ dobry - witam Patwa, w tym pokoju komentarz bêdzie w jêzyku polskim|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: other information about the tournament can be found at www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Para £osiewicz - Terszak debiutuje w reprezentacji, ale jej ostatnie wyniki wystawiaj¹ jej dobre wiadectwo|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS playing a lot of transfers after almost any intervention, so we will see playing the hands from different hands|pg||
nt|xenya: for i moment i thought they might overbid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: too high now it seems|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzyf: results of the tournament at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund and Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly on this lead|pg||
nt|dburn: although North may need to do well|pg||
nt|kingcur: but Dennis Stuurman, our vugraph operator, already showed the way to also beat 4@H: once dummy is out of trumps, declarer will be tapped|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|uni_cicam: than at other table|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: hello everyone|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Hi all, welcome back|pg||
pc|dA|nt|400 volt: I just got the note that in this room I should commentate in English - sorry for all kibitz who do not understand German :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baldfriede: And there it is.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup:  hi -a nice slam to start with -not laydown but good one and makes easily by ruffing 2 @h -si Smirnov will make this for sure|pg||
nt|stc: good morning|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Roland, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play standard signals|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|400 volt: I should commentate in German, sorry :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Users who prefer English will find their way to the open room, Felix|pg||
nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze haben sich bereits gewundert, dass Thomas Gotard jun. nicht mehr mit Bernard Ludewig spielt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a service to have German in one room, not a punishment|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: bernard ludewig konnte leider aus gesundheitlichen gründen heute nicht antreten|pg||
nt|400 volt: Danke Michael - damit wäre die Frage geklärt|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Still time for an overtrick.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: fails to let me down for once.|pg||
nt|dburn: scarcely a pause - impressive|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stc: a good slam with not many points. @s 2-2 and short @h on side making the play easy |pg||
nt|stc: but of course dec doesn't know all this and has to consider many layouts|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  otherwise 5 c M , 4+1@d and 2+1@c with trf|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sastro: Karo 8 hätte das Kommunikationsproblem gelöst|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Not so easy when you are on rama and have communications problems .. but will make i am sure |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzyf: so vLankveld actually showed 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: hello Peter, hello Tony|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wilkinsona: and 12 ricks now it seems..|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: dont exp signals in @s :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: and this will give E two trump tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sastro: 9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|uni_cicam: Nice squeeze prepared by MIchal|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|stc: sollte push sein|pg||
nt|stc: as you see he NEEDS now trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|stc: a lucky slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: smirnov places his cards in his hand for a crossruff and counts the tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|stc: I think that E should win the first @d with the A and give dec a losing option in @D|pg||
nt|bebechira: fantastic tournament ... can we have a wbsite with teams etc...|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW part of the Dutch team that performed so well in the latest world youth championships and a very talented pair|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so good defence by East|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sastro: Besten Dank an Roland Wald. Ich hatte drom gebeten , dass zumindest in einem Raum deutsche Kommentare möglich sind. Und er hat diesem Wunsch entsprochen|pg||
pc|h4|nt|400 volt: Das Team Jamm & Co spielt außer mit Rohowsky-Fritsche am anderen Tisch noch mit Rehder-Gromöller. Das dritte Paar, welches gerade aussetzt, ist Smirnov-Piekarek|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: nicht wenn w deckt|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzzx: NS discussing system|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south tryed to show @h and @c  and north didn't support -because minimum opening -so |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3@C was artifical and did not show clubs for north|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok that makes it more understandable|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: Hello Dennis|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ryskiel_: system polskiej pary jes bardzo naturalny, nie jest tro Wspólny Jêzyk, jak ju¿ wczeniej zauwa¿y³ operator|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: crossruff wins also with @s 3-1 but needs the J@S on side, also good|pg||
nt|stc: I think this is what he will play|pg||
nt|dkkello:  run for 9 now|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|stc: but before it have been worked, ending with say 2 @c in dummy and Q10@s in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov was thinking about playing east for one spade more and one @D less|pg||
nt|andreasw:  http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: the official tournament site is www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our other four matches today will be England-Poland, Israel-Czech Republic, Norway-Bugaria and Sweden-Finland|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we all open E hand  I vote yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think results will be on www.bridge.nl|pg||
nt|kingcur: as always well maintained by Rosaline Barendregt and a few others|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 11H |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played for the first hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: well played by Kopecky, may be too fast for some of us :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you must connect both rooms, operator|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 11 tricks  in an easy contract to start with|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@s n-s here?|pg||
nt|kingcur: a classic but well executed defense theme for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: being in the closed room we will not have results from the open very soon|pg||
nt|bobholl: when in doubt bid one more :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i understand the double of east|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north claims that he bid as if there had been no 1nt and after 1@C-2@D = hearts 2nt they have a system. south bid system off (=natural)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to endplay n on that line.|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 1@H|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening transfer preempts on 2nd level, too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: certainly a high standard of card play there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H = 8-11 with 6c. or 9-14 with 5@S+5m|pg||
nt|sommer: oh oh|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, it didn't matter - this wasn't a deal where declarer could pitch a spade on a club, then set up a long spade for a heart pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: worth 3@s|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diese mBoard könnten Nord/Süd schnell mal zu hoch geraten|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that was a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: then he would need to play a heart from dummy forcing east to ruff|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning all|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s -1 by EW ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier to concede a @d early. 2 3 4 1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky is not very happy with this bid :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: first option is 8-11 with 6 clubs? or 6 cards?|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|400 volt: 4@C bei Nord/Süd und 3@S bei Ost/West ist das Limit|pg||
nt|stc: was für NT spielen sie ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 12-14 beide|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir spielt sogar 11-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@s promises 5, but 1@h only promises 4 in e/w system (swiss acol)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW used to play a modification of NS Baltic club but they found out it was too complicated, so they switched to some easier system at the beginning of the year|pg||
nt|frankaus: i value it a 15 count|pg||
nt|kingcur: agree: if you open light, it's important to have a good suit, and this @H suit qualifies for that|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sorry, 6@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will be more happy now :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS is saved, is there an option to get to 3NT by EW side?|pg||
nt|anton72: Curiosly is that i comentating match between country where i am born ...BUL ...and country where I live ..NOR |pg||
nt|anton72: splinter probably is 3 di|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 6 rounds of 10 boards today|pg||
nt|kingcur: but we will do our best to keep you posted|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: yes probably -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ³adnie przepuci³ kiera Robertson, |pg||
nt|tomi2: ISR leading, CZE 2nd. the teams have been put in four grops of 6, playin a compleate round robin today and will go on in a swiss movement tomorrow and the day after|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just checking the website, i see these 2 teams are lying 4th and 1st|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will for sure|pg||
mb|1H|nt|400 volt: Yes, 3 NT can be made by N/S, but east/west will bid 4@S everytime|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat geschrieben "2@s gute hebung"... wundert mich etwas...|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D ist eigentlich relativ natürlich im System von Ost-West. Der einzige Grund für das Alertieren kann sein, dass West auch mit 5er @C und 4er @D 1@D häufig eröffnet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hab ich mir schon fast gedacht, dass er hier mit kontra in die reizung einsteigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: thats the problem with playing artifical methods - you need detailed agreements or some really good working meta-agreements in competition|pg||
nt|stc: I even think that with more free places in E the crossruff line was a bit better|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Good fireworks here|pg||
nt|stc: anyway good start for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Alex said in the end that he should have played the cross ruff. but that needed to start in trick 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: summary of Slawinsky leads in Supplementary Notes of Fantoni-Nunes Convention Card  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBra...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|stc: cards are friendly for NS, EW can't go plus|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now i doubt it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, a somewhat conservative move by E|pg||
nt|dburn: but here is another tough problem for North-South - getting to 6@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is a slammy sort of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt opening would be 11-13, so this rebid shows 14+|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players produced so many big swings that they all speed up playing for overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or book that introduced the method   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south passed and explained to west "I have a clear pass on 2@S but I was thinking because I was not sure if thats natural"|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play a strong @c system|pg||
mb|1S|nt|400 volt: Ja, 3SA können von Nord/Süd erfüllt werden, aber Ost/West gehen immer auf 4er-Stufe|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube nicht, dass 3SA von Ost irgendwelche Probleme bereitet. Sogar 5@D geht. Mal schauen, ob Ost/West sie erreichen|pg||
nt|sastro: mit 6-4 bevorzuge ich zuerst die Wiederholung der 6er-Länge|pg||
nt|stc: keine gute Idee von N|pg||
nt|stc: aber 2@h ist nicht soo schlecht|pg||
nt|dimi: @s K @h Q and 2 @c tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hard to guess the singleton king.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW are very slow players and are in danger of beeing to late every segment|pg||
nt|stc: NS must just cash their tricks before the 5th @d is played|pg||
nt|stc: in other words S must play @c when in hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: novay min 4 me |pg||
nt|frankaus: no way |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results are at www.nbbportal.nl/1003, then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|kingcur: but with two aces and a decent 2nd suit, this is not even a light opening|pg||
nt|dburn: that might give them a chance, if it's a pure takeout double|pg||
nt|dburn: but I think this is too difficult|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well its a good bid, but not sure north will try clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: hi Markku|pg||
nt|kingcur: and for the record: we have no running scores of the other matches available. Past round results on www.wintyurl.com/whj2012 however|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we play 6 rounds of 10 boards today|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: tomorrow we have the semi-finals |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Hi Markku|pg||
nt|runnerup:  misfit ,but 8 available by finessing @d even with @s switches|pg||
mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but nothing will bother it|pg||
nt|anton72: E hasnt he control ..so...we just in Game|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2 teams here are No 1 (Netherland) and No 3 after 5 rounds  (in 4 groups) now 12 x swiss|pg||
nt|andreasw:  anyone for keeping open with a dbl or a 2@h bid on norths hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: but a pergectly reasonable one|pg||
nt|dburn: he probably has to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well he does bid 4 hearts..|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, not enough pitches on diamonds anyway - still need the spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Auch 5@C kann man schnell mal im Gegenspiel schenken, von daher ist 5@S sicherlich ein akzeptables Gebot|pg||
nt|400 volt: jetzt hat sich Udo Kasimir etwas zu hoch gewagt - die Hand steht aber auch schlecht für ihn|pg||
nt|400 volt: Der Gegner hat @S KB8x UND der @C-Schnitt sitzt nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben got a 10 imp penalty for slow play|pg||
nt|stc: better now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer may simply pull trumps from the top|pg||
nt|stc: not very likely but possible of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ducking that was risky, vuln south could hold 8 hearts and noting outside|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S now game try $ me|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems it is, now how to make it :)|pg||
nt|xenya: perfectly*|pg||
nt|xenya: very delicate contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some players will overcvall 1NT with E|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can set up a long @h also if they keep playing @ss|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|tomi2: can insert the king and unblock an honor in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: club lead might break the communication. Declarer has to play his suits from his hand which is not good for him in this board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be difficult to defeat...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to get entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry, i mean in 2nd club trick  finesse the 9|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: defence has to put Declarer once on the table with A of @H and another possible entry is @C8, but not easy to find it.|pg||
nt|tomi2: and later overtake the honor, in case michal forgot to insert the 9. south would do well to switch to a small dia when he wins a spade trick, that would denatly cut the ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: communication|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, declarer can play his @S from his hand, establishing 2@S tricks, 4@C, 1@H and 2 @D which makes a total of 9 = just made|pg||
nt|tomi2: cant NS open the hearts in time then, to score 2@S and 3@H?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: timing is important now|pg||
nt|tomi2: they seem to block because they need to finesse dummy's 10|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Another easy 3 nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 Then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: other tournament info at www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|pelu: ok Israke and Bulgaria both 3/4|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2NT does not promise 4@h here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: N can have any invitational hand|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case, might as well be in six diamonds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and ofcause you have a growing @h also ,but |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north might have tried NT but settles for 2 spades|pg||
nt|kingcur: and by the time the semis and finals are being played, we ordered some less sunny weather to make watching them even more attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Nord hat nur 6 Figurenpunkte, aber mit einem sicheren 9-Karten-Fit und einer guten Verteilung ist das 3@S nicht völlig unverständlich|pg||
nt|runnerup:  time for 800?|pg||
nt|stc: 5 obvious losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what 1@S asked/showed   but it allowed North any easy bid  [versus something like immediate 3@C]|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: DBL seems ok to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with 5@d-2@h you dbl immediately over 1@s, so now dbl is this shape|pg||
nt|kingcur: I agree with N's bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|400 volt: hier kostet es 500 - aber gegen mögliche 400 beim Gegner kein allzu großer Verlust|pg||
nt|runnerup:  is south worth 3 @s -with 8 points and 7xxx in @s maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  other room stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: a decent save|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the club finesse is best therefore it seems..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, seems so, and thats a bit unlucky as there seems no endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Good morning all|pg||
nt|stc: wieso hat W @d entdeckt ?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns never mensioned -the suit they make a slam (lucly ofcause ) @s|pg||
nt|stc: clap-clap|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even though east is a substitute it seems they have control over their system:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure how many of his regular agreements vd Bos has agreed with Tim Verbeek but this looks like a relay sequence he used with v Lankveld as well: they play a fairly natural ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: system, but with loads of gadgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: gf relay quite standard among dutch juniors|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H the limit of the hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: the 4-4 fit often plays better, but here we see @s's split 4-1|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S had 17+7 but hard to get in to the bidding ..|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and they cant make any contract either|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: well no reason to play here for NS as even 3@c won't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke mal 2@s zeigt schon 5-4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise to me though that north didn't drive to game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: schlechte stimmung bei den senioren, kratz/sträter sind mit der spielgeschwindigkeit ihrer gegner nicht glücklich|pg||
nt|400 volt: Gegen wen spielen die beiden denn?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich glaub der eine ist yves mucha|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe some side effect, that explains the imo poor level of bridge here besides the tight schedule was last night... it was Alexander Smirnovs 30th birthday and most of the players ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: were at the bar (too?) long|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he had bought champagne for all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1@h was positive with @h, 2@s about 8-10|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@S would probably have failed so good result|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andreasw:  4@s could have problems although it should make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well getting lost now|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all :)|pg||
nt|dburn: wasn't thinking of five spades, but it may be the last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: 3@C probably does that too :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S seems playable|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C K protected|pg||
nt|kingcur: and W declaring 4@S seems like the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d lead looks best to me? altough North might get creative and lead a small @c here|pg||
nt|tomi2: N could insert the 9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stc: sry, Ich dachte an einer 1NT Opening !|pg||
nt|tomi2: to prevent this|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello Bob|pg||
nt|dkkello:  true :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|runnerup:  level -to be honist must admid has been a dissopointment but colorful boards and happenings|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Jokisch proved theirs ablities on the piano|pg||
nt|anton72: still could be one down|pg||
nt|anton72: for me looks cool -1 ..let see|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west's second trump lead in two boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: cross in @H and finesse or play a@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: now -2|pg||
nt|xenya: probably down 1 -- unless declarer is clairvoyant enough to drop 1DK |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess this will just make :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess it will - if this South is looking for a shorter name that will fit on the BBO name plate, he could try Houdini|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stc: klar, er hjat 1@d eröffnet|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes i agree:)  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|stc: @s, @s ruff, @H and @c für -1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|anton72: trumps break is bad for declarer|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tomi2: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ this is a link to the results of the first two rounds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kingcur: @HJ not hurting declarer|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So Vesa Fagerlund has played a longtime for the finnish jun team|pg||
pc|sA|nt|luffe12:  @s9 probably odd/even|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no|pg||
nt|stc: and -1|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Tony|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Updated scores at http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/  --> Competitie|pg||
nt|pelu: yes  1NT = 15-18 and N has 9 + a 5 card suit + help in @d|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: nice game missed here?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: also south sitting over the stuff|pg||
nt|xenya: i hope i'm not resulting, but i'd try 3N as N|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzzx: high = odd count|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps -it will beb down -entryes are too bad -sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: club lead = low from doubleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thats what i meant|pg||
nt|stc: do you think they make 6@s ? big communication problems, don't think they make|pg||
nt|luffe12:  sry for any confussion|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kingcur: and will now look to set up his side suit first|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@s was a mild slam try even|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  lead 2nd/4th   so  weak doubleton leads LOW|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|golfsquash: Just 8 tricks, but north coming under some pressure on the run of the hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does north do after  1@C-1@H-3@C-???|pg||
pc|s5|nt|golfsquash: making now if he reads it right|pg||
nt|sastro: pik 8 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@d would have been sign-off|pg||
nt|frankaus: now will be breathing hard - but lon @H & @S with S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|stc: and trump promotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he bids so that NS go minus|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sastro: 9|pg||
nt|sastro: kann einen Stich kosten|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube sie kann es nicht nur, sondern tut es auch hier|pg||
nt|bobholl: hope and pray|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzzx: south claiming for west|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: yes the young Aberdeen player had some tough bids, and suspect he took 4 hearts as playing in spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|golfsquash: and he will|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: QJ8xx is an asset and the fact that E has opened might make it easier to play|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry my analysis was lousy :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frankaus: long|pg||
mc|12|nt|kingcur: can ruff the 3rd club in dummy now, play one more round of trumps and then continue hearts, with @DA as entry|pg||
nt|kingcur: West was not thrown in, since a heart return would never give S two tricks|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: o/w diskutieren noch ob 3@c forcing war|pg||
nt|santyclz: Very reasonably played n for @sK10xx.|pg||
nt|stc: not big deal, 2@s was making|pg||
nt|stc: this looks exagerated ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: movie shows 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hmm have to type the aucion one more, it was too nice|pg||
nt|kingcur: and NS believe he will do just that|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we treat S hand as a weak 2@D?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  slam can make here finding the @s J|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@d for me nv-v|pg||
nt|kingcur: in a junior event, even 3@D is a possibility :)|pg||
nt|anton72: mixed hand ...1 Cl or 1 NT|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 Cl for me ...too many controls ...|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West's turn for a tough hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results: www.nbbportal.nl/1003 --> competitie|pg||

nt|kingcur: as we see|pg||
nt|frankaus: can get ugly 6322 not a gr8 shape|pg||
nt|kingcur: and it's not even extremely junior-ish to open 3@D nowadays|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i believe preempting high is best at these colors|pg||
nt|dburn: slam on not a lot of high-card points and only a nine-card fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh -- i should have refreshed screens :(|pg||
nt|kingcur: pressure bidding being the way to go nowadays|pg||
nt|anton72: surely you will miss 1 point ...but ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like a set of test hands so far..|pg||

nt|dkkello:  http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  this board is a fine example on how great 10+ trumphs works |pg||
nt|stc: 6@c is a very decent contract|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@C leaping Michaels presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: non-leaping actually :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east values looks great.. i dont they they will stand at 5'th lvl|pg||
nt|kingcur: and N adding his part in the preemption...E might want to double for penalties now, but not sure if that isn't agreed as forward going|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: interesting to see what Verbeek comes up with now|pg||
nt|frankaus: just @C i ecpect planing to introduce @S later to show 6/5|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: pass and pull? |pg||
nt|kingcur: has E got enough for a pass and pull you think?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe east is afraid of W passing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: very risky indeed in a one-day partnership|pg||
nt|kingcur: for specs: this is an agreement to show a better hand than you would be showing by bidding directly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening 2@C as weak with majors, but this hand is too weak for vulnerable|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: another 3NT contract|pg||
nt|xenya: and declarer was almost certain the finesse would work  |pg||
nt|dburn: and an opening bid by an opponent to make life harder yet|pg||

nt|stc: needs to guess @h, not impossible after the bidding|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: narazie dwa szczêliwe rozdania dla Brytyjczyków|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: someone told me that 7222 distribution is very close to 6322 which is very close to 5332 which is almost 4333. With that hand, you will bid 3NT immediately, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2nt is positive with fit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 1 Nt could prob be a weak raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We need to shut down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tes, difficult for west not to bid on|pg||
nt|pelu: I forgot - juniors :) - S only have to a contructive raise to 2@s - But "The law" again cost|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tables are not linked|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 diamonds alerted, but looks natural|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C goes already for 800 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: she alerted, so I did too|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 3@H nid in W (3@H and 54 in minors)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: first pass, let your pd double and then bid: hence the name|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably would have gone down in 6, losing the @sJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: i even alert my 1nt opening as "may include 7 card suits"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East shows clubs, but there is a nasty duplication in hearts|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome to Frank Budai :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 6@D   be honest now -- how many people thought about THAT bid??|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W has bad values for slam even he has a maximum hand in HCP so he shouldnt go for a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dennis will insert scores manually for boards already played when he gets a minute|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: kleine swings für Jokisch|pg||
nt|stc: kann spanend sein|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: interesting auction|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s guess needed -restricted choice if you happened to start from rigth hand |pg||
nt|stc: now 170 EW :)|pg||
nt|stc: of course splits are very bad and even 5 @c is not so easy, 3NT lokks OK|pg||
nt|stc: 9 easy tricks, some endplay with N for ten ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe NS need to lead spades, though|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: as I have written before, inviting slam with 7222 needs a lot of HCP and especially a lot of controls.|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W should bid 4NT now to be able to stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
nt|kingcur: not an easy bid for S, since 2NT may be too high opposite a 3rd hand opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i would just bid 1@s|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not after a 2@H bid off course :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|luffe12:  the law!!|pg||
nt|dimi: but if you only see the EW hands 6@c would be the best contract|pg||
nt|stc: sure, W must be disapointed now but happy later|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can make 5nt double-dummy with the @hKJ- but that's not a likely result at the table.|pg||
nt|stc: DD you can paerhaps even make 6@c guessing @Hs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but west will likely bid 4 hearts|pg||
nt|sommer: quite easy to get overboard on this one|pg||
nt|runnerup:  task again to avoid 3nt --5 @D is great --4 @S lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: what do you do with @s loser in 5@d?|pg||
nt|kingcur: me too|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi frank isn't it late in australia ?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|golfsquash: lead directing, implying a heart fit on passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ew play weak nt so 1nt shows extras|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: ns normally play 2/4 leads but in this particular situation (partner's suit vs nt) they play 1/3|pg||
nt|stc: but whatfor ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: instill doubt in East  in case grand slam is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west is still thinking|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this one was played a few boards back:)|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, N has a nice hand, with those chunky majors |pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 NT looks normal  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, NS seem to have judged the contract well again|pg||
nt|kingcur: but the saying in Poland is that you always get a @S lead against NT contracts, which would have turned out nicely here|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: when the tray is on my side i try to avoid clicking immediatly after a bid has been done because it's possile that they hear my mouse on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|xenya: but it seems she chose wrong time to bid on|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gronkvist:  1M-2M = 7-10 hcp for NS|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kingcur: yes, slam is not plain sailing for EW, and 5@Dx should bring in more than 650...let's see|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well judged...|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: found about missing @S cue. But wrong contract and 2 imps on 8 board match might be crutial|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3NT would be better. on a @D lead they need the finesse now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup:  3nt makeable by guessing @d |pg||
nt|runnerup:  so it means that you you play like this -now @s finess is odds on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missing some hesitations Tomi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: @s10 2nd, 4th|pg||
nt|sommer: y|pg||
nt|andreasw:  vugraph cordinator just giving everyone  a chance to see all the boards:)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes need wyew to make 5 @d --j @s run -so maybe 3nt but this time lead will be @c -so down it goes|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10.22 pm here :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Switching to English now|pg||
nt|stc: welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking about the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet    Khanukov WOULD have played @H suit correctly after the 4@S opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov shaking his head after seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|tomi2: think they play 10 boards. does not change too much anyway, 1 imp can easy be 1vp, yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h and 5 @c down because bad sits -with good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south unsure about the meaning of norths bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: not sure whether this contract is doubled...|pg||
nt|pelu: the highest making contract is 3@D - and now fight on the 5-level :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so, peter the 4 spade bid is a winner|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like to compete over 1NT but saw an awful result earlier -------- pays ur money  - takes ur chance|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzyf: no @c lead!!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|golfsquash: N/S playing x-y NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 2@c demands 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: mit @hA vor dem k ist hier alles relativ egal, aber jokisch versucht natürlich eine linie zu finden die auch gegen möglichst widrige verteilungen noch erfïult|pg||
nt|runnerup:  on a good day even 6 @c makes ..not this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky seems totaly unsure what is going on but from west questiones he can imagine clubs splitting not so well. unfortunatly for he would be dummy. screens in use, so north and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south do not know who was thinking when|pg||
nt|bobholl: he sees only 9 sure tricks :) |pg||
nt|kingcur: S can bring in 4 spade tricks by way of an intra-finesse, scooping West's @ST|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room bidding brd 21 and the poles managed to play 3h EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: so NS played 4h and EW playing 3h in the open room|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably intended as an entry for the @c finesse, the @hJ dropping changes the line.  He did that just to spite my prediction...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer will give a @c and then has an entry to the @h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dimi: Joe, declarer might heard your plan for 11 tricks :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl claimed on any return and no single king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to leaders on 33   shouldn't be long wait till we know whether 6@S was good or bad bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: 20:22 but i had 5:00 start 4 a bush walk this morning|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wilkinsona: difficult to stop in 3N, should be happy with this I think..|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Czechs reached the slam on the other table, will be expensive|pg||
nt|pelu: only if u play Pokere and weak or very agressiv opponents|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wilkinsona: also not sure re the reference to "juniors" who underbid the last hand|pg||
nt|xenya: rather aggressive of course -- and they layout far from friendly|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im not sure it will.. but taking the safe road is problebly best|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 10 tricks here w a nice @h |pg||
nt|kingcur: and with heart length indicated by west's lead, he might just play East for 4@S's|pg||
nt|bebechira: strange but true and a swing in the very first board for the swedes|pg||
nt|kingcur: I just earned my first coke it seems :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzzx: td called|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps south is out of what is happening |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking what to do when he gets no expainations from south|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south trying his best to explain|pg||
nt|runnerup:  really --book says 4. wrong longest ans strongest --ok --makes now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome to felix zimmermann|pg||
nt|400 volt: Hi all|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: perhaps N would have done better to overtake and play @HQ -- |pg||
nt|pelu: N will have time for that later|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: on board 21 Israel did not preempt at all, so Helmich-Hop played a quiet 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well netherland Red of to a great start|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with a very likely gain on the next board too|pg||
nt|xenya: note E's duck -- it couldn't lose|pg||
nt|xenya: worth remembering|pg||
nt|bebechira: realy?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pelu: and on B22: 3NT +1 = 7IMP|pg||
nt|xenya: as he knows the spade position|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c3|nt|frankaus: so the 6322 shape goes $ 1100|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt ist ost auf jeden fall engespielt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: both discard a heart|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I will bid 3NT directly against 15-17 NT, probably getting too old :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I may be wrong, but think quite a few teams will be in slam...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|golfsquash: and if north bids on over 2@d he has a game invitation hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:) 1100 seems right|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|nt|runnerup:  missunderstandings continues -now you see other table in 6 @s with 4-1 |pg||
nt|runnerup:  board 17|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzyf: decision time now...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  In Poland this summer, they said: Always lead a @H     (not this time though)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c6|nt|glen: good morning|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 10|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gute alleinspieltechnik|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like a few more imps for Jokisch|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: don't see why it caused him so much pain to part with @d7|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can' t quite manage here if N now returns @D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|frankaus: sydney is an amazing place u can go bush walking 10 min from CBD|pg||
pc|h9|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat @h2 vorgezogen, denkt aber nochmal nach|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h8|nt|kingcur: and there was a @C9 to scoop here as well|pg||
pc|c9|nt|glen: guten Morgen also|pg||
nt|kingcur: 1100 a decent win versus a game result, and an acceptable loss should open room bring in the slam|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andreasw:  might go one more now playing to win|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: now S's @C2 gets promoted :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: but will be happy to end up with 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sastro: jetzt kommt ein Endspiel|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 12 Imps for Ireland on bd 2. Scotland played 5@c-5 on 4/3 fit where Ireland made 3NT on strip squeeze.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: nice|pg||
pc|hK|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
