nt|mohitz:  the key word is randomly|pg||

mb|3C|nt|jain: will they reach the cold 4h|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|allysophia: I'm not entirely sure its fair to call them the juniors.. when you look at  Fiona Brown who must be all of 26 on team Hanlon|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: you do know Ally that these comments are recorded ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lool..stop it Bill|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but prajwal is unlikely to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What you really meant was:  "Michael Ware has wonderfully youthful looks"|pg||

pc|s2|nt|vugraphzaw: SHEKHAR BANERJEE,S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jain: hmm|pg||
nt|mohitz:  NK had a tough initial bid, ideally he would like to get both minors in, but Kx in spades meant he could not X|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mohitz:  diamonds would have played better|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|allysophia: that goes without saying (Ware's youthful good looks)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: I think North has 1430'd in clubs and now asked for @CQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think maybe they have set the wrong suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and perhaps Smirnov wouold have been better off bidding 3@D over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this will be a VERY important board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but of course I am just guessing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|subhranp:  will have to finnesse clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Alex alerted the 5h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so it must mean something for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The good thing is that diamonds is the "boss" suit, at least of the minors.  Smirnov knows about the 8-card fit there|pg||
nt|mohitz:  can make this now if diamonds can be guessed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is clear now...missunderstanding in bidding|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: Great work Geo!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and a spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was clearly the indicated lead ... but that's easy to type.  It's not easy to do in the heat of battle|pg||

mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: I don't think Smirnov-Griffiths have had a lot of experience playing together.  It looks like they succumbed to a Standard American confusion|pg||

nt|subhranp:  3nt for NS, should reach there comfortably|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mohitz:  that explains the pass|pg||

nt|mohitz:  odd choice of balancing by prajwal|pg||
nt|rishabh:  hard for Prajwal too|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: may be 5nt was better for choice of a game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mohitz:  if balancing, X was definitely better|pg||
nt|rishabh:  NS missed a good 4@h game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I'm getting some complaints from standard Americans|pg||
nt|mohitz:  especially considering that NK's overcalls are very strong|pg||
nt|mohitz:  how will you make 4@H?|pg||
nt|rishabh:  yeah not on this lie|pg||
nt|vicky888: NK knows they are in a inferior contract, but he isnt sure which is the correct suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: sorry guys|pg||
nt|subhranp:  just to repeat for those who have logged in late: Indian Mavericks, Formidables, Shekhar Banerjee, Hemant Jalan, Grub Club, Maya Mera Sneha, DSM, Ladies team are the qualifiers|pg||
mb|p|nt|rishabh:  this is getting higher|pg||

nt|mohitz:  instead of one of those 4 card raises|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: E/W have 25 points but it's hard to find a sensible game contract for them|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Maybe 4@H|pg||
nt|subhranp:  good hand for defence|pg||
nt|subhranp:  EW going overboard here|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i tried so hard to convince him to dump them|pg||
nt|mohitz:  never agreed with me :)|pg||
nt|rishabh:  2@h bid has a problem, that it lets opponent bid 3@h in this caes|pg||
nt|vicky888: 4 carder bergen raises promise a offensive shape, he had no such shape|pg||
nt|mohitz:  alright |pg||
nt|mohitz:  so now, it is upto NK to fetch this.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mohitz:  on the lie, it looks like itwont|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh now it will|pg||
nt|vicky888: spade lead would have put arvind at ease|pg||
nt|subhranp:  light 1s opening by South, could get into trouble here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|serhat: now they can bid their 4-3 fit 4@H game|pg||
nt|subhranp:  South needs to switch to heart and find the spade switch frm partner|pg||
nt|subhranp:  but NS have to defend well here, they need to find the heart ruff immdeately|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mohitz:  now, NK can ruff two clubs |pg||
nt|rishabh:  it should now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is makeable, but it won't (I predict)|pg||
nt|serhat: well tough one now. Geo could have bid 3D I believe|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer has to take an a-priori inferior play in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lol...thats nice bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Running the diamond jack works beautifully to neutralize 10x in South|pg||
nt|steshome: Hinden stretching for a non-vul game here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|georgia19: bit thin for 3NT, but they have 24HCP between them, do you fancy Graham to get this on the card?|pg||
nt|steshome: I think Sime will duck the first heart and in time collect 2@H tricks and 3@D tricks - i don't think Hinden should move. No fitting cards in partner's suit|pg||
nt|steshome: Georgia, have England won with a match to go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: yes well done|pg||
nt|steshome: Perhaps E/W have a glass of wine each at the table?|pg||
nt|georgia19: yes indeed, 30 clear of 2nd|pg||
nt|steshome: Excellent - well done England!|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: Not celebrating yet!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: But playing ace and king picks up Qx in North AND South, so is theoretically twice as good|pg||
nt|rishabh:  @s J looked normal lead here|pg||
nt|rishabh:  after partner's double|pg||
pc|cK|nt|georgia19: they'll want to beat Scotland if they can|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if manoj had preserved his 98x of trumps, he would have been able to ruff with 8 and 9 and score a trump trick, apart from a diamond, a spade and a club|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|steshome: Nice unblocking spade play by Osborne with the 10 to finesse the 9 later|pg||
nt|steshome: He'' be playing for Q9x clubs on side for 4 club tricks|pg||
nt|steshome: Questionable high low in spades by North to give the count - Will Osborne believe him?|pg||
nt|georgia19: as he'll be disappointed, the 9th trick seems elusive|pg||
nt|steshome: or is the high low spade a smith peter saying he likes the heart lead?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|subhranp:  declarer should get 5 tricks and the spot cards in spades might see him through with the 6th trick|pg||

mb|1N|nt|rishabh:  may be they have decided for only very good overcalls|pg||

nt|mohitz:  here, for example Arvind might well have passed|pg||
nt|rishabh:  1@s isn't very strong suit :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|serhat: not a very good one. but Ware team needs it.|pg||
nt|vicky888: it has its chances...|pg||

nt|subhranp:  NS might reach 4h here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: Played by South, 6@C is a make|pg||
nt|serhat: so they might bid it the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer will be able to discard his two diamond losers on a spade and a heart, and the defence cannot attack the diamonds|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaw: YES|pg||

mb|p|nt|serhat: N is excited after 2D|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Arvind thinking about @h 4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|subhranp:  East choosing to open 1s and partner putting him in the game. |pg||
nt|subhranp:  defence off to a safe start here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugrapha3: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: So now gap again increased|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzaw: He picked up 1@s in plACE OF 1@H|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, although the excitement might be tempered by the result last time South "reversed"|pg||
nt|subhranp:  west needs to find the spade switch now or later|pg||

nt|mohitz:  meanwhile, MMS has picked up one more imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: They are listening to u :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|serhat: Nye is sorry for 2d bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He spent the rest of the auction backtracking.  Surely he owed partner a 4@H bid over 4@C|pg||
nt|serhat: because he didnt have real 2d bid. may be 3c better there|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so the match is getting closer|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|subhranp:  this time a slam for EW|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, and not easy for E/W, after the multi|pg||
nt|serhat: W has very good hand though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So does East, but it's still difficult.  For example, any suggestions on what East should do here?|pg||
nt|serhat: 3D= if forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: they will at most be in game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: 3@D doesn't look forcing to me|pg||
nt|serhat: well may be 2nt =not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of the problems with this auction is that E/W don't know South's suit.  Hence they have no easy cue-bids|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: I got stuck with exactly this problem in the NEC recently.  I had to guess ... wrongly as usual|pg||
nt|subhranp:  scores level in this segment so far 5-5 so maya meera continue to lead by 24 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: E bid 1@s before N, N called director and then comes up with dbl. 1@s stands for E |pg||
mb|p|nt|rishabh:  2@s looks like an underbid|pg||
nt|vicky888: suppressing the clubs wasnt the best bid in such a distributional hand|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not really|pg||
nt|rishabh:  5 loser hand, i will bid at least 3|pg||
nt|subhranp:  somik, it always helps to listen to the commentator who can see all the 52 cards.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: was forcing Bill!:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here Sveindal has guessed rightly|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: wow|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it's remotely forcing.  But it's certainly constructive, and certainly at least a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: flat board|pg||
nt|georgia19: NS playing strong NT so EW find spade fit.....cards badly placed for them|pg||
nt|steshome: E/W play 2@S bid by Hinden as showing the weakest hnad for an o/call in preference to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp:  North and East are screen mates?|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: lets say contstructive plus!|pg||
nt|georgia19: EW heading for a minus, but lead has helped.....|pg||
nt|steshome: odd lead it seems|pg||

nt|subhranp:  first 2 boards have been flat|pg||
nt|subhranp:  yes North should trust his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|rishabh:  yeah no entries to dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  meanwhile, rv-arvind are in 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  so, no swing there|pg||
mb|2D|an|weak|nt|georgia19: bizarre|pg||
nt|steshome: although 3NT needs inspiration to make|pg||

nt|subhranp:  after a quiet board, another slam board comng up|pg||
nt|subhranp:  maya meera have closed the gap with 5imps on B3|pg||
mb|2S|nt|georgia19: hate aceless 1NT overcalls, even with 17,,,|pg||
nt|steshome: that's why i don't like this 4@S bid with no aces|pg||
nt|steshome: and the lack of 3 trumps!|pg||
nt|mohitz:  surprising really|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Very sad result for E/W who were having a very nice set up till then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sveindal might be saying: "I didn't expect you to be that strong, hence my pass".  So technically, the blame goes to the partnership|pg||
nt|rishabh:  strange to see that in the final|pg||
nt|vicky888: on board 7?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|serhat: ahh W.. no I dont agree with you.. I blame E . 2d can be anything. he has no @D fitno good clubs or H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh well, that's what makes horseracing.  The 2@D bid is a matter of partnership style, I guess|pg||
nt|serhat: at least he could have rdbled|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry...i saw first 1 heart lol|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: then i looked better |pg||
nt|subhranp:  many play 2c by West hand as majors|pg||
nt|rishabh:  probably teams are trying to play too safe|pg||
nt|mohitz:  ya|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|georgia19: but was the E hand really worth a jump, may be 5-5 but only a 7 count in HCP|pg||
nt|subhranp:  3nt plays better frm East hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: this is not much better.....|pg||
nt|georgia19: what now E?|pg||
nt|steshome: All a bit murky but I suppose East must push when vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: Contract is 3NT to W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|subhranp:  EW have 25hcp but all the spot cards are with NS|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vicky888: possibility is they are all fatigued and avoiding the adventures of cards|pg||
nt|rishabh:  2@s rebid on board 7 is quite an underbid imho|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i wouldn't call it an underbid |pg||
nt|rishabh:  probably it got passed around|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|serhat: might dbl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: might bid 5@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|steshome: after heart to the ace and one back, Hinden needs to overtake the K@C and play a spade to the 9 to make. |pg||
nt|mohitz:  back to this board|pg||
nt|rishabh:  some like to open 1@d with this hand|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not the best lead|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for defense|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mohitz:  although, declarer can establish a heart, he doesnt have the entries to dispose club loser|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugrapha3: you wanted action...we have action|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder if he could have diagnosed his partner's spade singleton?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If South's double showed 3 spades, and North's 2@H shows 5-4 shape in the majors, then bob's your uncle|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So he could double 4@H, play @SA, @S4, @HA, spade, down up front|pg||
nt|subhranp:  declarer has 14 tricks unless north can find diamond lead|pg||
nt|mohitz:  two rounds of diamonds and ruff a dia with ten @S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  defense will get a heart and three spades i reckon|pg||
nt|rishabh:  that's what S is going for|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: @CA in the middle|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Milne team is very close to win now|pg||
nt|georgia19: just an everyday play for her.......:)|pg||
nt|steshome: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  GIB might make this hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|subhranp:  arvind must be thinking, if only he had atleast one out of the four Tens|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugrapha3: only 5 imps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That would have been 500 for 9 imps|pg||
nt|rishabh:  @d J changed the plans, in cases @ds are 5-1|pg||
nt|vicky888: arvind is not sure now...what is S doing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|steshome: Silly duck of the spade now Hinden cannot go wrong|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|georgia19: can just play spades now |pg||
pc|hT|pc|d3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|subhranp:  good lead, saves the OT|pg||
nt|mohitz:  mavericks have opened their ghada too :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vicky888: why wouldnt manoj ruff it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rishabh:  RV didn't feel like making his partner feel better and went for 4 overtricks :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: The danger with the double is if it chases the opponents to 4@S, but you have defence against that contract, via the forcing plays|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mohitz:  in situations like these, the best defense is to punch declarer and make him lose control. Unfortunately for the defense, they don't have any threatening suit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|steshome: She'll cash the clubs and diamond to the Jack. South cannot have the Ace of Diamonds or they would rise and cash out|pg||

nt|georgia19: it was the pause that got me,|pg||
nt|subhranp:  meanwhile shekar banerjee have reduced the deficit with 10imp pickup on B18|pg||

nt|vicky888: too ambitious 3nt|pg||
nt|rishabh:  NK gambling a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: would Jesus save any contracts or only making once?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is not what Rodwell had in mind for a "support double"|pg||
nt|vicky888: hoping opps wont find the dia defence|pg||
nt|mohitz:  4@S a way better contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|rishabh:  with 3 card @c support, i have found lots of success in such contracts|pg||
nt|rishabh:  with 2 card, never :)|pg||
nt|vicky888: one loser in every suit there as well|pg||
nt|mohitz:  of course, 4@S is down too but it is a way better contract|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugrapha3: i took out the explanation...my norwegian not very good|pg||
nt|subhranp:  Mavericks gaining 5imps on B4 as MMS pair in the other room conceeded a 800|pg||
pc|sA|nt|subhranp:  aggresive 1h by North|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rishabh:  yes requires any one finesse|pg||
nt|vicky888: manoj knows what 4 of heart means|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugrapha3: i promise|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i will start on monday a course in norwegian|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|serhat: Ware needs 2 miracles after this board.. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And his 4@S bid was fairly undisciplined|pg||

nt|vicky888: 5 more for defence|pg||
nt|vicky888: thats 3nt by EW|pg||
nt|rishabh:  NK can keep it to down 4|pg||
nt|mohitz:  on board 9, mavericks are in 3@D |pg||
nt|rishabh:  should be big swing for mavs this board|pg||
nt|mohitz:  which is likely to go down|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, if he had bought @HA instead of @HK, 4@S is in with a fighting chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still 3@S was not in any way invitational.  East had a double of 3@H available as an invite|pg||

nt|mohitz:  "SLOW PLAY"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: i bet NK is hungry by this time... and is in no mood for such calls|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bjacobs: The way I play, 1@S is used to deny spades|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Various approaches are valid ... you just have to choose one of them|pg||
nt|subhranp:  3 imps to Shekar banerjee on B20. So lead now down to 11imp with 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|rishabh:  interesting pass by E|pg||
nt|mohitz:  what if prajwal passes this|pg||
nt|rishabh:  yeah :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|georgia19: 50% diamond slam here|pg||
nt|rishabh:  2@d looks like any 1 major|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  yes, 2@D is one major|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I can agree with that - I guess 1@s over 1@h is 1nt with no stopper|pg||
nt|mohitz:  would have thought prajwal would bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  decided 2@H is enough|pg||
nt|vicky888: well, EW have to play in 3nt... 4@h will have no chance on spade lead|pg||

nt|rishabh:  3@s asking for @s stop,|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|MBV53: welcome Mohit, Koushik and Deb|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mohitz:  now sure about the bidding|pg||
nt|champ35: ohh....|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mohitz:  2N is some kind of forcing bid obv|pg||
nt|mohitz:  might have been transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|mohitz:  popular tratment in expert circles|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *treatment|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mohitz:  I don't know specs. I am trying to make sense out of the bidding myself :)|pg||
nt|champ35: now quite sure to go beyond |pg||
nt|mohitz:  okay |pg||
nt|mohitz:  so, it seems NK showed 5 diamonds surely|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and then showed an invite hand|pg||
nt|champ35: ya, 2Nt must hv showed 5@ds|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi all from the city of Joy Kolkata for the last session now|pg||
nt|champ35: hi DS|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi kaushik, good afternoon|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dslee: thanks to our VG operators we are able to watch this match|pg||
nt|mohitz:  hopeless contract |pg||
nt|mohitz:  at least 2 diamond losers |pg||
nt|MBV53: :) many Venkatesh wishers here!!|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm- they are in a do or die situation now|pg||
nt|champ35: Arvind & RV cdn't hv expected a better deal, for starters, in 3rd segment|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if bidding slam, prefer 6N by Prajwal instead of 6@D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dslee: this is the farewell match for RV and Arvind for Indian maverics - they would be representing a top Indian team in the next season - a win here will surely lift their motivations|pg||
nt|mohitz:  that at least had some chnces |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|champ35: yes, if @DK & @CK both are favourable layout, hv chance to make that|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|bjacobs: hmm, that's more challenging|pg||
nt|steshome: I have noticed a few 6-5 hands this weekend and people opening a 5 card Major ahead of a 6 card Minor - hate it. What do you think Georgia?|pg||
nt|subhranp:  opportunity for Hemant Jalan here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: sry miss|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: 4 @s is contract|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this is a bad board for Maya Meera|pg||
mb|1N|nt|subhranp:  6h on for them|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|georgia19: I like to open 6 before 5, BUT sometimes, I let the suit quality decide - some suits can be treated as one shorter if they're awful.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp:  2d probably multi|pg||
nt|mohitz:  very slow this room|pg||
nt|vicky888: always 3nt making here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|steshome: I wonder if 2@D is F1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: Nabil made double win this year. well done..|pg||
nt|georgia19: T'other day I opened 1@d on a NICE 5 card suit with 5 little spades, it worked fine, this time...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  EW and South are pretty slow players|pg||
nt|rishabh:  they might play in 5@c/5@d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  NK took a lot of time too today |pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other room are playing the last bd now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  we have 4 remaining|pg||

mb|3N|nt|georgia19: well if it's not it could be messy|pg||
nt|subhranp:  2nt should be asking, west will show weak hands in hearts|pg||
nt|subhranp:  incidentally NS also make 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: right ... he won the pairs with Ash Bach?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  precision opening, so, 2@C is 5-4 either way |pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: is this first win of Milne team? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  2@H game forcing artificial bid|pg||

nt|mohitz:  3@C, we have a fit in clubs |pg||

pc|c3|nt|allysophia: Traian gets kickbacks obviously|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|georgia19: I think 3NT was easier, this could go off, but only on a spade lead -|pg||
nt|steshome: easy to make now|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this board could be game set and match for Mavericks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugrapha3: noooooooo|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|subhranp:  so DSM will go into the next set with 24imp lead|pg||

nt|dslee: rightly said MBV|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dslee: 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mohitz:  prajwal has 5 card support but has a balanced hand and with 1N overcaller sitting over partner, 2@H should be enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: play in 2 places and mostly minors|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT from arvind|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|dslee: Indicating - length in 2 places - and which is surely @C and @D now - with @S x|pg||
