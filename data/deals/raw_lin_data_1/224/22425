pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kareno: He had to duck that diamond.|pg||
nt|ritong: fortunately for bertheau, this hand does not decide the match  but he is currently swearing at himself i m sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Does Fred have enough info to guess right if N leads @D now?|pg||
nt|corplaw:  not much of a guess; J in N vs Jx in S|pg||
nt|ritong: but north did not duck|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he likely has not @d AJ under his eyes|pg||
nt|kareno: True - if north ducks the diamond there is a trump endplay after ruffing out the club.  My bad :)|pg||
nt|corplaw:  declarer might have had QC instead of QD|pg||
nt|corplaw:  then duck would look very foolish|pg||
nt|corplaw:  but if N smoothly ducks diamond, W might play S for AD and lead another up instead of trying for endplay|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: If declarer doesn't have @DQ, he would play 3 rounds of @C first?|pg||
nt|kareno: Wheels within wheels|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred: Nothing makes any sense.|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
nt|corplaw:  if declarer had Ax, KJx, Kxxxx, AQx, can't play three rounds of clubs at that point as needs entry to play up diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit overstated, perhaps, but true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Both sides just agreed to ask me if this board matters for the match outcome, so I told them.|pg||
