nt|wilkinsona: yes, hello everyone|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|tomi2: first question, Milan you probably know more - isnt Michal Kopecky too old for juniors? you cant be juniors all of your life! :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I am here to help you understand the bidding of the Czech pair, both players are my regular partners|pg||
nt|tomi2: I remeber I played against Michal and you back in 2006 and unfortunatly I bacame older since that :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, he turned 26 this year. He is more a playing coach of the rest of the team |pg||
nt|anton72: hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome from a sunny Amsterdam :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Good starting hand :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be an easy slam to reach and an easy sacrefise in 7@c/@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: bulgaria white are currently 3rd, england U20 are 14th|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all welcome :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: nice 2@S opener (muiderberg) if available|pg||
nt|bebechira: Bulgaria White 3rd now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome back all|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kingcur: Poland currently in 6th position, but they gave the strong Iraeli team a 22-8 beating in yesterday's last session|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: from today on the teams play another 12 rounds Swiss|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 boards per match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NL Red currently leading the Swiss with 105 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Israel is 4th with 98 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: after the Swiss the 4 top teams play semi-finals on thursday|pg||
nt|bebechira: England U20 are 14th|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i would never open 2@s with that N hand, 1@c my choice|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|vugraphzzx: hello|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that does give you access to Open Room Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|stc: one big swing difference, the match is open|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the TD stopped punishing such behaviour after both teams agreed. so there are no more time penalties in the final|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Guten Abend allerseits|pg||
nt|400 volt: Beide Paare spielen einen schwachen SA in der Eröffnung|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi this time sesson it is not sensible to guess final contracts -so colorful they where last session |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: TD gave them 10 minutes extra and decided that both pairs were responsible for the last delay so assigned NO penalties|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!N here or 4@h? 4@h ofcourse best but 3!N with 5-3-3-2 over 4-3-3-3 is quite common|pg||
nt|kingcur: and here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sorry 1@s thougt 5@s only|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|400 volt: Das Ost-West-System ist relativ natürlich gehalten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: an agressive 3@c opener here again|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Dutch style :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: strangely enough south did not transfer over 1NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi again Dennis...long day for you :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denamrk 10th..NL Girls 11th|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Good evening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: das n/s system hingegen bringt über 200 seiten auf die waage :)|pg||
nt|danmac: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult break in spades in this first hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if 4@h can be a form of weak bid pass from tofte might be dangerous and chooses to bid 5@h:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: W not bidding with his 4c @S support...|pg||
nt|bebechira: she will|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still tough for ns|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3@S nowadays the common way to show more trumps than points|pg||
nt|bobholl: would consider 4nt on west hand and after 5@C 5@DE|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stc: A@s hilft|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is round 9 of 17 of the Swiss|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: This is the semifinal of the German Open Team Trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky asks about 3@c, gotard makes some kind of "it's natural" shrugging motion |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, sorry for the confusion just now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS a polish pair, but they do NOT play Polish Club|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS playing weak NT 11-14|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: Piekarek's DBL = 3@S|pg||
nt|anton72: we will be happy if operator giving us some info about artifical bids|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all and welcome|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW plays a different 2 Nt module|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: interesting to see if he can make|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark|pg||
nt|andreasw:  getting @s right then it should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Ja, da sind einige ungewöhnliche Sachen drin|pg||
nt|stc: reicht aber nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: der kontrakt geht nur, wenn west im ersten karo stich mit dem as steigt|pg||
nt|stc: auch nicht, A@D und @H, hat immer noch ein @c zu verlieren|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads  2nd/4th|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: netherlands white is a team with some new Dutch junior players|pg||
nt|kingcur: test|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@s extra and cuebid? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Cor Balfoort|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kingcur: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Frank Budai|pg||
nt|kingcur: from a very sunny and spring-y Holland|pg||
nt|anton72: i am not fully familiar with systems ...just Roland invite me few minutes ago :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: I will if I know|pg||
nt|anton72: thank you ...sure :)|pg||
nt|anton72: N avoid the standart lead in clubs ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome back all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the last match for today. Tomorrow we play another 6 rounds|pg||
nt|bobholl: N is vulnarable not glad of 4@S so bid only 2 @H :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|400 volt: Yet, the results were as expected: All teams in the semifinals were expected to get to the semifinals|pg||
nt|400 volt: But there is a very clear favourite - the team "Jamm & Co"|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5@h should not be a good result for e-w .. although 7@c/@d is only -500 so might not be that bad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3NT the right contract here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: heading that way I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: west can bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: If East has singelton @h she will surely bid again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results www.nbbportal.nl/1003 --> competitie|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well judged bid from south|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  so 6 @c missed |pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: from the player's notes: 2NT = 9-12 or 16+, 3@s and 4@c cues|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@h will probably fail as East can hold up his @hA twice|pg||
nt|kingcur: but they got to the only game that does have a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: ew lead 3/5 throughout i believe|pg||
nt|kingcur: so all specs consider yourself lucky I'm not sitting in the sun :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have really enjoyed holland when i have visited - particullarly amsterdam|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi all :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  11 quick tricks:)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3NT should be an easy contract for Michal after @D lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NS avoid the bad spade situation after east's overcall|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3NT obviously failing by the lack of a spade stopper and the minor suit game by three top tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well spotted Dennis|pg||
nt|bobholl: probably k@H lead and 1 up|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: auch @d geht|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Good evening  |pg||
nt|bebechira: i met Dennis in Veldhoven last year...he is an outstanding VG operator :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: east probably wondering where the @s are|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stc: oder @s :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: bidding is over vor some minutes but still no opening lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Welcome back, folks. |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results of the 1st round can be found at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|xenya: a cautious auction has led to a good stop |pg||
pc|d8|nt|dimi: this will be an easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lead of a king would have shown a good suit, queen denies|pg||
nt|kingcur: Tim Verbeek acting as substitute for Berend vd Bos' regular partner, Joris van Lankveld. The reason being that Joris has an examn to bring off first|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|xenya: N showed a weakish hand with 4! Ss, S went on to invite and N accepted|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dkkello:  standard bidding here|pg||
nt|xenya: providing EW play carefully, this should go down -- the defence can get 3 clubs, a diamond and a spade|pg||
pc|d4|nt|baldfriede: Declarer just has to develop a trick in @s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads  Slawinski   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the website of the bridgeclub 'het Witte Huis'|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Para £osiewicz - Terszak debiutuje w reprezentacji, ale jej ostatnie wyniki wystawiaj¹ jej dobre wiadectwo|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS playing a lot of transfers after almost any intervention, so we will see playing the hands from different hands|pg||
nt|xenya: for i moment i thought they might overbid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: too high now it seems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzyf: results of the tournament at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund and Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly on this lead|pg||
nt|dburn: although North may need to do well|pg||
nt|kingcur: but Dennis Stuurman, our vugraph operator, already showed the way to also beat 4@H: once dummy is out of trumps, declarer will be tapped|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: than at other table|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|400 volt: I just got the note that in this room I should commentate in English - sorry for all kibitz who do not understand German :)|pg||
nt|xenya: but they ought to be very accurate|pg||
pc|cT|nt|baldfriede: And there it is.|pg||
nt|xenya: now, for example, only a club switch beats it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup:  hi -a nice slam to start with -not laydown but good one and makes easily by ruffing 2 @h -si Smirnov will make this for sure|pg||
nt|stc: good morning|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Roland, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play standard signals|pg||
pc|cA|nt|400 volt: I should commentate in German, sorry :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Users who prefer English will find their way to the open room, Felix|pg||
nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze haben sich bereits gewundert, dass Thomas Gotard jun. nicht mehr mit Bernard Ludewig spielt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a service to have German in one room, not a punishment|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: bernard ludewig konnte leider aus gesundheitlichen gründen heute nicht antreten|pg||
nt|400 volt: Danke Michael - damit wäre die Frage geklärt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Still time for an overtrick.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: fails to let me down for once.|pg||
nt|dburn: scarcely a pause - impressive|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: a good slam with not many points. @s 2-2 and short @h on side making the play easy |pg||
nt|stc: but of course dec doesn't know all this and has to consider many layouts|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  otherwise 5 c M , 4+1@d and 2+1@c with trf|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sastro: Karo 8 hätte das Kommunikationsproblem gelöst|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Not so easy when you are on rama and have communications problems .. but will make i am sure |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so vLankveld actually showed 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: hello Peter, hello Tony|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wilkinsona: and 12 ricks now it seems..|pg||
nt|bebechira: and quick -1|pg||
nt|xenya: preferably the 10 -- well done|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c8|nt|pelu: dont exp signals in @s :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: and this will give E two trump tricks|pg||

nt|gsper:  E had a difficult choice betweewn active and passive defence|pg||
nt|kingcur: so, 10 in for Israel|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gsper:  In any case, we are more likely to respond to chat if you have full name in profile|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kingcur: being 9 VP's ahead of number 5, they have enough with a fair result in this match to qualify|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kingcur: many specs suggesting a 2@H overcall, but those 3 small spades make this a tricky hand. Plus, the suit isn't too good|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gsper:  A prominent kib objects strongly to Es first pass. I agree, but in the end it is to some extent a style matter|pg||

nt|stc: but before it have been worked, ending with say 2 @c in dummy and Q10@s in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov was thinking about playing east for one spade more and one @D less|pg||
nt|andreasw:  http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: the official tournament site is www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our other four matches today will be England-Poland, Israel-Czech Republic, Norway-Bugaria and Sweden-Finland|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we all open E hand  I vote yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think results will be on www.bridge.nl|pg||
nt|kingcur: as always well maintained by Rosaline Barendregt and a few others|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 11H |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played for the first hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: well played by Kopecky, may be too fast for some of us :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you must connect both rooms, operator|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 11 tricks  in an easy contract to start with|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@s n-s here?|pg||
nt|kingcur: a classic but well executed defense theme for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: being in the closed room we will not have results from the open very soon|pg||
nt|bobholl: when in doubt bid one more :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i understand the double of east|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Easy to get to high this board .. especially playing teams|pg||
nt|bobholl: than they (may be) will not bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north claims that he bid as if there had been no 1nt and after 1@C-2@D = hearts 2nt they have a system. south bid system off (=natural)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to endplay n on that line.|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 1@H|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening transfer preempts on 2nd level, too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: certainly a high standard of card play there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H = 8-11 with 6c. or 9-14 with 5@S+5m|pg||
nt|sommer: oh oh|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, it didn't matter - this wasn't a deal where declarer could pitch a spade on a club, then set up a long spade for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D 5@C and 2 aces 13 tricks but even 6 migth be tough|pg||
mb|2H!|an|weak|nt|golfsquash: worth 3@s|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diese mBoard könnten Nord/Süd schnell mal zu hoch geraten|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that was a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: then he would need to play a heart from dummy forcing east to ruff|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning all|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s -1 by EW ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier to concede a @d early. 2 3 4 1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky is not very happy with this bid :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: first option is 8-11 with 6 clubs? or 6 cards?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@h seems like the max|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4@C bei Nord/Süd und 3@S bei Ost/West ist das Limit|pg||
nt|stc: was für NT spielen sie ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 12-14 beide|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir spielt sogar 11-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@s promises 5, but 1@h only promises 4 in e/w system (swiss acol)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW used to play a modification of NS Baltic club but they found out it was too complicated, so they switched to some easier system at the beginning of the year|pg||
nt|frankaus: i value it a 15 count|pg||
nt|kingcur: agree: if you open light, it's important to have a good suit, and this @H suit qualifies for that|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sorry, 6@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will be more happy now :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS is saved, is there an option to get to 3NT by EW side?|pg||
nt|anton72: Curiosly is that i comentating match between country where i am born ...BUL ...and country where I live ..NOR |pg||
nt|anton72: splinter probably is 3 di|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 6 rounds of 10 boards today|pg||
nt|kingcur: but we will do our best to keep you posted|pg||
nt|xenya: they are now heading for another thin game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dimi: yes probably -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ³adnie przepuci³ kiera Robertson, |pg||
nt|tomi2: ISR leading, CZE 2nd. the teams have been put in four grops of 6, playin a compleate round robin today and will go on in a swiss movement tomorrow and the day after|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just checking the website, i see these 2 teams are lying 4th and 1st|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Yes, 3 NT can be made by N/S, but east/west will bid 4@S everytime|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat geschrieben "2@s gute hebung"... wundert mich etwas...|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D ist eigentlich relativ natürlich im System von Ost-West. Der einzige Grund für das Alertieren kann sein, dass West auch mit 5er @C und 4er @D 1@D häufig eröffnet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hab ich mir schon fast gedacht, dass er hier mit kontra in die reizung einsteigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: thats the problem with playing artifical methods - you need detailed agreements or some really good working meta-agreements in competition|pg||
nt|stc: I even think that with more free places in E the crossruff line was a bit better|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Good fireworks here|pg||
nt|stc: anyway good start for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Alex said in the end that he should have played the cross ruff. but that needed to start in trick 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: summary of Slawinsky leads in Supplementary Notes of Fantoni-Nunes Convention Card  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBra...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|stc: cards are friendly for NS, EW can't go plus|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now i doubt it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, a somewhat conservative move by E|pg||
nt|dburn: but here is another tough problem for North-South - getting to 6@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is a slammy sort of hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: over 2h already|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|bobholl: welcome markku|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: diff to reach 6@d. Opps bidding is mote helpfull then destructive|pg||
nt|bobholl: s will bid 3nt i fear|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt opening would be 11-13, so this rebid shows 14+|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players produced so many big swings that they all speed up playing for overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or book that introduced the method   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south passed and explained to west "I have a clear pass on 2@S but I was thinking because I was not sure if thats natural"|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play a strong @c system|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Ja, 3SA können von Nord/Süd erfüllt werden, aber Ost/West gehen immer auf 4er-Stufe|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube nicht, dass 3SA von Ost irgendwelche Probleme bereitet. Sogar 5@D geht. Mal schauen, ob Ost/West sie erreichen|pg||
nt|sastro: mit 6-4 bevorzuge ich zuerst die Wiederholung der 6er-Länge|pg||
nt|stc: keine gute Idee von N|pg||
nt|stc: aber 2@h ist nicht soo schlecht|pg||
nt|dimi: @s K @h Q and 2 @c tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hard to guess the singleton king.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW are very slow players and are in danger of beeing to late every segment|pg||
nt|stc: NS must just cash their tricks before the 5th @d is played|pg||
nt|stc: in other words S must play @c when in hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: novay min 4 me |pg||
nt|frankaus: no way |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results are at www.nbbportal.nl/1003, then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|kingcur: but with two aces and a decent 2nd suit, this is not even a light opening|pg||
nt|dburn: that might give them a chance, if it's a pure takeout double|pg||
nt|dburn: but I think this is too difficult|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well its a good bid, but not sure north will try clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: hi Markku|pg||
nt|kingcur: and for the record: we have no running scores of the other matches available. Past round results on www.wintyurl.com/whj2012 however|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we play 6 rounds of 10 boards today|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: tomorrow we have the semi-finals |pg||
pc|s7|nt|dkkello:  Hi Markku|pg||
nt|runnerup:  misfit ,but 8 available by finessing @d even with @s switches|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h will fail|pg||
pc|sA|nt|golfsquash: trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but nothing will bother it|pg||
nt|anton72: E hasnt he control ..so...we just in Game|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2 teams here are No 1 (Netherland) and No 3 after 5 rounds  (in 4 groups) now 12 x swiss|pg||
nt|andreasw:  anyone for keeping open with a dbl or a 2@h bid on norths hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: but a pergectly reasonable one|pg||
nt|dburn: he probably has to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well he does bid 4 hearts..|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, not enough pitches on diamonds anyway - still need the spade finesse|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 easy tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S would have gone for 800 despite NV|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi joe :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi ..looks like garnny by squuezing east and finessing @c here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|400 volt: Auch 5@C kann man schnell mal im Gegenspiel schenken, von daher ist 5@S sicherlich ein akzeptables Gebot|pg||
nt|400 volt: jetzt hat sich Udo Kasimir etwas zu hoch gewagt - die Hand steht aber auch schlecht für ihn|pg||
nt|400 volt: Der Gegner hat @S KB8x UND der @C-Schnitt sitzt nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben got a 10 imp penalty for slow play|pg||
nt|stc: better now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer may simply pull trumps from the top|pg||
nt|stc: not very likely but possible of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ducking that was risky, vuln south could hold 8 hearts and noting outside|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S now game try $ me|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems it is, now how to make it :)|pg||
nt|xenya: perfectly*|pg||
nt|xenya: very delicate contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some players will overcvall 1NT with E|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can set up a long @h also if they keep playing @ss|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so will 4:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lool|pg||
nt|bobholl: @CQ lead and 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: even 2@h down with 3@c, 2@d and !K to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: *@sK|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tomi2: can insert the king and unblock an honor in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: club lead might break the communication. Declarer has to play his suits from his hand which is not good for him in this board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be difficult to defeat...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to get entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry, i mean in 2nd club trick  finesse the 9|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: defence has to put Declarer once on the table with A of @H and another possible entry is @C8, but not easy to find it.|pg||
nt|tomi2: and later overtake the honor, in case michal forgot to insert the 9. south would do well to switch to a small dia when he wins a spade trick, that would denatly cut the ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: communication|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, declarer can play his @S from his hand, establishing 2@S tricks, 4@C, 1@H and 2 @D which makes a total of 9 = just made|pg||
nt|tomi2: cant NS open the hearts in time then, to score 2@S and 3@H?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: timing is important now|pg||
nt|tomi2: they seem to block because they need to finesse dummy's 10|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Another easy 3 nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 Then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: other tournament info at www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|pelu: ok Israke and Bulgaria both 3/4|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2NT does not promise 4@h here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: N can have any invitational hand|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case, might as well be in six diamonds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and ofcause you have a growing @h also ,but |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north might have tried NT but settles for 2 spades|pg||
nt|kingcur: and by the time the semis and finals are being played, we ordered some less sunny weather to make watching them even more attractive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  granny|pg||
nt|bobholl: now s migth be thinking of 6@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|400 volt: Nord hat nur 6 Figurenpunkte, aber mit einem sicheren 9-Karten-Fit und einer guten Verteilung ist das 3@S nicht völlig unverständlich|pg||
nt|runnerup:  time for 800?|pg||
nt|stc: 5 obvious losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what 1@S asked/showed   but it allowed North any easy bid  [versus something like immediate 3@C]|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: DBL seems ok to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with 5@d-2@h you dbl immediately over 1@s, so now dbl is this shape|pg||
nt|kingcur: I agree with N's bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep dennis3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  seems normal:) might even go 3 down if east switch to a small @d or west either way:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|400 volt: hier kostet es 500 - aber gegen mögliche 400 beim Gegner kein allzu großer Verlust|pg||
nt|runnerup:  is south worth 3 @s -with 8 points and 7xxx in @s maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  other room stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: a decent save|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the club finesse is best therefore it seems..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, seems so, and thats a bit unlucky as there seems no endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: the fall of @c8 makes it easy to make 7@d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|golfsquash: Good morning all|pg||
nt|stc: wieso hat W @d entdeckt ?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns never mensioned -the suit they make a slam (lucly ofcause ) @s|pg||
nt|stc: clap-clap|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even though east is a substitute it seems they have control over their system:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure how many of his regular agreements vd Bos has agreed with Tim Verbeek but this looks like a relay sequence he used with v Lankveld as well: they play a fairly natural ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: system, but with loads of gadgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: gf relay quite standard among dutch juniors|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H the limit of the hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: the 4-4 fit often plays better, but here we see @s's split 4-1|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S had 17+7 but hard to get in to the bidding ..|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and they cant make any contract either|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: well no reason to play here for NS as even 3@c won't make|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke mal 2@s zeigt schon 5-4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise to me though that north didn't drive to game here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzzx: schlechte stimmung bei den senioren, kratz/sträter sind mit der spielgeschwindigkeit ihrer gegner nicht glücklich|pg||
nt|400 volt: Gegen wen spielen die beiden denn?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich glaub der eine ist yves mucha|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe some side effect, that explains the imo poor level of bridge here besides the tight schedule was last night... it was Alexander Smirnovs 30th birthday and most of the players ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: were at the bar (too?) long|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he had bought champagne for all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1@h was positive with @h, 2@s about 8-10|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@S would probably have failed so good result|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andreasw:  4@s could have problems although it should make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well getting lost now|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all :)|pg||
nt|dburn: wasn't thinking of five spades, but it may be the last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 3@C probably does that too :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S seems playable|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C K protected|pg||
nt|kingcur: and W declaring 4@S seems like the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d lead looks best to me? altough North might get creative and lead a small @c here|pg||
nt|tomi2: N could insert the 9|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|stc: sry, Ich dachte an einer 1NT Opening !|pg||
nt|tomi2: to prevent this|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello Bob|pg||
nt|dkkello:  true :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|runnerup:  level -to be honist must admid has been a dissopointment but colorful boards and happenings|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Jokisch proved theirs ablities on the piano|pg||
nt|anton72: still could be one down|pg||
nt|anton72: for me looks cool -1 ..let see|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west's second trump lead in two boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: cross in @H and finesse or play a@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: now -2|pg||
nt|xenya: probably down 1 -- unless declarer is clairvoyant enough to drop 1DK |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess this will just make :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess it will - if this South is looking for a shorter name that will fit on the BBO name plate, he could try Houdini|pg||
nt|xenya: anu clue in @Ds?|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly, i think|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stc: klar, er hjat 1@d eröffnet|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes i agree:)  |pg||

nt|andreasw:  ohh sorry did not notice your comment dennis:)|pg||
nt|xenya: J or K?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|anton72: trumps break is bad for declarer|pg||
nt|bebechira: here we go|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Updated scores at http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/  --> Competitie|pg||
nt|pelu: yes  1NT = 15-18 and N has 9 + a 5 card suit + help in @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: nice game missed here?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: also south sitting over the stuff|pg||
nt|xenya: i hope i'm not resulting, but i'd try 3N as N|pg||
nt|xenya: winning choice |pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzzx: high = odd count|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps -it will beb down -entryes are too bad -sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: club lead = low from doubleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thats what i meant|pg||
nt|stc: do you think they make 6@s ? big communication problems, don't think they make|pg||
nt|luffe12:  sry for any confussion|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kingcur: and will now look to set up his side suit first|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@s was a mild slam try even|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  lead 2nd/4th   so  weak doubleton leads LOW|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Bob.  Looks like 4@h is pretty easy here, I might even make it.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|golfsquash: Just 8 tricks, but north coming under some pressure on the run of the hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does north do after  1@C-1@H-3@C-???|pg||
nt|bobholl: did he notice the 8 ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|golfsquash: making now if he reads it right|pg||
nt|sastro: pik 8 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@d would have been sign-off|pg||
nt|frankaus: now will be breathing hard - but lon @H & @S with S|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes he did|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes 3 @s made its task ,but 6 is thinkable with all aces and very good support by south|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: North is a she btw|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|stc: and trump promotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he bids so that NS go minus|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sastro: 9|pg||
nt|sastro: kann einen Stich kosten|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube sie kann es nicht nur, sondern tut es auch hier|pg||
nt|bobholl: hope and pray|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzzx: south claiming for west|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: yes the young Aberdeen player had some tough bids, and suspect he took 4 hearts as playing in spades|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and he will|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|xenya: QJ8xx is an asset and the fact that E has opened might make it easier to play|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry my analysis was lousy :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: long|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kingcur: can ruff the 3rd club in dummy now, play one more round of trumps and then continue hearts, with @DA as entry|pg||
nt|kingcur: West was not thrown in, since a heart return would never give S two tricks|pg||
mc|11|nt|400 volt: aber der Stich kam zurück|pg||
nt|xenya: now cash @SK discarding @D and take @D finesse -- you make if it is on|pg||

nt|kingcur: in a junior event, even 3@D is a possibility :)|pg||

nt|frankaus: can get ugly 6322 not a gr8 shape|pg||
nt|kingcur: and it's not even extremely junior-ish to open 3@D nowadays|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i believe preempting high is best at these colors|pg||
nt|dburn: slam on not a lot of high-card points and only a nine-card fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: weak two or muiderberg ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh -- i should have refreshed screens :(|pg||

nt|runnerup:  yes 1 overtrick looked possible actually -just eliminatate all before 2, trumo trick|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|luffe12:  this board is a fine example on how great 10+ trumphs works |pg||
nt|stc: 6@c is a very decent contract|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@C leaping Michaels presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: non-leaping actually :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east values looks great.. i dont they they will stand at 5'th lvl|pg||
nt|kingcur: and N adding his part in the preemption...E might want to double for penalties now, but not sure if that isn't agreed as forward going|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: interesting to see what Verbeek comes up with now|pg||
nt|frankaus: just @C i ecpect planing to introduce @S later to show 6/5|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: pass and pull? |pg||
nt|kingcur: has E got enough for a pass and pull you think?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe east is afraid of W passing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: very risky indeed in a one-day partnership|pg||
nt|kingcur: for specs: this is an agreement to show a better hand than you would be showing by bidding directly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening 2@C as weak with majors, but this hand is too weak for vulnerable|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: another 3NT contract|pg||
nt|xenya: and declarer was almost certain the finesse would work  |pg||
nt|dburn: and an opening bid by an opponent to make life harder yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1@c natural here, no Polish club!|pg||

nt|luffe12:  10 easy tricks on the E-W cards dispite only 18HCP and a worthless @dk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=non-force  [negative free bid]|pg||
nt|stc: here the üar is 5@Dx -1 : 100 EW !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: smirnov: "Josef, pls, your lead"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Jamm must win so that both get to travel to European Championships in  Cardiff|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Dublin it is I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the winner of this event will represent Germany in Dublin (EC) and Lille (WC/Olympiad)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   European is Dublin     Cardiff was in running for the World Championship  but i think final decision is for Lillie France|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Tomi|pg||
nt|stc: needs to guess @h, not impossible after the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: screens in use, so I dont know who is thinking, N or E|pg||
nt|stc: but I think S will take the insurance in 6 @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: am sitting in the south west corner|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s x -4 = 800|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: narazie dwa szczêliwe rozdania dla Brytyjczyków|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: someone told me that 7222 distribution is very close to 6322 which is very close to 5332 which is almost 4333. With that hand, you will bid 3NT immediately, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2nt is positive with fit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 1 Nt could prob be a weak raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We need to shut down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tes, difficult for west not to bid on|pg||
nt|pelu: I forgot - juniors :) - S only have to a contructive raise to 2@s - But "The law" again cost|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tables are not linked|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 diamonds alerted, but looks natural|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C goes already for 800 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: she alerted, so I did too|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 3@H nid in W (3@H and 54 in minors)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  e-w might compete to 3@c which should buy it|pg||
nt|bobholl: reasonable guess by s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: first pass, let your pd double and then bid: hence the name|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably would have gone down in 6, losing the @sJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: i even alert my 1nt opening as "may include 7 card suits"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East shows clubs, but there is a nasty duplication in hearts|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome to Frank Budai :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 6@D   be honest now -- how many people thought about THAT bid??|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W has bad values for slam even he has a maximum hand in HCP so he shouldnt go for a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dennis will insert scores manually for boards already played when he gets a minute|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow 3NT looks much better imo|pg||
nt|bobholl: good support in both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: kleine swings für Jokisch|pg||
nt|stc: kann spanend sein|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: interesting auction|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s guess needed -restricted choice if you happened to start from rigth hand |pg||
nt|stc: now 170 EW :)|pg||
nt|stc: of course splits are very bad and even 5 @c is not so easy, 3NT lokks OK|pg||
nt|stc: 9 easy tricks, some endplay with N for ten ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe NS need to lead spades, though|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: as I have written before, inviting slam with 7222 needs a lot of HCP and especially a lot of controls.|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W should bid 4NT now to be able to stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
nt|kingcur: not an easy bid for S, since 2NT may be too high opposite a 3rd hand opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i would just bid 1@s|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not after a 2@H bid off course :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|luffe12:  the law!!|pg||
nt|dimi: but if you only see the EW hands 6@c would be the best contract|pg||
nt|stc: sure, W must be disapointed now but happy later|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can make 5nt double-dummy with the @hKJ- but that's not a likely result at the table.|pg||
nt|stc: DD you can paerhaps even make 6@c guessing @Hs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but west will likely bid 4 hearts|pg||
nt|sommer: quite easy to get overboard on this one|pg||
nt|runnerup:  task again to avoid 3nt --5 @D is great --4 @S lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: what do you do with @s loser in 5@d?|pg||
nt|kingcur: me too|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi frank isn't it late in australia ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if n bids 2@H|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 matches to go including this one... a lot of VPs available|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if east would have had 8 @c -still he has squuezed because that @h K |pg||
pc|d2|nt|golfsquash: lead directing, implying a heart fit on passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ew play weak nt so 1nt shows extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pure Piekarek|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And both pairs use Gazzilli in this sequence|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure your right, Dennis|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doubling with a void is risky.  Doubling with a void and all your points in a long suit is ... well, not quite suicidal, but close.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  with careful play 500 here|pg||
nt|bobholl: first trick blown :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzzx: 3@s eben hat 8 imps gekostet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gromöller wanders off in search of coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ns normally play 2/4 leads but in this particular situation (partner's suit vs nt) they play 1/3|pg||
nt|stc: but whatfor ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: instill doubt in East  in case grand slam is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west is still thinking|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this one was played a few boards back:)|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, N has a nice hand, with those chunky majors |pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 NT looks normal  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, NS seem to have judged the contract well again|pg||
nt|kingcur: but the saying in Poland is that you always get a @S lead against NT contracts, which would have turned out nicely here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sastro: denke mal, dass mit Fit die Nordhand ein 4 Couer-Gebot wert ist|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@H sieht hier eigentlich gar nicht schlecht aus - bei dem aktuellen Kartenstand aber nur mit viel hellseherischen Talent zu erfüllen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: der schlitten für die bietkarten ist kaputt, g. thamm versucht ihn jetzt zu reparieren während dieses board gespielt wird|pg||
nt|luffe12:  20 trumphs = 20 tricks totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room   33 [4@HW-1]     Fritsche playing 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: when the tray is on my side i try to avoid clicking immediatly after a bid has been done because it's possile that they hear my mouse on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|xenya: but it seems she chose wrong time to bid on|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gronkvist:  1M-2M = 7-10 hcp for NS|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kingcur: yes, slam is not plain sailing for EW, and 5@Dx should bring in more than 650...let's see|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well judged...|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: found about missing @S cue. But wrong contract and 2 imps on 8 board match might be crutial|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3NT would be better. on a @D lead they need the finesse now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another -3 here?|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bobholl: being less clever than jamilla would have led a @D :(|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup:  3nt makeable by guessing @d |pg||
nt|runnerup:  so it means that you you play like this -now @s finess is odds on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missing some hesitations Tomi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: @s10 2nd, 4th|pg||
nt|sommer: y|pg||
nt|andreasw:  vugraph cordinator just giving everyone  a chance to see all the boards:)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes need wyew to make 5 @d --j @s run -so maybe 3nt but this time lead will be @c -so down it goes|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10.22 pm here :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Switching to English now|pg||
nt|stc: welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking about the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet    Khanukov WOULD have played @H suit correctly after the 4@S opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov shaking his head after seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|tomi2: think they play 10 boards. does not change too much anyway, 1 imp can easy be 1vp, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: trumps 2-2, no defensive ruffs -- 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: @d ruff for 1 down|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h and 5 @c down because bad sits -with good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south unsure about the meaning of norths bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: not sure whether this contract is doubled...|pg||
nt|pelu: the highest making contract is 3@D - and now fight on the 5-level :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so, peter the 4 spade bid is a winner|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like to compete over 1NT but saw an awful result earlier -------- pays ur money  - takes ur chance|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzyf: no @c lead!!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|golfsquash: N/S playing x-y NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 2@c demands 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: mit @hA vor dem k ist hier alles relativ egal, aber jokisch versucht natürlich eine linie zu finden die auch gegen möglichst widrige verteilungen noch erfïult|pg||
nt|runnerup:  on a good day even 6 @c makes ..not this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky seems totaly unsure what is going on but from west questiones he can imagine clubs splitting not so well. unfortunatly for he would be dummy. screens in use, so north and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south do not know who was thinking when|pg||
nt|bobholl: he sees only 9 sure tricks :) |pg||
nt|kingcur: S can bring in 4 spade tricks by way of an intra-finesse, scooping West's @ST|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room bidding brd 21 and the poles managed to play 3h EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: so NS played 4h and EW playing 3h in the open room|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably intended as an entry for the @c finesse, the @hJ dropping changes the line.  He did that just to spite my prediction...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer will give a @c and then has an entry to the @h|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dimi: Joe, declarer might heard your plan for 11 tricks :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl claimed on any return and no single king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to leaders on 33   shouldn't be long wait till we know whether 6@S was good or bad bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: 20:22 but i had 5:00 start 4 a bush walk this morning|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wilkinsona: difficult to stop in 3N, should be happy with this I think..|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Czechs reached the slam on the other table, will be expensive|pg||
nt|pelu: only if u play Pokere and weak or very agressiv opponents|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: also not sure re the reference to "juniors" who underbid the last hand|pg||
nt|xenya: rather aggressive of course -- and they layout far from friendly|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im not sure it will.. but taking the safe road is problebly best|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 10 tricks here w a nice @h |pg||
nt|kingcur: and with heart length indicated by west's lead, he might just play East for 4@S's|pg||
nt|bebechira: strange but true and a swing in the very first board for the swedes|pg||
nt|kingcur: I just earned my first coke it seems :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzzx: td called|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps south is out of what is happening |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking what to do when he gets no expainations from south|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south trying his best to explain|pg||
nt|runnerup:  really --book says 4. wrong longest ans strongest --ok --makes now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome to felix zimmermann|pg||
nt|400 volt: Hi all|pg||
nt|andreasw:  anyone for drawing king of @c before playing a @h?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: perhaps N would have done better to overtake and play @HQ -- |pg||
nt|pelu: N will have time for that later|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: on board 21 Israel did not preempt at all, so Helmich-Hop played a quiet 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well netherland Red of to a great start|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with a very likely gain on the next board too|pg||
nt|xenya: note E's duck -- it couldn't lose|pg||
nt|xenya: worth remembering|pg||
nt|bebechira: realy?|pg||
nt|bebechira: absolutely|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pelu: and on B22: 3NT +1 = 7IMP|pg||
nt|xenya: as he knows the spade position|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|frankaus: so the 6322 shape goes $ 1100|pg||
nt|bobholl: so guess 200 now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt ist ost auf jeden fall engespielt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: both discard a heart|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I will bid 3NT directly against 15-17 NT, probably getting too old :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I may be wrong, but think quite a few teams will be in slam...|pg||
nt|xenya: well yes, i'm sorry, there IS a ruff in @Ds...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: still made, because endplay for S after ruff (or decl can guess the @d)|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|golfsquash: and if north bids on over 2@d he has a game invitation hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:) 1100 seems right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andreasw:  @d 10 was best in trick 2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to Open Room Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|frankaus: 11000 in the bank would be nice |pg||
nt|kingcur: I'd say EW made the correct decision here, so well done for this occasional partnership|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems the bidding will go 1@C-1@S-1NT-3NT if EW will pass all the time|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 4@C bid also made the club slam beeing played from the wrong site in case partner has some kx holdng in spades and potential discards in another. maybe a jump to 4nt after 2nd ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be right. partner could pass on a "bad" hand or convert to 5 or 6 clubs on a better one|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: agree with Thomas|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@C from S will shown 11+ unbal with @C, 18-20 bal, or 21+ any|pg||
nt|anton72: for norwegians ...sorry :)|pg||
nt|anton72: i am a litle distracted :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sorry need to restart again, we lost connection with the other room|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, spotted 10 and took them|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but west has a very normal @c lead and he needs only 1 big card from parter either in @c or stopping any other suit ...ok next|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so only 200 this board:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: better to let 2@C play :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  partial in @h e-w here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 500 points better than than an own game|pg||
nt|xenya: a club return would have let declarer oitch a club, ruffing in dummy  -- for the same result|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzzx: west claiming he would have doubled if he got some better information about the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: this smells like slam, maybe a grand|pg||
nt|frankaus: another 5 level excursion to a loss|pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  now a dist monster |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 5@c was not doubled, so only -200|pg||
nt|dkkello:  next !   ;)  |pg||
nt|bobholl: i would guess all pass but with juniors improbable|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kingcur: this will end up in 4@S EW, potentially very fast|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: all 3 boards look pretty good for the Czech |pg||
nt|kingcur: 7@C here?|pg||
nt|bebechira: first blood to the swedes|pg||
nt|bebechira: 8 that is for brd 21|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be even game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|golfsquash: could bid 4@c if not too strong in his methods|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@H sieht eigentlich recht gut aus - aber gegen @H 5-0 und @D AJ hinter KD sieht es nicht erfüllbar aus|pg||
nt|glen: classic question - red, in 2nd seat, the N hand does not fit a weak two, but does it anyways|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Grand on a @d guess|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@D probably some good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: as this E hand seems a little heavy for current tandards for bidding 1mi-4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: standards*|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: vdBos-Verbeek also play strong jump shifts, so 2@s would have been GF 5+@s with more outside values|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 5@d now bye W?|pg||
nt|friggi: any guess? 5|pg||
nt|bobholl: took probably extra chance of 4th @H with @C ace|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @c J placed well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am a bit old fashioned so not an opening for me although i can understand it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|400 volt: 2@D zeigt einen zweifärber mit @S und einer zweiten farbe, @H oder @C|pg||
nt|sastro: Kontra heisst iA : Ich kann eine mögliche Farbe des Gegners kontrieren- sehe ich hier nicht|pg||
nt|400 volt: entweder unter Eröffnungsstärke oder eine starke Hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kontra wurde schlicht als "punkte" erklärt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@s könnte sogar gehen... spannend|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C?|pg||
nt|glen: the reason for not opening - poor playing value, the reason for opening, hey, i would have opened it in 1st or 3rd seats|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi Friggi|pg||
nt|pelu: B23: Hop in S only show a good raise to 3@S, and EW in 4@d|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy if west opens 1 club|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|kingcur: once again, a pretty 4c@S remains unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice to have a weak raise available :)|pg||
nt|xenya: pitch a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: I like 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@c is nat or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  assume they end up in 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3@d shows values (2nt would have been lebensohl)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning Shirley and Glen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Leif|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||

nt|uni_cicam: nice opening by E, makes it more difficult to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but EW do not keep quiet|pg||
nt|friggi: hi Johan|pg||
nt|kingcur: at least so far|pg||
nt|bebechira: you have to guess the spades queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: You'd like to do something on the w hand but 1@d is too much for me.|pg||
mb|d|nt|golfsquash: magical 25 HCP slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch-kasimir have a quite unique system|pg||
nt|stc: This result may be anything, push or swing in any direction !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@D overcall shows 10+, solid hand|pg||
nt|gsper:  Well, what did you bid last time in this situation?|pg||
nt|friggi: 5@D|pg||
nt|xenya: routine 3N -|pg||
nt|kingcur: the NS hands fitting perfectly|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be not|pg||
nt|runnerup:  it really was good result -and they have only 21 points to gether and no game|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ew can make 5 @h but can be many down if different sits |pg||
nt|frankaus: this auction right sided the contract now @D lead gives up a trick|pg||
nt|kingcur: the danger with transfer-agreements always being that it allows your opponents a double to indicate values in that suit and enter the bidding at lesser risk|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3@C asking for stopper will get NS there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, he sure has that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  6 @C was cold|pg||
nt|friggi: dif to find after 5@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry they haven't|pg||
mb|2N|nt|golfsquash: could have tried 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch hatte erklärt dass 2@d in dieser geflage eröffnungsstärke zeigt|pg||
nt|xenya: S can hardly make a move now -- has to take it like a man|pg||
nt|luffe12:  11 from the top - 12th from at possible double squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: bright an early in Washington DC |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west explained 2@D as if 1@H = hearts would have been bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south to west: 1@H is natural|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north would perhaps be declarer in 4 @s (d?)  if he had bid a couple of @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now rohowsky remembers|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they agreed to treat the system as polish club and 1@H showed spades against non natural systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2 [5@DX-2] von Alvensleben playing 5@C South|pg||
nt|luffe12:  good "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|baldfriede: W may get into a squeeze when trying to protect Q@c. which is not the way to brin it down, bzt hard for W to know unless E shows it somehow|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but*|pg||
nt|kingcur: but here it worked out well, with @DK now protected|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky now regrets his 2@D bid :-) but he has to show the stopper|pg||
nt|pelu: so "only" 3 IMP for NL|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 7NT will make as well, but 7@c better|pg||
nt|kingcur: 13 tricks in NT with @S 3-3 as well, but 7@C looks like the safer spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is more difficult after the double|pg||
nt|andreasw:  cant you manage without?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben bei ansicht des dummys: "damit eröffnet ihr?!?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 24-26 but might be on a very nice 23, we are told|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 sp may be showed some shape|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry for Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i don't like rdbl with real fit here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this should lead to 3!N/5@d which both make|pg||
nt|xenya: think i'll get coffee|pg||
nt|dkkello:  is 2 @S here an Ostot convention ?  If tou play that..  should be |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: trump lead or switch to defeat 3@s?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|golfsquash: 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So 1 down here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  very difficult after 5@d|pg||
nt|friggi: after the lead yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: though this is clearly too good a hand for 2@s nv|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s lead will kill this |pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @S   = weak limit   ... 2 @H Good @S raise with 3 cards support   |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i predict 6NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol Dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: (want to win a coke too :) )|pg||
nt|kingcur: lol|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even if a weak 2@d is available it's probably too strong for that with a void and 2 quick tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: td was still at the table, he has not to be called :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  7 tricks seems sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can be 7+ with no 4-card major   or  7-11 wrong for 1N|pg||
nt|kingcur: and brining in a discard for a loser|pg||
nt|anton72: or just is asking|pg||
nt|bebechira: history now |pg||
nt|andreasw:  @h K being placed second i think you can|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: getting 9 tricks shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
nt|luffe12:  3nt is easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: from souths point of view the lead must be a singleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  would u X with the N hand or 3nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low from xx does NOT include  10x   that leads 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N way too much opposite balancing DBL|pg||
nt|xenya: down 2 for 500 -- but 3N NS is very very close -- 4@H might go down though|pg||
nt|tomi2: he has 3 card fit and two kings, nothing to regret|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@DS: making on B24 - decl setup the @Hs and no @c-loser|pg||
nt|bebechira: they will not be happy with 6nt|pg||
nt|kingcur: there are additional chances in 7NT in case the sapdes or diamonds would not break: if one defender holds them both, he will be squeezed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  strange hand to lead from:) might turn up with a 1h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @h*|pg||
nt|bobholl: and you migth miss 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and possibly another one in hearts|pg||
nt|anton72: West need to play that one carefuly|pg||
nt|anton72: expecting K he |pg||
nt|anton72: like lead|pg||
nt|friggi: overtake|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so as I say, the 4 spade bid is a winner|pg||
nt|runnerup:  still time ofcause |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|golfsquash: cash 4 side suit tricks and claim|pg||
nt|xenya: there is an entry to dummy in @Ds, so...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir studies opponent's cc|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they lead 5/3|pg||
nt|xenya: whichever high heart will do here|pg||
nt|dimi: ok also 6NT is an easy make, probably loses only to the @d Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, but didn't clarify strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S is not forcing|pg||
nt|friggi: is mandatory|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: east apologizing for his dummy|pg||
nt|andreasw:  disaster for denmark here.. im guessing Raulund believes that the dbl showed @s support and tofte believes Raulund has at alot of @s:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: DD easy 9th trick but in practice it is coming now :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 losers but i guess will  make anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: double dummy, you can make 3N by running the @SJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzzx: @cA erfolgreicht geduckt... jetzt tippe ich auf -1|pg||
nt|sastro: Treff 7 machts|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: this will be played very fast i guess|pg||
nt|stc: not a great contract with 4@s and 5@c making|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekarek comments "it cant be true"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but this may be a good lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems some sort of question and answer sequence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|luffe12:  S could be a little bit less i 4th seat but N have fine support all over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  2   looks like 5@C going down|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so close to "All Square"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking about the lead agreements again, south looked suprised expecting partner and not opp wil ruff this|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i was wondering -- on the surface, 5@C looked like a make, but there are pitfalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he did know SOMEONE was going to ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: first double explained "we mandatory double with spade shortnes and 7+hcp"|pg||
nt|stc: yes, DD you just give the K@c and score 5@s, 5@c and A@H in 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 5@C on 2 did fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2nd double: "double on 2@S would be penalty, so I guess this one is penalty too"|pg||
nt|stc: I think that 500 here will by a swing for NS|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but they pl @dk to @dA and a @h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so u are doomed, right?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  since u are looked in hand |pg||
nt|luffe12:  fine piece of defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer won't lose a trick if playing for the @d finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ew asking abut the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@s not alerted, so probably natural|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|xenya: of course W could have @H9 or @HQ |pg||
nt|anton72: seems defence can get maximum 2 trumps and 2 hearts more|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i thought it was   example:  includes 18 hcp 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: it can be weak nt with 4 spades or 3 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|stc: in fact 6@c as spec noticed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or 4 spades and 5+ clubs any strength that survives a pass from partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or 5+ spades, 18+ hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: WOW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = not 4@H, a) 11+, 3/4@S  b) 18-19, 5@S  c) 11-20, 5@C & 4@S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sastro: auf Treff Bube geht Karo weg|pg||
nt|400 volt: wieso hat denn Ost nicht @S nachgespielt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: actually e/w play slavinsky leads|pg||
nt|bobholl: S should have doubled 3@H now always made otherwise had to find @S Q|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: could you expand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3 [3@SW+1]  von Alvensleben in 4@D South   so  like previous 5@C -- now he just has to make it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, but wasnt easy to count the points at the table :-)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, cor and with a 3rd heart in one of the hands a double sq|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so i take a guess at 7nt|pg||
nt|kingcur: declarer has two hearts and four clubs to cash from top, and that leaves 7 cards while there are two 4 cards in @S/@D to keep|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kingcur: will now play clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: not fooled :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  time is runnig out  ..|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 1 will be flat 5sx+1 both tables :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns has 'almost game' in @c or @s so ew has done well in the end|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sastro: ducken ist das beste- dann kann AS die Treffs noch missraten|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: je nachdem wie lange man zum duck braucht aber auch nicht mehr|pg||
nt|kingcur: double finesse the best chance|pg||
nt|friggi: trump|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So next time u have a 5 card in the opening suit and a solid 8 card suit bid 5 :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  I'll make note of that|pg||
nt|bebechira: so Dennis is 6nt and Tony 7nt|pg||
nt|kingcur: and with the length in these suits being in two hands, the squeeze will work against either opponent, a so called automatic squeeze|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he noticed it is the highest one ?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|anton72: lead was giving unexpecting trick for declarer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: althouh that xx not to everyones taste, EW judged well here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @h @h  |pg||
nt|bobholl: will make 3 now (trump 1 @S)|pg||
nt|bobholl: or a @C ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cc469: N's hand became less impressive with announced @C singleton with S opposite his @C values|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think the high lead showed either even length with an honor or odd length without an honor|pg||
nt|xenya: the mind boggles :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|kingcur: no cokes! :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: wrong again |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: players are writing explanations of the bidding now, but can't read it|pg||
nt|bebechira: poland scored 5 on 22..|pg||
nt|kingcur: 2@S down in the open room on  22|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: if i understand correctly North asked aces (probably 4@c)|pg||
nt|kingcur: @CA lead, then @HA and another heart and the defense set up a bit of cross ruffing|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...you can see in the movie the proceedings|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: and N has no entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks suprised that south has a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: he will claim very soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: north surprised by this dummy|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: I am sure 3NT will be contracted in some matches on hand 22|pg||
pc|s2|nt|golfsquash: would like to play hearts agin, but entry problems|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: what made smirny choose @S rather than give @C ruff??|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|anton72: he need to play cl|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS play standard count|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S might make on a non-trump lead?|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey povl:)|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like 5@D is also on|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|luffe12:  S must guard @C N the @s so no one to protect @h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  maybe to avoid any kind of endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekareks carding was consistent to KT9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no, in fact may be better for north to duck, as declarer may have got the spades wrong|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -if declarer makes no stupid things we ii home now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 times @D and dump 2@C|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sastro: wie vorausgesagt- nun Treff 7|pg||
nt|400 volt: hat Jokisch wirklich @C 2 geordert?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  figth for contract here |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|stc: a big missed oportunity for EW to come bach in the match|pg||
nt|anton72: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|friggi: trump was necessary to reduce @S ruffing|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a very bad contract with both 5@D and 3N playable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: on bd 1 the bidding was more exciting in the open room|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 down anyway but could have been more|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1 down only now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: was|pg||
nt|stc: was not the 3@d very positive ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after Piekarek had commented souths bidding for a minute i did not guess this would happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per CC   East leads King from AKJT  else Ace |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they are playing now for the overtricks|pg||
nt|anton72: i think he already is down|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and that moment came|pg||
pc|d9|nt|runnerup:  well stopped here and -@h holding found so that you are favorite to make this aldo after @h lead by finessiing in @c or @s ..so same guesswork ,,but now all well -@h lead not found|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: True about doubling 3@h, but partner did not overcall in @s, so longest suit lead seems best|pg||
nt|bobholl: or develop a @H as he does now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|golfsquash: overtrick now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Not any longer - declarer should give up a club |pg||
nt|glen: declarer ducks @C to S, to prevent @S play from N|pg||
nt|santyclz: They were lucky to miss @hs this time.  I like w's 2@d bid even if the negative x "practically guarantees" 4@h.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: upside down attitude   @D3 with north showing the @D2  is most encouraging|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 down may be ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: now hope that teammates bid 6@C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|golfsquash: and a sixth Imp|pg||
nt|sastro: wieder ein optimales Ergebnis für NS . , denn 4 Coeur ist schlagbar|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|glen: now if @C were 3-3, 12 tricks,  but the dbl sqz gets 12 tricks too|pg||
nt|sommer: hej Andreas:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|anton72: mm a litle starnge choose for clubs ...anyway let dontforget this guys is so young |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzyf: well done by south then|pg||
pc|h6|nt|400 volt: wenn @C 7 geordert wird, muss Wagner mit @S A stechen und @S 5 nachspielen, um den Kontrakt zu schlagen|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kingcur: making 5|pg||
nt|frankaus: good result|pg||
nt|kingcur: which should be worth an imp :)|pg||
nt|anton72: they are the future :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d back from south would have killed the @d entrys for -3?|pg||
nt|bobholl: S will get squeezed between @S and @D|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|glen: if E had a @H|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||

mb|d|nt|400 volt: ungewöhnlich, dass man eine 5er-länge gegen die 1SA-eröffnung gegenreizt|pg||
nt|400 volt: meine Wahl wäre hier Kontra gegen den 12-14 SA|pg||
nt|sastro: sieht für Alvensleben stark danach aus , dass Partner ebenfalls die Coeur hält|pg||
nt|santyclz: I seem to recall an old column by Reese in which he was faced with a 2-way finesse.  He solved the problem by leading the J of a suit in which he held the Q and observing LHO's ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: reaction.  He then led the suit in which he didn't have the Q and noticing a slight difference in the reaction finessed LHO for the Q.|pg||
nt|xenya: and it was made (with an overtrick) in OR|pg||
nt|andreasw:  quite the distrabution these hands have:) but there is allways one who has the boring one(balanced):).. 6@c /6@D needs the double @c finesse to win with a @S lead:)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes.. 1) @Slead from N is unlikely 2) THEN he needs doublefinesse..good!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4!N W now?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..I would have|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some play 4NT = minors and 4@h = minors but stronger|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe to good?.. would u raise to 6 with east hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: the Dutch defense on 11 in the OR was not as accurate as here -- 3N just made for 11 imps to Israel |pg||
mb|3S|nt|400 volt: gut, dass West Kontra als pass/correct zur Verfügung hat, so wird der @S-Fit gefunden|pg||
nt|400 volt: mal schauen, ob man 4@S findet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt kann ost evtl 3@s reizen?|pg||
nt|sastro: kontra zeigt Hand mit Bereitschaft in Pik. Hat Partner Coeurs soll er drin bleiben|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i could have been drunk this very wednesday on that account :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: understandably, gotard not happy to open 1@d, so 1nt the practical choice|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s 4-1 ,@h finess of -so probÃ¶ems in 4 @s|pg||
nt|runnerup:  problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: actually they have discussed their system in that sequence 20 minutes ago, hope both remember|pg||
nt|dimi: NS can make 2 @c, EW can make 2-3 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we had some similar problem yesterday, when one player complained his oponent took some short time to follow a single honor|pg||
nt|stc: yes, the winner must play better in the euros|pg||
nt|kingcur: 5@C a make for NS here, and they may bid it too|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S showing an opening hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2 d is transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  do you bid 2@c on east hand playing pairs?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D one too high may be but not probable|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @d game need impossible small @s lead to beat -so = or +1 in that|pg||
nt|xenya: but Netherlands Blue struck back on the very next hand...|pg||
nt|xenya: the other room went 1 down in 3N|pg||
mb|4D|nt|anton72: nothing artifical to this moment after opening ...|pg||
nt|dburn: then he is well above a minimum opening bid, at least in terms of his diamond holding|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and I dont like 1st hand 3@H with that hand...by the way|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!n now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad guesser as usual|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 3@D wird vermutlich eine Werte in @D zeigen mit einer guten Hand|pg||
nt|400 volt: (und natürlich die @S), da 3@C einen guten @H-Fit bestätigt|pg||
nt|sastro: ein gutes taktisches Gebot von Kasimir, das den C-Fit verdeckt|pg||
nt|400 volt: das ist für West natürlich ein Traumgebot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch erklärt dass ohne zwischenreizung 3@c jetzt maximum, 4er @c und kleines double in @c gezeigt hätte|pg||
nt|runnerup:  wd -now ew makes 9 in @s and ns 10 in @c |pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to defend with the N hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pachnie szlemikiem|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: gives N a better raise by 2@H, but still too weak for that|pg||
nt|xenya: is S worth a bid now?|pg||
nt|sommer: 3N - 4@D forcing! |pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D goes down 3nt makes|pg||
nt|bobholl: even if they make 4@H in other room its an imp (6 or 7)|pg||
nt|xenya: very aggressive barrage by EW|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzzx: e/w playing some funny defense where they pass some strong hands... perhaps west regrets that now|pg||
nt|santyclz: My partner and I used to have on our convention cards: "Opening leader's partner always hesitates at trick 1, even with a singleton."  |pg||
nt|runnerup:  a lucky 4 @h --not normal game ofcause but perhaps 3 @d +1 somehow now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4th from your longest berry (westra) always says|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Only impossible low @s lead will beat this contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: sehr diszipliniertes pass von rohowsky|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks in @h on a sqz @s/@c against N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drury|pg||
nt|kingcur: doubling 4@H showing interest to bid on, I expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: don't think S is good with wrong singleton and 3 small @h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  can u make this one?|pg||
nt|sommer: X could be ok from W, but didnt work here|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H says 5+ @H and 4+ @S -- but it's the other way round :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: yes its the other way around, also explained like that|pg||
nt|xenya: and W's 3@C rebid confirms he took it as 5 @Ss and 4 @Hs |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@c was alerted, so I think they have a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|dkkello:  V  came back in the game , nice dbl|pg||
nt|bobholl: time for zia lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Looks like this will just about get home|pg||
nt|golfsquash: this knocks out an entry but should be ok for 8 tricks, play on spades first|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably not|pg||
nt|anton72: and North hand is good enough for slam|pg||
nt|kingcur: with clubs behaving nicely, this should come in without problems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this looks like a steal for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  i booked 4 X !7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time east had 17 -did west know that? -i douth|pg||
nt|frankaus: not a fan of 5 minor contracts|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west migth feel some pain but should have it -1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzzx: seems to have reached a normal contract though... unlike the other room!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = nat or 4-fit 10-11 hcp  or  3-fit one round force|pg||
nt|xenya: alerted by both?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no only by E, the screen is E/S and W/N|pg||
nt|xenya: i see, thanks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: by far the best lead though|pg||
nt|dkkello:  nice lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: should East have done something here, like dbl on 3@s?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  difficult 3-3-3-4   |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Still carefull play is necesary|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D is an easy make if you play for @DQx(x) with E|pg||
pc|s2|nt|golfsquash: and a little respite for the Scots|pg||
nt|sastro: warom nicht Treff Dame ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: He could have opened 1@C and repeated 2@C, showing 15+ with 5+ @C|pg||
nt|luffe12:  @d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: dont know how that works but 2@C was explained as drury or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: as i mentioned earlier NL white is a team with quite unexperienced players. this is their first international tournament|pg||
nt|anton72: something went wrong :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Sout might have made some move in the direction of a slam, it is true|pg||
nt|anton72: ofcourse slam is too lucky|pg||
nt|anton72: Hi David|pg||
nt|gsper:  Everything is wrong. A couple off?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so a tough lead for Ida (W)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with correct defence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzzx: ah yes, right|pg||
nt|sybarra: this wont work out well,  @D's not behaving |pg||
nt|luffe12:  no chance whatsoever|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: but doubtless South has seen plenty of North's opening bids before|pg||
nt|anton72: yes ..they just missunderstood probably 2 NT is artifical|pg||
nt|friggi: what about @H7|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  nice start for the def|pg||
nt|friggi: good lead and now @H return|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dimi: Wagner needs 2 entries into the W hand to double finess in @h first to the 9 later to the J|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is 200 with normal defence ..in teams difficult to double|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't but at imps yes but with doubt|pg||
nt|andreasw:  E-W other table Dennis Bilde and Emil Jepsen.. as i understand this is the first day they play at this event|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: got his @d here|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow the 9th trick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: drury OR nat??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not a transfer to 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow, they have arrived at a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok -was fast over|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @H small @D would have been much easier|pg||
pc|c3|nt|golfsquash: could have tried @s10 at trick 1 but didn't really matter|pg||
nt|golfsquash: no, ignore that|pg||
nt|golfsquash: good duck, keep control|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: aeh 4er @h meinte ich|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben fragt nach @c9, antwort zeigt länge|pg||
nt|luffe12:  declarer should run the clubs immediately and hope for a miracle|pg||
nt|sommer: -1, it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: albeit a delicate one|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|stc: nice result from OR, wow !|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: i have a view on 5 minor ......... its like kissing your own sister .......... even when its right ............ its hard to get excited about it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: just -2 |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3rd/ 5th leads and through decl|pg||
nt|gsper:  Anybody know how many @C the opening showed?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  -1 might be a + board though|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gsper:  3+, Finnish kibs say|pg||
nt|bobholl: she starts very well|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|dimi: ok no finesse :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 10 tricks could have been made from double dummy, but Schanka playes safe, trying to postpone the @H guess|pg||
nt|gsper:  In a year or two it will be down to 2+|pg||
nt|xenya: @C ruff, draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|anton72: all finesses is on the way :)|pg||
nt|anton72: have a safety play|pg||
nt|anton72: if he guess where is a last heart|pg||
nt|anton72: K Cl ..diamond K ...all clubs and finessing E in Di|pg||
nt|anton72: bad is missing card in hearts|pg||
nt|anton72: 9|pg||
nt|xenya: N applies breaks with his @HQ wrongly placed |pg||
pc|d6|nt|dimi: know he might go down, @c to N and a @s back|pg||
nt|dimi: now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|anton72: W play Q J 8|pg||
nt|anton72: so he could be 4-th|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: hmmm |pg||
nt|luffe12:  careful now|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW plays 2+ already :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  The Finnish are supposed to be more true to ancient customs|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sommer: guess (very much) so|pg||
pc|s5|nt|anton72: if they not lead in NT 3-5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|uni_cicam: honors should be clear now, W will probably not bid 2D with onle @CK and @HQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: now rthe @D trick disappears also (on 4th @C)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like EW's defence against NS's 1@C roughly comes down to this: you pass with a balanced hand, no matter how strong, but bid on an unbalanced hand, no matter how weak |pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzyf: S shoukld not ruff now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tough hand for declarer|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|kingcur: No insult to the England U25 but it would be sad to lose this Israeli team after having been in the top ranks all tournament, and have shown us many hands of fine bridge|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4 flat boards in row|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|xenya: something you might do when bidding against a genuine stron 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think any bid shows either the next suit or the two above|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  declarer did not apply Rabbi's Rule  [when king is singleton, play the ace]  so 4@D down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still 3 imps to tie the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final contract  5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we'll never know if Piek 6@S good or bad   but it doesn't lose a lot against the game|pg||
nt|kingcur: so two off a good result for NS if the other room makes 5@C|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s here seems normal?|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW, sorry|pg||
nt|anton72: some goulash distribution |pg||
nt|friggi: this was as disasterous as possible|pg||
nt|andreasw:  gonna take a few lucky boards to win this one now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sorry for some flashbacks, but then people can see what happened|pg||
nt|xenya: looked like misunderstanding -- E took W's 3@C as artificial|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but south errs and lets them out for -1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h isn't home if north plays small @d when Q played --looking more carefully --but the fact that this made isn't good for ew|pg||
nt|kingcur: and EW have a part score to make as well|pg||
nt|kingcur: so, a potential swing for the Polish team|pg||
nt|andreasw:  As Traian mentioned before non of these team will be happy with a small win.. they both need big scores to progress unless top 4 "screws up":)|pg||
nt|bobholl: imo west could "see" this happening|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  results to date are http://www.camrosebridge.com/|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  currently England are in the lead with 134, Scotland are second with 121, Wales are third with 114|pg||
nt|cc469: on the last board, S is the hand that essentially makes slam a possibility - I think N's rebid of 4@H opposite the announced singleton with his p was quite proper but S should bid ...|pg||
nt|cc469: 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: weak 6/7 clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The SBU has 97 Ireland 91 and Northern Ireland 71|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only bad if Khanukov was going down in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  but 5 x @c from the start could have made life a bit more difficult for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: here we see the weak nt version of the polish 1@c|pg||
nt|bebechira: NL red is far far away.. lol so hard for them to..."screw up"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|golfsquash: the 4/4 fit may be better than the 5/4 fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hm sollte das ein alert sein? bin mir unsicher|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1sa zeigt 4er @s und 5er UF|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e.g. 1@d would have shown @h or @s+@c|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can make 3nt here -but hardly will be bidden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with only 42 boards to play|pg||
nt|dimi: @s from S was a bad  card|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he did not read parners signal in clubs as encouraging|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north did not want to overtake in case the lead was from Tx he said|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and he reminded partner of the low spotcards in dummy|pg||
nt|stc: not a lot, just 3 IMP|pg||
nt|stc: or 4 if only 5 made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5+@S   [Kaplan Inversion]   so why 2@S???|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west said he was thinking about bidding 6nt or even 7 because he expected 6@D to be void and he had aj... so he planed on some finesse |pg||
nt|kingcur: S bidding his 2-suiter...looks like Michaels, is that correct, Dennis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@h to play here, with INV+ van den Bos can make a cuebid|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: this does not seem as a openning hand to me Thomas :-)|pg||
nt|anton72: I think Siderov is enough agressive to observe and reach 6 He|pg||
nt|gsper:  The N hand is of a troublesome type. Suit weak for a jump rebid. They may have some gadget|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd23 the swedes are going down in 1nt ...so more swings|pg||
nt|bebechira: no flat boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: how many @D vulnarable ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 10-16 punkte|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: may not need the club guess playing in hearts with a club going on the long spade|pg||
nt|cc469: ... with controls in both side suits and a 5th @H to boot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sicherlich nicht die antwort die rohowsky befürchtet hat|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c starts relays|pg||
nt|stc: EW on the way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: according to the system, he could bid 2@S to show 54 with minor|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H is a better raise to @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: you mean 1@D by east?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so now N must bid atl 3@s|pg||
nt|friggi: what about 2NT|pg||
nt|gsper:  3NT rather|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: would everyone dbl with south?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Nt w a small @h|pg||
nt|xenya: double dummy, he could have made 4 by dropping @SK, then endplaying E in @Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c makes but hard to bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  who would not love to be in their position playing a tourny:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: This brings up a good  point.  When declarer has a long suit in 3nt which is probably running but leads another suit, he's often trying to "steal" his 9th trick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England - tough for Goodman-Pownall who played both sets in that match|pg||
nt|400 volt: der Trend geht allgemein dazu, Kontra als Stärkekontra erst ab 18 Punkten zu spielen, für Rohowsky aber offensichtlich nicht :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. kann in dieser sequenz auch 4@d5@c haben|pg||
nt|sastro: polnisch - 8-15  4er Pik und längere Minore|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: no, sorry, overcall by S, should be an openning hand as in previous board|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 14-16, 55xx|pg||
nt|stc: the trailing team recovered almost all, now a very close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so a slight upgrade but i think the hand is surely worth it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir can now bid 4@h rkcb or 4@d to sign off in 4@h i believe|pg||
nt|tomi2: did 2@H show hearts? or do they play some sort of transfers.  would find kjx in spades and some ruffing avalues the most important thing to show in this hand|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would not with minimum strength and not the slightest @S fit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  not mee either|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@h was a good bid|pg||
nt|gsper:  S may not like it much|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes as the play went, in fact seemed like a case for the spade Ace as safety in 3 spades |pg||
nt|xenya: bergen-like 3@C?|pg||
nt|xenya: invitational values with 4 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: or jump fit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: maybe 3@c shows @c + @s|pg||
nt|xenya: clubs and spades|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzzx: oh maybe 4@s is rkcb for @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate the leads from  4333's  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Slavinski leads for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fritsche played @H for no loser so made overtrick in 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: saves an imp|pg||
nt|stc: this IS FAIRPLAY from Smirnov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and implies 6@H would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in our room|pg||
nt|stc: in fact he expect AQ @s in W !|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1@h 3+@h, 2@c probably puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3NT missed here, 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|bebechira: and now is brd24 to come ...and may be the swedes will bid the grand for another swing|pg||
pc|hT|nt|golfsquash: This is the par contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: low = odd count with honor or even without|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS play the cuebid as other Major + @d |pg||
nt|kingcur: 10 imps away for NL white on  4, when they didnt reach a rather obvious 4@S vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in Holland many top pairs play Michaels with known suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so partner can judge better if bidding gets high quickly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, 2@H shows 3@S fit and 8-10 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: slam was reached at the other table on 14|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No but S was the one who started...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: after a 4@d overcall|pg||
nt|friggi: that is the difference|pg||
nt|friggi: between 4 and 5 overcall|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so what shows 4 NT |pg||
nt|gsper:  N would like to know that|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: clearly intended as 5-5 minors|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  we see that but not N i think|pg||
nt|friggi: yes but as well as stronger hands this|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: though the bidding looks very normal|pg||
nt|kingcur: for those who watched yesterday: Traian and I have a reputation for never presenting specs with flat boards :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Israel and Bulgaria White would be the candidates for the "screw ups"|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@h n-s is my guess:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H -3 probably duplicated in other room|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will they reach 6@D?|pg||
nt|kingcur: and with his hand, N will not care too much what South's minor will be|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sastro: meine Wahl wäre forcierende 2 Karo|pg||
nt|stc: 6@h is a complex contract(easy in DD)|pg||
nt|glen: well at least picking the "longest and strongest" from 4333 is easy|pg||
nt|glen: here though a @D lead would help declarer|pg||
nt|glen: (how to make 3 tricks with ATx opposite Q8x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = one round force|pg||
nt|anton72: 2 di is positive 8+points 5 +diamonds GF|pg||
nt|anton72: 3 sp ...values ...or just 4 he|pg||
nt|xenya: in either case, N is not excited|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@c just fit, not promising @c|pg||
nt|xenya: cute|pg||
nt|bobholl: pass or 2@D ?|pg||
nt|bebechira: 9 tricks here..|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H always easier (as now)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 easy tricks it seems|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes..same lead same play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzzx: fritsche freut sich, endlich mal einen unkontrierten kontrakt spielen zu dürfen|pg||
nt|runnerup:  needs some guesses to make  |pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope:) 1!N was my last guess though:)'|pg||
pc|d3|nt|golfsquash: shame it is going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: seems they have some science in action here|pg||
nt|dburn: probably owes partner a bit more than just 4@h|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may not consider his hand worth a move above game|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i would dbl with East, you want @s lead|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|bobholl: stayman will reach 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|runnerup:  candeclarer manitsh here .hardly .looks like -1/2|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|golfsquash: so much for the theory in the Majors|pg||
nt|sastro: der Ausspieler ist in 4 Farben geendspielt- wie soll er auf klein pik kommen|pg||
nt|luffe12:  he came off very well this time - but not much to do |pg||
nt|gsper:  Know nothing definite about the bidding, I would like @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: or should you really be afraid for @sA and 11 minors?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Mike knows that 6 Nt gors down but 7 in min could|pg||
nt|runnerup:  it is very challencing to find that suit even ..11 in @h no harm done going to 5-level|pg||
nt|kingcur: with heart ruffs in dummy and the @CK onside, this will produce 9 tricks, losing a trump, a heart and two diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: it's a good contract i think|pg||
nt|stc: in fact you discard @c on @d and must start @h in the good direction|pg||
nt|stc: of course it is|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N very awkward |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = 15+ HCP  5+@D|pg||
nt|dimi: nice|pg||
nt|stc: with friendly @s you could even make 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: looks like -2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well 2 diamonds looks normal, but perhaps doesn't want to play 2 spades, so an early pass|pg||
nt|dkkello:  difficult hand |pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: not laydown by any means but worth trying|pg||
nt|stc: the first @h is the key of the play|pg||
nt|dburn: but Siderov has taken the helm now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  system notes for Walsh-O'Gorman http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/WalshOGorman.pdf|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in board 4 east was in 5 @h xx -and played it -1 ..so bad day it can be -1600 or so -and a good day if you play for it +1600 ,now 400 out|pg||
nt|anton72: yes :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i do not believe they will bid 7@D:) but mb wrong|pg||
nt|luffe12:  smoth duck i @d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: any clue here as how to play trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: some misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|stc: and now samll @d from W, wd|pg||
nt|anton72: i told you ..he si enough smart and agressive :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but as we say "niemijer" does the job too|pg||
nt|santyclz: Stayman of the puppet variety forces them to 4@h.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|anton72: good job |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@d much better then 1NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: GIB gives only one card as a make... J clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|golfsquash: amazing result at the other table|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: DEclarer has to establish @C tricks soon, otherwise he will loose control because of bad @S break|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d to K and @D back looked like the only line that would make?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sastro: Karo war noch das beste, weil es die Kommunikation angreift|pg||
nt|dimi: if he tries to finesse in @d even 1NT is down|pg||
nt|anton72: may be the bid is not so theoreticaly good ....but is practical |pg||
nt|xenya: it seems EW's aggresiveness on the last hand backfired -- strictly speaking, 3N is down there (15)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stc: closest to your finger :)|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  heard an interesting analysis last weekend |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov explained 1NT as " I may pass with 12"|pg||
nt|luffe12:  as it is, 3nt still ok|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he must have smelled a rat|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he saw the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: probably :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that's why he smelled it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@D = any negative or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he already saw @CQ and knew west failed to bid positive holding at least one major|pg||
nt|bobholl: but gib sees 52 cards on a@H continuation not made i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess east thougth to signal ! witj  j|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to Rory Timlin|pg||
nt|xenya: but now it's makeable|pg||
nt|sommer: guess, this will go 2 down, despite -1 is possible|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board 5 could be a possible 17 swing?|pg||
nt|sommer: N had a strong pass, and does he look like the favorite to have @Dleangth?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  jxxx and QJ blanc.. is it not the same odds?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  jxxx or QJ blanc*|pg||
nt|sommer: it doesn't matter much, if Belgium bid and make 6@D. It's 17 imps instead of 15 for 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with @d xxx North might have dbled 1@D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|400 volt: das sieht nach einem Überstich aus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But i had dbl 6 Nt every day|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes duck is best|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobholl: s now makes up a distribution that lets 4@S make guess he finds none :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|400 volt: auf den hohen @C J (nach @C zur 9) kann Fritsche den @S-Verlierer abwerfen|pg||
nt|sastro: allerdings tendiere ich zu 1 C und nicht zum Kontra|pg||
nt|luffe12:  wd|pg||
nt|stc: very lucky, @c 5-2, Q@H on side|pg||
pc|cA|nt|golfsquash: Hi Julian|pg||
nt|stc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  still some avoidance work to be done|pg||
nt|luffe12:  low|pg||
nt|xenya: still it feels defence could have done better |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  [3@SX-2]  Rehder playing 2@S undoubled|pg||
nt|luffe12:  hard to imagine, how NS was kept away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 38 boards   218 imps    WOW|pg||
nt|sommer: the @Dfinesse is best now, because of the rule of "resricted choice"|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: restricted choice: south might have played @dJ of QJ, but has to play Q with Q bare|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: well it's not over yet, but as the cards lie declarer can hardly go wrong|pg||
nt|luffe12:  that leads from Kxxx are almost as costy as from KJxx|pg||
nt|luffe12:  or Jxx(x)|pg||
nt|glen: was that kit woolsey?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hint for robot tourney players: GIB never leads from Kxxx ;)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @S was clear ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he goes for the uptrick|pg||
nt|santyclz: The big question on this hand is can north arrange a "beer"?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: may be only 1 down now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes looks strongly -1|pg||
nt|bobholl: east knows 4@C but may be 3 @D and 4@S than he has to think too|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kingcur: N will lose two trump tricks but will hardly go wrong on the D's, making dummy high|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: E should have ducked another @S, Schanka should ruff the @D with K and return small @S to play safer|pg||
nt|friggi: agree |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  very strange bid bye S with 4 Nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 6 of @S @H k|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: playing his only chance, wd|pg||
nt|luffe12:  wd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|luffe12:  no - one of the voice commentaries here on BBO|pg||
nt|bobholl: he will i guess :) fun too !|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|friggi: yes|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm certain 2@D won't be the contract in the OR|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sastro: der SA _Überruf hat ihm verraten, dass West das as Blank haben muss|pg||
nt|stc: he can't, even with 4@c in E he would have no problem, only with 4 in W|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence still ahead it seems|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzyf: I am sure it will be 1NT, a tough contract with @SJ lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|luffe12:  NS has a fine set so far - and a bit of luck too|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: N asking?: why did you not bid 4@S"?|pg||

nt|anton72: sure|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: for both pairs 1@D promises long @D and an unbal hand. they open 1@C with most balanced outside their nt range|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sry, take it back, only for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and both other pairs from the von alvensleben team|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Fritsche is usually a fast player|pg||
nt|santyclz: Slawinski leads are sometimes called "combined leads".  A brief overview may be found at:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/SGlossary/GlossS.html|pg||
nt|dimi: yes he is|pg||

mb|p|nt|stc: very good in played by S, which would be the case|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1!N?|pg||
nt|anton72: they have a King of suits :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or 5Cx|pg||
nt|frankaus: E hand worth a poss IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  this is a coffee hand ..or looks so ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: on bd 13 south did get a @c lead, but East finessed with the 9 in the first trick for an extra overtrick|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 6@D looks more attractive but down on a @H lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: now they migth miss 6 even|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: problem of 4@d no room for North to show a positive noise|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 33 @D 22 3nt no problem at all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so east found a bid ..without that game would have been missed -now found -i assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 2@h zeigt, wenn ich mich recht entsinne, ein w2 in @s oder eine starke hand mit @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hard not to bid on with such a nice shapely hand in north|pg||
nt|xenya: that's a bit far-fetched :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe norths second double shows spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@c now a choice-of-games?|pg||
nt|xenya: or just cards (if he thinks he has that)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south may try 4 clubs I suppose|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT  - quick 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: siderov alerting 3@d as a transfer to 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: explaining that it probably shows both minors now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzzx: south: nowadays splinter shows 3 card fit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north "what else cani do"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south: lead of the ten?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west: single, Tx or HTx|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north: "probably single"|pg||
nt|luffe12:  strong values and lack of space: I like 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south: "yes, because I have the honors it looks like"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east:"oh thats nice"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right since 2@S would be non-force the only other choice was  DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW open 12-14 bal 1NT so the rebid shows the strong NT|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@h apparently shows 4@s too|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: it was not alerted...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe they dont want to investigate the fit after the double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW actually list this treatment on their convention card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all CCs zipped up and available under  http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/2343|pg||
nt|anton72: i feel in double dummy have a way for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|anton72: not 100 % sure|pg||
nt|anton72: what you think david|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  15-17 nt|pg||
pc|c5|nt|400 volt: auch dieses Vollspiel ist relativ normal - bei dem Trumpfstand in @S ist aber das Vollspiel in 3SA deutlich besser|pg||
nt|400 volt: Thomas Gotard jun. denkt auch darüber nach, ob er 3SA oder 4@S reizen soll|pg||
nt|glen: a typical hand that shows why partnership have a variety of raises for S hand, to help N make decisions if bidding gets high fast|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this 4@H C will only be a push i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c is 20-21 or any gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder's pass asks for a spade lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: theoretically it can be even 4@H-1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt is easier here than 4@H|pg||
nt|kingcur: N may have shown an unbalanced hand with 1S...then S should maybe convert to 2@C|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h looks an underbid|pg||
pc|cK|nt|luffe12:  is the X for penalty here - dont think so|pg||
nt|luffe12:  is disagree in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is "make the right decision pard" kind of X |pg||
nt|glen: some play X is penalty, some X is two-way values, some X as I want to bid 5@H but you decide|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but N should have done more here for sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh slam minded|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1NT 15-17 and will accept the invitation|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: easy 3NT here, time to get some drinks :-)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: It is likely that north's double is technically correct, but as he knows pard has 3 hearts why worry, just bid 2 hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: mixup|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult to for the defence to get this right vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3 possible games 3nt /4 @h and 5 @d all on|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 "aces" missing i guess |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: I think they have misunderstanding about 2@d. W alerted it, but E did not|pg||
pc|s7|nt|400 volt: das war die richtige Wahl|pg||
nt|stc: you need A@c on side and if not @d finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south has shown 14-16 with 1642 or 0643 shape|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s still some chance ..but others -with best defence hopeless --like this |pg||
nt|dimi: no X no trouble|pg||
nt|stc: something looks wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they do play 1@C-2@H 4-7hcp|pg||
nt|stc: Obviously w doesn't know about 4@s in E|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west took 2@H as 8-10 then|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, that's pretty obvious now|pg||
nt|dimi: yes that seems to be the explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: if i hear correctly vasilev explained 1NT a bit weaker (around 17)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|golfsquash: This is very thin|pg||
nt|golfsquash: west playing east for a better hand for change of suit after double|pg||
nt|sastro: das Single Karo ist fotographiert- da bietet sich 3 SA schon an|pg||
nt|sastro: 6 C ist ein ordentlicher Kontrakt, wird aber vorrausichtlich fallen, weil die Odds für Karoschnitt sprechen|pg||
nt|glen: best for N is to X first, then find out result, the claim X was a certain type of X|pg||
nt|luffe12:  5 looser hand by distribution - bid one more time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: that's a good tip glen, i'll keep it in mind :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i assume that NS use some kind of constructive major raises|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very tough to bid|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s was not good, 3NT is a disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks at the dummy and is kind of shoked, he obviously expected more :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "pfff"|pg||
nt|sommer: here 2N could have been at minimum just as good as 2@H|pg||
nt|sommer: but S was a little too weak to move 2@H to 2N ..I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  idk denmark needs to get something going soon(at this table):)|pg||
nt|sommer: as expected, b5 and 6 cost 27 imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: if you search GRONKVIST on WBF site 4 names coming up.. Ida,Mikael,Johan and Maria.. bridge is a family sport it seems|pg||
nt|kingcur: I wouldn't say South has enough to open SF...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agreed.|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@H with the trumps breaking -- but very tough to reach|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: yes the diamond 10 at trcick one gets declarer 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: ..sry, 4 and 5|pg||
nt|bobholl: no squeeze so 5 made i guess|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 9 cold|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i hate to caught with only 3-card support, when supposed to have 4 - but the N hand is just 6 loosers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually, i think 3@S would show 5+@S and @H fit, but agree key feature is short @D rather than long @S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  anybody familiar with Ron Klingers ideas on the rules of Loosers Count|pg||
nt|stc: trump looks best now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cc469: yes, he must ensure he is left with an entry in dummy to @Ds when that suit is established|pg||

pc|h8|nt|luffe12:  bergen raises would lead to 5@h i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: best you make sure you know what you are playing over interference|pg||
nt|luffe12:  S would bid 3@c rather than 2@h - promising 4card support|pg||
nt|glen: its a question whether to use a bergen raise on not: 4 trumps good, but quacks (queens/jacks) not good for playing the hand in a suit contract|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i fully support that - |pg||
nt|sybarra: it is only an 8 count of quacks, 3 @H was also a possibility  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play standard signals|pg||
nt|frankaus: not clear but gr8 switch|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir glaubt sogar 6-7 ... 4@h hätte minimum gezeigt|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|400 volt: In Board 4 hat Martin Rehder 4@H sehr gut gespielt - 9 verdiente IMPs|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead of a small club would probably beat 6@H but it's not easy to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: anyway or bid and made 6@h so von alvensleben team will reassert the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  noreal chance here |pg||
nt|kingcur: I am just informed that my co-commentator's mother is a woman I played bridge with in Sopot, Poland in the mid 80's. That's kind of cute, isn't it, andreas? :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sastro: schwierige Entscheidung, was man am Tisch auf die nächsten Karorunden abwerfen soll|pg||
nt|stc: not very convincing sequence, missing a good slam and 12 IMP|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but knowing prd to have xxxx might change the N approach|pg||
nt|stc: A pair in control of the system may stretch to 3@s and play there|pg||
nt|bobholl: claiming time|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzyf: that was in the open room, i mean|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stc: wd, 4@s was a good save|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south has a really nice 14-16 one must say|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, but if wests 2H shows a good raise, N should not be defending here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south unaware of the split tries a trump|pg||
mc|12|nt|stc: and here you can't score the 150 for 4 Aces|pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room found the reasonable 6@c on board 19, but didn't find a line to make it with the bad @c bread.  13 imps.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (break)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: what a freak here|pg||
nt|luffe12:  looking at running rate = 6 imps it does'nt matter too much, but why did E disc a @c|pg||
nt|dimi: ... he punished his partner|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like a "tilt" play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lost concentration|pg||
nt|stc: not good for the parftnership :(|pg||
nt|dimi: no|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 600 was really expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: wanted to correct him self but it was clear change of mind, he thougt dummys discard is irrelevant, after a short break while Fritsche was claiming he saw what he missed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@h the game to be in here|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@H looking like a good spot here, 3NT less so on a @C lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW discussing whether West should have bid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w 15 grulica WJ-ta - odwrotka wpêdzi³a w  szlemika|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: now we will see some action :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well south has a good hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: and some conplicated contracts, seems all suits are breaking porely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but 6 spades likely it seems|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 6@S or NT should easy to reach with 35 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Not a word from Brandsnes or the Norwegian coach|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Vasilev deserved some credit for that @c9 at the first trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  Likely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|friggi: sure|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1@c 12-14 nt or 18-19 or @c|pg||
nt|sommer: saw that now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board 13 was 9 imps for denmark.. Bilde making 9 tricks in 3!N (cards did lay good:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess the almost let them make 10 tricks anyway :):)|pg||
nt|santyclz: He showed 4@h and 6 hcp or so. With a good 6 card suit and side ace he owes  his pd a que, whether in their system 5@c or 5@d.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt=11-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rather maximum for that i think :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  6@s is laydown|pg||
nt|stc: Par is 4@dX -1 by EW|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 Cl again|pg||
nt|anton72: 16 +|pg||
nt|friggi: so he upgraded that hand:)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  N doubled 2 h - would he do that with 4 missing AK?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I am sure our excellent viewgraph may give us details|pg||
nt|runnerup:  you can make 3nt here -is it good -maybe not but makes |pg||
nt|kingcur: Sweden have a 13 VP lead over Israel, the current 3rd in the rankings. First four teams will qualify for the semi-finals that will start tomorrow|pg||
nt|bobholl: dificult hand with strong @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: opposite xxx QJxx Kxx xxx  he wants to play 4@H 3tricks extra|pg||
mb|1S|nt|luffe12:  110!|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: last board for the Open room|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would play Sys on and double here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can't give any details on why they defended 3@c instead of bidding their own game, i'm afraid :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 11 tricks :( diffucult to stay out of slam)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: need to be careful here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|stc: of course if you play slam on the same defense, the @d finesse is much better than the sqz, and you go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in fact the first imps for von alvensleben this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminded it was a full book   Ron Klinger "The Modern Losing Trick Count" Modern Bridge Series|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2 over 1 GF|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: still counting points :D|pg||
nt|gsper:  Primitive but easy to remember|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is just insane|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: interesting pass by Rosenthal|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: will surely bid later|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and distributional hands here --4 @s os 5 @d ..just maybe|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice ghestem hand :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sastro: 4er-C Unterstützung und double Treff können einen schon etwas optimistisch stimmen|pg||
nt|xenya: EW play an 11-13 1N -- hence 1@C|pg||
nt|kingcur: 11 in for Sweden as predicted, with the open pair bidding and making 7@C|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzzx: i think you all know what 2@c is by now ;)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@C asks if 11-13 really has 14?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so 6@h is more friendly for the specs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = inverted, one round forcing raise, not 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  seems well judged by S: I will have a second chance, to show strong playing values|pg||
nt|stc: very interesting this one !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no, no escort, but he was quite fast and at least we are ahead of the other room, so those boards are not available anywhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this match seems to have theme of finding 5-3 fit that has 5-0 break|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: szlemik nie byl taki zly kiery po 2 - 2 lub trafiony A kier singlowy |pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: lub J / 10 |pg||
nt|friggi: not good|pg||
nt|xenya: now 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 6@c can be made here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can they reach it?|pg||
mb|d|nt|tomi2: spade finesse not working, hearts are not coming in. 6n seems like the best spot, if you see you cant hold spades to 1 loser, you try the other suits|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sys on or @H?|pg||
nt|friggi: why not @S bid in N|pg||
nt|bobholl: for the lead 4@H but P can't lead them :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  When X might be slightly weeaker, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|xenya: a raise by N now would be weak, but perhaps not as weak as this|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just a quick key card check|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@S shows min, can be still 5|pg||
nt|tomi2: this won't be quick, he needs to find a fit first|pg||
nt|xenya: E had a choice between introducing @Ss and showing fit -- he opted for the latter |pg||
nt|andreasw:  7@s looks good but will problably go down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: norths double gives south a problem|pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 4@C i presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some pairs play DBL as GF now, so that it is easier to find out about slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but here South wants to bid NF|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I like the double |pg||
nt|runnerup:  nice press bid -so ns didn't have a chance so bid 3nt |pg||
nt|kingcur: 2NT showing @H support and invitational +, 3@C showing a minimum, I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: das 2@D-Gebot zeigt Fit in @H - entweder mit einer schwachen Hand oder Partieforcierend|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure they can get to 6 @S now |pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h shows either @c as 2nd suit or a 3352|pg||
nt|andreasw:  because of the @d split:)|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@S is very good|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i'm quite surprised that south did not bid 3@c over 2@c here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  you must admit.. it is easy to get to high|pg||
nt|sommer: ..4@D splinter and no aces?|pg||
nt|sommer: will lead to 6@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sporting x by north.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: W's jump to 3NT was reckless in my view - E might have minimum values and simply trying to protect the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: den kontrakt aus dem open room werden wir hier wohl nicht nochmal sehen|pg||
nt|sastro: so wie die Hand steht sind 3 SA das optimale. Aber wie soll man mit den unausgeglichenen Händen dort landen. Katastrophen sind hier vorprogrammiert|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h still makeable but now ???|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: 2@d slabe ze wzgledu na QJx @h 1!p imo zdecydowanie lepsze i ewnetulana x na wznowce |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w 16 znowu odwrotka w akcji|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: 1@s*|pg||
nt|anton72: 3 NT is logical choice|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure does, but maybe a pass now...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 3 @H off course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: risky x|pg||
nt|kingcur: by another Grönkvist, incidentally|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cc469: 2NT I could find a case for but not 3|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diesem Fall die starke Variante - jetzt muss Nord @D-Ausspiel finden. Da Süd 2@D (künstlich) nicht kontriert hat, spricht das für ihn vielleicht gegen @D-ausspiel|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the @d7 presumably shows an odd length... and as we know both 1 and 3 are odd...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Johan?|pg||
nt|bobholl: still no imps scored :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: bye all tu 4 ur company|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: thanks frank|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a lack of aces i think east should pass if 4@s was only a slam try|pg||
nt|bobholl: hope they have 6 aces now :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S will get X and i guess it will make |pg||
nt|bobholl: specially after @H lead :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south has a normal hand  -so he cant see any mystic in this ,but ,,4 @s looks unbeatable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: strange pass over 4@h by E. Should be some @s support with passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: I go for 11 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|golfsquash: 1Nt beatable|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: what now? 4NT would be quantitative only I guess|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south can bid 4 clubs ok|pg||
nt|tomi2: mabw 5nt pick-a-slam?|pg||
nt|dburn: trusting East not to have psyched, or maybe unable to bid spades naturally anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: although 2@s ought to be natural over 2@d|pg||
nt|dburn: just in case East is one of the ungodly|pg||
nt|anton72: i think 2 sp over 2 di is not natural|pg||
nt|xenya: i think S is likely to lead a @D, not a @H|pg||
nt|kingcur: Johan, the father|pg||
pc|s8|nt|golfsquash: They are playing strong NT|pg||
nt|luffe12:  wd all|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@C= any invit, does not promise clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west did not expect this beeing passed out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east forgot the system|pg||
nt|dimi: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the thought 2@C was pass/correct|pg||
nt|baldfriede: These are probably the seeds of mistrust from previous hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: playing 80 boards yesterday was hard, the night was short|pg||
nt|anton72: in their agreements|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h dbled...this will make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: although the trumps break badly this contract may roll home|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: overtrick even|pg||
nt|bebechira: the overtrick will increase the size of the....swing|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure what S was expecting of 2@S, but he has very little in defense himself|pg||
nt|bobholl: wollff signoff in action ?|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting hand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|stc: as spec notices on same defense you should finesse the 10@c to make, yes|pg||
nt|stc: after a small @c lead would be different|pg||
nt|glen: W has tried his hardest to stay out of slam (opening 11-13 1NT with 14, not accepting slam try 4@D)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  top spot|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both sides|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT by W goes down on a @h lead but played by E has much better chances |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: all players discussing, south "lets play, it will not be down 6 times now, i am pretty sure"|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, nice bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good call|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: might be also a grand slamr try id N has a very good hand such as @S AKJxx and @D A|pg||
nt|xenya: N didn't support hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: still a good lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|400 volt: jetzt wird Rohowsky keine Probleme mit dem Kontrakt mehr bekommen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N gets a chance to trump a @H in dummy he has a chance to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs W to play trump when in with @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you've watched NS play before   you KNEW Piek would bid 3@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: *3532|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if east bids 6 now i would raise for sure on W hand (if 4@s is weak which defently looks like an underbid to me):)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5@d cuebid or?|pg||
nt|sommer: it's a good idea to play 4@S weak and 0 aces (keycards)..then even this weak hand COULD splinter 4@D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well no stopping this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: siderov playing the 7 here clever play|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: south doesn't know who has the 3. North could have led from 53 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done and a lucky @H t position|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it looked like it until the last bid.|pg||
nt|bobholl: in original wolff signoff this is a slam try with @C :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  why bid again -when you find the way to stay in 3 @d |pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzzx: looks like they are going overboard here thanks to north opening his 8-count|pg||
nt|stc: loosing control|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: of course, north in the open room had it much easier after west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but i'm sure günther in his wildest dreams would not have thought of opening 1@h :)|pg||
nt|stc: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 2nd/4th   that means  from worthless doubleton lead LOW|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: teraz to juz szlemika powinni zagrac :) ale 4!t Andrzeja bardzo celne |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zgadzam siê z Tob¹ Kuba, ale teraz chyba ³atwie dolicytowaæ szlemika bêdzie|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: what will happen with this one on a spade lead?|pg||
nt|kingcur: plus he has alerted the foul trump break to declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|golfsquash: and 2@s beatable but difficult|pg||
nt|glen: finally forced to admit holds @H Q|pg||
nt|dimi: anyway 2@c seems to be a good contract, while 3NT is not a make i think|pg||
nt|sommer: not surprincingly, E WANTS a slam:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this might lead to 7|pg||
nt|bobholl: good players often do such things and it works :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|stc: you can make 4@h played on @s but not on @d|pg||
nt|tomi2: i think this is the convention, that made me score / avoid lose most imps at all. if i was allowed to play only one convention, i would kick blackwood and stayman and keep 5nt=pick ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: a slam :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it should be - if 2@d is forcing to game, no need for 2@s to be artificial over it|pg||
nt|gsper:  If 1@H was an ordinary oercall, |pg||
nt|gsper:  Many would pass|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes north can either bid 4 @c or double both looks nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: if south bids @s you can go back to @d, so dbl is good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  double better in case partner supraises and bids 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: that's what you really hope for yes|pg||
nt|dkkello:  South will be disapointet board 13 was 1 imp away  ..  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: he doesn't know (yet) :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Because you're young!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@c was a puppet to 3@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kingcur: it looks very much like Tim Verbeek having learned all the relays by heart: as I said earlier, E is not Berend vd Bos' regular partner|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: anyway, well bid by NS, do we have the bidding from the other table?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..so after ....2@S - 3@S, you promise 1+ keycard!|pg||
nt|sommer: I dont think, E can expect to get rid of all W's @Hlosers...so 6@S..pls:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east should just lay himself in 6@s because of the Ax in @h yes:)|pg||
nt|sommer: p signed off twice...|pg||
nt|bobholl: welcome to cornelia roder |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: @d to K and @h now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ryskiel_: eeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Igor nie doceni³ cue bidu kier partnera|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: chyba mu sie A schowal ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4 obvious losers and a possible @d ruff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|golfsquash: not beating it now|pg||
nt|stc: 1@h, 1@d, 1@c to loose|pg||
nt|kingcur: but despite the relaying, not landing at the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in a more natural system do you bid 1@s or 2@d on pds 1@h bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Tim Verbeek plays the same relay with his regular partner Danny Molenaar|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results: www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e trema - w koñcu to ich debiut w takiej rangi imprezie|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no running scores|pg||
nt|anton72: 2 Di is GF|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 4@H looks quite reasonable -- but not easy to play on this layout|pg||
nt|stc: I think you can try @s first, then @d if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@H, i fear is doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|glen: and after all of W's efforts to stay out of slam, E bids the grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes the ace of trumps is useful|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i suspect gro meant 4nt as exclusion keycard, rehder misunderstood|pg||
nt|dburn: and although there are fewer people around than there used to be who played a non-vul 1@s overcall of a strong club to show 13 cards, the breed has not entirely died out|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Siderov shaking his head|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: and talking why i didnt passed 3 NT ? :)|pg||
nt|anton72: with 3-2 trumps 5 diamonds have some play|pg||
nt|anton72: with expectable spade lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  and now claim :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i get this hands like one every 900 boards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sign-off to 5@d is a lack of @c-cue|pg||
nt|sommer: it's a rare hand for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sign-off to 5@s i mean|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and south has his work cut out here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: No, just finesse twice in @s|pg||
nt|stc: for 5@h+4@s+2@d = 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: declarer's shape is known exactly from the bidding, so the defense will hardly go wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: why, yes, of course:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder thinking, not schüller|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: meanwhile the imps start to roll in for the jamm team, 6 on  35|pg||
nt|jaapfr: about what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i don't know should i ask him? ;)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HTQ already played?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now schüller is thinking...|pg||
nt|stc: now even 2¨ds|pg||
nt|stc: 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl: "thats probably good news" after n showed out|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well after the 5@d bid followed by 5!n 6@d could be @d Q or?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  managed to stop:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|glen: i think you are correct Michael, about 4NT as exclusion|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. was out of pass cards so had to use a double instead|pg||
nt|glen: for some expect partnerships, splinter then 4NT is exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  exclusion is tell me your aces outside of @D |pg||
nt|glen: *for some expert|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ;)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 25 was flat.. :(  but in 26 we will have a swing because the poles are in 4s E|pg||
nt|kingcur: meanwhile we're sorry to have to announce the first flat board of today:  25 was 1NT bid and made at both tables|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well when oppo bid a game freely, I East reluctantly not going slaming, x seems optimistic|pg||
nt|kingcur: sorry, 2@H-1|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow this will cost  1 or 2 imps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cc469: I'm referring of course to the previous hand|pg||
nt|stc: It is an interesting question : where the line between fairplay and "team interest" ?|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't think he can manage this with the cards as they are|pg||
nt|anton72: 10 from dummy ...3 trumps ...and 3 rounds of spades discarding 3 hearts|pg||
nt|anton72: but trump is 4-1 |pg||
nt|anton72: yes ...only with 3-2 trumps |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could make it if the heart ace were onside also - it isn't the worst contract in the world|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3NT would certainly have been a better one|pg||
nt|dburn: and Siderov probably should have passed it, although you can see why he thought Vasilev might have a club fit|pg||
nt|anton72: yes ...trumps lay bad ...and A he is offside ...3nt is easy 9+ tricks ...depending on lead|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a fairly extreme example of the notion that you can't go down if you don't play a card|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: but u also wouldnt make it |pg||
nt|dburn: I can't see a way - maybe GIB can|pg||
nt|anton72: m no|pg||
nt|anton72: i checked already |pg||
nt|anton72: just kiding david|pg||
nt|bobholl: even after J@C only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|stc: he will make, when seeing the @d, will be force to play on @s finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has the @c6 prepared...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better not think too long then:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the thinking suggests he has @CKJ6 imo|pg||
nt|stc: this may be the match ball|pg||
nt|bobholl: when east comes in with @C K difficult guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board 14 looks like an imp for denmark playing 2@h and making 9|pg||
nt|andreasw:  bilde also misguessed the @c as i understand:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will N play the Q?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if small even down 2 looming|pg||
nt|kingcur: but flat board nonetheless|pg||
nt|bobholl: how many ups guess 1|pg||
pc|c7|nt|stc: fairplay would say -4, strict rules -6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no they are discussing this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: -6 was clear for all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the heart has intentionally been played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S certainly tried to keep the kettle boiling for some psychological advantage with his remark|pg||
nt|dimi: well this really a tight match ... difficult situation for "fairplay" whatever this is in such a case|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: or at least something very similar|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kingcur: I'd bid 1@S, since 2@D invites pd to go over 3N with a fitting hand; and you're not strong enough to show @S in a reverse bid with this hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S-2@H-2@S-3@C-3@D-3@S-4@S-5@S-6@D-6@S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|luffe12:  ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sry, miscl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Piek 3@C bid certainly made things difficult for East|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kingcur: declarer has a choice to make now....double seems only "plausible" with a 5-0 trump split, not?|pg||
nt|bebechira: the queen of clubs must be in North..|pg||
nt|kingcur: many specs telling that Ida is sure they are 5-0, including dad Grönkvist|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes declarer may be worried just now, but will ok at end of the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: cash 2@c now and play a @s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stc: defense doing the job for him|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead helped a lot. Did E know S had the @S suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Rohowsky simply wanted not to spend to much time discussing about east-west system in a 2@C contract|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: nothing was known about s hand, only relayed|pg||
nt|friggi: why not ruff @C first just incase|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzzx: west forcing declarer to guess whether to play on spades 3-3 or on diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E rescues N:(|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: now -2 |pg||
nt|adonis18:  why double 3 nt when you don't know what to do with 4 @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: spade continuations and @h9 is the 3rd undertrick|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzyf: maybe if defence play @c, then decl can go wrong|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: @H return can never win something imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gromöller says he expected @dJ from @dJ73|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would it make a diffrent if you had 15 insted?|pg||
nt|bebechira: swedem has a healty lead half-way|pg||
nt|bebechira: sweden|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6 for sweden on  26, the Polish pair one off in 4@S where the Swedish bid and made 3@S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzzx: yes i was right about the misunderstanding|pg||
nt|glen: -2 good, E goes "hey, slam wasn't making either"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 5@c showed 1 or 4 keycards and gro thought it was exclusion so must be @hA|pg||
nt|sommer: now just discard @H on @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: not only difficult but important too|pg||
nt|kingcur: now can discard clubs whenever S ruffs high|pg||
nt|kingcur: and can repeat this with @HA as entry|pg||
nt|kingcur: the thorough way to make S regret his double|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...cuel|pg||
nt|bebechira: cruel|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|stc: assume a @c defense, dec will pull trumps, finesse once in @s, play @d and go back to @s...I think you are forced to find the right solution|pg||
nt|xenya: i think S is marked with @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: if S did not ruff, W has to guess how to play. @d is woring (trumppromotion) @cA is ok|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|d3|nt|dkkello:  S i s the man of the match ? but the all do fine (for sure better than I had done)  maybe|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: declarer claimed:|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "I pull trump and discard on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: this time its the fairplay case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he claimed before dia was lead|pg||
nt|kingcur: @HQ, @H to ace and @CK now, probably|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzzx: NS let the claim through|pg||
nt|dimi: poor EW they have to recover and forget about the last boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west was cut of his spade winner and if he really pulled the trump he would be in dummy then|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: declarer can draw trumps for +1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: may be more than one down now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dkkello:  their will be bridge in the future!!  hope so  :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: good 9 of @D in case @D 41|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dkkello:  they all  ...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|anton72: 3 is minimum |pg||

pc|dT|nt|anton72: 2 down |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: E led the @S2 -- could it be from a doubleton?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bebechira: well done|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|stc: as I said it is not @s OR @d, you have time to combine and the single @d gives you the solution|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwile, the Dutch have extended their lead when NS bid 3N in OR, going 1 down |pg||

nt|stc: wow, why comenting I missed the play...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator job much harder than being player, nicht wahr??|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  38  [4@S-2]  Rohowsky playing 3N West!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: heavy 1@h-opening at the other table|pg||
nt|kingcur: not likely, andreas...I play reverses in answering hand a rock solid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakie +1 to nie umia³ wziac 13?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: claimed 1 trick for EW|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: there was another bid between 6@D and 6@S, guess which :)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  the double of 3 nt cost 8 imp!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: vdBos not happy that vLankveld didn't cash the @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but declarer had no entry as the @d were blocked|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some discussion what would happen with @h lead on bd 8|pg||
nt|xenya: the only lead to beat it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defending 4 spades not so easy either though|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: south not so happy with the dbl on 3@h if i understand correctly|pg||
nt|kingcur: and of course the vicious smile at S: don't double me dude ;-)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Bob :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry all have to leave tya|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks, Bob, bye.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north opened and got no tricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: would open N hand only if playing canape :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: back to bidding, I wonder if transfer then bid of @H's would have worked better |pg||
nt|dkkello:  what ells could he bid?  |pg||
nt|bobholl: good 4@H but down on @D lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|golfsquash: 1 Imp to Ireland, as 1NT survived in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3NT?|pg||
nt|kingcur: meanwhile  27 was also flat in 1@S with 3 overtricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: and that's an obvious lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this should be flat:)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in 23 other table in hopeless slam (-1)ew so 7 to Czech's|pg||
nt|xenya: but the last board likely very good for Israel|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzzx: @s2 lead showed odd with honor or even without honor|pg||
nt|stc: 8 dangerous boards for them|pg||
nt|xenya: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I am sure west is much to polite for these tatics|pg||
mb|3S|nt|400 volt: hier zeigt 2@H auch wieder eine @S-Hebung, 4-8 Punkte in diesem Fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ns play 5-card majors, btw|pg||
nt|jaapfr: does he get away with that excuse:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: for gromöller-rehder 1@h would be systematic on the s cards|pg||
nt|runnerup:  8 tricks in nt but not so easy to stop below game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C shows biggest difference between NS Baltic Club and Polish Club|pg||
nt|stc: in other sports they will take a timeout|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Online players would, of course, both make and accept that claim.)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in the 6NT board Felmy - Khanukov had some strange auction leading to the 4-2 fit in spades and an overtrick..|pg||
nt|stc: many online players reject very obvious claims !!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!n on N hand will go down but on souths it could make|pg||
nt|dkkello:  an option .. I must agree|pg||
nt|bobholl: less obvious now but will switch after @C lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Another feather light opening bid.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is a borderline 6 @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyf: EW had a free run to the comfortable 2@s in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: the best lead against a splinter bid is usually trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: trump lead an overtrick here|pg||
nt|bobholl: but after the double and having 5@C yourself it isn't|pg||
nt|chick: this might be an exception since it's fairly clear that N won't have to ruff too many clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: if dummy has another 5 card suit you better set up your tricks for the defense|pg||
mb|4H|nt|golfsquash: I'm told that north and west are regular partners!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they find 4@S?|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6 more imps to NL Red, with 4@S receiving a double and making +1 in other room on  6|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h forcing, but not yet GF|pg||
nt|sommer: still makeable after just 1 round @S..then @DAK and ruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no running scores, standings on http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ + competitie + White House Juniors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board 15 4@h is declared by East insted of W and did not get the free @S guess in lead.. insted he got a @d lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: but can guess @S and @H and lose only 1 imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: don't think Nab should pass here, but bid 2@s as at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: with spades breaking, this will cruise home|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so indeed it could be either @s32 or @sQ32|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: h+minor|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 1/2  @h  here   ..|pg||
nt|xenya: W has a huge hand, but no clear fits|pg||
nt|xenya: E rather|pg||
mb|4N|nt|400 volt: 4@S sind in dieser Hand erfüllbar, ob man sie aber reizen sollte, ist fraglich|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@H zeigt vermutlich fit und 2@S könnte dann ein Versuchsgebot sein|pg||
nt|400 volt: ohne Fit spielen viele, dass nach Kontra das 2@H nicht mehr erzwungen wird|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Polish Club uses Precision 2@C opener with 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/1S|pg||
nt|stc: you mean !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget 6 -- get to 4@S first :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: they might get too high after 2@H GF|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: on the other hand, 4@H can be made after other than @D lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in 15 ew really bid to 4 @h and it was made ,,contract is some 10 % maybe and can be baeten ,,but it was made and here 3 @s should have been -200 was 140 so 11 in|pg||
nt|kingcur: I am told Ida is a sweet girl but a cruel bridge player|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland was 6th before this match...they needed a close result|pg||
nt|chick: so you're predicting the @CA then the @DK?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but ..... always easier if you see 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but trump lead usually cuts the ruffs and doesn't give away a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: wenn thomas jetzt aufkontriert, könnte das teuer werden|pg||
nt|santyclz: And then they wonder why no one wants them at their table...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  this time V will lead from EKxxx if 3 NT   ..|pg||
nt|runnerup:  first you open ligth then you have to rd .,who knows who has strength nowadays|pg||
nt|xenya: so perhaps pass is prudent|pg||
nt|xenya: but no...|pg||
mb|5S|nt|golfsquash: a heavy 1NT, so might have bid a spade on the way|pg||
nt|stc: but would W  return @s if starting with KQxx ?|pg||
nt|stc: fortunately the choosed the good 4-2 suit, @s and not @h|pg||
nt|anton72: dbl is 3 card supp |pg||
nt|anton72: and good decison by Vassilev to pass of 3 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@s more interesting|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so a nice a weak 2@d  did a good job here|pg||
nt|gsper:  On this lead 9 tricks are fairly easy, but I don't see a tenth|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: what would 4@d by West have been instead of 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can they reach 4@h if E has 3/4 @hs?|pg||
nt|friggi: sure|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  agood raise to 4@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@h is Natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  sry - was interrupted by a Bridgemate Control problem..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 33 minutes left|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@D wd probably be nf for EW after 1@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks available on this lead -- but perhaps he will play it safely...|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cc469: I wonder why 1NT and not 2NT with 11 points ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely not really...|pg||
nt|sommer: with @Clead from W vs 3N, E may shift to @S8 after @CQ...|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is not all that silly here|pg||
nt|bebechira: proabably South had a look at the sweet girl in West and said: I will double... and now probably he does not feel she is very sweet|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: i think one of the most valuable quality of a top bridge player is to forget about every bad board at once after it was played|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Declarer has to ruff 3rd spade, cross to the @DA and play @SJ discarding anothe @D looser. |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@d makes, so passing out 2@s seems a bit passive|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a decent @s suit here and pd prob promised at least Hx in @s .. not long from a 3@s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: good question|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so I missed all the entertainement|pg||
nt|anton72: Siderov may be is a bit scared after 5 diamonds |pg||
nt|xenya: like this...|pg||
nt|runnerup:  like here ew make 3 @s easily and ns -1 or 2-  in 3 @h|pg||
nt|santyclz: If he gets out for -1 he gains an imp.  Maybe they know something we don't.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  3@D Stayman really helps|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s is not bad and makes, both options, @s/@d finesse are good|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@H try if P has 1@H :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|stc: and risking to offer a fast @c discard ?|pg||
nt|stc: this is one of the points where professional players are much better then non-profi experts|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van den Bos when he put down his dummy: 'I hope I don't have too much :)'|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: but still one more looser to go, sorry 4 trick to EW|pg||
nt|xenya: but not easy to reach, and 3N is, of course, quite normal|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Just love bridge when I can see all cards , so easy    :)    |pg||
pc|cK|nt|cc469: I think I would have not bid @Ss with 4333 shape and 4 weak @Ss|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But u have to have a better and longer suit for that|pg||
pc|c8|nt|400 volt: am anderen Tisch wurde west in 2@D kontriert.Udo Kasimir muss sich anstrengen, um den Verlust auf 2 IMPs zu beschränken|pg||
nt|stc: a desperate 7@d ?|pg||
nt|stc: the only grand you can make is 7@s BY NORTH !|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be disappointed if they reached 7 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @HQ is wasted value|pg||
nt|gsper:  There is a case for bidding 2@H as W, but it is rather hair-raising|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still it is to late now if N takesK|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|frankaus: declarer shows 2 suits lead trump is a fine method|pg||
nt|kingcur: a bit unlucky for EW in the other room to be stuck in 1@H: especially with opps NV, a hand with a short suit almost assures competitive bidding, after which you could show your ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: strength in rebound...not this time though|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sastro: Denke mal , dass 2 Pik den 4-4 Fit vorschlägt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben is out of pass cards|pg||
nt|stc: and of course 7NT|pg||
nt|stc: still loking for 7 on the Q@s ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stc: if you are in 7@s lightner Xed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: forgetting a bad board is easier said than done|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e-w are pure amateur players. n-s are at least experienced players in the international bridge scene|pg||
pc|hA|nt|400 volt: ich bin verwundert, dass Nord mit XX nicht gute @D gezeigt hat (falls verfügbar)|pg||
nt|400 volt: Süd hätte wohl nicht gepasst mit seiner Hand, aber 2@D ist tatsächlich erfüllbar von N/S|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: an elaborate system like theirs should stop them from getting to a grand like this|pg||
nt|stc: looks like the first natural bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a @d back frmo the K now should beat this|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 6@S is only on @S 32 so 68% :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: extra chance in @S J sec compensates for @C 62 :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  even a bit better if no ruffs -because J -sing will do|pg||
nt|xenya: N has hit on a good lead -- slam now looks pretty hopeless and may well go 2 off|pg||
pc|hK|nt|stc: indeed, fair enough|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: i believe using normal responses to RKC after showing 0-4 hcp  is silly|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  no their style is good hands in that position bye W|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  by W"|pg||
nt|sommer: ..my remarc was to Andreas' suggestion about "best in S":)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can take a @h ruff and have 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed 8 tricks for 1 imp|pg||
nt|bobholl: the weak NT could have cost a lot on a @D lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|baldfriede: especially when opps rub it in, like Rohowsky did|pg||
nt|stc: he has to finesse here|pg||
nt|dimi: some kibs told me that they even forget about a bad board during playing it ... well :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Smirnov are the only two German (male) players who regullary play professional. Auken- von Arnim are the other professional pair we have|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4th toilet break for Matthias|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze werden sich wundern, warum Thomas Gotard seine Hand mit 12 Punkten nicht eröffnet hat. Das liegt an der sehr ausgeglichenen Verteilung und den wenigen Mittelkarten, ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: sodass sie für ihn nicht 12 Punkte wert war|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stc: so 6@d for -3 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north has shown 14-16, 2452 shape, two keycards and no @dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 38   3N made   i would have bet that both rooms would play 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT made in OR and now 32 with 10 results tom compare and a potential swing for the leading team(5@H-1)|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW picked their 4-4 @S fit here, the only denomination to have a chance at 10 tricks for game|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again north might get the chance to play a @d back again:)|pg||
nt|xenya: just making |pg||
nt|runnerup:  one of those under ace -leads but very wise one -south has bid nt so it hardly costs|pg||
nt|bobholl: a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: declarer better could have ducked @d 1 round in case of 5-2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: NS use 2@C to show weak hand with 5+@H and 5+ other suit    [except in ACBL events]|pg||
nt|luffe12:  do u agree on pass by W? Never in a lifetime|pg||
nt|stc: JAMM can start packing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please stay in your seats until match comes to complete stop|pg||
nt|stc: one line of play : AK@s, run @c, finess @ds|pg||
nt|sommer: ..it looks fine i N too:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|anton72: norwegians in other room skip some A ...play 7 @h|pg||
nt|anton72: in board 6|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: will try a showup squeeze i suspect|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, there's still a chance to go right|pg||
nt|kingcur: but not at all easy for S|pg||
nt|chmitty: would still make 10 tricks if he decides @s 4-1|pg||
nt|bebechira: and W plays 6h not doubled on 28|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzzx: now they were playing way too fast for my computer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer, with discards to find trys the spade hook|pg||
nt|kingcur: running the trumps will squeeze S for the 11th trick|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: did he really play that way?|pg||
nt|stc: +2 looks a bit too much|pg||
nt|xenya: i guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they played the board in 30 secs, i cant only click like one time in 3sec because of the connection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good bidding from Khanukov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is best line    without looking at NS hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: so on this board we had 4h dbled and 6h not dbled lol|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|stc: Yes, the doctors had very, very good results for non profis|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|stc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Wagner claimed he will score all tricks expect of one but he thought this would lead to just made, he miscounted tricks|pg||
nt|stc: As far as I know von Arnim is not a full time profi (school teacher ?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems  play for @S 32   and something good in @C or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2nd trump then @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: Probably -1 if he leads the 1st @hs from s, -2 if from n.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kingcur: now @C in N...he can see the @D switch|pg||
nt|frankaus: neded N win @C and push @D|pg||
nt|kingcur: last chance now|pg||
nt|frankaus: too late i think|pg||
nt|kingcur: a warm welcome to Pierre Schmidt as well|pg||
nt|kingcur: well, we need swings, don't we Traian? :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|stc: I think this is the best line|pg||
nt|chmitty: hi all :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|anton72: no tempo for clubs|pg||
nt|anton72: one down|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cc469: as a passed hand 2NT would be a perfect descriptor of hand value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pitching @D from dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: then trump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gsper:  He tried to make it, with deplorable consequences|pg||
pc|d6|nt|golfsquash: I suggest no-1@c-1@s-1NT-2NT-3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this is less nice :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|stc: combines Qx in @S with @C 3-3 and last hope @d hook|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is a big one|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: hmm  i need more time to think about play from dummy|pg||

nt|400 volt: und erneut 11 IMPs für das Team Alvensleben|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: toilet break for E...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we have two td here in Bad Honnef, one is sitting silently the other will assign penalties at the end of the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Leif  when do you think Schlicker should bid?|pg||
nt|dimi: i think ortwin needs a break|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: before the round Gromöller and Rohowsky were discussing because neither of them wanted to play, both felt tired|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can EW reach slam here?|pg||
nt|frankaus: last comming up tu all 4 ur company|pg||
nt|kingcur: with another chance on more, since 6@C looks very good here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and sadly -3|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: -3 will teach S that you need some HCP to make a game :) having a @S shortness is a defect of the hand to show GF agains 11|pg||
nt|anton72: last board here |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: ok last board now|pg||
nt|sommer: dK must forget this match quickly... looks like 2 MP..Belgium have had 25 for a while|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is so sad:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: ok last board for today now|pg||
nt|dkkello:  closing time |pg||
nt|kingcur: final board of this session now, and a very good one it was for Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Poland was allowed to play 4@c on this one, but i think 4@h will make for NS|pg||
nt|bebechira: the swedes missed 4h here|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree dennis but no difference|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board 15 dennis misguessed the @s and are now down one|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: I would bid 1@S if my hand looks suitable for a suit contract but this balanced hand looks NT oriented|pg||
nt|400 volt: Hier geht es im Kampf und den Teilkontrakt. Theoretisch kann Ost/West 4@H erfüllen, wird es aber wohl nicht reizen, aber 3@D oder 3@H könnte schon erreicht werden |pg||
nt|400 volt: Nord sollte maximal bis 2@S mithalten, was auch schon Probleme bereitet |pg||
nt|stc: almost 4@s here ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: something strange happened here in other room ... seems thay had a misunderstanding about the number of keycards|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: therefore, 1NT forcing might be a good alternative. 1S-1NT-2D(shows 11-14)-3H-p|pg||
nt|friggi: Finland needed som IMPs:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes thanks everyone|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very pour slam made in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: looks like a phantom save in OR|pg||
nt|glen: (no idea why N played @S Q, but perhaps though E was ready to play the T)|pg||
nt|thetaker: but North will bid @S now |pg||
nt|andreasw:  is this 10 board matches?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: unlucky missfit, but 2 hearts game force optimistic|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Germany take the least as Scotland go -2 in 4 spades x|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@d bid should lead N-s to 3!N|pg||
mb|1S|nt|golfsquash: will sail into 6@c|pg||
nt|400 volt: Nach @D K wäre es von Kasimir erfolgreicher gewesen, wenn er einfach Trumpf spielt - West muss dann @D in D10 spielen oder die @S|pg||
nt|stc: It's sad that EW are losing IMP's on such incidents...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after this round the von Alvensleben team might have similar problems |pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT version of multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 board per match|pg||
nt|chmitty: 5 matches today|pg||
nt|chmitty: the field has been divided into 6 teams "sections" for the first day|pg||
nt|kingcur: and if they bring in 6@C here, NL Red will be close to a max result in their first match of today|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: they probably win some more on this one|pg||
nt|friggi: not sure yeat|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a new chance for Finland|pg||
nt|kingcur: seems so, yes|pg||
nt|kingcur: and then 5@C a good save|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or rather might lead them to 3!n*:)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|xenya: and now E can pass? :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x106s6_leonard-cohen-closing-time_music|pg||
nt|bobholl: would consider 1NT too but imo the hand is to ace rich|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: if kasimir were a solid citizen, jokisch might well bid 4@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp   only Walter the Walrus would count north as 7 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: need 1 more imp for 25-5|pg||
nt|chmitty: they will start a full "swiss" tomorrow with starting positions depending of today's results|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: why cant south bid 2 hearts over 2 diamonds in your suggested auction?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure did|pg||
nt|sommer: ..you are not Belgian, I see?:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: South will bid 4h now|pg||
nt|kingcur: 2@D, even when NF, sounds like music to S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|400 volt: das künstliche 2@D-Gebot gegen die Eröffnung von Nord hilft West sehr - er weiß jetzt, dass er die beste Hand hat, die er haben kann|pg||
nt|sastro: im polnischrn <Treff von der Verteilung her eine 2 Treff-Eröffnund- aber die Qualität spricht dagegen|pg||
nt|400 volt: alle Werte bis auf ein Ass in Partners Farben|pg||
nt|400 volt: Ja, und bei Gotard-Gotard ist die 2@C-Eröffnung keine reine "Precision-Eröffnung", sondern zeigt immer ein 6er@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke, thomas behandelt seine hand als schwachen sa|pg||
nt|sastro: 2|pg||
nt|400 volt: Rohowsky fragt sich sicherlich, ob 4@H hier gehen können|pg||
nt|stc: but defense must play @d early to beat 4@h, if not E is endplayed in @d|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but check the result, was probably +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4@D 4@C, EW always open 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but afterwards they needed longer to count the tricks as to play the hand before. they agreed on 10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  after 1@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  6 [3N=]  von Alvensleben playing 2@D South    so STILL no pushed boards|pg||
nt|dimi: 4@h is a nice spot for NS|pg||
nt|stc: This hard week-end is a good trial before a two weeks competition as noticed by specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: would also expced 1@S from north|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they are systematicly allowed to bid 1@S or 1@H on 3 cards if no other bid fits well|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or if they fear to wrongside a NT contract by bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: in the open room, Aarnout Helmich in N threw in a 2@S bid over 2@C|pg||
nt|xenya: amusing auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some imps here for Denmark probably|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and this last a very intersting 5 @d -without @s lead you can make it becaust @s blocked and you can endplay south|pg||
nt|santyclz: Let's see, needs 3-2 @ds, the @ca onside and no @h lead.  Sounds like one of my slams.|pg||
nt|xenya: this should be a very good board for Israel -- 4@H is hard to bid on the NS hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Da aber Fritsche nicht 2@H eröffnet hat (mindestens 5er @H und 4er+ Unterfarbe, unter Eröffnungsstärke), ist das ein Argument dagegen|pg||
nt|400 volt: Ob man jetzt aber West oder Ost den letzten Trumpf gibt, ist fraglich. Spielt man Trumpf und Ost hält ihn, hat man den Kontrakt verspielt, da man @S-Schnitt nicht mehr machen kann|pg||
nt|glen: modern bidding, S gets to open worst suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  very well done Dennis ..  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: tx :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...yes|pg||
nt|kingcur: so they will get to 4@H I predict|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H and 2@S now ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: dbl by N?|pg||
nt|xenya: not that 4@H is a particularly good contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C is better but less rewearding :0|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C is down of course, with @HK wrongly placed|pg||
nt|xenya: considering the excellent result for Israel on 18, this is going to be a convincing win for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I prefer 1 @D promises 4 |pg||
nt|gsper:  How strong is 2NT supposed to be?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..but may need a few to get the 2 MP's even|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :D|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 53 imps is 25-1|pg||
nt|sommer: what I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: if this makes it is 46 imps and 25-2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and see you markku , good you came!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@c overcall denies 4@s here in their system|pg||
nt|bobholl: juniors ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: benjamin 2@d|pg||
nt|cc469: p can bid @Ss himself if he has distribution that makes a suit contract look more attractive from his pov than NT|pg||
nt|stc: that NS "produced" an almost impossible extra trick, wd :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: will be sign-off and shows only 5. 11 count and 6c. is better to show immediately|pg||
nt|sommer: ..so this may be worth a hole MP:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like 5cx to me|pg||
nt|chick: assuming they play negative doubles, W's 1@S should show 5, so why wouldn't East support?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: did not show @d yet and can bid 2@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this can get very expencive for denmark|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be (i hope ) 3@S X made :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  buuuuuuuuuuuh:))) -1 is okay :D|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S 1@H 1@C migth happen|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzzx: i could not hear souths explaination but 2@S can show several at least invitational hands|pg||
nt|kingcur: after which EW actually have an easy way to get to 6@C, but as said, sth seems to have gone wrong after that when it came to keycard asking|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: clear advantage of the transfer then|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we will be back at 13.05 CET with Denmark-Belgium|pg||
nt|sommer: yep|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Markku|pg||
nt|kingcur: and E taking the save|pg||
pc|s3|nt|golfsquash: misprint|pg||
nt|golfsquash: the equivalent of 2@c in most natural systems|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@C ist ein partieforcierendes Relay und fragt|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich weiß leider nicht, was die weiteren Gebote heißen, bin mir aber sicher, dass Nord Süd über die Verteilung und Punkte ausfragt|pg||
nt|sybarra: even if only 2 @C |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: don't worry they open 1@c on 4342 as well :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is agreement/style etc |pg||
nt|friggi: 12+:)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes tx all -by for now ..just interested  ..ok now 11 without anu play|pg||
nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly Roland would want to be there.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes but lets say @d lead -and no @c ace taken -still you have to guess well to make it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|luffe12:  take it back - second round|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2NT inv+, 4@C = void 10-13/17+|pg||

nt|dkkello:  and kilani whants to know abouth board 13    :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: he did say that he would lead @c against 3NT on this board|pg||
nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the modern style is perhaps 1 @H on S hand here ...|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt made in thsi other room ,,really good luck -getting the only lead ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  dont know ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will be a big victory for France then   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: ok bye all|pg||
nt|chick: so what if he didn't show diamonds yet, he has spade support|pg||
nt|andreasw:  qustion is if N-S can get the @c away endplaying table in @D later and shorten declarer in trumf by @h @h and @h for a -1:p|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-2@S would be 4-7 HCP, so this sequence is constructive|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lead of  = attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why 2@S was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: either from 4 or 5 cards with an honor|pg||
nt|stc: looks like making 1@s 4@h 3@c at least|pg||
nt|luffe12:  on  9 would u guys give up at 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east asking, north "2nd/4th" ah "nooo attitude"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east "thats better!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the final board of this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: our next match will be Israel - Czech Republic|pg||
nt|kingcur: ouch|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzyf: that match will start at 15.20 local time. That is in 20 minutes from now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, stakes raised here too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no, south taking the save|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: well, if north had better @d 5@h surely has potential|pg||
pc|cA|nt|400 volt: In dem anderen Halbfinale hat der eine Tisch 7@H erreicht und erfüllt, während der andere Tisch in 4@H gestrandet ist|pg||
nt|glen: i like systems where 1@C is natural or balanced, so I like the NS modern bidding|pg||
nt|chmitty: if 3@s shows shortness in the suit, they are on good tracks here also|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  says a kib|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results can be found at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 --> competitie|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: after this match there is a break for dinner|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps to the swedes..poland will be dissapointed with the number of VPs they scored in this match|pg||
nt|kingcur: West's double of 5@H probably the sign to East to not bid 6@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: oops..1 imp to poland|pg||
nt|kingcur: but limited damage here, since the game was not bid in the open room|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think west double of 5 hearts just reflects the coments my collegues have made on west's bridge playing|pg||
nt|bebechira: cruelty?|pg||
nt|kingcur: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: meanwhile i can announce that our next match will be england u20 - Bulgaria White|pg||
nt|andreasw:  the lead does not help :(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: supposedly i played attitude leads for a long time with one partner [his choice] -- but turns out he always assumed 4th|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: i znow dziwne ze N nie otworzyl uklad 44 na starszych na drugiej rece powinien zachecic zdecydowanie |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: after likely missfit established, down valuing is in order|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: overtrick is 25-3|pg||
nt|xenya: W will pass? |pg||
nt|xenya: his singleton @S is likely to deter him |pg||
nt|dburn: it is quite a large singleton, though - facing @sAKQ9xxx rather than @sAKQ8xx, slam would be OK|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, all those 109's...|pg||
nt|dburn: and he can hope for some help on the opening lead if it isn't a spade|pg||
nt|bebechira: we have to thank Dennis...our super-operator....gret job Dennis|pg||
nt|bobholl: s won't like the sigth of dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@h vermutlich forcierend, 4@d hätte 4@h erzwungen um in partie zu bleiben|pg||
nt|anton72: kibs help me...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|400 volt: ich denke 7@H sollte man nicht reizen, aber 6@H sieht nach einem sehr gutem Schlemm aus|pg||
nt|xenya: i weould love to be in 4@H on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north semi claiming|pg||
nt|kingcur: W actually has a fine hand for an old fashioned 1@C-3@S splinter bid, but nowadays that bid is often used to show suit, not shortness|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, thanks everyone|pg||
pc|c2|nt|golfsquash: no trump finesses now Derek!|pg||
nt|cc469: safest contract is 6@C but hard to get to a slam in a suit that has never been bid :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a @s lead is best for def|pg||
nt|andreasw:  promotion in trumf not possible|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: should East have shown 2-suiter immediately over 1@D?|pg||
nt|bagman: With a spade lead this probably goes down; declarer can make by taking 2x spades, AK of diamonds discarding a heart and then low @H to 10, ruffing finesse in hearts and diamond ...|pg||
nt|bagman: ruff to drop the Q|pg||
nt|gsper:  Wow|pg||
nt|friggi: Kip pointed out the following: they can score 17 by winning the trump lead, cashing AK@D for @H discard and then low @H to 10 and then ruffing fin in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: If N makes this, the defenders should take better care of their cards :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  In practice the @D finesse is perhaps more likely?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A fun last board to deal with|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then 'competitie'|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: if you end up defending you want partner to lead @d|pg||
nt|bobholl: if n has paid attention he knows it was the middle @H|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|stc: 1@s is a safe contract|pg||
nt|anton72: 2 Sp was invite with 11-12 balnced hand ...without 4cardM|pg||
pc|c4|nt|golfsquash: This will not make|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and 2 down is a possibility.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: N thinking|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If south had raised earlier to 3@h, that might have ended the matter|pg||
nt|golfsquash: earlier Ireland had a 6@s contract depending on playing trumps for no loser missing Qxxx. A seconround fimesse was taken after all followed.|pg||
nt|kingcur: but they got there, well done|pg||
nt|kingcur: the play should be too hard|pg||
nt|xenya: and there they are...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we will be back at 19.00 CET|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzzx: actually they play very old-fashioned polish club|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H was a touch aggresive|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to see cash of @H a now |pg||
nt|sybarra: @S ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has it at his thumb but is thinking some more|pg||
nt|glen: -200 is nice too, deciding if he can afford not to cash now|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: to fasten up the play he tells west what he will play in the next few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the 600 board has now been scored against some normal contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: will just make i would have played A@C small @C nakes the same with no risk|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so -England won a bit tx all bye|pg||
nt|bobholl: thank you wubbo (de boer i guess) nice job done|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chmitty: tough start in the competition for Netherlands White, sure they will recover |pg||
nt|kingcur: which brings us to the end of this first round and allows me to thank Dennis Stuurman for the excellent VU graph work|pg||
nt|kingcur: and my fellow commentators for their wisdom and wit|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: next round will be in 12 minutes|pg||
nt|chmitty: tx Dennis :) good job|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: bye|pg||
nt|kingcur: see you soon|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump best now|pg||
nt|kingcur: same lead as in other room, and it will likely result in 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|uni_cicam: yes, but still, you want to bid the game if possible. Still can have 25 HCP and 3NT can be cold|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and perhaps this can make for another swing..|pg||
nt|xenya: he is going to make it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  naah no overtrick:)|pg||
nt|xenya: the @H lead makes it easy for declarer, but as the cards lie he couldn't go wrong anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|400 volt: Kasimir ist auf dem Weg in den Großschlemm - Jokisch wird aber wohl jegliches Interesse verneinen|pg||
nt|sybarra: better part of valour?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: why, you have almost no play|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no, too bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: our next match will be Netherlands Girls - Czech Republic|pg||
nt|sommer: S will take @DAK before hoping in black|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: that match will start in 15 min|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cc469: this only makes because @Hs are 3-3 - 36% slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: *valor|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder surprised|pg||
nt|andreasw:  might play @c J now? i doubt it but|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wilkinsona: this switch may let this home|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzzx: 12 imps for JAMM that is|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the extra 2 tricks produced 1 additional imp.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4@H has play too|pg||
nt|kingcur: and while South will be quietly going one off, this allows me to thank Dennis for his vugraph work, my fellow commentators for their contributions and the specs for their wit, info ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: and wisdom. We'll be back shortly; hope you enjoyed|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: last time in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekarek played polish leads all his life|pg||
nt|santyclz: When you look at it that way, it's easier to forget the bad results -- same as an undoubled overtrick.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|xenya: but it does look unmakeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then it just need the @hKJ onside, you have to lead the @h10 and run it if not covered so you have the ace for a reentry to lead up to the q.  |pg||
mc|10|nt|bobholl: dutch hope full filled i guess (hope)|pg||
pg||
