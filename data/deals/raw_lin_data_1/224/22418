nt|ahollan1: Cullin too strong for 1N overcall|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H-3@S-4@C   one side alerted as @H fit   seems Zagorin on different page|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: there is some artificiality here, but I can't see what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force, could be 2-cards with balanced hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bathurst did announce to opponents before opening lead about the probable wrong explanation of 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quite right to do that -- good show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what 2@D and 2@S mean :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Joe will find out eventually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in veldhoven WBF ruled that cross screen explanation was not correct procedure|pg||
mb|4N|nt|xenya: i though EW would try for more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: when dummy hits, Zagorin takes back his lead :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems strange to me  but i'll need to think about it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: going to guess  2@S showed balanced hand with 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  2@H shows @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think 5@D is one KC outside of spades (so 4NT was exclusion) but not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@S looks pretty good here|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: DBL/1N = something like good 18-20  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe just 18-19|pg||
nt|udo: 3NT after @C lead, not so good,,:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N after any lead ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Bertheau didn't show 5th @H along the way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right  4@S would be keycard @H  so  4N = Exclusion with 0@S|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: maybe disliked @D length for @H??|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: was expecting Platnick to bid 6@c to show the king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 2@S was 3 hearts and only game interest untill Diamond has substantial extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other match  both in 3@H  for 1 imp swing|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: still, maybe 6@h denies the @dK at any rate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Big club context for EW|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: though by no means laydown |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i bet many big clubbers would open 1@C   and ashamed i didn't think about that 9 bids ago|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: not obvious to open strong club with high-card minimum and no spades - risk of enemy activity preventing you from showing your suits|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|udo: hm|pg||
nt|udo: but still no way to make ?|pg||
nt|udo: passive @S exit needed now,,,,,|pg||
nt|udo: a red suits gives the contract, i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 3-3 spades, double @HQ, @DK onside -- what's the problem :)|pg||
nt|udo: 3 @D tricks not so easy,,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy game|pg||
nt|udo: needs only 2 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  double dummy can still do it after @S|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
nt|udo: does he have another choice ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but also true that after 1@H-@S interference   hard to convince partner you're this strong|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|dburn: looks like 17 to Diamond - Bertheau will need some things to go their way soonish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 64 board match|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, they have plenty of time, but opportunities may be hard to come by - Diamond is playing pretty well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Diamond attempting to show his hand to Bertheau under the table to speed things up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: course might get tougher if the wind picks up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no wait  that doesn't apply in bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cullin wondering if there is any chance that @C8 was singleton?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2nd undertrick out of thin air|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H  10-13  does 7th card make the hand too good?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D   go figure|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: seems so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if that is "mixed" or pure preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even looking at the hand :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: impressive DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they find 5@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  44 4@H went down 2   where here 5@H down 1|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1:  45  @D were opened  but precision 1@D in 3rd seat|pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: as then declarer might well have looked for a major fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson made great evaluation to bid 3N opposite 11-13 balanced  [confession: i thought he might PASS 1N]|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfb: Diamond laughin about the 5 heart bids in series -- Cullin wishes he had bid 5N so he could bid 6@H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thru 42  Amoils over Falk by 36|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yet another hand for the "4333 = nt" rule|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other precisioners might [keyword] open 1@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: looked as though 1nt was going to force them into the right spot|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: i guess north had to bid 2@C as a way of inviting in notrumps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the other room known to be slow :( |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|athene: any methods that force you to bid stayman to make a 2NT raise have to be suspect|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: maybe north was looking for a 5-3 major fit from the start|pg||
nt|athene: but i would not bother with that hand|pg||
nt|ritong: @c Q a routine move here|pg||
nt|athene: yes rising the queen buys you a temp, if you need it|pg||
nt|ritong: when east doubled 2@c, that is|pg||
nt|athene: as east has to win and can't continue the attack on the suit|pg||
nt|athene: facing a 14-16 notrump, if i had a natural 2nt raise available, i might use it with north, but if not, i would just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H looks a lot better if north doesn't open 3@S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: maybe just 3nt is right anyway, vul at imps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: after dinner break, 2 more 16-board segments to complete the Semi-Finals|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  30  6@H  and @Dx lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss in the tank   [1st time today :)]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: yes, we are waiting to see if we get the last board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is just wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt first time Moss in the tank |pg||
nt|ahollan1: either they should play 32 or director lets them go to the bar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Shirley  i couldn't find the heavy sarcasm font|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh that is why I missed it then |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now do we play and possibly finish AFTER the slow table  or ....|pg||

nt|ritong: with a gap of like three game swings  we may have sporty auctions in the last segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: We won't be able to restart until both matches start again, so it may be a bit longer than that since the other match is still on board 46|pg||

nt|jaapfr: or realist Al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finesse @H to handle another @S tap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for us 4.30 at night so we should dream|pg||
nt|ritong: also known as " trump policemen" manoeuvre|pg||
nt|ahollan1: new phrase for me Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: for the plural, i guess  usually is trump policeman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Other match has caught up, so we should restart about 10 minutes after they finish here|pg||
nt|ritong: kelsey's terminology|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't read kelsey in a couple of years -- i'm so ashamed|pg||

nt|athene: 4@D showing a strong 4@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they got to 7@S vs 6@S now being played in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D specifically for @S  let Cheek cooperate with 4N RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: response will show max, unbal, no 4-card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just not sure which structure they use|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final set in 90 minutes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 3@H is asking partner to bid 3nt with a stop, usually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but other tables still in play for Q3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = values, no better bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: you might then pull it to show a big 1-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people use this with a monster 1 suiter with a void in opps' suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D = RKC @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  5@HX|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that does not want to make a takeout double in case it's passed|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  46 [4@DW]  other room  1@S-P-3@H*-DBL//3@S    * one player alerted as takeout of @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin in the tank with west hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: 4@H=0/3   but in context of max, must be 3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks cindy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was looking at wrong event|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: (1M)-3M asking for stop  much more common than (2M)-3M, isn't it Nik?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told Joe Grue read the cards to make 7@S from the east seat on this hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: cash one trump then take a ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done to get to 6@S   and again credit for swing to Hampson for his opening 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true -- he hasn't made 6@S yet|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if moss promises a heart void with this sequence|pg||
nt|athene: i mean gitelman must be fairly sure of it anyway, even absent agreements|pg||
nt|ritong: opponent's bidding does|pg||
nt|athene: people sometimes bid higher than the Law says you should, but not THAT much higher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: law breakers must be punished !!!|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's a pretty good rule that the cue then bidding your suit shows a void in opps' suit|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what Moss would have bid over a multi-2@D|pg||
nt|athene: with no anchor suit to cue|pg||
nt|athene: declarer knows south must surely have some spade as he bid 5@H on three|pg||
nt|athene: *have some SHAPE|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: zagorin out of the tank with 4@S  -- might get to 6@D now|pg||

nt|davpro: I was afraid of that|pg||
nt|athene: oh dear....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: get this -  other table finishes 1st     ACBL really needs to rethink this procedure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: change that to   abandon and redesign|pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe bds do not need to be played in order |pg||
nt|sybarra: give a bd out of order to keep the pace common  (one example)|pg||
pc|sJ|mc|7|nt|ahollan1: i was just going to ask about play after @CK|pg||
