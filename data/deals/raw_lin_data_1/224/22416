nt|joest: hi all|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|joest: I suppose some point counters might pass with Gitelman's hand but there is too good a chance of making 3NT or 4@s to try taht|pg||
nt|joest: that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has an interesting decision here - whether to let the @C9 hold and try to reach dummy later in spades|pg||
nt|athene: or unblock the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: using the spades as entries requires the @SA to be short of course|pg||
nt|joest: as it turns out with the queen ten of hearts tight he has other routes to nine tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: this play will win immediately if clubs break|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: with other chances|pg||
nt|bagman: The club might be from short as both majors were kind of 'taken' (S promised hearts and N spades)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, exactly - clubs might possibly be 3-2 |pg||
nt|bagman: So blocking the suit might be the only way to go down|pg||
nt|joest: three of clubs doesn't look too much like 'short'|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but can be from J53, T53, J63 or T63|pg||
nt|joest: Nystrom with a tough decision here|pg||
nt|joest: even if west works out to switch to a diamond, south can duck twice, unblock everything and make the hand when the queen ten of hearts flips up|pg||
nt|athene: does west know for sure that declarer has two more clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: could he have @CAK tight and east have started with @C64?|pg||
nt|athene: i am just wondering if west might try the @c5 here|pg||
nt|athene: EW are upside down carding so i guess west knows the club layout|pg||
nt|joest: yes 6 could not be from 64|pg||
nt|joest: east would give count at T1|pg||
nt|athene: in that case you might as well play diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: With the @H-spots (or lack of those) , W is unlikely to play hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: so might as well be a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: yes hearts can't be good for the defence long-term|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he is wondering WHICH diamond to lead|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H could be 5, right? so declarer could be 3-5-2-3|pg||
nt|athene: so a diamond shift could be just what the doctor ordered|pg||
nt|joest: if south has KQx/KQJx/Qxx/AKx defense will stil prevail even on the king of diamonds switch, so long as east ducks|pg||
nt|kareno: Hello from Vegas :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|athene: hello|pg||
nt|kareno: Bill :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course Moss is going to look for some route to nine tricks that does not need the heart miracle|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi|pg||
nt|kareno: Pekka :)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H an odd contract|pg||
nt|joest: i think somehow the train came off the track in the other room to reach 3@h|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: people play a variety of cunning twists and turns these days to try to get out at a low level when one hand has 20-22 balanced and the other has a major|pg||
nt|athene: for example putting your 20-22 hands in 2@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like, Joe.  It's a strange auction.  |pg||
nt|athene: and trying to scramble around|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H response showed spades|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h4|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it's down to the finesse against the @H10 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Brad tried calling for @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Fred refused to revoke|pg||
nt|bagman: Moss pictures AT west as he probably feels that a heart does not make sense from A7xxx|pg||
nt|athene: right so he might be wondering if he can possibly throw west in with the fourth round of clubs to lead a heart|pg||
nt|joest: but he can't strip West of diamonds, then toss him him b/c he knows west has at least two, ifnot three diamonds left|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|joest: toss him in|pg||
nt|athene: on the @SJ west would just throw the @H10 and have all winners|pg||
nt|bagman: So Moss probably thinks he's down but will be happily surprised|pg||
nt|bagman: But this might take a while|pg||
nt|athene: well he deserves some cheering-up after 7-1 clubs in 6@S|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that the 7-1 clubs was the proper punishment for not playing @CA and another; he had re-entries in heart ruffs|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  60 x 0 = ?|pg||
nt|kareno: Against Moss Senior (Mike) you had to be prepared to defend 3nt a LOT :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that's one reason for transfer responses|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  2-3|pg||
nt|athene: if it shows three then the defence will know west has only four, and hence not four hearts|pg||

nt|athene: wonder how it made only 9 in the other room|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|bagman: The @HQ might give a nasty guess for the declarer but it revolves around the overtrick and there's legitimate chance to beat in case E has Kx|pg||

nt|joest: perhaps 3@h on this particular hand|pg||
nt|athene: he bids 3@H now|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|joest: but, for example, does a new suit show extras?|pg||
nt|athene: the other interesting theoretical question is whether 2@C promises three hearts|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: this is a tougher problemin standard methods than people give it credit for|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like n/s make about 5 hearts and e/w can't really compete|pg||
nt|joest: most people would start with a negative double I guess|pg||
nt|joest: but that means you can never bid clubs forcing|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|joest: if you start with 2@c most pairs are no longer thinking in terms of a 44 heart fit|pg||
nt|kareno: With the misfit you need to be cautious|pg||
nt|kareno: That @sQ is not a real value|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room it might go 1@d-4@s and then south will have quite a problem|pg||
nt|bagman: Does the bounce to 4@H show distributional hand or can it be strongish?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: director just warned them that with such slow play, they may not get to play boards 31-32|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: so is this a general slam try or a 'bid six if you have spades controlled?|pg||
nt|joest: i think the latter undiscussed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: Oops - the 4-1 heart break will scuttle this I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|joest: i amtold next door it did go 4@s|pg||

nt|athene: how do you avoid losing a club and a spade?|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be a double loss for Diamond (you're lucky if you can compress your losses that way|pg||
nt|athene: i mean if east has the @CKQ you might be able to ruff the diamonds good and squeeze him in the black suits|pg||
nt|athene: 3-2 trumps and @DQxx is not enough because even if you draw trumps and ruff the diamonds good, you can throw all the clubs from dummy but dummy has no trump to ruff a club|pg||
nt|joest: assuming he does not switch to the club king at trick two and break that up|pg||
nt|kareno: Club best now.  A little tough but if north has the queen you're not beating this anyway.|pg||
nt|athene: east is just thinking about layouts when declarer has a singleton club|pg||
nt|kareno: Trump may work also but it is a very unappetizing shift.  |pg||
nt|kareno: If you continue spades, and declarer is missing @h J he will go right.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|kareno: Can't reply to you all - let's watch what he does.  I think it will be impossible to make 6@h without the impossible diamond shift.|pg||

nt|xenya: here E will probably end up 2 down|pg||
nt|davpro: beautiful. As so many of you told me. I'm too old for School :) Thx anyway|pg||
nt|athene: a fairly startling demonstration of the rule about leading trumps against sacrifices|pg||
nt|davpro: Well, after this bidding and P's double I think a trump lead is obvious...|pg||
nt|athene: club to ace, spade now - if south allows the ruff, you lead the @D8 and get another trick from your @HJ10|pg||
nt|athene: if south ruffs in he endplays himself immediately|pg||
nt|xenya: in any case, this won't be flat :)|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: this is a curious ending|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer now cashes the @CA and tries a spade, south can ruff and give his partner a club ruff to draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer does not cash the @CA, south ruffs and lets north throw his club away|pg||
nt|udo: if north plays a @H now|pg||

nt|davpro: Well, Bidding 4@c, unvulnerable, could be very right. Here it wasn't|pg||
nt|athene: but with 5-6 he really wants to be bidding hearts|pg||
nt|athene: trying to tell partner you have longer hearts AND you want him to play it - well, ok, if you have some firm discussion about that, which you won't, then fine|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@H they might have got out for -3 |pg||

nt|ndemirev: Bathurst hand proved to match poorly but try to move to cards to produce normal breaks, KQ of D as working casrds, or givee N a 5th spade |pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: so Nystrom bids 4 and Girelman passes after same start|pg||

mb|2N|nt|athene: do they play strong-ish weak-twos or something in the other room?|pg||

nt|sybarra: egads I have not played that in years |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: i didn't think it was known on east coast|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thought midwest only|pg||
nt|sybarra: I grew up in Nebraska|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhhh|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: pitch also,  sort of similar|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: i was accused of being liar/cheater 1st time i played   after asking for rules  i quickly conquered the game  because of bridge background|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ndemirev: DO we like 2S here? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Upmark 2@S would have shown  10-13   too many flaws for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Grue also opened 2@S to buy the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 13  Amoils 40  Falk 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like the 2 @S better than double,   his pard likely not to have a biddable spade suit (imo)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: can DBL now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or not |pg||
mb|4H|nt|ndemirev: I would hate to preempt pd with short spades and 1H opening bid. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: I would have to admit I would open 2S as well though |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Upmark's other option was 2@D  weak 2major or game force @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absent an opening from east    we thought he should bid 3@C after west showed minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: next set starts in 20 minutes    what's the over-under for this table finishing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: tight double    |pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: doesn't this auction suggest trump lead?|pg||

nt|sybarra: or a trump lead also an option true|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  26  Nystrom in 3N  ---  they didn't even sniff at @C slam|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: so much for the extra space available from the 2@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so far this week, i've been unimpressed with the swedish 2@C auctions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm sure they'll work on it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: when asked Diamond said they "give count" in this situation -- apparently Platnlick doesn't think so|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hey Shirley :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertheau concerned about Platnick overruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but would he really lead @D if he started with @Sxx??|pg||
pc|hA|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now need @H finesse for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  27  Gitelman opened the hand with @HAQ109xx with 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's final contract|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: any methods that force you to bid stayman to make a 2NT raise have to be suspect|pg||

nt|athene: yes rising the queen buys you a temp, if you need it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: response will show max, unbal, no 4-card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just not sure which structure they use|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@H is asking partner to bid 3nt with a stop, usually|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: you might then pull it to show a big 1-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people use this with a monster 1 suiter with a void in opps' suit|pg||
mb|4D|an|key card|nt|ahollan1: 4@D = RKC @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  5@HX|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that does not want to make a takeout double in case it's passed|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 4@H=0/3   but in context of max, must be 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: (1M)-3M asking for stop  much more common than (2M)-3M, isn't it Nik?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told Joe Grue read the cards to make 7@S from the east seat on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: cash one trump then take a ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done to get to 6@S   and again credit for swing to Hampson for his opening 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true -- he hasn't made 6@S yet|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if moss promises a heart void with this sequence|pg||
nt|athene: i mean gitelman must be fairly sure of it anyway, even absent agreements|pg||

nt|athene: people sometimes bid higher than the Law says you should, but not THAT much higher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: law breakers must be punished !!!|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's a pretty good rule that the cue then bidding your suit shows a void in opps' suit|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what Moss would have bid over a multi-2@D|pg||
nt|athene: with no anchor suit to cue|pg||
