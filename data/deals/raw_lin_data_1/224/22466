mb|p|mb|p|nt|mgb81: Surprisingly 3Nt went down in the other room with 27 between the two hands|pg||
nt|kingcur: 27 points in between the NS hands|pg||
nt|mgb81: Will North open a cheeky 1NT?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mgb81: No a discplined 1D|pg||
nt|kingcur: making 3NT-1 not the result you'd expect|pg||

nt|mgb81: That's a good lead by east|pg||
nt|mgb81: gives the defence a chance I guess|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mgb81: But Declarer can surely always make 3 diamonds, 2 hearts, 3 spades and a club|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that does give you access to Open Room Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|stc: one big swing difference, the match is open|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the TD stopped punishing such behaviour after both teams agreed. so there are no more time penalties in the final|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Guten Abend allerseits|pg||
nt|400 volt: Beide Paare spielen einen schwachen SA in der Eröffnung|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi this time sesson it is not sensible to guess final contracts -so colorful they where last session |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: TD gave them 10 minutes extra and decided that both pairs were responsible for the last delay so assigned NO penalties|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!N here or 4@h? 4@h ofcourse best but 3!N with 5-3-3-2 over 4-3-3-3 is quite common|pg||
mb|1N|nt|400 volt: Das Ost-West-System ist relativ natürlich gehalten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, sorry for the confusion just now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS a polish pair, but they do NOT play Polish Club|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup:  so 6 @c missed |pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: from the player's notes: 2NT = 9-12 or 16+, 3@s and 4@c cues|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: lead of a king would have shown a good suit, queen denies|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Users who prefer English will find their way to the open room, Felix|pg||
nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze haben sich bereits gewundert, dass Thomas Gotard jun. nicht mehr mit Bernard Ludewig spielt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a service to have German in one room, not a punishment|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: bernard ludewig konnte leider aus gesundheitlichen gründen heute nicht antreten|pg||
nt|400 volt: Danke Michael - damit wäre die Frage geklärt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: Still time for an overtrick.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|stc: a good slam with not many points. @s 2-2 and short @h on side making the play easy |pg||

nt|stc: a lucky slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: smirnov places his cards in his hand for a crossruff and counts the tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d6|nt|stc: I think that E should win the first @d with the A and give dec a losing option in @D|pg||
nt|bebechira: fantastic tournament ... can we have a wbsite with teams etc...|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW part of the Dutch team that performed so well in the latest world youth championships and a very talented pair|pg||

nt|frankaus: clear 11H |pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north claims that he bid as if there had been no 1nt and after 1@C-2@D = hearts 2nt they have a system. south bid system off (=natural)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to endplay n on that line.|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: worth 3@s|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diese mBoard könnten Nord/Süd schnell mal zu hoch geraten|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that was a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: then he would need to play a heart from dummy forcing east to ruff|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning all|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s -1 by EW ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier to concede a @d early. 2 3 4 1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|400 volt: 4@C bei Nord/Süd und 3@S bei Ost/West ist das Limit|pg||
nt|stc: was für NT spielen sie ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 12-14 beide|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir spielt sogar 11-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@s promises 5, but 1@h only promises 4 in e/w system (swiss acol)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW used to play a modification of NS Baltic club but they found out it was too complicated, so they switched to some easier system at the beginning of the year|pg||
nt|frankaus: i value it a 15 count|pg||
nt|kingcur: agree: if you open light, it's important to have a good suit, and this @H suit qualifies for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: yes probably -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ³adnie przepuci³ kiera Robertson, |pg||
mb|3S|nt|400 volt: Yes, 3 NT can be made by N/S, but east/west will bid 4@S everytime|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat geschrieben "2@s gute hebung"... wundert mich etwas...|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D ist eigentlich relativ natürlich im System von Ost-West. Der einzige Grund für das Alertieren kann sein, dass West auch mit 5er @C und 4er @D 1@D häufig eröffnet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hab ich mir schon fast gedacht, dass er hier mit kontra in die reizung einsteigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: thats the problem with playing artifical methods - you need detailed agreements or some really good working meta-agreements in competition|pg||
nt|stc: I even think that with more free places in E the crossruff line was a bit better|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Good fireworks here|pg||
nt|stc: anyway good start for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Alex said in the end that he should have played the cross ruff. but that needed to start in trick 3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: zil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|stc: cards are friendly for NS, EW can't go plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt opening would be 11-13, so this rebid shows 14+|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players produced so many big swings that they all speed up playing for overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or book that introduced the method   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south passed and explained to west "I have a clear pass on 2@S but I was thinking because I was not sure if thats natural"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|400 volt: Ja, 3SA können von Nord/Süd erfüllt werden, aber Ost/West gehen immer auf 4er-Stufe|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube nicht, dass 3SA von Ost irgendwelche Probleme bereitet. Sogar 5@D geht. Mal schauen, ob Ost/West sie erreichen|pg||
nt|sastro: mit 6-4 bevorzuge ich zuerst die Wiederholung der 6er-Länge|pg||
nt|stc: keine gute Idee von N|pg||
nt|stc: aber 2@h ist nicht soo schlecht|pg||
nt|dimi: @s K @h Q and 2 @c tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hard to guess the singleton king.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW are very slow players and are in danger of beeing to late every segment|pg||
nt|stc: NS must just cash their tricks before the 5th @d is played|pg||
nt|stc: in other words S must play @c when in hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: novay min 4 me |pg||
nt|frankaus: no way |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results are at www.nbbportal.nl/1003, then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|kingcur: but with two aces and a decent 2nd suit, this is not even a light opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but nothing will bother it|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Auch 5@C kann man schnell mal im Gegenspiel schenken, von daher ist 5@S sicherlich ein akzeptables Gebot|pg||
nt|400 volt: jetzt hat sich Udo Kasimir etwas zu hoch gewagt - die Hand steht aber auch schlecht für ihn|pg||
nt|400 volt: Der Gegner hat @S KB8x UND der @C-Schnitt sitzt nicht|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben got a 10 imp penalty for slow play|pg||
nt|stc: better now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer may simply pull trumps from the top|pg||
nt|stc: not very likely but possible of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ducking that was risky, vuln south could hold 8 hearts and noting outside|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S now game try $ me|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|400 volt: Nord hat nur 6 Figurenpunkte, aber mit einem sicheren 9-Karten-Fit und einer guten Verteilung ist das 3@S nicht völlig unverständlich|pg||
nt|runnerup:  time for 800?|pg||
nt|stc: 5 obvious losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what 1@S asked/showed   but it allowed North any easy bid  [versus something like immediate 3@C]|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S denied 4 spades|pg||
pc|hT|nt|400 volt: hier kostet es 500 - aber gegen mögliche 400 beim Gegner kein allzu großer Verlust|pg||
nt|runnerup:  is south worth 3 @s -with 8 points and 7xxx in @s maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  other room stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: a decent save|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Good morning all|pg||
nt|stc: wieso hat W @d entdeckt ?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns never mensioned -the suit they make a slam (lucly ofcause ) @s|pg||
nt|stc: clap-clap|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even though east is a substitute it seems they have control over their system:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure how many of his regular agreements vd Bos has agreed with Tim Verbeek but this looks like a relay sequence he used with v Lankveld as well: they play a fairly natural ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: system, but with loads of gadgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: gf relay quite standard among dutch juniors|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H the limit of the hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: the 4-4 fit often plays better, but here we see @s's split 4-1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke mal 2@s zeigt schon 5-4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzzx: schlechte stimmung bei den senioren, kratz/sträter sind mit der spielgeschwindigkeit ihrer gegner nicht glücklich|pg||
nt|400 volt: Gegen wen spielen die beiden denn?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich glaub der eine ist yves mucha|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe some side effect, that explains the imo poor level of bridge here besides the tight schedule was last night... it was Alexander Smirnovs 30th birthday and most of the players ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: were at the bar (too?) long|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he had bought champagne for all :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andreasw:  4@s could have problems although it should make|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C probably does that too :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S seems playable|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C K protected|pg||
nt|kingcur: and W declaring 4@S seems like the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d lead looks best to me? altough North might get creative and lead a small @c here|pg||

mb|p|nt|luffe12:  the law!!|pg||

nt|glen: classic question - red, in 2nd seat, the N hand does not fit a weak two, but does it anyways|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Grand on a @d guess|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@D probably some good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: as this E hand seems a little heavy for current tandards for bidding 1mi-4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: standards*|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: vdBos-Verbeek also play strong jump shifts, so 2@s would have been GF 5+@s with more outside values|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: magical 25 HCP slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch-kasimir have a quite unique system|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp|pg||
mb|4D|nt|runnerup:  ew can make 5 @h but can be many down if different sits |pg||
nt|frankaus: this auction right sided the contract now @D lead gives up a trick|pg||
nt|kingcur: the danger with transfer-agreements always being that it allows your opponents a double to indicate values in that suit and enter the bidding at lesser risk|pg||
mb|4H|nt|golfsquash: could have tried 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch hatte erklärt dass 2@d in dieser geflage eröffnungsstärke zeigt|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: west explained 2@D as if 1@H = hearts would have been bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south to west: 1@H is natural|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north would perhaps be declarer in 4 @s (d?)  if he had bid a couple of @s|pg||

pc|dA|nt|xenya: getting 9 tricks shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
nt|luffe12:  3nt is easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: from souths point of view the lead must be a singleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  would u X with the N hand or 3nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low from xx does NOT include  10x   that leads 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N way too much opposite balancing DBL|pg||
nt|xenya: down 2 for 500 -- but 3N NS is very very close -- 4@H might go down though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|golfsquash: and possibly another one in hearts|pg||

nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i was wondering -- on the surface, 5@C looked like a make, but there are pitfalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he did know SOMEONE was going to ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: first double explained "we mandatory double with spade shortnes and 7+hcp"|pg||
nt|stc: yes, DD you just give the K@c and score 5@s, 5@c and A@H in 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 5@C on 2 did fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2nd double: "double on 2@S would be penalty, so I guess this one is penalty too"|pg||

pc|cA|nt|xenya: could you expand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3 [3@SW+1]  von Alvensleben in 4@D South   so  like previous 5@C -- now he just has to make it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kingcur: will now play clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sastro: ducken ist das beste- dann kann AS die Treffs noch missraten|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: je nachdem wie lange man zum duck braucht aber auch nicht mehr|pg||
nt|kingcur: double finesse the best chance|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cc469: N's hand became less impressive with announced @C singleton with S opposite his @C values|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think the high lead showed either even length with an honor or odd length without an honor|pg||
nt|xenya: the mind boggles :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: and N has no entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks suprised that south has a trump|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|pg||
nt|golfsquash: would like to play hearts agin, but entry problems|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: what made smirny choose @S rather than give @C ruff??|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|luffe12:  S must guard @C N the @s so no one to protect @h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  maybe to avoid any kind of endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekareks carding was consistent to KT9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sastro: wie vorausgesagt- nun Treff 7|pg||
nt|400 volt: hat Jokisch wirklich @C 2 geordert?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|stc: was|pg||
nt|stc: was not the 3@d very positive ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after Piekarek had commented souths bidding for a minute i did not guess this would happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per CC   East leads King from AKJT  else Ace |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they are playing now for the overtricks|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|golfsquash: overtrick now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|luffe12:  Not any longer - declarer should give up a club |pg||
nt|glen: declarer ducks @C to S, to prevent @S play from N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: upside down attitude   @D3 with north showing the @D2  is most encouraging|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now hope that teammates bid 6@C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|golfsquash: and a sixth Imp|pg||
nt|sastro: wieder ein optimales Ergebnis für NS . , denn 4 Coeur ist schlagbar|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|glen: now if @C were 3-3, 12 tricks,  but the dbl sqz gets 12 tricks too|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|kingcur: @D on @CK looked like a findable play...|pg||

nt|kingcur: E will now describe his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|kingcur: Im told 2N shows a weak hand with 5c@H|pg||

nt|luffe12:  if u were forced to 12 u might get it right |pg||
nt|sybarra: not the same as @D 7 |pg||
nt|glen: so close to winning a beer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was it Tomi?   seems trick 2  @H2 shows South holds @CA  so @CKT9 would not play King|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players discussing the board, alex agrees with you that he meant @H2 as suit pref|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would have played for the @d finesse for entering declarer's hand. if it loses the rest is yours, if not you have an ot|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other room bidding 35 now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: NV, EW will compete heavily I expect|pg||
nt|frankaus: really interesting hands - did they feed the dealing machine red meat?|pg||
nt|kingcur: and there they are|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 5@dx -5 won 7 imps for red|pg||
nt|kingcur: same final contract on  3 in open room, but only 4 off there|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: ungewöhnlich, dass man eine 5er-länge gegen die 1SA-eröffnung gegenreizt|pg||
nt|400 volt: meine Wahl wäre hier Kontra gegen den 12-14 SA|pg||
nt|sastro: sieht für Alvensleben stark danach aus , dass Partner ebenfalls die Coeur hält|pg||
nt|santyclz: I seem to recall an old column by Reese in which he was faced with a 2-way finesse.  He solved the problem by leading the J of a suit in which he held the Q and observing LHO's ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: reaction.  He then led the suit in which he didn't have the Q and noticing a slight difference in the reaction finessed LHO for the Q.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|400 volt: gut, dass West Kontra als pass/correct zur Verfügung hat, so wird der @S-Fit gefunden|pg||
nt|400 volt: mal schauen, ob man 4@S findet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt kann ost evtl 3@s reizen?|pg||
nt|sastro: kontra zeigt Hand mit Bereitschaft in Pik. Hat Partner Coeurs soll er drin bleiben|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i could have been drunk this very wednesday on that account :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: understandably, gotard not happy to open 1@d, so 1nt the practical choice|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s 4-1 ,@h finess of -so probÃ¶ems in 4 @s|pg||
nt|runnerup:  problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: actually they have discussed their system in that sequence 20 minutes ago, hope both remember|pg||
nt|dimi: NS can make 2 @c, EW can make 2-3 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we had some similar problem yesterday, when one player complained his oponent took some short time to follow a single honor|pg||
nt|stc: yes, the winner must play better in the euros|pg||
nt|kingcur: 5@C a make for NS here, and they may bid it too|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3S!|nt|400 volt: 3@D wird vermutlich eine Werte in @D zeigen mit einer guten Hand|pg||
nt|400 volt: (und natürlich die @S), da 3@C einen guten @H-Fit bestätigt|pg||
nt|sastro: ein gutes taktisches Gebot von Kasimir, das den C-Fit verdeckt|pg||
nt|400 volt: das ist für West natürlich ein Traumgebot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch erklärt dass ohne zwischenreizung 3@c jetzt maximum, 4er @c und kleines double in @c gezeigt hätte|pg||
nt|runnerup:  wd -now ew makes 9 in @s and ns 10 in @c |pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to defend with the N hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pachnie szlemikiem|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: e/w playing some funny defense where they pass some strong hands... perhaps west regrets that now|pg||
nt|santyclz: My partner and I used to have on our convention cards: "Opening leader's partner always hesitates at trick 1, even with a singleton."  |pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzzx: sehr diszipliniertes pass von rohowsky|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks in @h on a sqz @s/@c against N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drury|pg||
nt|kingcur: doubling 4@H showing interest to bid on, I expect|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Looks like this will just about get home|pg||
nt|golfsquash: this knocks out an entry but should be ok for 8 tricks, play on spades first|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably not|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  i booked 4 X !7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time east had 17 -did west know that? -i douth|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: seems to have reached a normal contract though... unlike the other room!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = nat or 4-fit 10-11 hcp  or  3-fit one round force|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|golfsquash: and a little respite for the Scots|pg||
nt|sastro: warom nicht Treff Dame ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: He could have opened 1@C and repeated 2@C, showing 15+ with 5+ @C|pg||
nt|luffe12:  @d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: dont know how that works but 2@C was explained as drury or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: as i mentioned earlier NL white is a team with quite unexperienced players. this is their first international tournament|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzzx: ah yes, right|pg||

nt|luffe12:  no chance whatsoever|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drury OR nat??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not a transfer to 1NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: aeh 4er @h meinte ich|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kingcur: another Polish 1@C here|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|kingcur: and the 2@D relay to indicate the strong hand, with at least 3c fit|pg||
nt|kingcur: 2@S now showing 4c @H and a weak hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: in the days when I tried playing Polish @C, 2@H was the weakest response point and fit-wise, but maybe they changed this|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kingcur: not the time to investigate at 5 level here, since there are 3 tricks out that you cannot get rid of|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|xenya: something you might do when bidding against a genuine stron 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think any bid shows either the next suit or the two above|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  declarer did not apply Rabbi's Rule  [when king is singleton, play the ace]  so 4@D down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still 3 imps to tie the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final contract  5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we'll never know if Piek 6@S good or bad   but it doesn't lose a lot against the game|pg||
nt|kingcur: so two off a good result for NS if the other room makes 5@C|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s here seems normal?|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  results to date are http://www.camrosebridge.com/|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  currently England are in the lead with 134, Scotland are second with 121, Wales are third with 114|pg||
nt|cc469: on the last board, S is the hand that essentially makes slam a possibility - I think N's rebid of 4@H opposite the announced singleton with his p was quite proper but S should bid ...|pg||
nt|cc469: 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: weak 6/7 clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The SBU has 97 Ireland 91 and Northern Ireland 71|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only bad if Khanukov was going down in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  but 5 x @c from the start could have made life a bit more difficult for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: here we see the weak nt version of the polish 1@c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|golfsquash: the 4/4 fit may be better than the 5/4 fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hm sollte das ein alert sein? bin mir unsicher|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1sa zeigt 4er @s und 5er UF|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e.g. 1@d would have shown @h or @s+@c|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can make 3nt here -but hardly will be bidden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with only 42 boards to play|pg||
nt|dimi: @s from S was a bad  card|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he did not read parners signal in clubs as encouraging|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north did not want to overtake in case the lead was from Tx he said|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and he reminded partner of the low spotcards in dummy|pg||
nt|stc: not a lot, just 3 IMP|pg||
nt|stc: or 4 if only 5 made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5+@S   [Kaplan Inversion]   so why 2@S???|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west said he was thinking about bidding 6nt or even 7 because he expected 6@D to be void and he had aj... so he planed on some finesse |pg||
nt|kingcur: S bidding his 2-suiter...looks like Michaels, is that correct, Dennis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@h to play here, with INV+ van den Bos can make a cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 10-16 punkte|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|golfsquash: may not need the club guess playing in hearts with a club going on the long spade|pg||
nt|cc469: ... with controls in both side suits and a 5th @H to boot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sicherlich nicht die antwort die rohowsky befürchtet hat|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c starts relays|pg||
nt|stc: EW on the way to a minus score|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England - tough for Goodman-Pownall who played both sets in that match|pg||
nt|400 volt: der Trend geht allgemein dazu, Kontra als Stärkekontra erst ab 18 Punkten zu spielen, für Rohowsky aber offensichtlich nicht :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. kann in dieser sequenz auch 4@d5@c haben|pg||
nt|sastro: polnisch - 8-15  4er Pik und längere Minore|pg||
mb|3H|an|4+!h|nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 14-16, 55xx|pg||
nt|stc: the trailing team recovered almost all, now a very close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so a slight upgrade but i think the hand is surely worth it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir can now bid 4@h rkcb or 4@d to sign off in 4@h i believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: oh maybe 4@s is rkcb for @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate the leads from  4333's  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Slavinski leads for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fritsche played @H for no loser so made overtrick in 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: saves an imp|pg||
nt|stc: this IS FAIRPLAY from Smirnov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and implies 6@H would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in our room|pg||
nt|stc: in fact he expect AQ @s in W !|pg||
mb|4H|nt|golfsquash: This is the par contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: low = odd count with honor or even without|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS play the cuebid as other Major + @d |pg||
nt|kingcur: 10 imps away for NL white on  4, when they didnt reach a rather obvious 4@S vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in Holland many top pairs play Michaels with known suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so partner can judge better if bidding gets high quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: will they reach 6@D?|pg||
nt|kingcur: and with his hand, N will not care too much what South's minor will be|pg||
mb|p|nt|sastro: meine Wahl wäre forcierende 2 Karo|pg||
nt|stc: 6@h is a complex contract(easy in DD)|pg||
nt|glen: well at least picking the "longest and strongest" from 4333 is easy|pg||
nt|glen: here though a @D lead would help declarer|pg||
nt|glen: (how to make 3 tricks with ATx opposite Q8x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = one round force|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: fritsche freut sich, endlich mal einen unkontrierten kontrakt spielen zu dürfen|pg||

nt|luffe12:  he came off very well this time - but not much to do |pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: it's a good contract i think|pg||
nt|stc: in fact you discard @c on @d and must start @h in the good direction|pg||
nt|stc: of course it is|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N very awkward |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = 15+ HCP  5+@D|pg||
nt|dimi: nice|pg||
nt|stc: with friendly @s you could even make 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: looks like -2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: not laydown by any means but worth trying|pg||
nt|stc: the first @h is the key of the play|pg||

nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  heard an interesting analysis last weekend |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov explained 1NT as " I may pass with 12"|pg||

nt|baldfriede: he must have smelled a rat|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he saw the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: probably :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that's why he smelled it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@D = any negative or natural|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: south: "yes, because I have the honors it looks like"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east:"oh thats nice"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right since 2@S would be non-force the only other choice was  DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW open 12-14 bal 1NT so the rebid shows the strong NT|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@h apparently shows 4@s too|pg||

nt|400 volt: Thomas Gotard jun. denkt auch darüber nach, ob er 3SA oder 4@S reizen soll|pg||
nt|glen: a typical hand that shows why partnership have a variety of raises for S hand, to help N make decisions if bidding gets high fast|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this 4@H C will only be a push i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c is 20-21 or any gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder's pass asks for a spade lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: theoretically it can be even 4@H-1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt is easier here than 4@H|pg||
nt|kingcur: N may have shown an unbalanced hand with 1S...then S should maybe convert to 2@C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|luffe12:  is the X for penalty here - dont think so|pg||
nt|luffe12:  is disagree in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is "make the right decision pard" kind of X |pg||
nt|glen: some play X is penalty, some X is two-way values, some X as I want to bid 5@H but you decide|pg||
pc|d6|nt|golfsquash: 1NT 15-17 and will accept the invitation|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|400 volt: das war die richtige Wahl|pg||
nt|stc: you need A@c on side and if not @d finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south has shown 14-16 with 1642 or 0643 shape|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s still some chance ..but others -with best defence hopeless --like this |pg||
nt|dimi: no X no trouble|pg||
nt|stc: something looks wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they do play 1@C-2@H 4-7hcp|pg||
nt|stc: Obviously w doesn't know about 4@s in E|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west took 2@H as 8-10 then|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, that's pretty obvious now|pg||
nt|dimi: yes that seems to be the explanation|pg||
pc|h9|nt|golfsquash: This is very thin|pg||
nt|golfsquash: west playing east for a better hand for change of suit after double|pg||
nt|sastro: das Single Karo ist fotographiert- da bietet sich 3 SA schon an|pg||
nt|sastro: 6 C ist ein ordentlicher Kontrakt, wird aber vorrausichtlich fallen, weil die Odds für Karoschnitt sprechen|pg||
nt|glen: best for N is to X first, then find out result, the claim X was a certain type of X|pg||
nt|luffe12:  5 looser hand by distribution - bid one more time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: that's a good tip glen, i'll keep it in mind :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i assume that NS use some kind of constructive major raises|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very tough to bid|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s was not good, 3NT is a disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks at the dummy and is kind of shoked, he obviously expected more :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "pfff"|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|golfsquash: 9 cold|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i hate to caught with only 3-card support, when supposed to have 4 - but the N hand is just 6 loosers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually, i think 3@S would show 5+@S and @H fit, but agree key feature is short @D rather than long @S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  anybody familiar with Ron Klingers ideas on the rules of Loosers Count|pg||
nt|stc: trump looks best now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|c4|nt|luffe12:  bergen raises would lead to 5@h i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: best you make sure you know what you are playing over interference|pg||
nt|luffe12:  S would bid 3@c rather than 2@h - promising 4card support|pg||
nt|glen: its a question whether to use a bergen raise on not: 4 trumps good, but quacks (queens/jacks) not good for playing the hand in a suit contract|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i fully support that - |pg||
nt|sybarra: it is only an 8 count of quacks, 3 @H was also a possibility  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play standard signals|pg||
nt|frankaus: not clear but gr8 switch|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir glaubt sogar 6-7 ... 4@h hätte minimum gezeigt|pg||

pc|c2|nt|400 volt: In Board 4 hat Martin Rehder 4@H sehr gut gespielt - 9 verdiente IMPs|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead of a small club would probably beat 6@H but it's not easy to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: anyway or bid and made 6@h so von alvensleben team will reassert the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  noreal chance here |pg||

nt|sastro: schwierige Entscheidung, was man am Tisch auf die nächsten Karorunden abwerfen soll|pg||
nt|stc: not very convincing sequence, missing a good slam and 12 IMP|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but knowing prd to have xxxx might change the N approach|pg||
nt|stc: A pair in control of the system may stretch to 3@s and play there|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|stc: wd, 4@s was a good save|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|stc: and here you can't score the 150 for 4 Aces|pg||

nt|santyclz: (break)|pg||
nt|stc: here the defense may make 3NT but for only 500|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: that way pard knows I have 4 @H's  |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|xenya: in the other room, a trump was led against 6@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: after orth chose to open 1@d, schüller was undissuadable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't imagine other table finding the 4@S save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also   too tired to figure out how bad 4@SX really scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: toilet break for west, its his 3rd during the match already|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i mean this segment...|pg||
nt|stc: 200 I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he have an escort?|pg||
nt|stc: they can ruff @d or open @c, both for 4 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: if defense nothing wrong they can collect in each suit 1 trick|pg||
nt|stc: but 10 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|golfsquash: at Pairs, he might have tried a second spade|pg||
nt|dimi: good contract bad distribution, no justice in the world|pg||

mb|p|nt|luffe12:  110!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stc: of course if you play slam on the same defense, the @d finesse is much better than the sqz, and you go down|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: i think you all know what 2@c is by now ;)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@C asks if 11-13 really has 14?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so 6@h is more friendly for the specs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = inverted, one round forcing raise, not 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  seems well judged by S: I will have a second chance, to show strong playing values|pg||
nt|stc: very interesting this one !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no, no escort, but he was quite fast and at least we are ahead of the other room, so those boards are not available anywhere|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h shows either @c as 2nd suit or a 3352|pg||

mb|4H!|nt|400 volt: jetzt wird Rohowsky keine Probleme mit dem Kontrakt mehr bekommen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N gets a chance to trump a @H in dummy he has a chance to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs W to play trump when in with @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you've watched NS play before   you KNEW Piek would bid 3@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: *3532|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: looks like they are going overboard here thanks to north opening his 8-count|pg||
nt|stc: loosing control|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: of course, north in the open room had it much easier after west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but i'm sure günther in his wildest dreams would not have thought of opening 1@h :)|pg||
nt|stc: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 2nd/4th   that means  from worthless doubleton lead LOW|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: teraz to juz szlemika powinni zagrac :) ale 4!t Andrzeja bardzo celne |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zgadzam siê z Tob¹ Kuba, ale teraz chyba ³atwie dolicytowaæ szlemika bêdzie|pg||
mb|5C|nt|golfsquash: and 2@s beatable but difficult|pg||
nt|glen: finally forced to admit holds @H Q|pg||
nt|dimi: anyway 2@c seems to be a good contract, while 3NT is not a make i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: you can make 4@h played on @s but not on @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: it looks very much like Tim Verbeek having learned all the relays by heart: as I said earlier, E is not Berend vd Bos' regular partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: eeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Igor nie doceni³ cue bidu kier partnera|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: chyba mu sie A schowal ...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|golfsquash: not beating it now|pg||
nt|stc: 1@h, 1@d, 1@c to loose|pg||
nt|kingcur: but despite the relaying, not landing at the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in a more natural system do you bid 1@s or 2@d on pds 1@h bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Tim Verbeek plays the same relay with his regular partner Danny Molenaar|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results: www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e trema - w koñcu to ich debiut w takiej rangi imprezie|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no running scores|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: yes, 4@H looks quite reasonable -- but not easy to play on this layout|pg||
nt|stc: I think you can try @s first, then @d if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@H, i fear is doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|glen: and after all of W's efforts to stay out of slam, E bids the grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes the ace of trumps is useful|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i suspect gro meant 4nt as exclusion keycard, rehder misunderstood|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stc: No, just finesse twice in @s|pg||
nt|stc: for 5@h+4@s+2@d = 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: declarer's shape is known exactly from the bidding, so the defense will hardly go wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: why, yes, of course:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder thinking, not schüller|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: meanwhile the imps start to roll in for the jamm team, 6 on  35|pg||
nt|jaapfr: about what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i don't know should i ask him? ;)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HTQ already played?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now schüller is thinking...|pg||
nt|stc: now even 2¨ds|pg||
nt|stc: 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl: "thats probably good news" after n showed out|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|glen: i think you are correct Michael, about 4NT as exclusion|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. was out of pass cards so had to use a double instead|pg||
nt|glen: for some expect partnerships, splinter then 4NT is exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  exclusion is tell me your aces outside of @D |pg||
nt|glen: *for some expert|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cc469: I'm referring of course to the previous hand|pg||
nt|stc: It is an interesting question : where the line between fairplay and "team interest" ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stc: he will make, when seeing the @d, will be force to play on @s finesse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has the @c6 prepared...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better not think too long then:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the thinking suggests he has @CKJ6 imo|pg||
nt|stc: this may be the match ball|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will N play the Q?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if small even down 2 looming|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: fairplay would say -4, strict rules -6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no they are discussing this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: -6 was clear for all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the heart has intentionally been played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S certainly tried to keep the kettle boiling for some psychological advantage with his remark|pg||
nt|dimi: well this really a tight match ... difficult situation for "fairplay" whatever this is in such a case|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: or at least something very similar|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kingcur: I'd bid 1@S, since 2@D invites pd to go over 3N with a fitting hand; and you're not strong enough to show @S in a reverse bid with this hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|luffe12:  ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sry, miscl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Piek 3@C bid certainly made things difficult for East|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stc: defense doing the job for him|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead helped a lot. Did E know S had the @S suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Rohowsky simply wanted not to spend to much time discussing about east-west system in a 2@C contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzzx: nothing was known about s hand, only relayed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzzx: west forcing declarer to guess whether to play on spades 3-3 or on diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E rescues N:(|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: now -2 |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H return can never win something imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gromöller says he expected @dJ from @dJ73|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would it make a diffrent if you had 15 insted?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzzx: yes i was right about the misunderstanding|pg||
nt|glen: -2 good, E goes "hey, slam wasn't making either"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 5@c showed 1 or 4 keycards and gro thought it was exclusion so must be @hA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|stc: assume a @c defense, dec will pull trumps, finesse once in @s, play @d and go back to @s...I think you are forced to find the right solution|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzzx: declarer claimed:|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "I pull trump and discard on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: this time its the fairplay case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he claimed before dia was lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzzx: NS let the claim through|pg||
nt|dimi: poor EW they have to recover and forget about the last boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west was cut of his spade winner and if he really pulled the trump he would be in dummy then|pg||

mb|2S|nt|mgb81: Hi Bas, I hope youll be able to tell us anything interesting that happens at the table|pg||
nt|mgb81: the redouble of 2C looks a bit risky to me - sometime north has J10xxx and -1000 is rarely a good score|pg||
nt|kingcur: as we can see in the results, 4 teams started off with max results of 25 first round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||

nt|stc: wow, why comenting I missed the play...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator job much harder than being player, nicht wahr??|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  38  [4@S-2]  Rohowsky playing 3N West!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: heavy 1@h-opening at the other table|pg||
nt|kingcur: not likely, andreas...I play reverses in answering hand a rock solid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakie +1 to nie umia³ wziac 13?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: claimed 1 trick for EW|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: back to bidding, I wonder if transfer then bid of @H's would have worked better |pg||
mb|d|nt|golfsquash: 1 Imp to Ireland, as 1NT survived in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: @s2 lead showed odd with honor or even without honor|pg||
nt|stc: 8 dangerous boards for them|pg||
mb|2D|nt|400 volt: hier zeigt 2@H auch wieder eine @S-Hebung, 4-8 Punkte in diesem Fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ns play 5-card majors, btw|pg||
nt|jaapfr: does he get away with that excuse:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: for gromöller-rehder 1@h would be systematic on the s cards|pg||
nt|runnerup:  8 tricks in nt but not so easy to stop below game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C shows biggest difference between NS Baltic Club and Polish Club|pg||
nt|stc: in other sports they will take a timeout|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Online players would, of course, both make and accept that claim.)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in the 6NT board Felmy - Khanukov had some strange auction leading to the 4-2 fit in spades and an overtrick..|pg||
nt|stc: many online players reject very obvious claims !!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|golfsquash: I'm told that north and west are regular partners!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they find 4@S?|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6 more imps to NL Red, with 4@S receiving a double and making +1 in other room on  6|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h forcing, but not yet GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: with spades breaking, this will cruise home|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so indeed it could be either @s32 or @sQ32|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: h+minor|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4@S sind in dieser Hand erfüllbar, ob man sie aber reizen sollte, ist fraglich|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@H zeigt vermutlich fit und 2@S könnte dann ein Versuchsgebot sein|pg||
nt|400 volt: ohne Fit spielen viele, dass nach Kontra das 2@H nicht mehr erzwungen wird|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Polish Club uses Precision 2@C opener with 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/1S|pg||
nt|stc: you mean !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget 6 -- get to 4@S first :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: wenn thomas jetzt aufkontriert, könnte das teuer werden|pg||
nt|santyclz: And then they wonder why no one wants them at their table...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|golfsquash: a heavy 1NT, so might have bid a spade on the way|pg||
nt|stc: but would W  return @s if starting with KQxx ?|pg||
nt|stc: fortunately the choosed the good 4-2 suit, @s and not @h|pg||
pc|hK|nt|luffe12:  sry - was interrupted by a Bridgemate Control problem..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 33 minutes left|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@D wd probably be nf for EW after 1@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cc469: I wonder why 1NT and not 2NT with 11 points ?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dimi: i think one of the most valuable quality of a top bridge player is to forget about every bad board at once after it was played|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: good question|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so I missed all the entertainement|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  3@D Stayman really helps|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s is not bad and makes, both options, @s/@d finesse are good|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stc: and risking to offer a fast @c discard ?|pg||
nt|stc: this is one of the points where professional players are much better then non-profi experts|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van den Bos when he put down his dummy: 'I hope I don't have too much :)'|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cc469: I think I would have not bid @Ss with 4333 shape and 4 weak @Ss|pg||
pc|cA|nt|400 volt: am anderen Tisch wurde west in 2@D kontriert.Udo Kasimir muss sich anstrengen, um den Verlust auf 2 IMPs zu beschränken|pg||
nt|stc: a desperate 7@d ?|pg||
nt|stc: the only grand you can make is 7@s BY NORTH !|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be disappointed if they reached 7 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @HQ is wasted value|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: declarer shows 2 suits lead trump is a fine method|pg||
nt|kingcur: a bit unlucky for EW in the other room to be stuck in 1@H: especially with opps NV, a hand with a short suit almost assures competitive bidding, after which you could show your ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: strength in rebound...not this time though|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sastro: Denke mal , dass 2 Pik den 4-4 Fit vorschlägt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben is out of pass cards|pg||
nt|stc: and of course 7NT|pg||
nt|stc: still loking for 7 on the Q@s ?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|stc: if you are in 7@s lightner Xed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: forgetting a bad board is easier said than done|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e-w are pure amateur players. n-s are at least experienced players in the international bridge scene|pg||
pc|cK|nt|400 volt: ich bin verwundert, dass Nord mit XX nicht gute @D gezeigt hat (falls verfügbar)|pg||
nt|400 volt: Süd hätte wohl nicht gepasst mit seiner Hand, aber 2@D ist tatsächlich erfüllbar von N/S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: an elaborate system like theirs should stop them from getting to a grand like this|pg||
nt|stc: looks like the first natural bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a @d back frmo the K now should beat this|pg||
pc|cT|nt|stc: indeed, fair enough|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe using normal responses to RKC after showing 0-4 hcp  is silly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|baldfriede: especially when opps rub it in, like Rohowsky did|pg||
nt|stc: he has to finesse here|pg||
nt|dimi: some kibs told me that they even forget about a bad board during playing it ... well :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Smirnov are the only two German (male) players who regullary play professional. Auken- von Arnim are the other professional pair we have|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4th toilet break for Matthias|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze werden sich wundern, warum Thomas Gotard seine Hand mit 12 Punkten nicht eröffnet hat. Das liegt an der sehr ausgeglichenen Verteilung und den wenigen Mittelkarten, ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: sodass sie für ihn nicht 12 Punkte wert war|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stc: so 6@d for -3 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north has shown 14-16, 2452 shape, two keycards and no @dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 38   3N made   i would have bet that both rooms would play 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT made in OR and now 32 with 10 results tom compare and a potential swing for the leading team(5@H-1)|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW picked their 4-4 @S fit here, the only denomination to have a chance at 10 tricks for game|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again north might get the chance to play a @d back again:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS use 2@C to show weak hand with 5+@H and 5+ other suit    [except in ACBL events]|pg||
nt|luffe12:  do u agree on pass by W? Never in a lifetime|pg||
nt|stc: JAMM can start packing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please stay in your seats until match comes to complete stop|pg||
nt|stc: one line of play : AK@s, run @c, finess @ds|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|nt|vugraphzzx: will try a showup squeeze i suspect|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, there's still a chance to go right|pg||
nt|kingcur: but not at all easy for S|pg||
nt|chmitty: would still make 10 tricks if he decides @s 4-1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzzx: now they were playing way too fast for my computer|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: did he really play that way?|pg||
nt|stc: +2 looks a bit too much|pg||
nt|xenya: i guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they played the board in 30 secs, i cant only click like one time in 3sec because of the connection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good bidding from Khanukov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is best line    without looking at NS hands|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|nt|stc: Yes, the doctors had very, very good results for non profis|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|stc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Wagner claimed he will score all tricks expect of one but he thought this would lead to just made, he miscounted tricks|pg||
nt|stc: As far as I know von Arnim is not a full time profi (school teacher ?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems  play for @S 32   and something good in @C or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2nd trump then @C|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d6|nt|kingcur: now @C in N...he can see the @D switch|pg||
nt|frankaus: neded N win @C and push @D|pg||
nt|kingcur: last chance now|pg||
nt|frankaus: too late i think|pg||
nt|kingcur: a warm welcome to Pierre Schmidt as well|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|stc: I think this is the best line|pg||
nt|chmitty: hi all :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|cc469: as a passed hand 2NT would be a perfect descriptor of hand value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pitching @D from dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I suggest no-1@c-1@s-1NT-2NT-3NT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|stc: combines Qx in @S with @C 3-3 and last hope @d hook|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mgb81: Oh thats odd|pg||
nt|mgb81: Back to 11 tricks then|pg||
nt|mgb81: East was playing for AJx and a misguess by declarer?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kingcur: still has to play @D to reach dummy, not?|pg||

nt|400 volt: und erneut 11 IMPs für das Team Alvensleben|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: toilet break for E...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we have two td here in Bad Honnef, one is sitting silently the other will assign penalties at the end of the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Leif  when do you think Schlicker should bid?|pg||
nt|dimi: i think ortwin needs a break|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: before the round Gromöller and Rohowsky were discussing because neither of them wanted to play, both felt tired|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can EW reach slam here?|pg||
nt|frankaus: last comming up tu all 4 ur company|pg||
nt|kingcur: with another chance on more, since 6@C looks very good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: I would bid 1@S if my hand looks suitable for a suit contract but this balanced hand looks NT oriented|pg||
nt|400 volt: Hier geht es im Kampf und den Teilkontrakt. Theoretisch kann Ost/West 4@H erfüllen, wird es aber wohl nicht reizen, aber 3@D oder 3@H könnte schon erreicht werden |pg||
nt|400 volt: Nord sollte maximal bis 2@S mithalten, was auch schon Probleme bereitet |pg||
nt|stc: almost 4@s here ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: something strange happened here in other room ... seems thay had a misunderstanding about the number of keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: looks like a phantom save in OR|pg||
nt|glen: (no idea why N played @S Q, but perhaps though E was ready to play the T)|pg||
nt|thetaker: but North will bid @S now |pg||
nt|andreasw:  is this 10 board matches?|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: will sail into 6@c|pg||
nt|400 volt: Nach @D K wäre es von Kasimir erfolgreicher gewesen, wenn er einfach Trumpf spielt - West muss dann @D in D10 spielen oder die @S|pg||
nt|stc: It's sad that EW are losing IMP's on such incidents...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after this round the von Alvensleben team might have similar problems |pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT version of multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 board per match|pg||
nt|chmitty: 5 matches today|pg||
nt|chmitty: the field has been divided into 6 teams "sections" for the first day|pg||
nt|kingcur: and if they bring in 6@C here, NL Red will be close to a max result in their first match of today|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: if kasimir were a solid citizen, jokisch might well bid 4@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp   only Walter the Walrus would count north as 7 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: need 1 more imp for 25-5|pg||
nt|chmitty: they will start a full "swiss" tomorrow with starting positions depending of today's results|pg||
mb|2C|nt|400 volt: das künstliche 2@D-Gebot gegen die Eröffnung von Nord hilft West sehr - er weiß jetzt, dass er die beste Hand hat, die er haben kann|pg||
nt|sastro: im polnischrn <Treff von der Verteilung her eine 2 Treff-Eröffnund- aber die Qualität spricht dagegen|pg||
nt|400 volt: alle Werte bis auf ein Ass in Partners Farben|pg||
nt|400 volt: Ja, und bei Gotard-Gotard ist die 2@C-Eröffnung keine reine "Precision-Eröffnung", sondern zeigt immer ein 6er@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke, thomas behandelt seine hand als schwachen sa|pg||
nt|sastro: 2|pg||
nt|400 volt: Rohowsky fragt sich sicherlich, ob 4@H hier gehen können|pg||
nt|stc: but defense must play @d early to beat 4@h, if not E is endplayed in @d|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but check the result, was probably +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4@D 4@C, EW always open 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but afterwards they needed longer to count the tricks as to play the hand before. they agreed on 10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  after 1@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  6 [3N=]  von Alvensleben playing 2@D South    so STILL no pushed boards|pg||
nt|dimi: 4@h is a nice spot for NS|pg||
nt|stc: This hard week-end is a good trial before a two weeks competition as noticed by specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: would also expced 1@S from north|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they are systematicly allowed to bid 1@S or 1@H on 3 cards if no other bid fits well|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or if they fear to wrongside a NT contract by bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: in the open room, Aarnout Helmich in N threw in a 2@S bid over 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Da aber Fritsche nicht 2@H eröffnet hat (mindestens 5er @H und 4er+ Unterfarbe, unter Eröffnungsstärke), ist das ein Argument dagegen|pg||
nt|400 volt: Ob man jetzt aber West oder Ost den letzten Trumpf gibt, ist fraglich. Spielt man Trumpf und Ost hält ihn, hat man den Kontrakt verspielt, da man @S-Schnitt nicht mehr machen kann|pg||
nt|glen: modern bidding, S gets to open worst suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: I prefer 1 @D promises 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: benjamin 2@d|pg||
nt|cc469: p can bid @Ss himself if he has distribution that makes a suit contract look more attractive from his pov than NT|pg||
nt|stc: that NS "produced" an almost impossible extra trick, wd :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzzx: i could not hear souths explaination but 2@S can show several at least invitational hands|pg||
nt|kingcur: after which EW actually have an easy way to get to 6@C, but as said, sth seems to have gone wrong after that when it came to keycard asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: misprint|pg||
nt|golfsquash: the equivalent of 2@c in most natural systems|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@C ist ein partieforcierendes Relay und fragt|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich weiß leider nicht, was die weiteren Gebote heißen, bin mir aber sicher, dass Nord Süd über die Verteilung und Punkte ausfragt|pg||
nt|sybarra: even if only 2 @C |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: don't worry they open 1@c on 4342 as well :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is agreement/style etc |pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  take it back - second round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D-2@S would be 4-7 HCP, so this sequence is constructive|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lead of  = attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why 2@S was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: either from 4 or 5 cards with an honor|pg||
nt|stc: looks like making 1@s 4@h 3@c at least|pg||
nt|luffe12:  on  9 would u guys give up at 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east asking, north "2nd/4th" ah "nooo attitude"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east "thats better!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the final board of this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: our next match will be Israel - Czech Republic|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzyf: that match will start at 15.20 local time. That is in 20 minutes from now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|400 volt: In dem anderen Halbfinale hat der eine Tisch 7@H erreicht und erfüllt, während der andere Tisch in 4@H gestrandet ist|pg||
nt|glen: i like systems where 1@C is natural or balanced, so I like the NS modern bidding|pg||
nt|chmitty: if 3@s shows shortness in the suit, they are on good tracks here also|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: supposedly i played attitude leads for a long time with one partner [his choice] -- but turns out he always assumed 4th|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: i znow dziwne ze N nie otworzyl uklad 44 na starszych na drugiej rece powinien zachecic zdecydowanie |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@h vermutlich forcierend, 4@d hätte 4@h erzwungen um in partie zu bleiben|pg||
pc|s3|nt|400 volt: ich denke 7@H sollte man nicht reizen, aber 6@H sieht nach einem sehr gutem Schlemm aus|pg||
nt|xenya: i weould love to be in 4@H on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north semi claiming|pg||
nt|kingcur: W actually has a fine hand for an old fashioned 1@C-3@S splinter bid, but nowadays that bid is often used to show suit, not shortness|pg||
pc|s6|nt|golfsquash: no trump finesses now Derek!|pg||
nt|cc469: safest contract is 6@C but hard to get to a slam in a suit that has never been bid :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: should East have shown 2-suiter immediately over 1@D?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|stc: 1@s is a safe contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: This will not make|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and 2 down is a possibility.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: N thinking|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If south had raised earlier to 3@h, that might have ended the matter|pg||
nt|golfsquash: earlier Ireland had a 6@s contract depending on playing trumps for no loser missing Qxxx. A seconround fimesse was taken after all followed.|pg||
nt|kingcur: but they got there, well done|pg||
nt|kingcur: the play should be too hard|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzzx: actually they play very old-fashioned polish club|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H was a touch aggresive|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to see cash of @H a now |pg||
nt|sybarra: @S ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has it at his thumb but is thinking some more|pg||
nt|glen: -200 is nice too, deciding if he can afford not to cash now|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: to fasten up the play he tells west what he will play in the next few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the 600 board has now been scored against some normal contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chmitty: tough start in the competition for Netherlands White, sure they will recover |pg||
nt|kingcur: which brings us to the end of this first round and allows me to thank Dennis Stuurman for the excellent VU graph work|pg||
nt|kingcur: and my fellow commentators for their wisdom and wit|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: next round will be in 12 minutes|pg||
nt|chmitty: tx Dennis :) good job|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: bye|pg||
nt|kingcur: see you soon|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump best now|pg||
nt|kingcur: same lead as in other room, and it will likely result in 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|400 volt: Kasimir ist auf dem Weg in den Großschlemm - Jokisch wird aber wohl jegliches Interesse verneinen|pg||
nt|sybarra: better part of valour?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stc: why, you have almost no play|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cc469: this only makes because @Hs are 3-3 - 36% slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: *valor|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder surprised|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzzx: 12 imps for JAMM that is|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the extra 2 tricks produced 1 additional imp.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4@H has play too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: last time in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekarek played polish leads all his life|pg||
nt|santyclz: When you look at it that way, it's easier to forget the bad results -- same as an undoubled overtrick.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: but it does look unmakeable|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|stc: 3NT -6 gave 12, -4 would have been -11, just 1 IMP|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: in theory at least|pg||
nt|luffe12:  they duly found the @c ruff on  23 - mainly because N bid 5@c in the process|pg||
nt|kingcur: Thanks to Dannis Stuurman for the excellent vugraph work|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: claim|pg||
pc|cK|nt|golfsquash: Or is it 38% and add Jx as well|pg||
nt|400 volt: time to claim 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sastro: optimal despielt von Roland|pg||
nt|dimi: what is the save play in @d, cashing KA in @d and then let a @d from S or double finesse in @d after cashing the A|pg||
nt|kingcur: Dennis too|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: Piek originally from Poland   Smirnov from Russia|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky will show us the best play soon I guess :)|pg||
nt|dimi: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: King and then low to the 7?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzzx: now he has some option in clubs|pg||
nt|dimi: 2@c was a winner for 4 imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|golfsquash: 2 down, can't unravel the clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there any native Germans on the team??|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: so NS did well to stop and EW in OR made the phantom save and lost the IMPs|pg||
nt|stc: 28-28 in this segment|pg||
nt|baldfriede: sorry, we will have lunch here now. I have to stop|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzzx: all others this time...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzyf: thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|kingcur: see you in 20 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results will be on www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then 'competitie'' |pg||
