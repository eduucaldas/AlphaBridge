nt|runnerup:  can you bid grand here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hampson so strong he has choices  to ask 2N, start with @D or [don't count on it] splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might even just ask about keycards|pg||
nt|bt: we will see, as i remember hampson-greco plays meckwellish|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what does everyone think about 1N rather than raising @S |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: No, but they can get a bye to the R8 of the Trials by (I think) winning this match - I know winning the event is enough :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: And the amazing Falk team has also earned a bye to the Round of 16 of the Trials and can earn a R8 bye if they win today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think west has tough choice    4333 certainly suggests NT   hand too good for just 2@S  and maybe not offensive enough for 2@D|pg||

nt|runnerup:  same bidding up to point where west had 9 points and here put to 4 @h -other table passed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: laughter at table about Greco finally going down and something about J98 needs some luck|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: yes they do try to determine who is responsible for time delay|pg||

nt|runnerup:  open hand 6 @s easi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 3@H bid worked really well here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  or 7 @s if you guess all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: We should be back about 10-15 minutes after the other table finishes, but maybe not if the other match is slower - we have to wait for both matches to start to start the Vugraph|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11[5@DE-4]   other table  3@C-all pass|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: Hampson 3@H really was a winner here|pg||
mb|3H|an|very strong one suiter|nt|ahollan1: in other match   Grue had toy over 2@H  as east he bid 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D showing a strong 4@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they got to 7@S vs 6@S now being played in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D specifically for @S  let Cheek cooperate with 4N RKC|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: 3@H is asking partner to bid 3nt with a stop, usually|pg||
mb|p|an|forcing|nt|athene: you might then pull it to show a big 1-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people use this with a monster 1 suiter with a void in opps' suit|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|athene: that does not want to make a takeout double in case it's passed|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: (1M)-3M asking for stop  much more common than (2M)-3M, isn't it Nik?|pg||
mb|p!|nt|athene: i'm told Joe Grue read the cards to make 7@S from the east seat on this hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: cash one trump then take a ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done to get to 6@S   and again credit for swing to Hampson for his opening 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true -- he hasn't made 6@S yet|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if moss promises a heart void with this sequence|pg||
nt|athene: i mean gitelman must be fairly sure of it anyway, even absent agreements|pg||
nt|ritong: opponent's bidding does|pg||
nt|athene: people sometimes bid higher than the Law says you should, but not THAT much higher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: law breakers must be punished !!!|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's a pretty good rule that the cue then bidding your suit shows a void in opps' suit|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what Moss would have bid over a multi-2@D|pg||
nt|athene: with no anchor suit to cue|pg||
nt|athene: declarer knows south must surely have some spade as he bid 5@H on three|pg||
nt|athene: *have some SHAPE|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|ritong: oy|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to ask about play after @CK|pg||
nt|athene: well, he can still survive|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|s6|nt|dburn: how?|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry not now :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: something similar to this!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: he played the ace too quickly|pg||
mc|11|nt|Vugraphzfb: no, he wanted it back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: back soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky here   even if @CA @C better|pg||
