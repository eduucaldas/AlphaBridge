nt|vugrapha3: please note Bill I upgraded from kiddies to juniors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: such progress|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: loool|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: last deal shd b a sure loss of 5 or 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzaw: INDIAN MAVERICKS|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1N because of constructive raises, i presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: will they reach the cold 4h|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|allysophia: I'm not entirely sure its fair to call them the juniors.. when you look at  Fiona Brown who must be all of 26 on team Hanlon|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: here we go...another one loool|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6NT is ponly a fair contract, but 6@D is excellent|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|allysophia: and noone would ever accuse Mike Ware of being anything resembling |pg||
nt|allysophia: "mature"|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: FORMIDABLES|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3@HX would be 300 |pg||
nt|mohitz:  the best result for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: you do know Ally that these comments are recorded ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lool..stop it Bill|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but prajwal is unlikely to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What you really meant was:  "Michael Ware has wonderfully youthful looks"|pg||
nt|mohitz:  with just two rags in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Anyone know what N/S are doing?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: may be slam now?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzaw: SHEKHAR BANERJEE,S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|jain: hmm|pg||
nt|mohitz:  NK had a tough initial bid, ideally he would like to get both minors in, but Kx in spades meant he could not X|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mohitz:  diamonds would have played better|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|allysophia: that goes without saying (Ware's youthful good looks)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: I think North has 1430'd in clubs and now asked for @CQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think maybe they have set the wrong suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and perhaps Smirnov wouold have been better off bidding 3@D over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this will be a VERY important board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but of course I am just guessing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|subhranp:  will have to finnesse clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugrapha3: Alex alerted the 5h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so it must mean something for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The good thing is that diamonds is the "boss" suit, at least of the minors.  Smirnov knows about the 8-card fit there|pg||
nt|mohitz:  can make this now if diamonds can be guessed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is clear now...missunderstanding in bidding|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Great work Geo!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and a spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was clearly the indicated lead ... but that's easy to type.  It's not easy to do in the heat of battle|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Specs don't like 3@C, and I understand that, but I think 3@C was ok ...|pg||

nt|mohitz:  declarer knows East has 4621 shape|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
mc|10|nt|rishabh:  with no @h lead,|pg||
nt|rishabh:  @d Q likely with E|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea, East is likely to have AQ@H, K@C|pg||
nt|mohitz:  so, needs to have Q@D to justify opening|pg||

nt|rishabh:  might have given a shot with 2@s game try|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i think this result will  duplicated|pg||
nt|mohitz:  we will see|pg||
nt|rishabh:  W had an extra trump|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rishabh:  lets see if NK overcalls|pg||
nt|mohitz:  partscore battle|pg||
nt|vicky888: NK's overcalls are very strong|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rishabh:  he didn't :)|pg||
nt|rishabh:  i like responding with an Ace|pg||
nt|mohitz:  operator, can you confirm EW basic system?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i think they play precision(not sure)|pg||
nt|vicky888: with an ace and 4 carder in P's suit...i will never pass this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I don't think Smirnov-Griffiths have had a lot of experience playing together.  It looks like they succumbed to a Standard American confusion|pg||
nt|serhat: yes I think so|pg||
mb|2D|nt|georgia19: Frances Hinden did very well on board 2, keeping out of an awful game despite a combined 25 count|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: 15 imp penalty dsm|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Srini says EW do play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  that explains the pass|pg||
nt|vicky888: then, it makes sense to pass|pg||
nt|mohitz:  odd choice of balancing by prajwal|pg||
nt|rishabh:  hard for Prajwal too|pg||
mb|3D|nt|serhat: may be 5nt was better for choice of a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  if balancing, X was definitely better|pg||
nt|rishabh:  NS missed a good 4@h game here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: I'm getting some complaints from standard Americans|pg||
nt|mohitz:  especially considering that NK's overcalls are very strong|pg||
nt|mohitz:  how will you make 4@H?|pg||
nt|rishabh:  yeah not on this lie|pg||
nt|vicky888: NK knows they are in a inferior contract, but he isnt sure which is the correct suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: sorry guys|pg||
nt|subhranp:  just to repeat for those who have logged in late: Indian Mavericks, Formidables, Shekhar Banerjee, Hemant Jalan, Grub Club, Maya Mera Sneha, DSM, Ladies team are the qualifiers|pg||

mb|p|nt|mohitz:  life would have been so much simpler with a 'normal' 1@H overcall|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|vicky888: counting on the Qx, prajwal has gambled for that 3nt|pg||

nt|rishabh:  @d K asking for count would be the best bet for defense|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Double = 3 hearts, no doubt|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yep|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Griffiths asked and he got 3 fingers|pg||

nt|subhranp:  a big gain for DSM on Board-1 as Hemant Jalan pair in the other room having a disaster.|pg||
nt|mohitz:  20.85|pg||
nt|mohitz:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Ax+KQJT8+Ax+AT9x|pg||
nt|rishabh:  yes 4 loser hand,|pg||
nt|mohitz:  great to see prajwal bidding 2@H|pg||
nt|mohitz:  instead of one of those 4 card raises|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: E/W have 25 points but it's hard to find a sensible game contract for them|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: Maybe 4@H|pg||
nt|subhranp:  good hand for defence|pg||
nt|subhranp:  EW going overboard here|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i tried so hard to convince him to dump them|pg||
nt|mohitz:  never agreed with me :)|pg||
nt|rishabh:  2@h bid has a problem, that it lets opponent bid 3@h in this caes|pg||
nt|vicky888: 4 carder bergen raises promise a offensive shape, he had no such shape|pg||
nt|mohitz:  alright |pg||
nt|mohitz:  so now, it is upto NK to fetch this.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mohitz:  on the lie, it looks like itwont|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh now it will|pg||
nt|vicky888: spade lead would have put arvind at ease|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|serhat: now they can bid their 4-3 fit 4@H game|pg||
nt|subhranp:  South needs to switch to heart and find the spade switch frm partner|pg||
nt|subhranp:  but NS have to defend well here, they need to find the heart ruff immdeately|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mohitz:  now, NK can ruff two clubs |pg||
nt|rishabh:  it should now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: This is makeable, but it won't (I predict)|pg||
nt|serhat: well tough one now. Geo could have bid 3D I believe|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer has to take an a-priori inferior play in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lol...thats nice bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Running the diamond jack works beautifully to neutralize 10x in South|pg||
nt|steshome: Hinden stretching for a non-vul game here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|georgia19: bit thin for 3NT, but they have 24HCP between them, do you fancy Graham to get this on the card?|pg||
nt|steshome: I think Sime will duck the first heart and in time collect 2@H tricks and 3@D tricks - i don't think Hinden should move. No fitting cards in partner's suit|pg||
nt|steshome: Georgia, have England won with a match to go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: yes well done|pg||
nt|steshome: Perhaps E/W have a glass of wine each at the table?|pg||
nt|georgia19: yes indeed, 30 clear of 2nd|pg||
nt|steshome: Excellent - well done England!|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: Not celebrating yet!|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: But playing ace and king picks up Qx in North AND South, so is theoretically twice as good|pg||
nt|rishabh:  @s J looked normal lead here|pg||
nt|rishabh:  after partner's double|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|georgia19: they'll want to beat Scotland if they can|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if manoj had preserved his 98x of trumps, he would have been able to ruff with 8 and 9 and score a trump trick, apart from a diamond, a spade and a club|pg||

nt|serhat: so they might bid it the other room|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: and South is not being very cooperative here|pg||
nt|mohitz:  meanwhile, MMS has picked up one more imp|pg||

nt|serhat: Nye is sorry for 2d bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He spent the rest of the auction backtracking.  Surely he owed partner a 4@H bid over 4@C|pg||
nt|serhat: because he didnt have real 2d bid. may be 3c better there|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so the match is getting closer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, 6@C is not the world's greatest contract, so hard to criticize|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||

nt|bjacobs: yeah ... whatever the right contract, I do think it's wrong for South not to make a heart cue-bid when his partner sets clubs for cue-bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In a way, his partner set clubs TWICE ... that's a pretty strong indication that he is slam minded|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|josj: I wonder if this one will be found - probably not as W has a few spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|josj: W cannot resist temptation with his 4-4M|pg||
mb|3C|nt|josj: but I lost the board temporarily and so did all of us|pg||
mb|4C|nt|josj: EW will be overboard now|pg||
mb|d|nt|josj: NS are close to entering the danger zone now|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: either major will yield an extra trick but that's no. 7 :) :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: declarer might gain some tempos if S does not play a club in time|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|josj: maybe it will return before the close of play|pg||
nt|josj: @S 3-3, @DK well placed, should be not too complicated for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: @C10 offering a later finessing position too|pg||
nt|josj: but all ends well|pg||

nt|vugraphzaw: south dropped @dk|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: sry west|pg||
nt|rishabh:  hmm|pg||
nt|mohitz:  NS can make 4@S/5@C |pg||
nt|rishabh:  i was thinking about 6@s|pg||
nt|mohitz:  6@S even|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|subhranp:  this time a slam for EW|pg||
nt|rishabh:  and 7@c probably|pg||
mb|3C|nt|serhat: an other slam|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2D is multi only weak option|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and not easy for E/W, after the multi|pg||
nt|serhat: W has very good hand though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So does East, but it's still difficult.  For example, any suggestions on what East should do here?|pg||
nt|serhat: 3D= if forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: they will at most be in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3@D doesn't look forcing to me|pg||
nt|serhat: well may be 2nt =not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of the problems with this auction is that E/W don't know South's suit.  Hence they have no easy cue-bids|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: I got stuck with exactly this problem in the NEC recently.  I had to guess ... wrongly as usual|pg||
nt|subhranp:  scores level in this segment so far 5-5 so maya meera continue to lead by 24 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: E bid 1@s before N, N called director and then comes up with dbl. 1@s stands for E |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rishabh:  2@s looks like an underbid|pg||
nt|vicky888: suppressing the clubs wasnt the best bid in such a distributional hand|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not really|pg||
nt|rishabh:  5 loser hand, i will bid at least 3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|serhat: was forcing Bill!:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here Sveindal has guessed rightly|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: wow|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it's remotely forcing.  But it's certainly constructive, and certainly at least a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: flat board|pg||
nt|georgia19: NS playing strong NT so EW find spade fit.....cards badly placed for them|pg||
nt|steshome: E/W play 2@S bid by Hinden as showing the weakest hnad for an o/call in preference to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp:  North and East are screen mates?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|serhat: lets say contstructive plus!|pg||
nt|georgia19: EW heading for a minus, but lead has helped.....|pg||
nt|steshome: odd lead it seems|pg||
nt|subhranp:  another gain for DSM on B5, as 3NT is misdefended in the othe room.|pg||
nt|vicky888: so much for the grands|pg||
nt|mohitz:  wasn't expecting this|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzaw: INDIAN MAVERICKS VS  LADIES TEAM|pg||
nt|rishabh:  S has to accept this invitation|pg||
nt|rishabh:  underbidded twice|pg||
nt|mohitz:  this will be 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  depending on how he plays clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: ok, let's|pg||
nt|georgia19: yes, why not a club....|pg||
nt|steshome: the heartless negative double of 1@S would not meet with universal approval but what else can north do in a strong NT structure?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rishabh:  he should finesse|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vicky888: playing in 3 spades he is fee to innovate any line of play for clubs|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|georgia19: I know S bid hearts, but it just looks too dangerous to lead from that holding|pg||
pc|hT|nt|subhranp:  this lead is favourable for declarer, can even make 3 now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mohitz:  Ace of club to protect against K stiff offside|pg||
nt|rishabh:  well|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|serhat: 1 imp possible now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|serhat: but not now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|steshome: still, more imps to Scotland|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mohitz:  its a safety play in case you can lose one trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c2|nt|rishabh:  @d A wasn't the smartest play|pg||
nt|mohitz:  he can lose as many as he wants as vicky said :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzaw: FORMIDABLE VS GRUB CLUB|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rishabh:  @h ruff was a good entry|pg||
nt|rishabh:  but yes|pg||
nt|rishabh:  he is 3@s, so he can play as he likes :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  probably, justifying his underbid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rishabh:  makes partner feel better instead of making 12 tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  wont feel good to make 12 tricks after having just bid 3@S :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  anyway|pg||
nt|mohitz:  +200|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|dQ|pc|c9|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: probably this one flat as well|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzaw: yes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|serhat: not just me|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: saved them|pg||

nt|steshome: do you prefer 1@S chosen by jagger in the other room, or 2@H, georgia?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: i forgot they play vvery strong overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yeah, it's horrible, but I think West was asleep at the wheel. |pg||
nt|georgia19: should be a close call to make this one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mohitz:  might make is|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|serhat: He didnt see his 7.5 tricks hand properly|pg||

nt|mohitz:  they are killing the mavs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mohitz:  (slowly)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rishabh:  2@c bid on board 6 didn't let opps find their @h fit|pg||

nt|steshome: I quite agree |pg||
nt|steshome: Is there another set after this one?|pg||
nt|georgia19: 1@s nf so could be left in a 5-1 fit which is silly when you know you have a heart fit|pg||
nt|steshome: Ah, good point|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: Board 8 of 32|pg||

nt|steshome: that's why i don't like this 4@S bid with no aces|pg||
nt|steshome: and the lack of 3 trumps!|pg||
nt|mohitz:  surprising really|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: Very sad result for E/W who were having a very nice set up till then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sveindal might be saying: "I didn't expect you to be that strong, hence my pass".  So technically, the blame goes to the partnership|pg||
nt|rishabh:  strange to see that in the final|pg||
nt|vicky888: on board 7?|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: ahh W.. no I dont agree with you.. I blame E . 2d can be anything. he has no @D fitno good clubs or H|pg||

nt|serhat: at least he could have rdbled|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|georgia19: but was the E hand really worth a jump, may be 5-5 but only a 7 count in HCP|pg||
mb|2H|nt|georgia19: this is not much better.....|pg||
nt|georgia19: what now E?|pg||

nt|vugraphzxu: Contract is 3NT to W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vicky888: possibility is they are all fatigued and avoiding the adventures of cards|pg||

nt|rishabh:  probably it got passed around|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|serhat: might dbl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: might bid 5@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|steshome: after heart to the ace and one back, Hinden needs to overtake the K@C and play a spade to the 9 to make. |pg||
nt|mohitz:  back to this board|pg||
nt|rishabh:  some like to open 1@d with this hand|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not the best lead|pg||

nt|bjacobs: So he could double 4@H, play @SA, @S4, @HA, spade, down up front|pg||
nt|subhranp:  declarer has 14 tricks unless north can find diamond lead|pg||
nt|mohitz:  two rounds of diamonds and ruff a dia with ten @S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  defense will get a heart and three spades i reckon|pg||
nt|rishabh:  that's what S is going for|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: @CA in the middle|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Milne team is very close to win now|pg||
nt|georgia19: just an everyday play for her.......:)|pg||
nt|steshome: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  GIB might make this hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: only 5 imps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That would have been 500 for 9 imps|pg||
nt|rishabh:  @d J changed the plans, in cases @ds are 5-1|pg||
nt|vicky888: arvind is not sure now...what is S doing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|steshome: Silly duck of the spade now Hinden cannot go wrong|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|georgia19: can just play spades now |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|subhranp:  good lead, saves the OT|pg||
nt|mohitz:  mavericks have opened their ghada too :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vicky888: why wouldnt manoj ruff it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rishabh:  RV didn't feel like making his partner feel better and went for 4 overtricks :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The danger with the double is if it chases the opponents to 4@S, but you have defence against that contract, via the forcing plays|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mohitz:  in situations like these, the best defense is to punch declarer and make him lose control. Unfortunately for the defense, they don't have any threatening suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|steshome: She'll cash the clubs and diamond to the Jack. South cannot have the Ace of Diamonds or they would rise and cash out|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|georgia19: all over, well done|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|steshome: Much harder if South had won A@S immediately - she might then have finessed into the Jack?|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: another 3h-1 lol|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: popular|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so Serhat you like the maxim: "only Jesus saves"|pg||
nt|steshome: If Frances had got that diamond wrong, I would have been surprised|pg||
nt|georgia19: it was the pause that got me,|pg||
nt|subhranp:  meanwhile shekar banerjee have reduced the deficit with 10imp pickup on B18|pg||
nt|subhranp:  14imp diff with 5 boards to compare. still close enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  3@C overcall seems routine|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|georgia19: EW never found @h fit in open room, looks like same here...|pg||
nt|steshome: Good to see E/W still focussing even though they have won the event with a match to go.|pg||
nt|mohitz:  would have bid 3@D with Arvind's hand|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: really?|pg||
nt|georgia19: England hate to lose to Scotland|pg||
nt|steshome: Welcome back, all|pg||
nt|mohitz:  where did that 3N come from?|pg||
nt|vicky888: too ambitious 3nt|pg||
nt|rishabh:  NK gambling a bit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|serhat: would Jesus save any contracts or only making once?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is not what Rodwell had in mind for a "support double"|pg||
nt|vicky888: hoping opps wont find the dia defence|pg||
nt|mohitz:  4@S a way better contract |pg||
mb|4S|nt|rishabh:  with 3 card @c support, i have found lots of success in such contracts|pg||
nt|rishabh:  with 2 card, never :)|pg||
nt|vicky888: one loser in every suit there as well|pg||
nt|mohitz:  of course, 4@S is down too but it is a way better contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: i took out the explanation...my norwegian not very good|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp:  aggresive 1h by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|rishabh:  yes requires any one finesse|pg||
nt|vicky888: manoj knows what 4 of heart means|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|serhat: Ware needs 2 miracles after this board.. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And his 4@S bid was fairly undisciplined|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vicky888: 5 more for defence|pg||
nt|vicky888: thats 3nt by EW|pg||
nt|rishabh:  NK can keep it to down 4|pg||
nt|mohitz:  on board 9, mavericks are in 3@D |pg||
nt|rishabh:  should be big swing for mavs this board|pg||
nt|mohitz:  which is likely to go down|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|serhat: W has a good hand. K is a vaste.. thats all.. it is somewhere between for me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, if he had bought @HA instead of @HK, 4@S is in with a fighting chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still 3@S was not in any way invitational.  East had a double of 3@H available as an invite|pg||
nt|serhat: or no K@H A@D|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mohitz:  some more imps for MMS|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mohitz:  yea, but let opponent take his time|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: not really as 3@s were first time, but ok|pg||
nt|serhat: why not just 1s ? I dont understand the gain of those 4plus major bids.. |pg||
nt|subhranp:  4s on for NS but dont have the values to reach there|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and then call the director|pg||
nt|mohitz:  "SLOW PLAY"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888: i bet NK is hungry by this time... and is in no mood for such calls|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The way I play, 1@S is used to deny spades|pg||
nt|serhat: when you have a chance to show 5 cards bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Various approaches are valid ... you just have to choose one of them|pg||
nt|subhranp:  3 imps to Shekar banerjee on B20. So lead now down to 11imp with 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|rishabh:  interesting pass by E|pg||
nt|mohitz:  what if prajwal passes this|pg||
nt|rishabh:  yeah :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|georgia19: 50% diamond slam here|pg||
nt|rishabh:  2@d looks like any 1 major|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mohitz:  yes, 2@D is one major|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|grebrof: I can agree with that - I guess 1@s over 1@h is 1nt with no stopper|pg||
nt|mohitz:  would have thought prajwal would bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  decided 2@H is enough|pg||
nt|vicky888: well, EW have to play in 3nt... 4@h will have no chance on spade lead|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3@S artificial game forcing bid |pg||
nt|rishabh:  3@s asking for @s stop,|pg||
nt|vicky888: penalising 2@s would also have fetched 500|pg||
nt|rishabh:  3NT by W should settle the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: yes|pg||
nt|georgia19: has S limited his hand?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: this is flat board|pg||
nt|georgia19: :)|pg||
nt|steshome: I don't think so - I like playing 1@D - 2@D - 2@H here showing a weak NT when I play strong and 5|pg||
nt|georgia19: wonder why they made 12 in NT next door|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|steshome: If West discards a club at any point, East is squeezed in the blacks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rishabh:  will be a push board|pg||
pc|s2|nt|georgia19: 12 tricks in diamonds, 11 in NT - I'm searching for a reason.....|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sure looks that way ... maybe there is an imp to be had|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|grebrof: S has a nice hand for Ns @s|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 4000|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we have to thank all the comentators and to abf for bringing the event to us|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hmm, that's more challenging|pg||
nt|steshome: I have noticed a few 6-5 hands this weekend and people opening a 5 card Major ahead of a 6 card Minor - hate it. What do you think Georgia?|pg||
nt|subhranp:  opportunity for Hemant Jalan here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: sry miss|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: 4 @s is contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp:  6h on for them|pg||
mb|1C|mb|3S|nt|georgia19: I like to open 6 before 5, BUT sometimes, I let the suit quality decide - some suits can be treated as one shorter if they're awful.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|subhranp:  2d probably multi|pg||
nt|mohitz:  very slow this room|pg||
nt|vicky888: always 3nt making here|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome: I wonder if 2@D is F1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: Nabil made double win this year. well done..|pg||
nt|georgia19: T'other day I opened 1@d on a NICE 5 card suit with 5 little spades, it worked fine, this time...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  EW and South are pretty slow players|pg||
nt|rishabh:  they might play in 5@c/5@d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  NK took a lot of time too today |pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other room are playing the last bd now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  we have 4 remaining|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *is|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: well if it's not it could be messy|pg||
nt|subhranp:  2nt should be asking, west will show weak hands in hearts|pg||
nt|subhranp:  incidentally NS also make 4s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: right ... he won the pairs with Ash Bach?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  precision opening, so, 2@C is 5-4 either way |pg||
pc|h2|nt|serhat: is this first win of Milne team? |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mohitz:  2@H game forcing artificial bid|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thx all for watching this great event|pg||
pc|d5|nt|steshome: Are you dumb?|pg||
nt|subhranp:  opportunity lost here. |pg||
nt|mohitz:  2N, i have hearts stopped|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3@C, we have a fit in clubs |pg||
nt|mohitz:  might play in 5@C true|pg||
nt|mohitz:  that will make too|pg||
nt|mohitz:  no sweat|pg||
pc|d3|nt|allysophia: thanks vugraph Traian!|pg||
nt|serhat: thank you all.. congrats both team.. they tired their hardest.. but Milne won.. |pg||

nt|steshome: Sorry - private chat|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vicky888: yeah lucky lie of dias|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|allysophia: Traian gets kickbacks obviously|pg||
pc|d4|nt|georgia19: I think 3NT was easier, this could go off, but only on a spade lead -|pg||
nt|steshome: easy to make now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugrapha3: noooooooo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|subhranp:  so DSM will go into the next set with 24imp lead|pg||
nt|vicky888: it wasnt a biddable slam Subs|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||

nt|rishabh:  they have had their opportunities in this set, but unfortunately haven't made most of them|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: But they'll pick up 2 more for -50|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mohitz:  Arvind will be sweating a little |pg||
nt|mohitz:  he needs to get diamonds right |pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Although ... West is a little bit endplayed here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Only a "little" endplayed because the diamond play works|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: cheers all|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry..missed play but he made it|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: another slam...|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: a grand slam on a finesse is not so good in general but with an indication of the finesse being right, the pattern changes|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: W holding some useful cards, in that case...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|josj: so just 3 losers|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2NT asked for the minor suit so i assume they play that as 5 5|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: i was thinking that in 3rd seat there is a case for S to open 2@H rather than 1@H|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
