nt|vugraphzzx: players decided to take 15 minutes more break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final 16 boards of the trials|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: hello everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, hello everyone|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|tomi2: first question, Milan you probably know more - isnt Michal Kopecky too old for juniors? you cant be juniors all of your life! :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I am here to help you understand the bidding of the Czech pair, both players are my regular partners|pg||
nt|tomi2: I remeber I played against Michal and you back in 2006 and unfortunatly I bacame older since that :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, he turned 26 this year. He is more a playing coach of the rest of the team |pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that does give you access to Open Room Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|stc: one big swing difference, the match is open|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the TD stopped punishing such behaviour after both teams agreed. so there are no more time penalties in the final|pg||
mb|1N|nt|400 volt: Guten Abend allerseits|pg||
nt|400 volt: Beide Paare spielen einen schwachen SA in der Eröffnung|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi this time sesson it is not sensible to guess final contracts -so colorful they where last session |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: TD gave them 10 minutes extra and decided that both pairs were responsible for the last delay so assigned NO penalties|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!N here or 4@h? 4@h ofcourse best but 3!N with 5-3-3-2 over 4-3-3-3 is quite common|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Das Ost-West-System ist relativ natürlich gehalten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||
mb|3N|nt|400 volt: Good evening :)|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: difficult break in spades in this first hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: A@s hilft|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: This is the semifinal of the German Open Team Trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky asks about 3@c, gotard makes some kind of "it's natural" shrugging motion |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, sorry for the confusion just now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS a polish pair, but they do NOT play Polish Club|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS playing weak NT 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Piekarek's DBL = 3@S|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|400 volt: Ja, da sind einige ungewöhnliche Sachen drin|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS leads  2nd/4th|pg||

nt|anton72: thank you ...sure :)|pg||
nt|anton72: N avoid the standart lead in clubs ...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|400 volt: Yet, the results were as expected: All teams in the semifinals were expected to get to the semifinals|pg||
nt|400 volt: But there is a very clear favourite - the team "Jamm & Co"|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup:  so 6 @c missed |pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: from the player's notes: 2NT = 9-12 or 16+, 3@s and 4@c cues|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|bebechira: hi all :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  11 quick tricks:)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3NT should be an easy contract for Michal after @D lead|pg||

pc|h3|nt|stc: auch @d geht|pg||
pc|h9|nt|stc: oder @s :)|pg||

pc|hA|nt|dimi: this will be an easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lead of a king would have shown a good suit, queen denies|pg||
nt|kingcur: Tim Verbeek acting as substitute for Berend vd Bos' regular partner, Joris van Lankveld. The reason being that Joris has an examn to bring off first|pg||

nt|400 volt: I should commentate in German, sorry :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Users who prefer English will find their way to the open room, Felix|pg||
nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze haben sich bereits gewundert, dass Thomas Gotard jun. nicht mehr mit Bernard Ludewig spielt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a service to have German in one room, not a punishment|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: bernard ludewig konnte leider aus gesundheitlichen gründen heute nicht antreten|pg||
nt|400 volt: Danke Michael - damit wäre die Frage geklärt|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: Still time for an overtrick.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|stc: a good slam with not many points. @s 2-2 and short @h on side making the play easy |pg||

nt|stc: a lucky slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: smirnov places his cards in his hand for a crossruff and counts the tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|stc: I think that E should win the first @d with the A and give dec a losing option in @D|pg||
nt|bebechira: fantastic tournament ... can we have a wbsite with teams etc...|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW part of the Dutch team that performed so well in the latest world youth championships and a very talented pair|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sastro: Besten Dank an Roland Wald. Ich hatte drom gebeten , dass zumindest in einem Raum deutsche Kommentare möglich sind. Und er hat diesem Wunsch entsprochen|pg||
pc|c5|nt|400 volt: Das Team Jamm & Co spielt außer mit Rohowsky-Fritsche am anderen Tisch noch mit Rehder-Gromöller. Das dritte Paar, welches gerade aussetzt, ist Smirnov-Piekarek|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: nicht wenn w deckt|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzzx: NS discussing system|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south tryed to show @h and @c  and north didn't support -because minimum opening -so |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3@C was artifical and did not show clubs for north|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok that makes it more understandable|pg||

nt|stc: but before it have been worked, ending with say 2 @c in dummy and Q10@s in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov was thinking about playing east for one spade more and one @D less|pg||
nt|andreasw:  http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: the official tournament site is www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||

nt|frankaus: do we all open E hand  I vote yes|pg||

nt|kingcur: as always well maintained by Rosaline Barendregt and a few others|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 11H |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played for the first hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: well played by Kopecky, may be too fast for some of us :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you must connect both rooms, operator|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north claims that he bid as if there had been no 1nt and after 1@C-2@D = hearts 2nt they have a system. south bid system off (=natural)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to endplay n on that line.|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 1@H|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening transfer preempts on 2nd level, too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: certainly a high standard of card play there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H = 8-11 with 6c. or 9-14 with 5@S+5m|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: worth 3@s|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diese mBoard könnten Nord/Süd schnell mal zu hoch geraten|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that was a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: then he would need to play a heart from dummy forcing east to ruff|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning all|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s -1 by EW ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier to concede a @d early. 2 3 4 1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky is not very happy with this bid :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: first option is 8-11 with 6 clubs? or 6 cards?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|400 volt: 4@C bei Nord/Süd und 3@S bei Ost/West ist das Limit|pg||
nt|stc: was für NT spielen sie ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 12-14 beide|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir spielt sogar 11-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@s promises 5, but 1@h only promises 4 in e/w system (swiss acol)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW used to play a modification of NS Baltic club but they found out it was too complicated, so they switched to some easier system at the beginning of the year|pg||
nt|frankaus: i value it a 15 count|pg||
nt|kingcur: agree: if you open light, it's important to have a good suit, and this @H suit qualifies for that|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sorry, 6@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will be more happy now :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS is saved, is there an option to get to 3NT by EW side?|pg||
nt|anton72: Curiosly is that i comentating match between country where i am born ...BUL ...and country where I live ..NOR |pg||
nt|anton72: splinter probably is 3 di|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: yes probably -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ³adnie przepuci³ kiera Robertson, |pg||
nt|tomi2: ISR leading, CZE 2nd. the teams have been put in four grops of 6, playin a compleate round robin today and will go on in a swiss movement tomorrow and the day after|pg||
mb|4S|nt|400 volt: Yes, 3 NT can be made by N/S, but east/west will bid 4@S everytime|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat geschrieben "2@s gute hebung"... wundert mich etwas...|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D ist eigentlich relativ natürlich im System von Ost-West. Der einzige Grund für das Alertieren kann sein, dass West auch mit 5er @C und 4er @D 1@D häufig eröffnet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hab ich mir schon fast gedacht, dass er hier mit kontra in die reizung einsteigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: thats the problem with playing artifical methods - you need detailed agreements or some really good working meta-agreements in competition|pg||
nt|stc: I even think that with more free places in E the crossruff line was a bit better|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Good fireworks here|pg||
nt|stc: anyway good start for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Alex said in the end that he should have played the cross ruff. but that needed to start in trick 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: summary of Slawinsky leads in Supplementary Notes of Fantoni-Nunes Convention Card  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBra...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|stc: cards are friendly for NS, EW can't go plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt opening would be 11-13, so this rebid shows 14+|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players produced so many big swings that they all speed up playing for overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or book that introduced the method   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south passed and explained to west "I have a clear pass on 2@S but I was thinking because I was not sure if thats natural"|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Ja, 3SA können von Nord/Süd erfüllt werden, aber Ost/West gehen immer auf 4er-Stufe|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube nicht, dass 3SA von Ost irgendwelche Probleme bereitet. Sogar 5@D geht. Mal schauen, ob Ost/West sie erreichen|pg||
nt|sastro: mit 6-4 bevorzuge ich zuerst die Wiederholung der 6er-Länge|pg||
nt|stc: keine gute Idee von N|pg||
nt|stc: aber 2@h ist nicht soo schlecht|pg||
nt|dimi: @s K @h Q and 2 @c tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hard to guess the singleton king.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW are very slow players and are in danger of beeing to late every segment|pg||
nt|stc: NS must just cash their tricks before the 5th @d is played|pg||
nt|stc: in other words S must play @c when in hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: novay min 4 me |pg||
nt|frankaus: no way |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results are at www.nbbportal.nl/1003, then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|kingcur: but with two aces and a decent 2nd suit, this is not even a light opening|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|golfsquash: trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but nothing will bother it|pg||
nt|anton72: E hasnt he control ..so...we just in Game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|400 volt: Auch 5@C kann man schnell mal im Gegenspiel schenken, von daher ist 5@S sicherlich ein akzeptables Gebot|pg||
nt|400 volt: jetzt hat sich Udo Kasimir etwas zu hoch gewagt - die Hand steht aber auch schlecht für ihn|pg||
nt|400 volt: Der Gegner hat @S KB8x UND der @C-Schnitt sitzt nicht|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben got a 10 imp penalty for slow play|pg||
nt|stc: better now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer may simply pull trumps from the top|pg||
nt|stc: not very likely but possible of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ducking that was risky, vuln south could hold 8 hearts and noting outside|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S now game try $ me|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems it is, now how to make it :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tomi2: can insert the king and unblock an honor in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: club lead might break the communication. Declarer has to play his suits from his hand which is not good for him in this board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be difficult to defeat...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to get entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry, i mean in 2nd club trick  finesse the 9|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: defence has to put Declarer once on the table with A of @H and another possible entry is @C8, but not easy to find it.|pg||

nt|tomi2: communication|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, declarer can play his @S from his hand, establishing 2@S tricks, 4@C, 1@H and 2 @D which makes a total of 9 = just made|pg||
nt|tomi2: cant NS open the hearts in time then, to score 2@S and 3@H?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: timing is important now|pg||
nt|tomi2: they seem to block because they need to finesse dummy's 10|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|400 volt: Nord hat nur 6 Figurenpunkte, aber mit einem sicheren 9-Karten-Fit und einer guten Verteilung ist das 3@S nicht völlig unverständlich|pg||
nt|runnerup:  time for 800?|pg||
nt|stc: 5 obvious losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what 1@S asked/showed   but it allowed North any easy bid  [versus something like immediate 3@C]|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S denied 4 spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|400 volt: hier kostet es 500 - aber gegen mögliche 400 beim Gegner kein allzu großer Verlust|pg||
nt|runnerup:  is south worth 3 @s -with 8 points and 7xxx in @s maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  other room stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: a decent save|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the club finesse is best therefore it seems..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|golfsquash: Good morning all|pg||

nt|andreasw:  even though east is a substitute it seems they have control over their system:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure how many of his regular agreements vd Bos has agreed with Tim Verbeek but this looks like a relay sequence he used with v Lankveld as well: they play a fairly natural ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: system, but with loads of gadgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: gf relay quite standard among dutch juniors|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H the limit of the hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: the 4-4 fit often plays better, but here we see @s's split 4-1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke mal 2@s zeigt schon 5-4|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|400 volt: Gegen wen spielen die beiden denn?|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: 3@C probably does that too :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S seems playable|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C K protected|pg||
nt|kingcur: and W declaring 4@S seems like the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d lead looks best to me? altough North might get creative and lead a small @c here|pg||
nt|tomi2: N could insert the 9|pg||

nt|luffe12:  thats what i meant|pg||
nt|stc: do you think they make 6@s ? big communication problems, don't think they make|pg||
nt|luffe12:  sry for any confussion|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kingcur: and will now look to set up his side suit first|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@s was a mild slam try even|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  lead 2nd/4th   so  weak doubleton leads LOW|pg||
pc|d8|nt|golfsquash: Just 8 tricks, but north coming under some pressure on the run of the hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does north do after  1@C-1@H-3@C-???|pg||

mb|p|nt|luffe12:  this board is a fine example on how great 10+ trumphs works |pg||
nt|stc: 6@c is a very decent contract|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@C leaping Michaels presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: non-leaping actually :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east values looks great.. i dont they they will stand at 5'th lvl|pg||
nt|kingcur: and N adding his part in the preemption...E might want to double for penalties now, but not sure if that isn't agreed as forward going|pg||

nt|kingcur: has E got enough for a pass and pull you think?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe east is afraid of W passing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: very risky indeed in a one-day partnership|pg||
nt|kingcur: for specs: this is an agreement to show a better hand than you would be showing by bidding directly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening 2@C as weak with majors, but this hand is too weak for vulnerable|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: someone told me that 7222 distribution is very close to 6322 which is very close to 5332 which is almost 4333. With that hand, you will bid 3NT immediately, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2nt is positive with fit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kingcur: first pass, let your pd double and then bid: hence the name|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably would have gone down in 6, losing the @sJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: i even alert my 1nt opening as "may include 7 card suits"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East shows clubs, but there is a nasty duplication in hearts|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: 6@D   be honest now -- how many people thought about THAT bid??|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W has bad values for slam even he has a maximum hand in HCP so he shouldnt go for a slam|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|stc: kleine swings für Jokisch|pg||
nt|stc: kann spanend sein|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: interesting auction|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s guess needed -restricted choice if you happened to start from rigth hand |pg||
nt|stc: now 170 EW :)|pg||
nt|stc: of course splits are very bad and even 5 @c is not so easy, 3NT lokks OK|pg||
nt|stc: 9 easy tricks, some endplay with N for ten ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe NS need to lead spades, though|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: as I have written before, inviting slam with 7222 needs a lot of HCP and especially a lot of controls.|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W should bid 4NT now to be able to stop|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|luffe12:  the law!!|pg||
nt|dimi: but if you only see the EW hands 6@c would be the best contract|pg||
nt|stc: sure, W must be disapointed now but happy later|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can make 5nt double-dummy with the @hKJ- but that's not a likely result at the table.|pg||
nt|stc: DD you can paerhaps even make 6@c guessing @Hs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but west will likely bid 4 hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|golfsquash: lead directing, implying a heart fit on passed hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: ns normally play 2/4 leads but in this particular situation (partner's suit vs nt) they play 1/3|pg||
nt|stc: but whatfor ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: instill doubt in East  in case grand slam is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west is still thinking|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sastro: denke mal, dass mit Fit die Nordhand ein 4 Couer-Gebot wert ist|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|kingcur: yes, slam is not plain sailing for EW, and 5@Dx should bring in more than 650...let's see|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well judged...|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: found about missing @S cue. But wrong contract and 2 imps on 8 board match might be crutial|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3NT would be better. on a @D lead they need the finesse now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup:  3nt makeable by guessing @d |pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: south do not know who was thinking when|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably intended as an entry for the @c finesse, the @hJ dropping changes the line.  He did that just to spite my prediction...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer will give a @c and then has an entry to the @h|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dimi: Joe, declarer might heard your plan for 11 tricks :) |pg||

nt|kingcur: I'd say EW made the correct decision here, so well done for this occasional partnership|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems the bidding will go 1@C-1@S-1NT-3NT if EW will pass all the time|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 4@C bid also made the club slam beeing played from the wrong site in case partner has some kx holdng in spades and potential discards in another. maybe a jump to 4nt after 2nd ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be right. partner could pass on a "bad" hand or convert to 5 or 6 clubs on a better one|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: agree with Thomas|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@C from S will shown 11+ unbal with @C, 18-20 bal, or 21+ any|pg||
nt|anton72: for norwegians ...sorry :)|pg||
nt|anton72: i am a litle distracted :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzzx: west claiming he would have doubled if he got some better information about the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: this smells like slam, maybe a grand|pg||
nt|frankaus: another 5 level excursion to a loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: this will end up in 4@S EW, potentially very fast|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|golfsquash: could bid 4@c if not too strong in his methods|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@H sieht eigentlich recht gut aus - aber gegen @H 5-0 und @D AJ hinter KD sieht es nicht erfüllbar aus|pg||
nt|glen: classic question - red, in 2nd seat, the N hand does not fit a weak two, but does it anyways|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Grand on a @d guess|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@D probably some good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: as this E hand seems a little heavy for current tandards for bidding 1mi-4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: standards*|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: vdBos-Verbeek also play strong jump shifts, so 2@s would have been GF 5+@s with more outside values|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 2@D zeigt einen zweifärber mit @S und einer zweiten farbe, @H oder @C|pg||
nt|sastro: Kontra heisst iA : Ich kann eine mögliche Farbe des Gegners kontrieren- sehe ich hier nicht|pg||
nt|400 volt: entweder unter Eröffnungsstärke oder eine starke Hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kontra wurde schlicht als "punkte" erklärt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@s könnte sogar gehen... spannend|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C?|pg||
nt|glen: the reason for not opening - poor playing value, the reason for opening, hey, i would have opened it in 1st or 3rd seats|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|golfsquash: I like 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@c is nat or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  assume they end up in 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3@d shows values (2nt would have been lebensohl)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning Shirley and Glen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Leif|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: orth obviously upset about that last hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south and west seem to thinkk north has hearts!|pg||
nt|dimi: 7 will probably go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: nice opening by E, makes it more difficult to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but EW do not keep quiet|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|golfsquash: magical 25 HCP slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch-kasimir have a quite unique system|pg||
nt|stc: This result may be anything, push or swing in any direction !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@D overcall shows 10+, solid hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ew can make 5 @h but can be many down if different sits |pg||
nt|frankaus: this auction right sided the contract now @D lead gives up a trick|pg||
nt|kingcur: the danger with transfer-agreements always being that it allows your opponents a double to indicate values in that suit and enter the bidding at lesser risk|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3@C asking for stopper will get NS there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, he sure has that|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|golfsquash: could have tried 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch hatte erklärt dass 2@d in dieser geflage eröffnungsstärke zeigt|pg||
nt|xenya: S can hardly make a move now -- has to take it like a man|pg||
nt|luffe12:  11 from the top - 12th from at possible double squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: bright an early in Washington DC |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west explained 2@D as if 1@H = hearts would have been bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south to west: 1@H is natural|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north would perhaps be declarer in 4 @s (d?)  if he had bid a couple of @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now rohowsky remembers|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they agreed to treat the system as polish club and 1@H showed spades against non natural systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2 [5@DX-2] von Alvensleben playing 5@C South|pg||
nt|luffe12:  good "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|baldfriede: W may get into a squeeze when trying to protect Q@c. which is not the way to brin it down, bzt hard for W to know unless E shows it somehow|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but*|pg||
nt|kingcur: but here it worked out well, with @DK now protected|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky now regrets his 2@D bid :-) but he has to show the stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben bei ansicht des dummys: "damit eröffnet ihr?!?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 24-26 but might be on a very nice 23, we are told|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 sp may be showed some shape|pg||
mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: 8 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: td was still at the table, he has not to be called :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  7 tricks seems sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can be 7+ with no 4-card major   or  7-11 wrong for 1N|pg||
nt|kingcur: and brining in a discard for a loser|pg||
nt|anton72: or just is asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: getting 9 tricks shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
nt|luffe12:  3nt is easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: from souths point of view the lead must be a singleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  would u X with the N hand or 3nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low from xx does NOT include  10x   that leads 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N way too much opposite balancing DBL|pg||
nt|xenya: down 2 for 500 -- but 3N NS is very very close -- 4@H might go down though|pg||
nt|tomi2: he has 3 card fit and two kings, nothing to regret|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and possibly another one in hearts|pg||
nt|anton72: West need to play that one carefuly|pg||
nt|anton72: expecting K he |pg||
nt|anton72: like lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|golfsquash: cash 4 side suit tricks and claim|pg||
nt|xenya: there is an entry to dummy in @Ds, so...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir studies opponent's cc|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they lead 5/3|pg||
nt|xenya: whichever high heart will do here|pg||
nt|dimi: ok also 6NT is an easy make, probably loses only to the @d Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, but didn't clarify strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S is not forcing|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzzx: @cA erfolgreicht geduckt... jetzt tippe ich auf -1|pg||
nt|sastro: Treff 7 machts|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: this will be played very fast i guess|pg||
nt|stc: not a great contract with 4@s and 5@c making|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekarek comments "it cant be true"|pg||
pc|dK|nt|luffe12:  S could be a little bit less i 4th seat but N have fine support all over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  2   looks like 5@C going down|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so close to "All Square"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking about the lead agreements again, south looked suprised expecting partner and not opp wil ruff this|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i was wondering -- on the surface, 5@C looked like a make, but there are pitfalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he did know SOMEONE was going to ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: first double explained "we mandatory double with spade shortnes and 7+hcp"|pg||
nt|stc: yes, DD you just give the K@c and score 5@s, 5@c and A@H in 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 5@C on 2 did fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2nd double: "double on 2@S would be penalty, so I guess this one is penalty too"|pg||
nt|stc: I think that 500 here will by a swing for NS|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but they pl @dk to @dA and a @h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so u are doomed, right?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  since u are looked in hand |pg||
nt|luffe12:  fine piece of defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer won't lose a trick if playing for the @d finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ew asking abut the auction|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|xenya: of course W could have @H9 or @HQ |pg||
nt|anton72: seems defence can get maximum 2 trumps and 2 hearts more|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: i thought it was   example:  includes 18 hcp 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: it can be weak nt with 4 spades or 3 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|stc: in fact 6@c as spec noticed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or 4 spades and 5+ clubs any strength that survives a pass from partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or 5+ spades, 18+ hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: WOW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = not 4@H, a) 11+, 3/4@S  b) 18-19, 5@S  c) 11-20, 5@C & 4@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sastro: auf Treff Bube geht Karo weg|pg||
nt|400 volt: wieso hat denn Ost nicht @S nachgespielt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: actually e/w play slavinsky leads|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: could you expand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3 [3@SW+1]  von Alvensleben in 4@D South   so  like previous 5@C -- now he just has to make it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, but wasnt easy to count the points at the table :-)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kingcur: will now play clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sastro: ducken ist das beste- dann kann AS die Treffs noch missraten|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: je nachdem wie lange man zum duck braucht aber auch nicht mehr|pg||
nt|kingcur: double finesse the best chance|pg||
pc|sT|nt|anton72: lead was giving unexpecting trick for declarer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cc469: N's hand became less impressive with announced @C singleton with S opposite his @C values|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think the high lead showed either even length with an honor or odd length without an honor|pg||
nt|xenya: the mind boggles :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: and N has no entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks suprised that south has a trump|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|golfsquash: would like to play hearts agin, but entry problems|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: what made smirny choose @S rather than give @C ruff??|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|anton72: he need to play cl|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h7|nt|luffe12:  S must guard @C N the @s so no one to protect @h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  maybe to avoid any kind of endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekareks carding was consistent to KT9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sastro: wie vorausgesagt- nun Treff 7|pg||
nt|400 volt: hat Jokisch wirklich @C 2 geordert?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  figth for contract here |pg||

nt|anton72: this is dangerous|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stc: was|pg||
nt|stc: was not the 3@d very positive ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after Piekarek had commented souths bidding for a minute i did not guess this would happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per CC   East leads King from AKJT  else Ace |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they are playing now for the overtricks|pg||
nt|anton72: i think he already is down|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|golfsquash: overtrick now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Not any longer - declarer should give up a club |pg||
nt|glen: declarer ducks @C to S, to prevent @S play from N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: upside down attitude   @D3 with north showing the @D2  is most encouraging|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: now hope that teammates bid 6@C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|golfsquash: and a sixth Imp|pg||
nt|sastro: wieder ein optimales Ergebnis für NS . , denn 4 Coeur ist schlagbar|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: 5@dx -5 won 7 imps for red|pg||
nt|kingcur: same final contract on  3 in open room, but only 4 off there|pg||
nt|anton72: kibs help me...they play 0+|pg||
mb|2D|nt|400 volt: ungewöhnlich, dass man eine 5er-länge gegen die 1SA-eröffnung gegenreizt|pg||
nt|400 volt: meine Wahl wäre hier Kontra gegen den 12-14 SA|pg||
nt|sastro: sieht für Alvensleben stark danach aus , dass Partner ebenfalls die Coeur hält|pg||
nt|santyclz: I seem to recall an old column by Reese in which he was faced with a 2-way finesse.  He solved the problem by leading the J of a suit in which he held the Q and observing LHO's ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: reaction.  He then led the suit in which he didn't have the Q and noticing a slight difference in the reaction finessed LHO for the Q.|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: gut, dass West Kontra als pass/correct zur Verfügung hat, so wird der @S-Fit gefunden|pg||
nt|400 volt: mal schauen, ob man 4@S findet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt kann ost evtl 3@s reizen?|pg||
nt|sastro: kontra zeigt Hand mit Bereitschaft in Pik. Hat Partner Coeurs soll er drin bleiben|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i could have been drunk this very wednesday on that account :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: understandably, gotard not happy to open 1@d, so 1nt the practical choice|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s 4-1 ,@h finess of -so probÃ¶ems in 4 @s|pg||
nt|runnerup:  problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: actually they have discussed their system in that sequence 20 minutes ago, hope both remember|pg||
nt|dimi: NS can make 2 @c, EW can make 2-3 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we had some similar problem yesterday, when one player complained his oponent took some short time to follow a single honor|pg||
nt|stc: yes, the winner must play better in the euros|pg||
nt|kingcur: 5@C a make for NS here, and they may bid it too|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S showing an opening hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2 d is transfer to hearts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|anton72: nothing artifical to this moment after opening ...|pg||
nt|dburn: then he is well above a minimum opening bid, at least in terms of his diamond holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 3@D wird vermutlich eine Werte in @D zeigen mit einer guten Hand|pg||
nt|400 volt: (und natürlich die @S), da 3@C einen guten @H-Fit bestätigt|pg||
nt|sastro: ein gutes taktisches Gebot von Kasimir, das den C-Fit verdeckt|pg||
nt|400 volt: das ist für West natürlich ein Traumgebot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch erklärt dass ohne zwischenreizung 3@c jetzt maximum, 4er @c und kleines double in @c gezeigt hätte|pg||
nt|runnerup:  wd -now ew makes 9 in @s and ns 10 in @c |pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to defend with the N hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pachnie szlemikiem|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: gives N a better raise by 2@H, but still too weak for that|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzzx: e/w playing some funny defense where they pass some strong hands... perhaps west regrets that now|pg||
nt|santyclz: My partner and I used to have on our convention cards: "Opening leader's partner always hesitates at trick 1, even with a singleton."  |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: sehr diszipliniertes pass von rohowsky|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks in @h on a sqz @s/@c against N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drury|pg||
nt|kingcur: doubling 4@H showing interest to bid on, I expect|pg||
mb|3N|nt|golfsquash: Looks like this will just about get home|pg||
nt|golfsquash: this knocks out an entry but should be ok for 8 tricks, play on spades first|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably not|pg||
nt|anton72: and North hand is good enough for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  i booked 4 X !7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time east had 17 -did west know that? -i douth|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: seems to have reached a normal contract though... unlike the other room!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = nat or 4-fit 10-11 hcp  or  3-fit one round force|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and a little respite for the Scots|pg||
nt|sastro: warom nicht Treff Dame ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: He could have opened 1@C and repeated 2@C, showing 15+ with 5+ @C|pg||
nt|luffe12:  @d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: dont know how that works but 2@C was explained as drury or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: as i mentioned earlier NL white is a team with quite unexperienced players. this is their first international tournament|pg||
nt|anton72: something went wrong :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Sout might have made some move in the direction of a slam, it is true|pg||
nt|anton72: ofcourse slam is too lucky|pg||
nt|anton72: Hi David|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzzx: ah yes, right|pg||
nt|sybarra: this wont work out well,  @D's not behaving |pg||
nt|luffe12:  no chance whatsoever|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: but doubtless South has seen plenty of North's opening bids before|pg||
nt|anton72: yes ..they just missunderstood probably 2 NT is artifical|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dimi: Wagner needs 2 entries into the W hand to double finess in @h first to the 9 later to the J|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: drury OR nat??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not a transfer to 1NT|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|anton72: if they not lead in NT 3-5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|uni_cicam: honors should be clear now, W will probably not bid 2D with onle @CK and @HQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: looks like EW's defence against NS's 1@C roughly comes down to this: you pass with a balanced hand, no matter how strong, but bid on an unbalanced hand, no matter how weak |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sastro: hätte er klein zugegeben, hätte er seinen König wohl immer nch gemacht, weil AS das falsch raten würde|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  35  Fritsche-Rohowsky stop in 5@H   but Gunther still has chance to bid 5@S |pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4 flat boards in row|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|xenya: something you might do when bidding against a genuine stron 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think any bid shows either the next suit or the two above|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  declarer did not apply Rabbi's Rule  [when king is singleton, play the ace]  so 4@D down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still 3 imps to tie the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final contract  5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we'll never know if Piek 6@S good or bad   but it doesn't lose a lot against the game|pg||
nt|kingcur: so two off a good result for NS if the other room makes 5@C|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s here seems normal?|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW, sorry|pg||
nt|anton72: some goulash distribution |pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  results to date are http://www.camrosebridge.com/|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  currently England are in the lead with 134, Scotland are second with 121, Wales are third with 114|pg||
nt|cc469: on the last board, S is the hand that essentially makes slam a possibility - I think N's rebid of 4@H opposite the announced singleton with his p was quite proper but S should bid ...|pg||
nt|cc469: 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: weak 6/7 clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The SBU has 97 Ireland 91 and Northern Ireland 71|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only bad if Khanukov was going down in 6@H|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|luffe12:  but 5 x @c from the start could have made life a bit more difficult for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: here we see the weak nt version of the polish 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: the 4/4 fit may be better than the 5/4 fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hm sollte das ein alert sein? bin mir unsicher|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1sa zeigt 4er @s und 5er UF|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e.g. 1@d would have shown @h or @s+@c|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can make 3nt here -but hardly will be bidden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with only 42 boards to play|pg||
nt|dimi: @s from S was a bad  card|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he did not read parners signal in clubs as encouraging|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north did not want to overtake in case the lead was from Tx he said|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and he reminded partner of the low spotcards in dummy|pg||
nt|stc: not a lot, just 3 IMP|pg||
nt|stc: or 4 if only 5 made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5+@S   [Kaplan Inversion]   so why 2@S???|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west said he was thinking about bidding 6nt or even 7 because he expected 6@D to be void and he had aj... so he planed on some finesse |pg||
nt|kingcur: S bidding his 2-suiter...looks like Michaels, is that correct, Dennis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@h to play here, with INV+ van den Bos can make a cuebid|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: this does not seem as a openning hand to me Thomas :-)|pg||
nt|anton72: I think Siderov is enough agressive to observe and reach 6 He|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|400 volt: 10-16 punkte|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: may not need the club guess playing in hearts with a club going on the long spade|pg||
nt|cc469: ... with controls in both side suits and a 5th @H to boot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sicherlich nicht die antwort die rohowsky befürchtet hat|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c starts relays|pg||
nt|stc: EW on the way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: according to the system, he could bid 2@S to show 54 with minor|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H is a better raise to @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: you mean 1@D by east?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England - tough for Goodman-Pownall who played both sets in that match|pg||
nt|400 volt: der Trend geht allgemein dazu, Kontra als Stärkekontra erst ab 18 Punkten zu spielen, für Rohowsky aber offensichtlich nicht :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. kann in dieser sequenz auch 4@d5@c haben|pg||
nt|sastro: polnisch - 8-15  4er Pik und längere Minore|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: no, sorry, overcall by S, should be an openning hand as in previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 14-16, 55xx|pg||
nt|stc: the trailing team recovered almost all, now a very close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so a slight upgrade but i think the hand is surely worth it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir can now bid 4@h rkcb or 4@d to sign off in 4@h i believe|pg||
nt|tomi2: did 2@H show hearts? or do they play some sort of transfers.  would find kjx in spades and some ruffing avalues the most important thing to show in this hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzzx: oh maybe 4@s is rkcb for @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate the leads from  4333's  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Slavinski leads for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fritsche played @H for no loser so made overtrick in 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: saves an imp|pg||
nt|stc: this IS FAIRPLAY from Smirnov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and implies 6@H would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in our room|pg||
nt|stc: in fact he expect AQ @s in W !|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: This is the par contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: low = odd count with honor or even without|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS play the cuebid as other Major + @d |pg||
nt|kingcur: 10 imps away for NL white on  4, when they didnt reach a rather obvious 4@S vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in Holland many top pairs play Michaels with known suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so partner can judge better if bidding gets high quickly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, 2@H shows 3@S fit and 8-10 HCP|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jaapfr: will they reach 6@D?|pg||
nt|kingcur: and with his hand, N will not care too much what South's minor will be|pg||
mb|p|nt|sastro: meine Wahl wäre forcierende 2 Karo|pg||
nt|stc: 6@h is a complex contract(easy in DD)|pg||
nt|glen: well at least picking the "longest and strongest" from 4333 is easy|pg||
nt|glen: here though a @D lead would help declarer|pg||
nt|glen: (how to make 3 tricks with ATx opposite Q8x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = one round force|pg||
nt|anton72: 2 di is positive 8+points 5 +diamonds GF|pg||
nt|anton72: 3 sp ...values ...or just 4 he|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzzx: fritsche freut sich, endlich mal einen unkontrierten kontrakt spielen zu dürfen|pg||
nt|runnerup:  needs some guesses to make  |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: shame it is going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: seems they have some science in action here|pg||
nt|dburn: probably owes partner a bit more than just 4@h|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may not consider his hand worth a move above game|pg||
mb|4N|nt|golfsquash: so much for the theory in the Majors|pg||
nt|sastro: der Ausspieler ist in 4 Farben geendspielt- wie soll er auf klein pik kommen|pg||
nt|luffe12:  he came off very well this time - but not much to do |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: it's a good contract i think|pg||
nt|stc: in fact you discard @c on @d and must start @h in the good direction|pg||
nt|stc: of course it is|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N very awkward |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = 15+ HCP  5+@D|pg||
nt|dimi: nice|pg||
nt|stc: with friendly @s you could even make 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: looks like -2|pg||
mb|5C|nt|xenya: not laydown by any means but worth trying|pg||
nt|stc: the first @h is the key of the play|pg||
nt|dburn: but Siderov has taken the helm now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  system notes for Walsh-O'Gorman http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/WalshOGorman.pdf|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in board 4 east was in 5 @h xx -and played it -1 ..so bad day it can be -1600 or so -and a good day if you play for it +1600 ,now 400 out|pg||
nt|anton72: yes :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: some misunderstanding here|pg||

nt|anton72: i told you ..he si enough smart and agressive :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|anton72: good job |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: amazing result at the other table|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: DEclarer has to establish @C tricks soon, otherwise he will loose control because of bad @S break|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sastro: Karo war noch das beste, weil es die Kommunikation angreift|pg||
nt|dimi: if he tries to finesse in @d even 1NT is down|pg||
nt|anton72: may be the bid is not so theoreticaly good ....but is practical |pg||
mc|12|nt|stc: closest to your finger :)|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  heard an interesting analysis last weekend |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov explained 1NT as " I may pass with 12"|pg||
nt|luffe12:  as it is, 3nt still ok|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he must have smelled a rat|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he saw the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: probably :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that's why he smelled it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@D = any negative or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he already saw @CQ and knew west failed to bid positive holding at least one major|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: east:"oh thats nice"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right since 2@S would be non-force the only other choice was  DBL|pg||

pc|c3|nt|400 volt: auch dieses Vollspiel ist relativ normal - bei dem Trumpfstand in @S ist aber das Vollspiel in 3SA deutlich besser|pg||
nt|400 volt: Thomas Gotard jun. denkt auch darüber nach, ob er 3SA oder 4@S reizen soll|pg||
nt|glen: a typical hand that shows why partnership have a variety of raises for S hand, to help N make decisions if bidding gets high fast|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this 4@H C will only be a push i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c is 20-21 or any gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder's pass asks for a spade lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: theoretically it can be even 4@H-1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt is easier here than 4@H|pg||
nt|kingcur: N may have shown an unbalanced hand with 1S...then S should maybe convert to 2@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|luffe12:  is the X for penalty here - dont think so|pg||
nt|luffe12:  is disagree in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is "make the right decision pard" kind of X |pg||
nt|glen: some play X is penalty, some X is two-way values, some X as I want to bid 5@H but you decide|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: easy 3NT here, time to get some drinks :-)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|400 volt: das war die richtige Wahl|pg||
nt|stc: you need A@c on side and if not @d finesse|pg||

nt|runnerup:  2 @s still some chance ..but others -with best defence hopeless --like this |pg||
nt|dimi: no X no trouble|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: they do play 1@C-2@H 4-7hcp|pg||

nt|sastro: das Single Karo ist fotographiert- da bietet sich 3 SA schon an|pg||
nt|sastro: 6 C ist ein ordentlicher Kontrakt, wird aber vorrausichtlich fallen, weil die Odds für Karoschnitt sprechen|pg||
nt|glen: best for N is to X first, then find out result, the claim X was a certain type of X|pg||
nt|luffe12:  5 looser hand by distribution - bid one more time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: that's a good tip glen, i'll keep it in mind :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i assume that NS use some kind of constructive major raises|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very tough to bid|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s was not good, 3NT is a disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks at the dummy and is kind of shoked, he obviously expected more :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "pfff"|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wilkinsona: yes the diamond 10 at trcick one gets declarer 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 9 cold|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i hate to caught with only 3-card support, when supposed to have 4 - but the N hand is just 6 loosers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually, i think 3@S would show 5+@S and @H fit, but agree key feature is short @D rather than long @S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  anybody familiar with Ron Klingers ideas on the rules of Loosers Count|pg||
nt|stc: trump looks best now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cc469: yes, he must ensure he is left with an entry in dummy to @Ds when that suit is established|pg||

nt|sybarra: best you make sure you know what you are playing over interference|pg||
nt|luffe12:  S would bid 3@c rather than 2@h - promising 4card support|pg||
nt|glen: its a question whether to use a bergen raise on not: 4 trumps good, but quacks (queens/jacks) not good for playing the hand in a suit contract|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i fully support that - |pg||
nt|sybarra: it is only an 8 count of quacks, 3 @H was also a possibility  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play standard signals|pg||

nt|400 volt: In Board 4 hat Martin Rehder 4@H sehr gut gespielt - 9 verdiente IMPs|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead of a small club would probably beat 6@H but it's not easy to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: anyway or bid and made 6@h so von alvensleben team will reassert the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  noreal chance here |pg||
nt|kingcur: I am just informed that my co-commentator's mother is a woman I played bridge with in Sopot, Poland in the mid 80's. That's kind of cute, isn't it, andreas? :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sastro: schwierige Entscheidung, was man am Tisch auf die nächsten Karorunden abwerfen soll|pg||
nt|stc: not very convincing sequence, missing a good slam and 12 IMP|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but knowing prd to have xxxx might change the N approach|pg||
nt|stc: A pair in control of the system may stretch to 3@s and play there|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sK|nt|stc: wd, 4@s was a good save|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south has a really nice 14-16 one must say|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: and here you can't score the 150 for 4 Aces|pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room found the reasonable 6@c on board 19, but didn't find a line to make it with the bad @c bread.  13 imps.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (break)|pg||
nt|stc: here the defense may make 3NT but for only 500|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: that way pard knows I have 4 @H's  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|anton72: 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the deadly lead which W asked for by passing 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is good position for the trailing team|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sastro: besser wäre ein schnelles Ducken|pg||
nt|anton72: Vasilev play verry carefuly |pg||
nt|anton72: and that is not bad when u play team |pg||
nt|dburn: I think I'd settle for nine tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: in the other room, a trump was led against 6@H|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so 6NT came in on  20|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after orth chose to open 1@d, schüller was undissuadable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't imagine other table finding the 4@S save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also   too tired to figure out how bad 4@SX really scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: toilet break for west, its his 3rd during the match already|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i mean this segment...|pg||
nt|stc: 200 I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he have an escort?|pg||
nt|stc: they can ruff @d or open @c, both for 4 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: if defense nothing wrong they can collect in each suit 1 trick|pg||
nt|stc: but 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|anton72: already 10|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: at Pairs, he might have tried a second spade|pg||
nt|dimi: good contract bad distribution, no justice in the world|pg||
nt|anton72: again :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: but if my opponents pitched the jack of clubs, I would not tell them to pick it up and try something else - I'd settle for ten tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|cc469: I don't think he should have ducked first @S because @HK continuation could have proved embarrassing ...|pg||
nt|golfsquash: no strip squeeze this time|pg||
nt|xenya: 11|pg||
nt|frankaus: now gets out 4 -1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :) i think it is more amazing that she remembers something so long ago lol|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzzx: east angry he did not play club to the 7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in this case even to make your opponents tierd doen't help -so |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but north could have inserted the 9 to prevent this|pg||

pc|d7|nt|santyclz: Hmmm, "bread"... My inner self must be telling me it's time for breakfast.|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps one more @c trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: both players tried to play low dia spots to show partner values in clubs. N intentionaly blocked the suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know n-s's leading methods, but it seems that the 1 card you can't hold to lead the @c9 is the @c10.|pg||

pc|c7|nt|golfsquash: south knows where the @hA is, so will throw a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: was holding the @dJ|pg||
nt|kingcur: board  5 was flat, the other room taking the save in 4@Sx and NS not getting to 5@C either|pg||

nt|dimi: ... he punished his partner|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: w 15 grulica WJ-ta - odwrotka wpêdzi³a w  szlemika|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well south has a good hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: and some conplicated contracts, seems all suits are breaking porely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but 6 spades likely it seems|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 6@S or NT should easy to reach with 35 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Not a word from Brandsnes or the Norwegian coach|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Vasilev deserved some credit for that @c9 at the first trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt=11-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rather maximum for that i think :)|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: last board for the Open room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stc: of course if you play slam on the same defense, the @d finesse is much better than the sqz, and you go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in fact the first imps for von alvensleben this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminded it was a full book   Ron Klinger "The Modern Losing Trick Count" Modern Bridge Series|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2 over 1 GF|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: still counting points :D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sastro: 4er-C Unterstützung und double Treff können einen schon etwas optimistisch stimmen|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: i think you all know what 2@c is by now ;)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@C asks if 11-13 really has 14?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so 6@h is more friendly for the specs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = inverted, one round forcing raise, not 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  seems well judged by S: I will have a second chance, to show strong playing values|pg||
nt|stc: very interesting this one !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no, no escort, but he was quite fast and at least we are ahead of the other room, so those boards are not available anywhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this match seems to have theme of finding 5-3 fit that has 5-0 break|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: szlemik nie byl taki zly kiery po 2 - 2 lub trafiony A kier singlowy |pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: lub J / 10 |pg||
mb|2N|nt|tomi2: spade finesse not working, hearts are not coming in. 6n seems like the best spot, if you see you cant hold spades to 1 loser, you try the other suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  When X might be slightly weeaker, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|xenya: a raise by N now would be weak, but perhaps not as weak as this|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just a quick key card check|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@S shows min, can be still 5|pg||
nt|tomi2: this won't be quick, he needs to find a fit first|pg||
mb|3H|nt|400 volt: das 2@D-Gebot zeigt Fit in @H - entweder mit einer schwachen Hand oder Partieforcierend|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure they can get to 6 @S now |pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h shows either @c as 2nd suit or a 3352|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: W's jump to 3NT was reckless in my view - E might have minimum values and simply trying to protect the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: den kontrakt aus dem open room werden wir hier wohl nicht nochmal sehen|pg||
nt|sastro: so wie die Hand steht sind 3 SA das optimale. Aber wie soll man mit den unausgeglichenen Händen dort landen. Katastrophen sind hier vorprogrammiert|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h still makeable but now ???|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: 2@d slabe ze wzgledu na QJx @h 1!p imo zdecydowanie lepsze i ewnetulana x na wznowce |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w 16 znowu odwrotka w akcji|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: 1@s*|pg||
nt|anton72: 3 NT is logical choice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cc469: 2NT I could find a case for but not 3|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diesem Fall die starke Variante - jetzt muss Nord @D-Ausspiel finden. Da Süd 2@D (künstlich) nicht kontriert hat, spricht das für ihn vielleicht gegen @D-ausspiel|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the @d7 presumably shows an odd length... and as we know both 1 and 3 are odd...|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 1Nt beatable|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: what now? 4NT would be quantitative only I guess|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south can bid 4 clubs ok|pg||
nt|tomi2: mabw 5nt pick-a-slam?|pg||
nt|dburn: trusting East not to have psyched, or maybe unable to bid spades naturally anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: although 2@s ought to be natural over 2@d|pg||
nt|dburn: just in case East is one of the ungodly|pg||
nt|anton72: i think 2 sp over 2 di is not natural|pg||
mb|4C|nt|golfsquash: They are playing strong NT|pg||
nt|luffe12:  wd all|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@C= any invit, does not promise clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west did not expect this beeing passed out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east forgot the system|pg||
nt|dimi: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the thought 2@C was pass/correct|pg||
nt|baldfriede: These are probably the seeds of mistrust from previous hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: playing 80 boards yesterday was hard, the night was short|pg||
nt|anton72: in their agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: as spec notices on same defense you should finesse the 10@c to make, yes|pg||
nt|stc: after a small @c lead would be different|pg||
nt|glen: W has tried his hardest to stay out of slam (opening 11-13 1NT with 14, not accepting slam try 4@D)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  top spot|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both sides|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT by W goes down on a @h lead but played by E has much better chances |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: all players discussing, south "lets play, it will not be down 6 times now, i am pretty sure"|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, nice bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good call|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: might be also a grand slamr try id N has a very good hand such as @S AKJxx and @D A|pg||
mb|4D|nt|400 volt: jetzt wird Rohowsky keine Probleme mit dem Kontrakt mehr bekommen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N gets a chance to trump a @H in dummy he has a chance to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs W to play trump when in with @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you've watched NS play before   you KNEW Piek would bid 3@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: *3532|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: looks like they are going overboard here thanks to north opening his 8-count|pg||
nt|stc: loosing control|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: of course, north in the open room had it much easier after west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but i'm sure günther in his wildest dreams would not have thought of opening 1@h :)|pg||
nt|stc: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 2nd/4th   that means  from worthless doubleton lead LOW|pg||

mb|4H|nt|golfsquash: and 2@s beatable but difficult|pg||
nt|glen: finally forced to admit holds @H Q|pg||
nt|dimi: anyway 2@c seems to be a good contract, while 3NT is not a make i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: you can make 4@h played on @s but not on @d|pg||
nt|tomi2: i think this is the convention, that made me score / avoid lose most imps at all. if i was allowed to play only one convention, i would kick blackwood and stayman and keep 5nt=pick ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: a slam :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it should be - if 2@d is forcing to game, no need for 2@s to be artificial over it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kingcur: it looks very much like Tim Verbeek having learned all the relays by heart: as I said earlier, E is not Berend vd Bos' regular partner|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: anyway, well bid by NS, do we have the bidding from the other table?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: eeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Igor nie doceni³ cue bidu kier partnera|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: chyba mu sie A schowal ...|pg||
mb|5D|nt|golfsquash: not beating it now|pg||
nt|stc: 1@h, 1@d, 1@c to loose|pg||
nt|kingcur: but despite the relaying, not landing at the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in a more natural system do you bid 1@s or 2@d on pds 1@h bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Tim Verbeek plays the same relay with his regular partner Danny Molenaar|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results: www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e trema - w koñcu to ich debiut w takiej rangi imprezie|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no running scores|pg||
nt|anton72: 2 Di is GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, 4@H looks quite reasonable -- but not easy to play on this layout|pg||
nt|stc: I think you can try @s first, then @d if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@H, i fear is doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|glen: and after all of W's efforts to stay out of slam, E bids the grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes the ace of trumps is useful|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i suspect gro meant 4nt as exclusion keycard, rehder misunderstood|pg||
nt|dburn: and although there are fewer people around than there used to be who played a non-vul 1@s overcall of a strong club to show 13 cards, the breed has not entirely died out|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Siderov shaking his head|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: and talking why i didnt passed 3 NT ? :)|pg||
nt|anton72: with 3-2 trumps 5 diamonds have some play|pg||
nt|anton72: with expectable spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: No, just finesse twice in @s|pg||
nt|stc: for 5@h+4@s+2@d = 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: declarer's shape is known exactly from the bidding, so the defense will hardly go wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: why, yes, of course:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder thinking, not schüller|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: meanwhile the imps start to roll in for the jamm team, 6 on  35|pg||
nt|jaapfr: about what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i don't know should i ask him? ;)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HTQ already played?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now schüller is thinking...|pg||
nt|stc: now even 2¨ds|pg||
nt|stc: 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl: "thats probably good news" after n showed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: i think you are correct Michael, about 4NT as exclusion|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. was out of pass cards so had to use a double instead|pg||
nt|glen: for some expect partnerships, splinter then 4NT is exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  exclusion is tell me your aces outside of @D |pg||
nt|glen: *for some expert|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cc469: I'm referring of course to the previous hand|pg||
nt|stc: It is an interesting question : where the line between fairplay and "team interest" ?|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't think he can manage this with the cards as they are|pg||
nt|anton72: 10 from dummy ...3 trumps ...and 3 rounds of spades discarding 3 hearts|pg||
nt|anton72: but trump is 4-1 |pg||
nt|anton72: yes ...only with 3-2 trumps |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could make it if the heart ace were onside also - it isn't the worst contract in the world|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3NT would certainly have been a better one|pg||
nt|dburn: and Siderov probably should have passed it, although you can see why he thought Vasilev might have a club fit|pg||
nt|anton72: yes ...trumps lay bad ...and A he is offside ...3nt is easy 9+ tricks ...depending on lead|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a fairly extreme example of the notion that you can't go down if you don't play a card|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: but u also wouldnt make it |pg||
nt|dburn: I can't see a way - maybe GIB can|pg||
nt|anton72: m no|pg||
nt|anton72: i checked already |pg||
nt|anton72: just kiding david|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|stc: he will make, when seeing the @d, will be force to play on @s finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has the @c6 prepared...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better not think too long then:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the thinking suggests he has @CKJ6 imo|pg||
nt|stc: this may be the match ball|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will N play the Q?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if small even down 2 looming|pg||
pc|d8|nt|stc: fairplay would say -4, strict rules -6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no they are discussing this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: -6 was clear for all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the heart has intentionally been played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S certainly tried to keep the kettle boiling for some psychological advantage with his remark|pg||
nt|dimi: well this really a tight match ... difficult situation for "fairplay" whatever this is in such a case|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: or at least something very similar|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kingcur: I'd bid 1@S, since 2@D invites pd to go over 3N with a fitting hand; and you're not strong enough to show @S in a reverse bid with this hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S-2@H-2@S-3@C-3@D-3@S-4@S-5@S-6@D-6@S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|luffe12:  ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sry, miscl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Piek 3@C bid certainly made things difficult for East|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stc: defense doing the job for him|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead helped a lot. Did E know S had the @S suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Rohowsky simply wanted not to spend to much time discussing about east-west system in a 2@C contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzzx: nothing was known about s hand, only relayed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzzx: west forcing declarer to guess whether to play on spades 3-3 or on diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E rescues N:(|pg||

nt|sybarra: now -2 |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||

nt|andreasw:  would it make a diffrent if you had 15 insted?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzzx: yes i was right about the misunderstanding|pg||
nt|glen: -2 good, E goes "hey, slam wasn't making either"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 5@c showed 1 or 4 keycards and gro thought it was exclusion so must be @hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stc: assume a @c defense, dec will pull trumps, finesse once in @s, play @d and go back to @s...I think you are forced to find the right solution|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzzx: declarer claimed:|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "I pull trump and discard on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: this time its the fairplay case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he claimed before dia was lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzzx: NS let the claim through|pg||
nt|dimi: poor EW they have to recover and forget about the last boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west was cut of his spade winner and if he really pulled the trump he would be in dummy then|pg||

nt|stc: wow, why comenting I missed the play...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator job much harder than being player, nicht wahr??|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  38  [4@S-2]  Rohowsky playing 3N West!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: heavy 1@h-opening at the other table|pg||
nt|kingcur: not likely, andreas...I play reverses in answering hand a rock solid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakie +1 to nie umia³ wziac 13?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: claimed 1 trick for EW|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: there was another bid between 6@D and 6@S, guess which :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: back to bidding, I wonder if transfer then bid of @H's would have worked better |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 1 Imp to Ireland, as 1NT survived in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzzx: @s2 lead showed odd with honor or even without honor|pg||
nt|stc: 8 dangerous boards for them|pg||
mb|2H|nt|400 volt: hier zeigt 2@H auch wieder eine @S-Hebung, 4-8 Punkte in diesem Fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ns play 5-card majors, btw|pg||
nt|jaapfr: does he get away with that excuse:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: for gromöller-rehder 1@h would be systematic on the s cards|pg||
nt|runnerup:  8 tricks in nt but not so easy to stop below game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C shows biggest difference between NS Baltic Club and Polish Club|pg||
nt|stc: in other sports they will take a timeout|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Online players would, of course, both make and accept that claim.)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in the 6NT board Felmy - Khanukov had some strange auction leading to the 4-2 fit in spades and an overtrick..|pg||
nt|stc: many online players reject very obvious claims !!|pg||
mb|d!|mb|3H|nt|golfsquash: I'm told that north and west are regular partners!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they find 4@S?|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6 more imps to NL Red, with 4@S receiving a double and making +1 in other room on  6|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h forcing, but not yet GF|pg||
mb|3S|nt|golfsquash: with spades breaking, this will cruise home|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so indeed it could be either @s32 or @sQ32|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: h+minor|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4@S sind in dieser Hand erfüllbar, ob man sie aber reizen sollte, ist fraglich|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@H zeigt vermutlich fit und 2@S könnte dann ein Versuchsgebot sein|pg||
nt|400 volt: ohne Fit spielen viele, dass nach Kontra das 2@H nicht mehr erzwungen wird|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Polish Club uses Precision 2@C opener with 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/1S|pg||
nt|stc: you mean !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget 6 -- get to 4@S first :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: they might get too high after 2@H GF|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: on the other hand, 4@H can be made after other than @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: wenn thomas jetzt aufkontriert, könnte das teuer werden|pg||
nt|santyclz: And then they wonder why no one wants them at their table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: a heavy 1NT, so might have bid a spade on the way|pg||
nt|stc: but would W  return @s if starting with KQxx ?|pg||
nt|stc: fortunately the choosed the good 4-2 suit, @s and not @h|pg||
nt|anton72: dbl is 3 card supp |pg||
nt|anton72: and good decison by Vassilev to pass of 3 spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|luffe12:  sry - was interrupted by a Bridgemate Control problem..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 33 minutes left|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@D wd probably be nf for EW after 1@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cc469: I wonder why 1NT and not 2NT with 11 points ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely not really...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dimi: i think one of the most valuable quality of a top bridge player is to forget about every bad board at once after it was played|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Declarer has to ruff 3rd spade, cross to the @DA and play @SJ discarding anothe @D looser. |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: good question|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so I missed all the entertainement|pg||
nt|anton72: Siderov may be is a bit scared after 5 diamonds |pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  3@D Stayman really helps|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s is not bad and makes, both options, @s/@d finesse are good|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stc: and risking to offer a fast @c discard ?|pg||
nt|stc: this is one of the points where professional players are much better then non-profi experts|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van den Bos when he put down his dummy: 'I hope I don't have too much :)'|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: but still one more looser to go, sorry 4 trick to EW|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cc469: I think I would have not bid @Ss with 4333 shape and 4 weak @Ss|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|400 volt: am anderen Tisch wurde west in 2@D kontriert.Udo Kasimir muss sich anstrengen, um den Verlust auf 2 IMPs zu beschränken|pg||
nt|stc: a desperate 7@d ?|pg||
nt|stc: the only grand you can make is 7@s BY NORTH !|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be disappointed if they reached 7 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @HQ is wasted value|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankaus: declarer shows 2 suits lead trump is a fine method|pg||
nt|kingcur: a bit unlucky for EW in the other room to be stuck in 1@H: especially with opps NV, a hand with a short suit almost assures competitive bidding, after which you could show your ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: strength in rebound...not this time though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sastro: Denke mal , dass 2 Pik den 4-4 Fit vorschlägt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben is out of pass cards|pg||
nt|stc: and of course 7NT|pg||
nt|stc: still loking for 7 on the Q@s ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stc: if you are in 7@s lightner Xed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: forgetting a bad board is easier said than done|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e-w are pure amateur players. n-s are at least experienced players in the international bridge scene|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich bin verwundert, dass Nord mit XX nicht gute @D gezeigt hat (falls verfügbar)|pg||
nt|400 volt: Süd hätte wohl nicht gepasst mit seiner Hand, aber 2@D ist tatsächlich erfüllbar von N/S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: an elaborate system like theirs should stop them from getting to a grand like this|pg||
nt|stc: looks like the first natural bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a @d back frmo the K now should beat this|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stc: indeed, fair enough|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i believe using normal responses to RKC after showing 0-4 hcp  is silly|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|baldfriede: especially when opps rub it in, like Rohowsky did|pg||
nt|stc: he has to finesse here|pg||
nt|dimi: some kibs told me that they even forget about a bad board during playing it ... well :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Smirnov are the only two German (male) players who regullary play professional. Auken- von Arnim are the other professional pair we have|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4th toilet break for Matthias|pg||
pc|dK|nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze werden sich wundern, warum Thomas Gotard seine Hand mit 12 Punkten nicht eröffnet hat. Das liegt an der sehr ausgeglichenen Verteilung und den wenigen Mittelkarten, ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: sodass sie für ihn nicht 12 Punkte wert war|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: so 6@d for -3 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north has shown 14-16, 2452 shape, two keycards and no @dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 38   3N made   i would have bet that both rooms would play 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT made in OR and now 32 with 10 results tom compare and a potential swing for the leading team(5@H-1)|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW picked their 4-4 @S fit here, the only denomination to have a chance at 10 tricks for game|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again north might get the chance to play a @d back again:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: NS use 2@C to show weak hand with 5+@H and 5+ other suit    [except in ACBL events]|pg||
nt|luffe12:  do u agree on pass by W? Never in a lifetime|pg||
nt|stc: JAMM can start packing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please stay in your seats until match comes to complete stop|pg||
nt|stc: one line of play : AK@s, run @c, finess @ds|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|anton72: norwegians in other room skip some A ...play 7 @h|pg||
nt|anton72: in board 6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzzx: will try a showup squeeze i suspect|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, there's still a chance to go right|pg||
nt|kingcur: but not at all easy for S|pg||
nt|chmitty: would still make 10 tricks if he decides @s 4-1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzzx: now they were playing way too fast for my computer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer, with discards to find trys the spade hook|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: did he really play that way?|pg||
nt|stc: +2 looks a bit too much|pg||
nt|xenya: i guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they played the board in 30 secs, i cant only click like one time in 3sec because of the connection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good bidding from Khanukov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is best line    without looking at NS hands|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|stc: Yes, the doctors had very, very good results for non profis|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hQ|nt|stc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Wagner claimed he will score all tricks expect of one but he thought this would lead to just made, he miscounted tricks|pg||
nt|stc: As far as I know von Arnim is not a full time profi (school teacher ?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems  play for @S 32   and something good in @C or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2nd trump then @C|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kingcur: now @C in N...he can see the @D switch|pg||
nt|frankaus: neded N win @C and push @D|pg||
nt|kingcur: last chance now|pg||
nt|frankaus: too late i think|pg||
nt|kingcur: a warm welcome to Pierre Schmidt as well|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|nt|stc: I think this is the best line|pg||
nt|chmitty: hi all :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|anton72: no tempo for clubs|pg||
nt|anton72: one down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cc469: as a passed hand 2NT would be a perfect descriptor of hand value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pitching @D from dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s8|nt|golfsquash: I suggest no-1@c-1@s-1NT-2NT-3NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stc: combines Qx in @S with @C 3-3 and last hope @d hook|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: hmm  i need more time to think about play from dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|glen: not a really sqz since E discards before S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east can still go down finessing !bh|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i think if he had pitched @D on 2nd @C   he could eventually ruff @DQ in dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzzx: claimed on pitching dias now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still true this way|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @h*|pg||

nt|400 volt: und erneut 11 IMPs für das Team Alvensleben|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: toilet break for E...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we have two td here in Bad Honnef, one is sitting silently the other will assign penalties at the end of the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Leif  when do you think Schlicker should bid?|pg||
nt|dimi: i think ortwin needs a break|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: before the round Gromöller and Rohowsky were discussing because neither of them wanted to play, both felt tired|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can EW reach slam here?|pg||
nt|frankaus: last comming up tu all 4 ur company|pg||
nt|kingcur: with another chance on more, since 6@C looks very good here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and sadly -3|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: -3 will teach S that you need some HCP to make a game :) having a @S shortness is a defect of the hand to show GF agains 11|pg||
nt|anton72: last board here |pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: I would bid 1@S if my hand looks suitable for a suit contract but this balanced hand looks NT oriented|pg||
nt|400 volt: Hier geht es im Kampf und den Teilkontrakt. Theoretisch kann Ost/West 4@H erfüllen, wird es aber wohl nicht reizen, aber 3@D oder 3@H könnte schon erreicht werden |pg||
nt|400 volt: Nord sollte maximal bis 2@S mithalten, was auch schon Probleme bereitet |pg||
nt|stc: almost 4@s here ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: something strange happened here in other room ... seems thay had a misunderstanding about the number of keycards|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: therefore, 1NT forcing might be a good alternative. 1S-1NT-2D(shows 11-14)-3H-p|pg||
mb|1D|an|*|nt|stc: looks like a phantom save in OR|pg||
nt|glen: (no idea why N played @S Q, but perhaps though E was ready to play the T)|pg||
nt|thetaker: but North will bid @S now |pg||
nt|andreasw:  is this 10 board matches?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: unlucky missfit, but 2 hearts game force optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: will sail into 6@c|pg||
nt|400 volt: Nach @D K wäre es von Kasimir erfolgreicher gewesen, wenn er einfach Trumpf spielt - West muss dann @D in D10 spielen oder die @S|pg||
nt|stc: It's sad that EW are losing IMP's on such incidents...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after this round the von Alvensleben team might have similar problems |pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT version of multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 board per match|pg||
nt|chmitty: 5 matches today|pg||
nt|chmitty: the field has been divided into 6 teams "sections" for the first day|pg||
nt|kingcur: and if they bring in 6@C here, NL Red will be close to a max result in their first match of today|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: if kasimir were a solid citizen, jokisch might well bid 4@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp   only Walter the Walrus would count north as 7 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: need 1 more imp for 25-5|pg||
nt|chmitty: they will start a full "swiss" tomorrow with starting positions depending of today's results|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: why cant south bid 2 hearts over 2 diamonds in your suggested auction?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|400 volt: das künstliche 2@D-Gebot gegen die Eröffnung von Nord hilft West sehr - er weiß jetzt, dass er die beste Hand hat, die er haben kann|pg||
nt|sastro: im polnischrn <Treff von der Verteilung her eine 2 Treff-Eröffnund- aber die Qualität spricht dagegen|pg||
nt|400 volt: alle Werte bis auf ein Ass in Partners Farben|pg||
nt|400 volt: Ja, und bei Gotard-Gotard ist die 2@C-Eröffnung keine reine "Precision-Eröffnung", sondern zeigt immer ein 6er@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke, thomas behandelt seine hand als schwachen sa|pg||
nt|sastro: 2|pg||
nt|400 volt: Rohowsky fragt sich sicherlich, ob 4@H hier gehen können|pg||
nt|stc: but defense must play @d early to beat 4@h, if not E is endplayed in @d|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but check the result, was probably +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4@D 4@C, EW always open 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but afterwards they needed longer to count the tricks as to play the hand before. they agreed on 10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  after 1@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  6 [3N=]  von Alvensleben playing 2@D South    so STILL no pushed boards|pg||
nt|dimi: 4@h is a nice spot for NS|pg||
nt|stc: This hard week-end is a good trial before a two weeks competition as noticed by specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: would also expced 1@S from north|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they are systematicly allowed to bid 1@S or 1@H on 3 cards if no other bid fits well|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or if they fear to wrongside a NT contract by bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: in the open room, Aarnout Helmich in N threw in a 2@S bid over 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Da aber Fritsche nicht 2@H eröffnet hat (mindestens 5er @H und 4er+ Unterfarbe, unter Eröffnungsstärke), ist das ein Argument dagegen|pg||
nt|400 volt: Ob man jetzt aber West oder Ost den letzten Trumpf gibt, ist fraglich. Spielt man Trumpf und Ost hält ihn, hat man den Kontrakt verspielt, da man @S-Schnitt nicht mehr machen kann|pg||
nt|glen: modern bidding, S gets to open worst suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I prefer 1 @D promises 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: benjamin 2@d|pg||
nt|cc469: p can bid @Ss himself if he has distribution that makes a suit contract look more attractive from his pov than NT|pg||
nt|stc: that NS "produced" an almost impossible extra trick, wd :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: will be sign-off and shows only 5. 11 count and 6c. is better to show immediately|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzzx: i could not hear souths explaination but 2@S can show several at least invitational hands|pg||
nt|kingcur: after which EW actually have an easy way to get to 6@C, but as said, sth seems to have gone wrong after that when it came to keycard asking|pg||
pc|h8|nt|golfsquash: misprint|pg||
nt|golfsquash: the equivalent of 2@c in most natural systems|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@C ist ein partieforcierendes Relay und fragt|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich weiß leider nicht, was die weiteren Gebote heißen, bin mir aber sicher, dass Nord Süd über die Verteilung und Punkte ausfragt|pg||
nt|sybarra: even if only 2 @C |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: don't worry they open 1@c on 4342 as well :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is agreement/style etc |pg||
pc|hT|nt|luffe12:  take it back - second round|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-2@S would be 4-7 HCP, so this sequence is constructive|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lead of  = attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why 2@S was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: either from 4 or 5 cards with an honor|pg||
nt|stc: looks like making 1@s 4@h 3@c at least|pg||
nt|luffe12:  on  9 would u guys give up at 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east asking, north "2nd/4th" ah "nooo attitude"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east "thats better!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the final board of this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: our next match will be Israel - Czech Republic|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzyf: that match will start at 15.20 local time. That is in 20 minutes from now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|400 volt: In dem anderen Halbfinale hat der eine Tisch 7@H erreicht und erfüllt, während der andere Tisch in 4@H gestrandet ist|pg||
nt|glen: i like systems where 1@C is natural or balanced, so I like the NS modern bidding|pg||
nt|chmitty: if 3@s shows shortness in the suit, they are on good tracks here also|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: supposedly i played attitude leads for a long time with one partner [his choice] -- but turns out he always assumed 4th|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: i znow dziwne ze N nie otworzyl uklad 44 na starszych na drugiej rece powinien zachecic zdecydowanie |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: after likely missfit established, down valuing is in order|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@h vermutlich forcierend, 4@d hätte 4@h erzwungen um in partie zu bleiben|pg||
nt|anton72: kibs help me...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|400 volt: ich denke 7@H sollte man nicht reizen, aber 6@H sieht nach einem sehr gutem Schlemm aus|pg||
nt|xenya: i weould love to be in 4@H on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north semi claiming|pg||
nt|kingcur: W actually has a fine hand for an old fashioned 1@C-3@S splinter bid, but nowadays that bid is often used to show suit, not shortness|pg||
pc|s2|nt|golfsquash: no trump finesses now Derek!|pg||
nt|cc469: safest contract is 6@C but hard to get to a slam in a suit that has never been bid :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: should East have shown 2-suiter immediately over 1@D?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|stc: 1@s is a safe contract|pg||
nt|anton72: 2 Sp was invite with 11-12 balnced hand ...without 4cardM|pg||
pc|c5|nt|golfsquash: This will not make|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and 2 down is a possibility.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: N thinking|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If south had raised earlier to 3@h, that might have ended the matter|pg||
nt|golfsquash: earlier Ireland had a 6@s contract depending on playing trumps for no loser missing Qxxx. A seconround fimesse was taken after all followed.|pg||
nt|kingcur: but they got there, well done|pg||
nt|kingcur: the play should be too hard|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzzx: actually they play very old-fashioned polish club|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H was a touch aggresive|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to see cash of @H a now |pg||
nt|sybarra: @S ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has it at his thumb but is thinking some more|pg||
nt|glen: -200 is nice too, deciding if he can afford not to cash now|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: to fasten up the play he tells west what he will play in the next few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the 600 board has now been scored against some normal contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chmitty: tough start in the competition for Netherlands White, sure they will recover |pg||
nt|kingcur: which brings us to the end of this first round and allows me to thank Dennis Stuurman for the excellent VU graph work|pg||
nt|kingcur: and my fellow commentators for their wisdom and wit|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: next round will be in 12 minutes|pg||
nt|chmitty: tx Dennis :) good job|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: bye|pg||
nt|kingcur: see you soon|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump best now|pg||
nt|kingcur: same lead as in other room, and it will likely result in 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|uni_cicam: yes, but still, you want to bid the game if possible. Still can have 25 HCP and 3NT can be cold|pg||
pc|hK|nt|400 volt: Kasimir ist auf dem Weg in den Großschlemm - Jokisch wird aber wohl jegliches Interesse verneinen|pg||
nt|sybarra: better part of valour?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: why, you have almost no play|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cc469: this only makes because @Hs are 3-3 - 36% slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: *valor|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder surprised|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzzx: 12 imps for JAMM that is|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the extra 2 tricks produced 1 additional imp.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4@H has play too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: last time in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekarek played polish leads all his life|pg||
nt|santyclz: When you look at it that way, it's easier to forget the bad results -- same as an undoubled overtrick.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: but it does look unmakeable|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|stc: 3NT -6 gave 12, -4 would have been -11, just 1 IMP|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: in theory at least|pg||
nt|luffe12:  they duly found the @c ruff on  23 - mainly because N bid 5@c in the process|pg||
nt|kingcur: Thanks to Dannis Stuurman for the excellent vugraph work|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I always tell people if one shows a exact range, the other one should tell what to play, and will 11, you want to invite, or not?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: thats it, thanks everyone and good luck to the players in the next rounds|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: thank you we have a break now see you at 1800 hours |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not: with opening bids less these days and a missfit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks all|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stc: claim|pg||
pc|dT|nt|golfsquash: Or is it 38% and add Jx as well|pg||
nt|400 volt: time to claim 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sastro: optimal despielt von Roland|pg||
nt|dimi: what is the save play in @d, cashing KA in @d and then let a @d from S or double finesse in @d after cashing the A|pg||
nt|kingcur: Dennis too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: Piek originally from Poland   Smirnov from Russia|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky will show us the best play soon I guess :)|pg||
nt|dimi: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: King and then low to the 7?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzzx: now he has some option in clubs|pg||
nt|dimi: 2@c was a winner for 4 imps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|golfsquash: 2 down, can't unravel the clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there any native Germans on the team??|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stc: so NS did well to stop and EW in OR made the phantom save and lost the IMPs|pg||
nt|stc: 28-28 in this segment|pg||
nt|baldfriede: sorry, we will have lunch here now. I have to stop|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|vugraphzzx: all others this time...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzyf: thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|kingcur: see you in 20 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results will be on www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then 'competitie'' |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|anton72: wd here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: Thanks all, we'll be back later :)|pg||
nt|anton72: bye for now|pg||
