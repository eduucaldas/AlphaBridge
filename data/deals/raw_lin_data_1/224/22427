pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||

pc|dA|nt|georgia19: bit thin for 3NT, but they have 24HCP between them, do you fancy Graham to get this on the card?|pg||
nt|steshome: I think Sime will duck the first heart and in time collect 2@H tricks and 3@D tricks - i don't think Hinden should move. No fitting cards in partner's suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|bjacobs: 3@D doesn't look forcing to me|pg||
nt|serhat: well may be 2nt =not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of the problems with this auction is that E/W don't know South's suit.  Hence they have no easy cue-bids|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I got stuck with exactly this problem in the NEC recently.  I had to guess ... wrongly as usual|pg||
nt|subhranp:  scores level in this segment so far 5-5 so maya meera continue to lead by 24 imps|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Here Sveindal has guessed rightly|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: wow|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it's remotely forcing.  But it's certainly constructive, and certainly at least a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: flat board|pg||
nt|georgia19: NS playing strong NT so EW find spade fit.....cards badly placed for them|pg||
nt|steshome: E/W play 2@S bid by Hinden as showing the weakest hnad for an o/call in preference to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp:  North and East are screen mates?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|serhat: lets say contstructive plus!|pg||
nt|georgia19: EW heading for a minus, but lead has helped.....|pg||

mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: Very sad result for E/W who were having a very nice set up till then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sveindal might be saying: "I didn't expect you to be that strong, hence my pass".  So technically, the blame goes to the partnership|pg||

nt|bjacobs: If South's double showed 3 spades, and North's 2@H shows 5-4 shape in the majors, then bob's your uncle|pg||

nt|steshome: I have noticed a few 6-5 hands this weekend and people opening a 5 card Major ahead of a 6 card Minor - hate it. What do you think Georgia?|pg||
nt|subhranp:  opportunity for Hemant Jalan here|pg||

mb|p|nt|subhranp:  6h on for them|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|georgia19: I like to open 6 before 5, BUT sometimes, I let the suit quality decide - some suits can be treated as one shorter if they're awful.|pg||

mb|p|nt|steshome: I wonder if 2@D is F1?|pg||
