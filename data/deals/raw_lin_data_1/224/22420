nt|algraves:  declarer has 12 top tricks counting the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|algraves:  the 13 the will come with a Club diamond Squeeze|pg||
nt|algraves:  you can also set up the club as well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers are saying establish clubs which does work, but the squeeze works against clubs 5-1|pg||
nt|algraves:  that runs the risk of a club ruff though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7 spades and 3 hearts with north does not leave much room for clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|algraves:  if clubs 3-3 do not need diamond finesse|pg||
nt|algraves:  very interesting|pg||
nt|algraves:  so maybe best to play on clubs as you make if 4-2 and diamond on side or if clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|algraves:  Squeeze reuires North to have no more that 2 cards in each minor and South to have King of Diamonds|pg||
nt|algraves:  no wonder he is thinking|pg||
