nt|ahollan1: Amoils trying to improve on 2011 2nd place finish    Thomas Bessis won the event in 2010 with a different team|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both EW pairs play big club --  same opening and response structure, but some late round differences|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both NS pairs standard  gitelman-moss 2/1 with gadgets    bessis-del'monte seem to be somewhere between 2/1 and standard french|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: auction shortened for convenience surely|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/2011usbc/acblcards/DiamondPlatnick.jpg|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi all and welcome back for the 3rd segment of this final|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Joe...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco in 6@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: hiAL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set both pairs for Diamond playing big club|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Al (better :) )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson immediate 1N would be 15-18, not sure why he chose DBL unless they play 1N rebid does NOT promise extras|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: and both pairs for Amoils 2/1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 3@H not natural  sort of repeat 4th suit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auction in the other room|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfb: Players continue having much fun :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you flip-flop Del'Monte @H & @C  then Ish would rebid 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Moss led @H3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a swingy lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|penseur9: we all saw that the Diamond team had a difficult 2nd round... let's see how they fare in this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intersting  in other room hampson started with semi-force NT and after north showed max 55 raised @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  Bessis bids 2@C but doesn't show @D fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [i really like Bessis' auction]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone know if NS have been partners before this tournament?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfb: Play of @hQ an option?|pg||
nt|ritong: they have practiced some on BBO|pg||
nt|penseur9: bonsoir Henri... welcome|pg||
nt|ritong: for the live tourneys, i do not know|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: in any case, they have not practiced enough to set this kind of auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 of the players on Amoils team were 2nd last year|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bessis playing with his father as part of Zimmermann team won this event in 2010|pg||
nt|ritong: which might sound strong, but is in fact a search for NTs, then a choice of game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it has been a banner ACBL debut   2nd in the 3-day Platinum Pairs and going for the win in this even more prestigious event|pg||
nt|ritong: bessis has tried to orientate notrumps to his pard, Axx being a weak holding to receive the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 of Amoils played last year   cheek-grue, ish del'monte and amoils|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5th member was bakhshi  [hope i spelled that correctly]|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bagman: Gitelman had a sound balancing X and Moss had a bit better than a typical pass and showed some positive values with the jump;  Now EW ended a bit too high and the trump break ...|pg||
nt|bagman: complicates even more|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: brutal situation - even for long time partnership|pg||
nt|penseur9: very but 5@C seems a reasonable contract here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: when in doubt take a plus ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transportation issues if you take the "free finesse"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume Diamond would NOT lead away from trump Q, so  play king and finesse is very reasonable line|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Much laughter|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra2: only 1 nt  cant be but so much "swingy" |pg||

pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: please don't ask how to play after @H lead  :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bagman: After 2@H p - p; West can pass but the problem with pass is that it might miss game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes -- i'm very jealous|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Bill  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|bagman: With 13 hcp and support for unbid suits, X is (in my opinion) a sound choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Always 15-17|pg||

nt|ritong: but, basically, fred has not @h AKxxxxx|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat nv = 14-16  vul =15-17|pg||
nt|ritong: EW will now need a very brave decision to tie the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no losing choices  treat as 1-suiter in @H  or  both majors   partner has a fit!!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: going for 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but the idea is to keep opponents off the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diamond will be only one not to bid @H :)|pg||
nt|ritong: they are on the rails now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: nice convention, this 2@h|pg||
nt|dburn: super bid for Platnick to have in his armory|pg||
nt|ritong: hi david|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi David|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, extremely pleasant to hit such a hand to use it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid max of 13|pg||
nt|athene: EW are strong club with (in theory) 5-card majors, aren't they?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: and brad covers 5 out of 6 potential losers|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he quietly settles for game|pg||
nt|dburn: shows the amount of work these guys put in to compete at this level - very impressive indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  lost the @H suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: 1@H might be a gently swingy action - they have to do something, after all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  same for EW in other room  [cheek-grue]|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought hampson might open 1N=14-16|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss asking questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Moss is going to lose 2 trump tricks one way or another|pg||
nt|ritong: yep|pg||
nt|ritong: 300 away in any case|pg||
nt|bagman: Assuming Moss is not going to ruff with @S2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Deep thought|pg||
nt|bagman: Moss has the read of the club situation as the defense would have cashed the 3rd club in case they had the transportation|pg||
nt|dburn: practical shot by Bessis also - he could make some technical bid like 4@d, but he didn't want to give West a chance to double that|pg||

nt|ahollan1: good start for EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal 17+ bal [but not 2N range]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: delicate choice for moss here|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming north opens 1@c|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: anything goes versus a strong @c opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5+ suit, game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman bid 3N showing an undisclosed singleton and relay identified the @C splinter|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ritong: 1NT has the merit to picture the hand, despite the feeble @c stopper|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table North overcalled 2@h, and South made a technical bid of three of a minor, and West doubled that, and East saved|pg||
nt|ritong: hoping to be raised, not the case here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: a classical raise with singleton, but lots of quick tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra2: virtually the same auction here  really |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue: "Could have jumped to 2@h to show invitational hand"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Great Shuffler was playing a joke on EW this hand|pg||

nt|ritong: it is not over|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: east has a real good hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and same lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: not completely clear for Platnick to pass, but I guess he will|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very prudent pass on possible misfit|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: other room, wolpert was facing a "weak two", making his decision different|pg||
nt|ritong: when opener was supposed to hold a six bagger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @S4 had shown  i wonder if this is situation where a trailing team would try to generate swing by playing King|pg||
pc|d6|nt|penseur9: difficult hand to bid... and to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we see that Diamond can pin the @C9   but we're cheating|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJT too  but  a bunch of @S doubletons in south good for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession: i didn't think of that on my own|pg||
nt|ritong: unless he can create an entry playing the @h Q, he has few options|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: and as we can see, our heroes are well- equipped|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: both contracts making, so no big swing|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will hold?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: south is not scared with @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  difficult to bid, difficult to play, difficult to defend|pg||
nt|ritong: so he does not care offering an entry|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - South does not fear the diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: but this is problematic for Diamond now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: A club would not have helped as declarer could have ruffed with the ten and taken the rest|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ritong: the point remains, though  i do not like it|pg||

nt|ritong: rdbl= @hs, presumably|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like 2S by East. Definitely the action that wont be taken in other room|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: north surely must re-open 2@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not that this is a hand worth intermediate jump overcall|pg||
mb|r|nt|ritong: and 2@s seems to be equivalent of 3@h with unbal hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue did NOT RDBL|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: i wonder if del'monte is worried about a pass here being misinterpreted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in similar situation either greco-hampson or maybe teammates diamond-platnick described DBL as 2.5 @S bid|pg||
nt|athene: you need good agreements about when a pass is for penalties, if partner makes a takeout double and it gets redoubled|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|penseur9: anybody for 6@D EW?|pg||
nt|ritong: this will be more peaceful|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess 6@d has some sort of chance, but if they bid that, they have done spectacuarly well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = max, not 4@H/@S  [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from their bbo cc  2N="natural, 13+ HCP"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D would have shown 5@D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue: "I deny 5S and 4H"|pg||
nt|penseur9: pity considering 6@D makes|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer should claim 11 after two rounds of @c|pg||
nt|dburn: in the old days West would have opened 1@c and East would have responded 1@d, after which... but no one bids like that any more|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: I could not pass with E hand |pg||
nt|athene: greco needs to count his aces and kings|pg||
nt|sybarra2: however|pg||
nt|athene: that will point him toward the winning action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not his meld of 4-jacks ??|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if bessis will chance his arm with another double?|pg||
nt|athene: i mean the hand belongs to NS in 3@C, doesn't it?|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=0-3@S|pg||

mb|p|an|no club stopper|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i.e. takeout WITHOUT @S|pg||
nt|athene: although it's hard to see where they might choose to play it - it's not even as though they have some 4-3 major fit|pg||
mb|r|nt|Vugraphzfb: Players having lots of fun :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very common treatment in other parts of the world [mostly europe]|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Can't ask of course, and can't see|pg||
nt|henryb:  15-17? 14-16?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s probably equivalent to a negative double without four spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL -- re-stayman|pg||
nt|athene: redouble asks him to make his normal stayman response now?|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
mb|3S|an|4 hearts|nt|Vugraphzfb: Continues to be much fun had around the table :)|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ritong: i think tom will be disappointed to learn there is no grand|pg||

nt|poohbear: really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: Hi Gary, hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hi Andre|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the @h hole is now known|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Hampson's 2@C was artificial|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also works after 1N-P-2@C-DBL   |pg||
nt|athene: looks as though they are playing north bids the major he hasn't got|pg||
nt|athene: so that south can play it, and avoid the lead coming through his club strength|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm told that Hampson's 2@C bid covered a number of hand types|pg||
nt|athene: no, it must be south forgetting|pg||
nt|athene: you would not bid 3@S there unless you knew it showed hearts|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Cheek says "always can have a point less than any stated range"|pg||
nt|ritong: an amusing remark, considering brad is at the table|pg||
nt|ritong: and might say " how so, only one??"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue did play the H Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and vul will be a bunch of imps |pg||
nt|athene: and it makes perfect sense to try to make south play it once north has not got a club stop|pg||

nt|penseur9: seems he will only loose one trump trick here|pg||

nt|dburn: hard not to invite with those West cards, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: bertheau solved a really tough problem really easily|pg||
nt|kareno: Henri, I personally prefer a 3@h overcall with the south hand.  What do you think?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: "Solid suit outside A or K"|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ritong: both are borderline|pg||
nt|ritong: i rerally like 6+ baggers at the three level|pg||
nt|kareno: I believe the hand with the distribution must take the initiative.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: easier to refuse to accept with those West cards - not clear what extras Platnick thought he had|pg||
nt|ritong: he went all in with KKK|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Diamond has left the room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think risk/reward [absent dbl]  supports 4@H bid   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but looks like a stretch to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: clock signal the halfway point for this set -- we are well behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: are we entering the danger zone here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 2S apparently very weak by agreement|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 2900 kibitzers :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes I agree but Jxx isn't a good spade holding for a takeout double either.|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is they have decided cullin will be active and bertheau conservative, for the segment they must win big|pg||
nt|ahollan1: earlier set we saw Bessis jump to 3@S with 5-cards and max|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that ended up making the auction very difficult     but i digress|pg||

pc|c6|nt|dburn: no real reason to panic and bid joke games because of "state of match" - match still has plenty of boards to go|pg||
nt|ritong: i agree|pg||

pc|c8|nt|poohbear: Another broken dream for cheek :)|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ritong: right, but they might cash out, threatened by @ds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue playing confidently|pg||
nt|chmitty: if declarer unblocks @d at trick 2 (as suggested by audience) @h will be blocked|pg||

nt|poohbear: Intuitively I would exit Spade Jack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: @dJ came out in a flash :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this will endplay West if it is ducked|pg||
nt|algraves:  Kibitizers on flooding he airways with the exact number of imps per board|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think he will take and return  a @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No @s return knowing @sJ in Grue's hand :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss deep in thought|pg||
nt|algraves:  Moss is watering his diamonds hoping they will grow |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Every IMP counts! :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I don't think has any choice but to take... what to return may be the problem|pg||

nt|penseur9: that's is East as to...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Could Gitelman have afforded the @s9 first discard?  Upside down|pg||

mb|1D|nt|henryb:  Since they are behind the time schedule even with Joe-Boo at the table|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other room 3NXX [redoubled]|pg||

nt|kareno: Unfortunately not a swing hand (unless someone bids slam without checking for aces)|pg||
nt|ritong: intending to raise @hs later on|pg||
nt|ritong: but a chunky 2@h or the equivalent would be fine too  hand is ugly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and from what i read -- Ish's father was even more  ummmm   colorful|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ritong: stiff honors are not the best features, in general|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: redouble was fast, Brad thought long about how many @S to bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: your opinion about the 3NT bid Henri ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Henri(s) :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pragma|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue "he provides the running suit? :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 10 form Jack or shortness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss thinking deeply|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT certainly has the merit to diminish the chance they find a sacrifice|pg||
nt|chmitty: good point|pg||
nt|algraves:  so playing precision where 1@D is limited gives Grue a chance for very accurate description 5-6 13-15 pts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sonsini  who had large carryover from yesterday   won the Women's Swiss|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: this might go all pass at this table unless greco bids spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: on the other hand, if they do have a cheap sac, perhaps they will lead something else than @s and i won t make 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: but, all in all, if i bid the contract i have under my eyes, should be plus at the end of the year|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cheek refusing to lead what declarer expects|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|algraves:  Cheek has to weigh 3 contracts, game in red suit or 4@D|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT not an option really|pg||
nt|algraves:  typically gamble the contract that has the best chance of a good swing|pg||
nt|penseur9: trump play will decide if it makes or not|pg||
nt|algraves:  This is very close|pg||
nt|algraves:  lets see how it goies|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss thinking carefully|pg||
nt|penseur9: very|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems like a stretch to bid 5D with no working cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|algraves:  for sure declarer has 5 trumps, 4 black tricks and a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Black Aces cover Grue's black holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: @d109 huge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barbara Sonsini-Judi Radin  Irina Levitina-Kerri Sanborn  Lynn Deas-Beth Palmer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|poohbear: still need to produce 9 other tricks |pg||

nt|penseur9: exactly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That game is named "bridge" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ish and his father Curly were known for creative bidding and card play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh  most of the RM lite / meckwell pairs DENY 4@S with 1N rebid|pg||
nt|athene: of course when you are non-vul, going for a swing by underbidding can work as well as overbidding|pg||

pc|s2|nt|kareno: Well, could be a big plus... or a push :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: really difficult without this specific opening|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: hampson expected partner to be 11-13 without 4@S|pg||

nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|ritong: 5 comparisons left...*sweat*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another flat hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: West has a pair of sixes, but South has a pair of queens, so he wins the pot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 hcp, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: other room @D10 lead  [if you don't lead a singleton, you don't have one]|pg||
nt|poohbear: @d running out of boards FAST. Now or never|pg||
mb|3S|an|bid NT partner|nt|ahollan1: very cool bid!|pg||
nt|dburn: might as well, I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same toy used in the other room|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s asks partner to play 3nt from his side|pg||
nt|athene: east wants his partner to play 3nt, partly in case he has something like @SQx|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  for those of you at home who are not yet good squeezers, many of them play themselve as long as you do not destroy the communication in one of the suits. That one operated because he has the club communicationn sitll intact|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: A normal 1nt by south would create a big minus for n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: still, he hasn't made it yet...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he has now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just too tough -- nice bid Brian|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Platnick:  "you've got yours"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: 3@c = no shortness ?|pg||
nt|ritong: they should discover the @c weakness in time|pg||
nt|algraves:  Gittleman has a 7th spade to make up a few points|pg||
nt|penseur9: good advice Allan|pg||
nt|athene: also because the hearts might need protecting|pg||
nt|athene: and if a heart lead is right for the defence, south is more likely to know it than north|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: reasonable 6@c slam that Greco might have tried for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barry  are they allowed to override with bizarre distribution?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfb: 2@C = @C and another|pg||
nt|ritong: and prolly will lose 1 imp|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe that's redouble|pg||
nt|kareno: I play that a double of 1nt creates a force through 2@d - they cannot play 2 of a minor undoubled.|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, east has opened third seat at fav|pg||
nt|algraves:  Moss shows a limit raise and a diamond control|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes of course|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure he can bid something other than 3nt with a freak hand but 1354 isn't close to qualifying is it?|pg||
nt|athene: i mean partner has wasted spade stuff...not up to west to look for this one|pg||
nt|poohbear: well partner rates to have at least one minor suit |pg||
nt|athene: although i wonder what inferences there are from east bidding 3@S rather than 3NT (assuming that is to play)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves:  tricky lead|pg||
nt|algraves:  cover an honour with an honour will net a trick here|pg||
nt|poohbear: more pure holdings bid 3S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: perhaps this factor alterates some your point|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: immediate 3N would show he wants lead coming up to him|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|kareno: I would accept that a third seat opener isn't forced :)|pg||
nt|ritong: which is valid under other circumstances|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4@h denying @c and @d control they stop safely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue "no club control"|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|nt|dburn: a spade lead would, somewhat randomly, have beaten the contract, but that wasn't even fourth best from South's strongest suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kareno: He can be pretty confident trumps are breaking without a double.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|algraves:  Claim|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: yes but i mean does that knowledge help west look for 6 of a minor? doesn't seem so really|pg||
nt|ahollan1: analogous to playing south african texas over 1N  -- you get to decide which hand declares|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: mind you, a club lead and a spade shift would also work|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves:  thanks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|nt|poohbear: so that argues for aggressive slam pursuit with adequate minor holdings like here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: same spot next room, practically identical auction|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|kareno: In the OR they are playing 4@s doubled - won't beat it I would say.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: i guess fred will bid game, facing a 4+ cards support|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, now I hear the auction is not over.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 17+ bal  [but not 19-20]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=17-18|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: So the contract is now 5@h doubled I hear... |pg||
nt|kareno: Was pulled... the auction apparently wasn't over when it was reported to me at first.|pg||
nt|ritong: organize spies trails:)|pg||
nt|dburn: despite lots of points, no game EW is actually very good|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|ritong: mine are tip top:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h lead, 11 tricks ... next :)|pg||
nt|ritong: cheek has no reason to monkey around  1NT usually shows like 8/10, so he simply bids the obvious spot|pg||
nt|poohbear: quick shift to trumps will beat this|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|chmitty: wooow|pg||
nt|chmitty: OK there is a reason to lead a @d : if you want to defeat 3NT, you must find some cards in your partner's hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss was toying with @h7 then switched|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong:  |pg||
nt|penseur9: will they press for slam? let's see|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: isn t that a cute dummy, freddy boy?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oops - swing to Diamond.  Double?  Not my style with the north hand.|pg||
nt|algraves:  This is the type of hand where you want to avoid the weak  4-4  . Two strong long suit fits . Make one of them trump. Use the other for tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|chmitty: and as he did not double 1@s, you can't expect too many @h in his hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
nt|dburn: still, all the rotten ones will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought i saw 1@D   so 1N unlimited over 1@H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: @c 7 = good lead pal|pg||
nt|ritong: aka smith peter|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: open room on their last board|pg||
pc|d8|nt|penseur9: this will hurt the Diamond team|pg||
nt|algraves:  not a very good contract. Gittleman liked his black cards , and Moss his aces|pg||
nt|algraves:  but the mesh is not very good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: We know the @cfinesse is off, Moss doesn't :(|pg||
nt|algraves:  6C down on a Heart lead |pg||
nt|penseur9: possibly will also be bid at other table... otherwise ????|pg||
nt|algraves:  Bridge is a gambling game first and foremost and presents many opportunities for chance to play a role. They could easily have this auction on a different set of hands with similiar values and end in a very good contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: distribution is nearly always the determining factor|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes and the location of the high cards for the fit|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|chmitty: on the other hand, lead a @h may be good if you hit the 5 cards in the suit in your partner's hand, even though he is weak, when the 5 cards in @d may not help|pg||
nt|penseur9: that's another consideration Allan|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: Pass of the dbl  was purely State of the match. If this had been board one Hampson bids 1S for sure|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h8|nt|kareno: I think the double by north is like the opening 3nt saying I have stoppers if you have a 7 card running suit :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: so a good advice : at the end of the year, do what is good with the actual layout :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue "I can count all the points, I almost opened the bidding"|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: works to the tune of 7 imps but a little too late|pg||

pc|sT|pc|h6|pc|s7|nt|algraves:  6@S was the winner  and for the right reasons but of course but that is difficult to find as the Jack is the key card. Indeed if the Jack of hearts had been with EW then slam is pretty good |pg||
nt|algraves:  one of two finesses and a little racing luck|pg||
nt|penseur9: with 2700 watching and 2 commentators... you will appreciate we may not be able to reply to all of you... sorry|pg||
nt|algraves:  as I said bridge will always be full of random chance|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes 6@S does not make either. |pg||
nt|penseur9: given all the exitement... the match is still relatively close|pg||
nt|algraves:  thanks for the analytic help|pg||
nt|penseur9: 58 IMPs total in 25 boards is quite close|pg||
nt|algraves:  the other table is not really sprinting along|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Probably a few more minutes, way ahead players taking reasonable break|pg||

nt|ritong: oh my|pg||
nt|ritong: i am biased, i hate playing 1Nt|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss "I had ugly", Cheek "I'll show you ugly" much amusement all  around|pg||
nt|poohbear: Had he continued @cs and hearts were 5-3 he was just down . they would win the @c and KO the heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: couldnt get to dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: difficult round for the Diamond team... but 2 more rounds to go so all is possible|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kareno: Rule   27, just check with Roland :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 59 imps   2 to play   math says   Congratulations Amoils!!!   extremely well played|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2011 = 2nd place   2012 = 1st   what happens in 2013??|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  this is two down at least|pg||
nt|penseur9: looks like it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what is needed to raise @D immediately|pg||
nt|ritong: 4 cards|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: open room just finished play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 2C=clubs and another|pg||
nt|ritong: frenchstyle speaking, that is|pg||
nt|frankaus: may get 40% on thurs now LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Down to 2000 kibitzers :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: wonder what they need to not open and rebid @hs :P|pg||
nt|ahollan1: makes sense  especially if 2@D can be 4-cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   told you the other room was finished|pg||
nt|poohbear: could understand it if it was a straight flush and you were playing poker|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he has a draw|pg||
nt|ritong: not that bad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hampson treated his @H as 4-long|pg||
nt|dburn: no other rebid possible in standard French|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think this means  Ish Del'Monte Thomas Bessis will tie for most monsterpoints won in the tournament  2nd in Platinum Pairs and 1st in Vanderbilt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: his 2@H rebid showed 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: well..not really..2@h means " i have no other possible bid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: possibly due to slow play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: considering 2NT would be 15/17 or promising stoppers in unbid suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm talking about other room auction   1@D-2@C//2@H = 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|ritong: and, as said, @d raise = 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: vs 1NT, any convention which allows to show @cs is ok, imho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is something like 350 platinum points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 200 for 2nd in platinum???|pg||
nt|poohbear: but they wont have a chance to get player of the year as a partnership. Bessis will play with Bertheau starting in Philly in the summer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 150 I think -- winners of PP got 200|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or is Vandy worth more than 200  -- i'm checking Platinum Pairs total now|pg||
nt|poohbear: i think they got 400 total|pg||
nt|poohbear: vandy 250 I believe|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred keeps running out of pass cards on these long auctions|pg||
nt|ritong: only chance was a fake @h cue  over now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Expect @dQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: not me. I expect trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: Moss know declarer is 5-2-4-2|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm told that fyi -bessis-delmonte stopped in 4 hearts on  29|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia would flip in on the table :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok  confirmed  pairs was 150|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|ritong: ah, ok|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d = extras, 2NT obscene, 2@h = "j'y suis, j'y reste"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: point is   they've had great tournament|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|ritong: @cs are an endless source of good boards|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: if del Monte had any nerves in his whole body, they would be jangling now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final session scheduled to begin in 9 minutes|pg||
nt|penseur9: if this one is finished :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|poohbear: this is what happens when both sides play same suit. One is wrong :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Cheek needed to set up side suit before the second trump|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'd play the @H king here|pg||
nt|poohbear: On board 30 Delmaonte Bessis stopped in 4H so 13 imps for Amoils against 6H-2 here|pg||

nt|chmitty: the 8 Imps scored by Diamond so far involved 6 different boards ... :)|pg||
nt|daman:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 actually|pg||
nt|penseur9: last board here for this round...|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer wouldnt have scored the long @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Last board of "afternoon" hope all are enjoying this fine bridge :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I wish to thank Gary Hann, our great operator for a job well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OK - last for the set|pg||
nt|penseur9: last board of this session |pg||
nt|ritong: an other opportunity for the trailers|pg||
nt|frankaus: true but when they do strange things that work/fail  really makes a big difference|pg||
nt|frankaus: sorry private|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco asks "who is playing in overtime?"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: last board of the set     final 16 boards begins ...  whenever they restart|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: we can call that grinding, yes  fireworks are scheduled later on|pg||
nt|poohbear: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i guess cullin will reopen|pg||
nt|chmitty: may be this board ?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Double = strong|pg||
nt|poohbear: will restart in a few mins|pg||
nt|penseur9: a big hand of applause for Joe Stoke, our excellent operator...|pg||
nt|dburn: pre-emptive effect of the strong club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another very fine session for  Bessis-Del'Monte|pg||
nt|ritong: lol david|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great line from Eric Greco|pg||
mb|2D|nt|algraves:  no declarer is always down only two from the beginning but subsequently , yes .|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pass = 0-4|pg||
nt|poohbear: strong @c  . Dbl shows the majors  . |pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  I was talking against par|pg||
nt|algraves:  sorry|pg||
nt|penseur9: i also wish to thank my co-commentators Barry, Allan and George for their fine work|pg||
nt|ritong: @d should reopen|pg||
nt|ritong: weak, but shaped|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, the strong no trump may prove an equally effective pre-empt|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks to my co-commentators (who did most of the work :) ) Al, Henri and David|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: final board of the session   restart in about 30 minutes  [unless players agree to start earlier]|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: same start in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and now, moss faces a hand almost woth a superaccept|pg||
nt|kareno: Congratulations to Diamond and we wish them luck tomorrow.  Thanks to our excellent operator <applause>|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, hold your tickets for tomorrow's final!!|pg||
nt|ritong: so he might be tempted with 3NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Final is noon Eastern time.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody knew whether East 2N was minors or just stronger NT hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: maybe EW could have escaped the x in other room, but let's pay credit to Greco for the @h lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree Henri. Partner either leads your singleton or they run that suit. |pg||
nt|ritong: you can do something big, overall|pg||
nt|poohbear: or partner leads your 6 card suit and you missed game :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pard obv has cards, well placed|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a fit and here we go|pg||
nt|dburn: not so clear - if you bid, sometimes partner bids more than you can make|pg||
nt|ritong: vulnerable, i disagree with this pass|pg||
nt|ritong: right, david  the jackpot syndrome|pg||
nt|dburn: but at least 1NT might go down more than one here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never knew it had a name|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  Precision club, X for majors|pg||
pc|d9|nt|penseur9: we must not overlook the fine contribution of all our listeners... thank you all and hope to see you back for round  3 in about 2 hours and 10 minutes|pg||
nt|algraves:  cheek X for takeout|pg||
nt|algraves:  North converts|pg||
pc|dK|nt|poohbear: Passing 1NT in bal with a 6 card suit and a singleton is losing Bridge in my opinion|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: 8 nice imps|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, Platnick won't know how good his lead was|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: via 3@s, that is  but brad rejects it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding 5@D would just be greedy|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have balanced over strong C pass 1D p 1NT p p like in other room|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|dburn: and del Monte will rewrite the Dictionary of Suit Combinations|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: plus all the finesses are working|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 1 pitch in 5@D   retraction please|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess Grue took Cheeks 2 of @cs as suit preference|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|ritong: we stayed absolutely quiet:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: so 8 imp's to Diamond on this one, and 24-16 in total of the set :) see you all soon|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Kantar used to write up suit combinations like that  from his partnership disasters with Marshall Miles|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: the stories were hilarious|pg||
