mb|3S|nt|mouser:  East couldnt stand it|pg||

nt|agumperz:  which seems entirely sensible at any state of the match|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|swanson:  E-W have to defend well to set 4@H here. Get the spades going before declarer can play a diamond towards the king.  |pg||
nt|swanson:  That looks like a 3@H opening to me.  I don't really understand using a weak two bid.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|agumperz:  and our last board...|pg||
nt|agumperz:  Bessis bids an aggressive 2@S|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|agumperz:  Dahl superaccepts the transfer|pg||
nt|agumperz:  with a goodish 17 HCP|pg||
nt|agumperz:  this will get them to game|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mouser:  Half a miracle possibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  This might be an 11 or 12 IMP pickup for E-W.  They need at least one more deal, however.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|agumperz:  game is going down, but it isnt unreasonable to be there vul at IMPs|pg||
nt|agumperz:  if the diamond ace was onside or the heart queen|pg||

nt|swanson:  Dummy is squeezed on the diamonds.  Declarer will have to take the club to avoid losing two spades at the end.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Thanks all.  Thanks to BBO and the ACBL for the great show.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Club finesse|pg||
nt|swanson:  This match was so close for the Ventin team.  Simply avoiding the disaster on board 59 would have been eough.|pg||
