mb|3C|mb|p|nt|adonis18:  strange that S doesn't have a forcing opening|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  they play up to 23 pc openings|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so N is obliged to keep up the bidding even with 4 pc after 1M opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|adonis18:  there maybe a good principle in that, being able to bid two 5 cards suits in a smoother way, always difficult after a forcing opening|pg||
