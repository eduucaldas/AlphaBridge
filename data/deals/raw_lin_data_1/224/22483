nt|kingcur: closed room's result looking expensive, EW have 3N to make|pg||
nt|iceking: should end up in 3nt here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|iceking: w took some bad views in closed room |pg||
nt|tomi2: they needed @CK to be onside to win 5@D while 3nt will make easily|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|iceking: w realy should just bid 3nt now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kingcur: yes; if that turns out to be wrong, the most likely thing is that it will be copied by your opps|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed its just normal bidding |pg||
nt|tomi2: i also like 3nt here. sometimes partner brings something in hearts, sometimes they have only 4 tricks cashing and sometimes, like now, north will not know if heart or club will be ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: the better lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kingcur: and Stephen Rose doing the sensible thing here, for a first swing to Scotland|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|tomi2: first question, Milan you probably know more - isnt Michal Kopecky too old for juniors? you cant be juniors all of your life! :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I am here to help you understand the bidding of the Czech pair, both players are my regular partners|pg||
nt|tomi2: I remeber I played against Michal and you back in 2006 and unfortunatly I bacame older since that :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, he turned 26 this year. He is more a playing coach of the rest of the team |pg||
nt|anton72: hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome from a sunny Amsterdam :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that does give you access to Open Room Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|stc: one big swing difference, the match is open|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the TD stopped punishing such behaviour after both teams agreed. so there are no more time penalties in the final|pg||
mb|1S|nt|400 volt: Guten Abend allerseits|pg||
nt|400 volt: Beide Paare spielen einen schwachen SA in der Eröffnung|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi this time sesson it is not sensible to guess final contracts -so colorful they where last session |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: TD gave them 10 minutes extra and decided that both pairs were responsible for the last delay so assigned NO penalties|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!N here or 4@h? 4@h ofcourse best but 3!N with 5-3-3-2 over 4-3-3-3 is quite common|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Das Ost-West-System ist relativ natürlich gehalten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: difficult break in spades in this first hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if 4@h can be a form of weak bid pass from tofte might be dangerous and chooses to bid 5@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: A@s hilft|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, sorry for the confusion just now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS a polish pair, but they do NOT play Polish Club|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS playing weak NT 11-14|pg||

mb|3S|nt|400 volt: Ja, da sind einige ungewöhnliche Sachen drin|pg||
nt|stc: reicht aber nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: der kontrakt geht nur, wenn west im ersten karo stich mit dem as steigt|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS leads  2nd/4th|pg||

nt|anton72: thank you ...sure :)|pg||
nt|anton72: N avoid the standart lead in clubs ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Yet, the results were as expected: All teams in the semifinals were expected to get to the semifinals|pg||
nt|400 volt: But there is a very clear favourite - the team "Jamm & Co"|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5@h should not be a good result for e-w .. although 7@c/@d is only -500 so might not be that bad:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3NT the right contract here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: heading that way I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: west can bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: If East has singelton @h she will surely bid again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last chance|pg||
mb|4D|nt|runnerup:  so 6 @c missed |pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: from the player's notes: 2NT = 9-12 or 16+, 3@s and 4@c cues|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: ew lead 3/5 throughout i believe|pg||
nt|kingcur: so all specs consider yourself lucky I'm not sitting in the sun :)|pg||

nt|bebechira: hi all :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  11 quick tricks:)|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|stc: a good slam with not many points. @s 2-2 and short @h on side making the play easy |pg||

nt|kingcur: so, first blood drenched in malt whisky: 10 to Scotland|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is a rather lucky board for scottland, this contract seems far worse than 5@D by the german girls in 21, but this time it made|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|iceking: yes 5@S was not a good spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kingcur: it looks like they tried for 5@S after E bid on to 5@H, but they never did|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D shows 4(5)+dias but as far as I understand their system, it is not limited to 14|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|iceking: not easy here for S guess he has to bid 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: slam not on, as we can see|pg||
nt|tomi2: they might reach slam here|pg||
nt|tomi2: beeing asked why no 2@C rebid. i would rebid 2@D as well, that dias are much better than the clubs|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@D 4@H 5@C and now S tough|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|tomi2: and 2@D leaves the option of bidding 3@C in a nonfocing context next turn to have a full discription of his hand|pg||
nt|iceking: its a diffecult hand |pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|kingcur: @HA out required to beat the slam, though|pg||
nt|iceking: S has to bid slam now |pg||
nt|tomi2: unclear what strain they will play|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|iceking: is there any reason for N to pass this|pg||
nt|iceking: N can see discards not really needed here so might remove this to 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: not the best slam ever, but might make on a good day... you need a friendly layout in clubs (always) and spade finesse if they cash their heart trick|pg||
nt|kingcur: the power of the 4-4 fit shown here: 6@D only on with the @SK behaving, 6@C making whenever @HA is not lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6@C seems to me as a better contract than 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: east might lead @S after this bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: tough lead, I must admit I would probably give the contract in the opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzye: drumroll...|pg||
nt|iceking: but should lead @H ace i think |pg||

nt|stc: but before it have been worked, ending with say 2 @c in dummy and Q10@s in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov was thinking about playing east for one spade more and one @D less|pg||
nt|andreasw:  http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: the official tournament site is www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||

nt|frankaus: do we all open E hand  I vote yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think results will be on www.bridge.nl|pg||
nt|kingcur: as always well maintained by Rosaline Barendregt and a few others|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 11H |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played for the first hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: well played by Kopecky, may be too fast for some of us :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you must connect both rooms, operator|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 11 tricks  in an easy contract to start with|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@s n-s here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north claims that he bid as if there had been no 1nt and after 1@C-2@D = hearts 2nt they have a system. south bid system off (=natural)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to endplay n on that line.|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 1@H|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening transfer preempts on 2nd level, too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: certainly a high standard of card play there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H = 8-11 with 6c. or 9-14 with 5@S+5m|pg||
nt|sommer: oh oh|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, it didn't matter - this wasn't a deal where declarer could pitch a spade on a club, then set up a long spade for a heart pitch|pg||
mb|1D|nt|golfsquash: worth 3@s|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diese mBoard könnten Nord/Süd schnell mal zu hoch geraten|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that was a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: then he would need to play a heart from dummy forcing east to ruff|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning all|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s -1 by EW ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier to concede a @d early. 2 3 4 1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky is not very happy with this bid :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: first option is 8-11 with 6 clubs? or 6 cards?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|400 volt: 4@C bei Nord/Süd und 3@S bei Ost/West ist das Limit|pg||
nt|stc: was für NT spielen sie ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 12-14 beide|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir spielt sogar 11-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@s promises 5, but 1@h only promises 4 in e/w system (swiss acol)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW used to play a modification of NS Baltic club but they found out it was too complicated, so they switched to some easier system at the beginning of the year|pg||
nt|frankaus: i value it a 15 count|pg||
nt|kingcur: agree: if you open light, it's important to have a good suit, and this @H suit qualifies for that|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sorry, 6@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will be more happy now :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS is saved, is there an option to get to 3NT by EW side?|pg||
nt|anton72: Curiosly is that i comentating match between country where i am born ...BUL ...and country where I live ..NOR |pg||
nt|anton72: splinter probably is 3 di|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 6 rounds of 10 boards today|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dimi: yes probably -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ³adnie przepuci³ kiera Robertson, |pg||
nt|tomi2: ISR leading, CZE 2nd. the teams have been put in four grops of 6, playin a compleate round robin today and will go on in a swiss movement tomorrow and the day after|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just checking the website, i see these 2 teams are lying 4th and 1st|pg||
mb|3H|nt|400 volt: Yes, 3 NT can be made by N/S, but east/west will bid 4@S everytime|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat geschrieben "2@s gute hebung"... wundert mich etwas...|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D ist eigentlich relativ natürlich im System von Ost-West. Der einzige Grund für das Alertieren kann sein, dass West auch mit 5er @C und 4er @D 1@D häufig eröffnet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hab ich mir schon fast gedacht, dass er hier mit kontra in die reizung einsteigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: thats the problem with playing artifical methods - you need detailed agreements or some really good working meta-agreements in competition|pg||
nt|stc: I even think that with more free places in E the crossruff line was a bit better|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Good fireworks here|pg||
nt|stc: anyway good start for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Alex said in the end that he should have played the cross ruff. but that needed to start in trick 3|pg||

nt|xenya: once again, a somewhat conservative move by E|pg||
nt|dburn: but here is another tough problem for North-South - getting to 6@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this is a slammy sort of hand|pg||
mb|d!|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt opening would be 11-13, so this rebid shows 14+|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players produced so many big swings that they all speed up playing for overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or book that introduced the method   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south passed and explained to west "I have a clear pass on 2@S but I was thinking because I was not sure if thats natural"|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Ja, 3SA können von Nord/Süd erfüllt werden, aber Ost/West gehen immer auf 4er-Stufe|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube nicht, dass 3SA von Ost irgendwelche Probleme bereitet. Sogar 5@D geht. Mal schauen, ob Ost/West sie erreichen|pg||
nt|sastro: mit 6-4 bevorzuge ich zuerst die Wiederholung der 6er-Länge|pg||
nt|stc: keine gute Idee von N|pg||
nt|stc: aber 2@h ist nicht soo schlecht|pg||
nt|dimi: @s K @h Q and 2 @c tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hard to guess the singleton king.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW are very slow players and are in danger of beeing to late every segment|pg||
nt|stc: NS must just cash their tricks before the 5th @d is played|pg||
nt|stc: in other words S must play @c when in hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: novay min 4 me |pg||
nt|frankaus: no way |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results are at www.nbbportal.nl/1003, then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|kingcur: but with two aces and a decent 2nd suit, this is not even a light opening|pg||
nt|dburn: that might give them a chance, if it's a pure takeout double|pg||
nt|dburn: but I think this is too difficult|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well its a good bid, but not sure north will try clubs|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but nothing will bother it|pg||
nt|anton72: E hasnt he control ..so...we just in Game|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2 teams here are No 1 (Netherland) and No 3 after 5 rounds  (in 4 groups) now 12 x swiss|pg||
nt|andreasw:  anyone for keeping open with a dbl or a 2@h bid on norths hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: but a pergectly reasonable one|pg||
nt|dburn: he probably has to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well he does bid 4 hearts..|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, not enough pitches on diamonds anyway - still need the spade finesse|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|400 volt: Auch 5@C kann man schnell mal im Gegenspiel schenken, von daher ist 5@S sicherlich ein akzeptables Gebot|pg||
nt|400 volt: jetzt hat sich Udo Kasimir etwas zu hoch gewagt - die Hand steht aber auch schlecht für ihn|pg||
nt|400 volt: Der Gegner hat @S KB8x UND der @C-Schnitt sitzt nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben got a 10 imp penalty for slow play|pg||
nt|stc: better now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer may simply pull trumps from the top|pg||
nt|stc: not very likely but possible of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ducking that was risky, vuln south could hold 8 hearts and noting outside|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S now game try $ me|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems it is, now how to make it :)|pg||
nt|xenya: perfectly*|pg||
nt|xenya: very delicate contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some players will overcvall 1NT with E|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: can insert the king and unblock an honor in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: club lead might break the communication. Declarer has to play his suits from his hand which is not good for him in this board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be difficult to defeat...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to get entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry, i mean in 2nd club trick  finesse the 9|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: defence has to put Declarer once on the table with A of @H and another possible entry is @C8, but not easy to find it.|pg||
nt|tomi2: and later overtake the honor, in case michal forgot to insert the 9. south would do well to switch to a small dia when he wins a spade trick, that would denatly cut the ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: communication|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, declarer can play his @S from his hand, establishing 2@S tricks, 4@C, 1@H and 2 @D which makes a total of 9 = just made|pg||
nt|tomi2: cant NS open the hearts in time then, to score 2@S and 3@H?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: timing is important now|pg||
nt|tomi2: they seem to block because they need to finesse dummy's 10|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Another easy 3 nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 Then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: other tournament info at www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|pelu: ok Israke and Bulgaria both 3/4|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2NT does not promise 4@h here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: N can have any invitational hand|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case, might as well be in six diamonds|pg||
mb|5C|nt|400 volt: Nord hat nur 6 Figurenpunkte, aber mit einem sicheren 9-Karten-Fit und einer guten Verteilung ist das 3@S nicht völlig unverständlich|pg||
nt|runnerup:  time for 800?|pg||
nt|stc: 5 obvious losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what 1@S asked/showed   but it allowed North any easy bid  [versus something like immediate 3@C]|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: DBL seems ok to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with 5@d-2@h you dbl immediately over 1@s, so now dbl is this shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: hier kostet es 500 - aber gegen mögliche 400 beim Gegner kein allzu großer Verlust|pg||
nt|runnerup:  is south worth 3 @s -with 8 points and 7xxx in @s maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  other room stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: a decent save|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the club finesse is best therefore it seems..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, seems so, and thats a bit unlucky as there seems no endplay|pg||
mb|5S|nt|golfsquash: Good morning all|pg||
nt|stc: wieso hat W @d entdeckt ?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns never mensioned -the suit they make a slam (lucly ofcause ) @s|pg||
nt|stc: clap-clap|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even though east is a substitute it seems they have control over their system:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure how many of his regular agreements vd Bos has agreed with Tim Verbeek but this looks like a relay sequence he used with v Lankveld as well: they play a fairly natural ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: system, but with loads of gadgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: gf relay quite standard among dutch juniors|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H the limit of the hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: the 4-4 fit often plays better, but here we see @s's split 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke mal 2@s zeigt schon 5-4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise to me though that north didn't drive to game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: schlechte stimmung bei den senioren, kratz/sträter sind mit der spielgeschwindigkeit ihrer gegner nicht glücklich|pg||
nt|400 volt: Gegen wen spielen die beiden denn?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich glaub der eine ist yves mucha|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe some side effect, that explains the imo poor level of bridge here besides the tight schedule was last night... it was Alexander Smirnovs 30th birthday and most of the players ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: were at the bar (too?) long|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he had bought champagne for all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  4@s could have problems although it should make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well getting lost now|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all :)|pg||
nt|dburn: wasn't thinking of five spades, but it may be the last chance for a plus score|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 3@C probably does that too :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S seems playable|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C K protected|pg||
nt|kingcur: and W declaring 4@S seems like the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d lead looks best to me? altough North might get creative and lead a small @c here|pg||
nt|tomi2: N could insert the 9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stc: sry, Ich dachte an einer 1NT Opening !|pg||
nt|tomi2: to prevent this|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello Bob|pg||
pc|h7|nt|runnerup:  level -to be honist must admid has been a dissopointment but colorful boards and happenings|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Jokisch proved theirs ablities on the piano|pg||

nt|anton72: for me looks cool -1 ..let see|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|stc: now -2|pg||
nt|xenya: probably down 1 -- unless declarer is clairvoyant enough to drop 1DK |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess this will just make :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess it will - if this South is looking for a shorter name that will fit on the BBO name plate, he could try Houdini|pg||
pc|d8|nt|stc: klar, er hjat 1@d eröffnet|pg||

pc|s3|nt|xenya: nice game missed here?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: also south sitting over the stuff|pg||
nt|xenya: i hope i'm not resulting, but i'd try 3N as N|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: high = odd count|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps -it will beb down -entryes are too bad -sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: club lead = low from doubleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thats what i meant|pg||
nt|stc: do you think they make 6@s ? big communication problems, don't think they make|pg||
nt|luffe12:  sry for any confussion|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kingcur: and will now look to set up his side suit first|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@s was a mild slam try even|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  lead 2nd/4th   so  weak doubleton leads LOW|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Just 8 tricks, but north coming under some pressure on the run of the hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does north do after  1@C-1@H-3@C-???|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: making now if he reads it right|pg||
nt|sastro: pik 8 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@d would have been sign-off|pg||
nt|frankaus: now will be breathing hard - but lon @H & @S with S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stc: and trump promotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he bids so that NS go minus|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sastro: 9|pg||

nt|bobholl: hope and pray|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|tomi2: but since he played that way he might not realize that ths contract was simply cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: yes, very important now to be able to stick away this result and concentrate on the boards to come|pg||

nt|kingcur: and NS believe he will do just that|pg||

nt|frankaus: can get ugly 6322 not a gr8 shape|pg||
nt|kingcur: and it's not even extremely junior-ish to open 3@D nowadays|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i believe preempting high is best at these colors|pg||
nt|dburn: slam on not a lot of high-card points and only a nine-card fit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: oh -- i should have refreshed screens :(|pg||
nt|kingcur: pressure bidding being the way to go nowadays|pg||
nt|anton72: surely you will miss 1 point ...but ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like a set of test hands so far..|pg||
mb|4C|nt|luffe12:  this board is a fine example on how great 10+ trumphs works |pg||
nt|stc: 6@c is a very decent contract|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@C leaping Michaels presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: non-leaping actually :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east values looks great.. i dont they they will stand at 5'th lvl|pg||
nt|kingcur: and N adding his part in the preemption...E might want to double for penalties now, but not sure if that isn't agreed as forward going|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: interesting to see what Verbeek comes up with now|pg||
nt|frankaus: just @C i ecpect planing to introduce @S later to show 6/5|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: pass and pull? |pg||
nt|kingcur: has E got enough for a pass and pull you think?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe east is afraid of W passing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: very risky indeed in a one-day partnership|pg||
nt|kingcur: for specs: this is an agreement to show a better hand than you would be showing by bidding directly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening 2@C as weak with majors, but this hand is too weak for vulnerable|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: another 3NT contract|pg||
nt|xenya: and declarer was almost certain the finesse would work  |pg||

nt|uni_cicam: someone told me that 7222 distribution is very close to 6322 which is very close to 5332 which is almost 4333. With that hand, you will bid 3NT immediately, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2nt is positive with fit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 1 Nt could prob be a weak raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We need to shut down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tes, difficult for west not to bid on|pg||
nt|pelu: I forgot - juniors :) - S only have to a contructive raise to 2@s - But "The law" again cost|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tables are not linked|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 diamonds alerted, but looks natural|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C goes already for 800 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: she alerted, so I did too|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: first pass, let your pd double and then bid: hence the name|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably would have gone down in 6, losing the @sJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: i even alert my 1nt opening as "may include 7 card suits"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East shows clubs, but there is a nasty duplication in hearts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 6@D   be honest now -- how many people thought about THAT bid??|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W has bad values for slam even he has a maximum hand in HCP so he shouldnt go for a slam|pg||

nt|stc: now 170 EW :)|pg||
nt|stc: of course splits are very bad and even 5 @c is not so easy, 3NT lokks OK|pg||
nt|stc: 9 easy tricks, some endplay with N for ten ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe NS need to lead spades, though|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: as I have written before, inviting slam with 7222 needs a lot of HCP and especially a lot of controls.|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W should bid 4NT now to be able to stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  the law!!|pg||
nt|dimi: but if you only see the EW hands 6@c would be the best contract|pg||
nt|stc: sure, W must be disapointed now but happy later|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can make 5nt double-dummy with the @hKJ- but that's not a likely result at the table.|pg||
nt|stc: DD you can paerhaps even make 6@c guessing @Hs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but west will likely bid 4 hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|golfsquash: lead directing, implying a heart fit on passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ew play weak nt so 1nt shows extras|pg||

nt|ahollan1: instill doubt in East  in case grand slam is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west is still thinking|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this one was played a few boards back:)|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, N has a nice hand, with those chunky majors |pg||
pc|dA|nt|sastro: denke mal, dass mit Fit die Nordhand ein 4 Couer-Gebot wert ist|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@H sieht hier eigentlich gar nicht schlecht aus - bei dem aktuellen Kartenstand aber nur mit viel hellseherischen Talent zu erfüllen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: der schlitten für die bietkarten ist kaputt, g. thamm versucht ihn jetzt zu reparieren während dieses board gespielt wird|pg||
nt|luffe12:  20 trumphs = 20 tricks totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room   33 [4@HW-1]     Fritsche playing 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: when the tray is on my side i try to avoid clicking immediatly after a bid has been done because it's possile that they hear my mouse on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|xenya: but it seems she chose wrong time to bid on|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gronkvist:  1M-2M = 7-10 hcp for NS|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, slam is not plain sailing for EW, and 5@Dx should bring in more than 650...let's see|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well judged...|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: found about missing @S cue. But wrong contract and 2 imps on 8 board match might be crutial|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3NT would be better. on a @D lead they need the finesse now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup:  3nt makeable by guessing @d |pg||
nt|runnerup:  so it means that you you play like this -now @s finess is odds on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missing some hesitations Tomi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: @s10 2nd, 4th|pg||
nt|sommer: y|pg||
nt|andreasw:  vugraph cordinator just giving everyone  a chance to see all the boards:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Switching to English now|pg||
nt|stc: welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking about the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet    Khanukov WOULD have played @H suit correctly after the 4@S opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov shaking his head after seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|tomi2: think they play 10 boards. does not change too much anyway, 1 imp can easy be 1vp, yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h and 5 @c down because bad sits -with good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south unsure about the meaning of norths bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: not sure whether this contract is doubled...|pg||
nt|pelu: the highest making contract is 3@D - and now fight on the 5-level :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so, peter the 4 spade bid is a winner|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|golfsquash: N/S playing x-y NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 2@c demands 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: mit @hA vor dem k ist hier alles relativ egal, aber jokisch versucht natürlich eine linie zu finden die auch gegen möglichst widrige verteilungen noch erfïult|pg||
nt|runnerup:  on a good day even 6 @c makes ..not this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky seems totaly unsure what is going on but from west questiones he can imagine clubs splitting not so well. unfortunatly for he would be dummy. screens in use, so north and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south do not know who was thinking when|pg||
nt|bobholl: he sees only 9 sure tricks :) |pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Probably intended as an entry for the @c finesse, the @hJ dropping changes the line.  He did that just to spite my prediction...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer will give a @c and then has an entry to the @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dimi: Joe, declarer might heard your plan for 11 tricks :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl claimed on any return and no single king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to leaders on 33   shouldn't be long wait till we know whether 6@S was good or bad bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult to stop in 3N, should be happy with this I think..|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Czechs reached the slam on the other table, will be expensive|pg||
nt|pelu: only if u play Pokere and weak or very agressiv opponents|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: also not sure re the reference to "juniors" who underbid the last hand|pg||
nt|xenya: rather aggressive of course -- and they layout far from friendly|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andreasw:  im not sure it will.. but taking the safe road is problebly best|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 10 tricks here w a nice @h |pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzzx: td called|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps south is out of what is happening |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking what to do when he gets no expainations from south|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south trying his best to explain|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: welcome to felix zimmermann|pg||
nt|400 volt: Hi all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: perhaps N would have done better to overtake and play @HQ -- |pg||
nt|pelu: N will have time for that later|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: on board 21 Israel did not preempt at all, so Helmich-Hop played a quiet 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well netherland Red of to a great start|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with a very likely gain on the next board too|pg||
nt|xenya: note E's duck -- it couldn't lose|pg||
nt|xenya: worth remembering|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: and on B22: 3NT +1 = 7IMP|pg||
nt|xenya: as he knows the spade position|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|frankaus: so the 6322 shape goes $ 1100|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt ist ost auf jeden fall engespielt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: both discard a heart|pg||
pc|hT|nt|uni_cicam: I will bid 3NT directly against 15-17 NT, probably getting too old :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I may be wrong, but think quite a few teams will be in slam...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|golfsquash: and if north bids on over 2@d he has a game invitation hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:) 1100 seems right|pg||

nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|iceking: this works though if N doenst have the 4th @C |pg||
nt|kingcur: good point by Thomas: first playing the heart suit may get you additional info on the distribution|pg||

nt|400 volt: dann hätte man es auch erfüllen können|pg||
nt|400 volt: exactly :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: welcome glen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to Open Room Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|frankaus: 11000 in the bank would be nice |pg||
nt|kingcur: I'd say EW made the correct decision here, so well done for this occasional partnership|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems the bidding will go 1@C-1@S-1NT-3NT if EW will pass all the time|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 4@C bid also made the club slam beeing played from the wrong site in case partner has some kx holdng in spades and potential discards in another. maybe a jump to 4nt after 2nd ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be right. partner could pass on a "bad" hand or convert to 5 or 6 clubs on a better one|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: agree with Thomas|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@C from S will shown 11+ unbal with @C, 18-20 bal, or 21+ any|pg||
nt|anton72: for norwegians ...sorry :)|pg||
nt|anton72: i am a litle distracted :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sorry need to restart again, we lost connection with the other room|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, spotted 10 and took them|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: west claiming he would have doubled if he got some better information about the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: this smells like slam, maybe a grand|pg||
nt|frankaus: another 5 level excursion to a loss|pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  now a dist monster |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 5@c was not doubled, so only -200|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: this will end up in 4@S EW, potentially very fast|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: all 3 boards look pretty good for the Czech |pg||
mb|2N|nt|golfsquash: could bid 4@c if not too strong in his methods|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@H sieht eigentlich recht gut aus - aber gegen @H 5-0 und @D AJ hinter KD sieht es nicht erfüllbar aus|pg||
nt|glen: classic question - red, in 2nd seat, the N hand does not fit a weak two, but does it anyways|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Grand on a @d guess|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@D probably some good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: as this E hand seems a little heavy for current tandards for bidding 1mi-4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: standards*|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: vdBos-Verbeek also play strong jump shifts, so 2@s would have been GF 5+@s with more outside values|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 5@d now bye W?|pg||
nt|friggi: any guess? 5|pg||
nt|bobholl: took probably extra chance of 4th @H with @C ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 2@D zeigt einen zweifärber mit @S und einer zweiten farbe, @H oder @C|pg||
nt|sastro: Kontra heisst iA : Ich kann eine mögliche Farbe des Gegners kontrieren- sehe ich hier nicht|pg||
nt|400 volt: entweder unter Eröffnungsstärke oder eine starke Hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kontra wurde schlicht als "punkte" erklärt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@s könnte sogar gehen... spannend|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C?|pg||
nt|glen: the reason for not opening - poor playing value, the reason for opening, hey, i would have opened it in 1st or 3rd seats|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi Friggi|pg||
nt|pelu: B23: Hop in S only show a good raise to 3@S, and EW in 4@d|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|golfsquash: I like 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@c is nat or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  assume they end up in 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3@d shows values (2nt would have been lebensohl)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning Shirley and Glen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Leif|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: orth obviously upset about that last hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south and west seem to thinkk north has hearts!|pg||
nt|dimi: 7 will probably go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: nice opening by E, makes it more difficult to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but EW do not keep quiet|pg||
nt|friggi: hi Johan|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|golfsquash: magical 25 HCP slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch-kasimir have a quite unique system|pg||
nt|stc: This result may be anything, push or swing in any direction !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@D overcall shows 10+, solid hand|pg||
nt|gsper:  Well, what did you bid last time in this situation?|pg||
nt|friggi: 5@D|pg||
nt|xenya: routine 3N -|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ew can make 5 @h but can be many down if different sits |pg||
nt|frankaus: this auction right sided the contract now @D lead gives up a trick|pg||
nt|kingcur: the danger with transfer-agreements always being that it allows your opponents a double to indicate values in that suit and enter the bidding at lesser risk|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3@C asking for stopper will get NS there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, he sure has that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  6 @C was cold|pg||
nt|friggi: dif to find after 5@D|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|golfsquash: could have tried 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch hatte erklärt dass 2@d in dieser geflage eröffnungsstärke zeigt|pg||
nt|xenya: S can hardly make a move now -- has to take it like a man|pg||
nt|luffe12:  11 from the top - 12th from at possible double squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: bright an early in Washington DC |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west explained 2@D as if 1@H = hearts would have been bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south to west: 1@H is natural|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north would perhaps be declarer in 4 @s (d?)  if he had bid a couple of @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now rohowsky remembers|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they agreed to treat the system as polish club and 1@H showed spades against non natural systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2 [5@DX-2] von Alvensleben playing 5@C South|pg||
nt|luffe12:  good "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|baldfriede: W may get into a squeeze when trying to protect Q@c. which is not the way to brin it down, bzt hard for W to know unless E shows it somehow|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but*|pg||
nt|kingcur: but here it worked out well, with @DK now protected|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky now regrets his 2@D bid :-) but he has to show the stopper|pg||
nt|pelu: so "only" 3 IMP for NL|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben bei ansicht des dummys: "damit eröffnet ihr?!?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 24-26 but might be on a very nice 23, we are told|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 sp may be showed some shape|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry for Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i don't like rdbl with real fit here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this should lead to 3!N/5@d which both make|pg||
nt|xenya: think i'll get coffee|pg||
mb|3N|nt|golfsquash: 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So 1 down here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  very difficult after 5@d|pg||
nt|friggi: after the lead yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: though this is clearly too good a hand for 2@s nv|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: td was still at the table, he has not to be called :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  7 tricks seems sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can be 7+ with no 4-card major   or  7-11 wrong for 1N|pg||
nt|kingcur: and brining in a discard for a loser|pg||
nt|anton72: or just is asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: getting 9 tricks shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
nt|luffe12:  3nt is easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: from souths point of view the lead must be a singleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  would u X with the N hand or 3nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low from xx does NOT include  10x   that leads 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N way too much opposite balancing DBL|pg||
nt|xenya: down 2 for 500 -- but 3N NS is very very close -- 4@H might go down though|pg||
nt|tomi2: he has 3 card fit and two kings, nothing to regret|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@DS: making on B24 - decl setup the @Hs and no @c-loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and possibly another one in hearts|pg||
nt|anton72: West need to play that one carefuly|pg||
nt|anton72: expecting K he |pg||
nt|anton72: like lead|pg||
nt|friggi: overtake|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so as I say, the 4 spade bid is a winner|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|golfsquash: cash 4 side suit tricks and claim|pg||
nt|xenya: there is an entry to dummy in @Ds, so...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir studies opponent's cc|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they lead 5/3|pg||
nt|xenya: whichever high heart will do here|pg||
nt|dimi: ok also 6NT is an easy make, probably loses only to the @d Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, but didn't clarify strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S is not forcing|pg||
nt|friggi: is mandatory|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: east apologizing for his dummy|pg||
nt|andreasw:  disaster for denmark here.. im guessing Raulund believes that the dbl showed @s support and tofte believes Raulund has at alot of @s:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: DD easy 9th trick but in practice it is coming now :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzzx: @cA erfolgreicht geduckt... jetzt tippe ich auf -1|pg||
nt|sastro: Treff 7 machts|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: this will be played very fast i guess|pg||
nt|stc: not a great contract with 4@s and 5@c making|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekarek comments "it cant be true"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but this may be a good lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|luffe12:  S could be a little bit less i 4th seat but N have fine support all over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  2   looks like 5@C going down|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so close to "All Square"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking about the lead agreements again, south looked suprised expecting partner and not opp wil ruff this|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i was wondering -- on the surface, 5@C looked like a make, but there are pitfalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he did know SOMEONE was going to ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: first double explained "we mandatory double with spade shortnes and 7+hcp"|pg||
nt|stc: yes, DD you just give the K@c and score 5@s, 5@c and A@H in 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 5@C on 2 did fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2nd double: "double on 2@S would be penalty, so I guess this one is penalty too"|pg||
nt|stc: I think that 500 here will by a swing for NS|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but they pl @dk to @dA and a @h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so u are doomed, right?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  since u are looked in hand |pg||
nt|luffe12:  fine piece of defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer won't lose a trick if playing for the @d finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ew asking abut the auction|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|xenya: of course W could have @H9 or @HQ |pg||
nt|anton72: seems defence can get maximum 2 trumps and 2 hearts more|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: i thought it was   example:  includes 18 hcp 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: it can be weak nt with 4 spades or 3 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|stc: in fact 6@c as spec noticed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or 4 spades and 5+ clubs any strength that survives a pass from partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or 5+ spades, 18+ hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: WOW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = not 4@H, a) 11+, 3/4@S  b) 18-19, 5@S  c) 11-20, 5@C & 4@S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sastro: auf Treff Bube geht Karo weg|pg||
nt|400 volt: wieso hat denn Ost nicht @S nachgespielt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: actually e/w play slavinsky leads|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: could you expand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3 [3@SW+1]  von Alvensleben in 4@D South   so  like previous 5@C -- now he just has to make it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, but wasnt easy to count the points at the table :-)|pg||

nt|friggi: trump|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So next time u have a 5 card in the opening suit and a solid 8 card suit bid 5 :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  I'll make note of that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|anton72: lead was giving unexpecting trick for declarer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: althouh that xx not to everyones taste, EW judged well here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cc469: N's hand became less impressive with announced @C singleton with S opposite his @C values|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think the high lead showed either even length with an honor or odd length without an honor|pg||
nt|xenya: the mind boggles :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and N has no entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks suprised that south has a trump|pg||

nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey povl:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|luffe12:  S must guard @C N the @s so no one to protect @h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  maybe to avoid any kind of endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekareks carding was consistent to KT9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no, in fact may be better for north to duck, as declarer may have got the spades wrong|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sastro: wie vorausgesagt- nun Treff 7|pg||
nt|400 volt: hat Jokisch wirklich @C 2 geordert?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  figth for contract here |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|stc: a big missed oportunity for EW to come bach in the match|pg||
nt|anton72: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|friggi: trump was necessary to reduce @S ruffing|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a very bad contract with both 5@D and 3N playable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: on bd 1 the bidding was more exciting in the open room|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stc: was|pg||
nt|stc: was not the 3@d very positive ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after Piekarek had commented souths bidding for a minute i did not guess this would happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per CC   East leads King from AKJT  else Ace |pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|golfsquash: overtrick now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Not any longer - declarer should give up a club |pg||
nt|glen: declarer ducks @C to S, to prevent @S play from N|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: upside down attitude   @D3 with north showing the @D2  is most encouraging|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: now hope that teammates bid 6@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: tournament director points out that they have taken 50 minutes for 4 boards so far|pg||

nt|glen: so close to winning a beer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was it Tomi?   seems trick 2  @H2 shows South holds @CA  so @CKT9 would not play King|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players discussing the board, alex agrees with you that he meant @H2 as suit pref|pg||

mb|d|nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: NV, EW will compete heavily I expect|pg||
nt|frankaus: really interesting hands - did they feed the dealing machine red meat?|pg||
nt|kingcur: and there they are|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 5@dx -5 won 7 imps for red|pg||
nt|kingcur: same final contract on  3 in open room, but only 4 off there|pg||
nt|anton72: kibs help me...they play 0+|pg||
nt|gsper:  What an anticlimax this board is|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D will here have a good chance in W|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well lets not being on bbo change your bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: ungewöhnlich, dass man eine 5er-länge gegen die 1SA-eröffnung gegenreizt|pg||
nt|400 volt: meine Wahl wäre hier Kontra gegen den 12-14 SA|pg||
nt|sastro: sieht für Alvensleben stark danach aus , dass Partner ebenfalls die Coeur hält|pg||
nt|santyclz: I seem to recall an old column by Reese in which he was faced with a 2-way finesse.  He solved the problem by leading the J of a suit in which he held the Q and observing LHO's ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: reaction.  He then led the suit in which he didn't have the Q and noticing a slight difference in the reaction finessed LHO for the Q.|pg||
nt|xenya: and it was made (with an overtrick) in OR|pg||
nt|andreasw:  quite the distrabution these hands have:) but there is allways one who has the boring one(balanced):).. 6@c /6@D needs the double @c finesse to win with a @S lead:)|pg||
nt|sommer: yes.. 1) @Slead from N is unlikely 2) THEN he needs doublefinesse..good!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4!N W now?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..I would have|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some play 4NT = minors and 4@h = minors but stronger|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe to good?.. would u raise to 6 with east hand?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|400 volt: gut, dass West Kontra als pass/correct zur Verfügung hat, so wird der @S-Fit gefunden|pg||
nt|400 volt: mal schauen, ob man 4@S findet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt kann ost evtl 3@s reizen?|pg||
nt|sastro: kontra zeigt Hand mit Bereitschaft in Pik. Hat Partner Coeurs soll er drin bleiben|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i could have been drunk this very wednesday on that account :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: understandably, gotard not happy to open 1@d, so 1nt the practical choice|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s 4-1 ,@h finess of -so probÃ¶ems in 4 @s|pg||
nt|runnerup:  problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: actually they have discussed their system in that sequence 20 minutes ago, hope both remember|pg||
nt|dimi: NS can make 2 @c, EW can make 2-3 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we had some similar problem yesterday, when one player complained his oponent took some short time to follow a single honor|pg||
nt|stc: yes, the winner must play better in the euros|pg||
nt|kingcur: 5@C a make for NS here, and they may bid it too|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S showing an opening hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2 d is transfer to hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|anton72: nothing artifical to this moment after opening ...|pg||
nt|dburn: then he is well above a minimum opening bid, at least in terms of his diamond holding|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and I dont like 1st hand 3@H with that hand...by the way|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!n now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 3@D wird vermutlich eine Werte in @D zeigen mit einer guten Hand|pg||
nt|400 volt: (und natürlich die @S), da 3@C einen guten @H-Fit bestätigt|pg||
nt|sastro: ein gutes taktisches Gebot von Kasimir, das den C-Fit verdeckt|pg||
nt|400 volt: das ist für West natürlich ein Traumgebot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch erklärt dass ohne zwischenreizung 3@c jetzt maximum, 4er @c und kleines double in @c gezeigt hätte|pg||
nt|runnerup:  wd -now ew makes 9 in @s and ns 10 in @c |pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to defend with the N hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pachnie szlemikiem|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: gives N a better raise by 2@H, but still too weak for that|pg||
nt|xenya: is S worth a bid now?|pg||
nt|sommer: 3N - 4@D forcing! |pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzzx: e/w playing some funny defense where they pass some strong hands... perhaps west regrets that now|pg||
nt|santyclz: My partner and I used to have on our convention cards: "Opening leader's partner always hesitates at trick 1, even with a singleton."  |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: sehr diszipliniertes pass von rohowsky|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks in @h on a sqz @s/@c against N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drury|pg||
nt|kingcur: doubling 4@H showing interest to bid on, I expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: don't think S is good with wrong singleton and 3 small @h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  can u make this one?|pg||
nt|sommer: X could be ok from W, but didnt work here|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H says 5+ @H and 4+ @S -- but it's the other way round :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: yes its the other way around, also explained like that|pg||
nt|xenya: and W's 3@C rebid confirms he took it as 5 @Ss and 4 @Hs |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@c was alerted, so I think they have a misunderstanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Looks like this will just about get home|pg||
nt|golfsquash: this knocks out an entry but should be ok for 8 tricks, play on spades first|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably not|pg||
nt|anton72: and North hand is good enough for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  i booked 4 X !7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time east had 17 -did west know that? -i douth|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzzx: seems to have reached a normal contract though... unlike the other room!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = nat or 4-fit 10-11 hcp  or  3-fit one round force|pg||
nt|xenya: alerted by both?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no only by E, the screen is E/S and W/N|pg||
nt|xenya: i see, thanks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: by far the best lead though|pg||
pc|hK|nt|golfsquash: and a little respite for the Scots|pg||
nt|sastro: warom nicht Treff Dame ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: He could have opened 1@C and repeated 2@C, showing 15+ with 5+ @C|pg||
nt|luffe12:  @d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: dont know how that works but 2@C was explained as drury or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: as i mentioned earlier NL white is a team with quite unexperienced players. this is their first international tournament|pg||
nt|anton72: something went wrong :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Sout might have made some move in the direction of a slam, it is true|pg||
nt|anton72: ofcourse slam is too lucky|pg||
nt|anton72: Hi David|pg||
nt|gsper:  Everything is wrong. A couple off?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so a tough lead for Ida (W)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with correct defence|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzzx: ah yes, right|pg||
nt|sybarra: this wont work out well,  @D's not behaving |pg||
nt|luffe12:  no chance whatsoever|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: but doubtless South has seen plenty of North's opening bids before|pg||
nt|anton72: yes ..they just missunderstood probably 2 NT is artifical|pg||
nt|friggi: what about @H7|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  nice start for the def|pg||
nt|friggi: good lead and now @H return|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dimi: Wagner needs 2 entries into the W hand to double finess in @h first to the 9 later to the J|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: drury OR nat??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not a transfer to 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow, they have arrived at a reasonable contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: could have tried @s10 at trick 1 but didn't really matter|pg||
nt|golfsquash: no, ignore that|pg||
nt|golfsquash: good duck, keep control|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: aeh 4er @h meinte ich|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben fragt nach @c9, antwort zeigt länge|pg||
nt|luffe12:  declarer should run the clubs immediately and hope for a miracle|pg||
nt|sommer: -1, it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: albeit a delicate one|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|stc: nice result from OR, wow !|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|frankaus: just -2 |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3rd/ 5th leads and through decl|pg||
nt|gsper:  Anybody know how many @C the opening showed?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  -1 might be a + board though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gsper:  3+, Finnish kibs say|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dimi: ok no finesse :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 10 tricks could have been made from double dummy, but Schanka playes safe, trying to postpone the @H guess|pg||
nt|gsper:  In a year or two it will be down to 2+|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|anton72: all finesses is on the way :)|pg||
nt|anton72: have a safety play|pg||
nt|anton72: if he guess where is a last heart|pg||
nt|anton72: K Cl ..diamond K ...all clubs and finessing E in Di|pg||
nt|anton72: bad is missing card in hearts|pg||
nt|anton72: 9|pg||
nt|xenya: N applies breaks with his @HQ wrongly placed |pg||
pc|c3|nt|dimi: know he might go down, @c to N and a @s back|pg||
nt|dimi: now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|anton72: W play Q J 8|pg||
nt|anton72: so he could be 4-th|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: hmmm |pg||
nt|luffe12:  careful now|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW plays 2+ already :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  The Finnish are supposed to be more true to ancient customs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sommer: guess (very much) so|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|anton72: if they not lead in NT 3-5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|uni_cicam: honors should be clear now, W will probably not bid 2D with onle @CK and @HQ|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like EW's defence against NS's 1@C roughly comes down to this: you pass with a balanced hand, no matter how strong, but bid on an unbalanced hand, no matter how weak |pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzyf: S shoukld not ruff now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tough hand for declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sastro: hätte er klein zugegeben, hätte er seinen König wohl immer nch gemacht, weil AS das falsch raten würde|pg||
nt|kingcur: with x@D lead, 5@C should be played with care btw to not lose a ruff to E|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So NS plays weak 2 and 5 c M with 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|gsper:  A kib tells me that Aimala is already with one foot in it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2 down now|pg||
nt|friggi: strange to discard @S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: nicerly played|pg||
nt|xenya: S is helpless|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: refuse ruffing is still 1 down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|400 volt: Gromöller is not sure how the @H distribution is - but he seems to be sure not to give the trick away when he plays a @S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|golfsquash: 4@s costs 500|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  35  Fritsche-Rohowsky stop in 5@H   but Gunther still has chance to bid 5@S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..for Belgium, that is|pg||
pc|cK|nt|400 volt: still has the important @D J - if Gotard had 9 tricks, he would hav etaken them|pg||
nt|xenya: trump now and another club|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|friggi: discard @D and play for split @S hon|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So sweden lies 4;th after 4 rounds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sK|nt|luffe12:  allways easier when u c all 52|pg||

nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: best for defense if 10 of spades cashed and @H J is pitched |pg||
nt|luffe12:  where is @hj? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: again easy from here |pg||
nt|dburn: Kralik will survive his adventure in the bidding - not quite sure what that was about|pg||
nt|xenya: no, not club -- spade as she did -- well done |pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4 flat boards in row|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|xenya: something you might do when bidding against a genuine stron 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think any bid shows either the next suit or the two above|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  declarer did not apply Rabbi's Rule  [when king is singleton, play the ace]  so 4@D down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still 3 imps to tie the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final contract  5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we'll never know if Piek 6@S good or bad   but it doesn't lose a lot against the game|pg||
nt|kingcur: so two off a good result for NS if the other room makes 5@C|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s here seems normal?|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW, sorry|pg||
nt|anton72: some goulash distribution |pg||
nt|friggi: this was as disasterous as possible|pg||
nt|andreasw:  gonna take a few lucky boards to win this one now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sorry for some flashbacks, but then people can see what happened|pg||
nt|xenya: looked like misunderstanding -- E took W's 3@C as artificial|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but south errs and lets them out for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  results to date are http://www.camrosebridge.com/|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  currently England are in the lead with 134, Scotland are second with 121, Wales are third with 114|pg||
nt|cc469: on the last board, S is the hand that essentially makes slam a possibility - I think N's rebid of 4@H opposite the announced singleton with his p was quite proper but S should bid ...|pg||
nt|cc469: 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: weak 6/7 clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The SBU has 97 Ireland 91 and Northern Ireland 71|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only bad if Khanukov was going down in 6@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|luffe12:  but 5 x @c from the start could have made life a bit more difficult for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: here we see the weak nt version of the polish 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: the 4/4 fit may be better than the 5/4 fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hm sollte das ein alert sein? bin mir unsicher|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1sa zeigt 4er @s und 5er UF|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e.g. 1@d would have shown @h or @s+@c|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can make 3nt here -but hardly will be bidden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with only 42 boards to play|pg||
nt|dimi: @s from S was a bad  card|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he did not read parners signal in clubs as encouraging|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north did not want to overtake in case the lead was from Tx he said|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and he reminded partner of the low spotcards in dummy|pg||
nt|stc: not a lot, just 3 IMP|pg||
nt|stc: or 4 if only 5 made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5+@S   [Kaplan Inversion]   so why 2@S???|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west said he was thinking about bidding 6nt or even 7 because he expected 6@D to be void and he had aj... so he planed on some finesse |pg||
nt|kingcur: S bidding his 2-suiter...looks like Michaels, is that correct, Dennis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@h to play here, with INV+ van den Bos can make a cuebid|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: this does not seem as a openning hand to me Thomas :-)|pg||
nt|anton72: I think Siderov is enough agressive to observe and reach 6 He|pg||
nt|gsper:  The N hand is of a troublesome type. Suit weak for a jump rebid. They may have some gadget|pg||
mb|1H|nt|400 volt: 10-16 punkte|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: may not need the club guess playing in hearts with a club going on the long spade|pg||
nt|cc469: ... with controls in both side suits and a 5th @H to boot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sicherlich nicht die antwort die rohowsky befürchtet hat|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c starts relays|pg||
nt|stc: EW on the way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: according to the system, he could bid 2@S to show 54 with minor|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H is a better raise to @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: you mean 1@D by east?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so now N must bid atl 3@s|pg||
nt|friggi: what about 2NT|pg||
nt|gsper:  3NT rather|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: would everyone dbl with south?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Nt w a small @h|pg||
nt|xenya: double dummy, he could have made 4 by dropping @SK, then endplaying E in @Ds|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England - tough for Goodman-Pownall who played both sets in that match|pg||
nt|400 volt: der Trend geht allgemein dazu, Kontra als Stärkekontra erst ab 18 Punkten zu spielen, für Rohowsky aber offensichtlich nicht :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. kann in dieser sequenz auch 4@d5@c haben|pg||
nt|sastro: polnisch - 8-15  4er Pik und längere Minore|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: no, sorry, overcall by S, should be an openning hand as in previous board|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 14-16, 55xx|pg||
nt|stc: the trailing team recovered almost all, now a very close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so a slight upgrade but i think the hand is surely worth it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir can now bid 4@h rkcb or 4@d to sign off in 4@h i believe|pg||
nt|tomi2: did 2@H show hearts? or do they play some sort of transfers.  would find kjx in spades and some ruffing avalues the most important thing to show in this hand|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would not with minimum strength and not the slightest @S fit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  not mee either|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@h was a good bid|pg||
nt|gsper:  S may not like it much|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes as the play went, in fact seemed like a case for the spade Ace as safety in 3 spades |pg||
nt|xenya: bergen-like 3@C?|pg||
nt|xenya: invitational values with 4 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: or jump fit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: maybe 3@c shows @c + @s|pg||
nt|xenya: clubs and spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzzx: oh maybe 4@s is rkcb for @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate the leads from  4333's  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Slavinski leads for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fritsche played @H for no loser so made overtrick in 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: saves an imp|pg||
nt|stc: this IS FAIRPLAY from Smirnov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and implies 6@H would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in our room|pg||
nt|stc: in fact he expect AQ @s in W !|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1@h 3+@h, 2@c probably puppet to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: This is the par contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: low = odd count with honor or even without|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS play the cuebid as other Major + @d |pg||
nt|kingcur: 10 imps away for NL white on  4, when they didnt reach a rather obvious 4@S vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in Holland many top pairs play Michaels with known suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so partner can judge better if bidding gets high quickly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, 2@H shows 3@S fit and 8-10 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: slam was reached at the other table on 14|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No but S was the one who started...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: after a 4@d overcall|pg||
nt|friggi: that is the difference|pg||
nt|friggi: between 4 and 5 overcall|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so what shows 4 NT |pg||
nt|gsper:  N would like to know that|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: clearly intended as 5-5 minors|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  we see that but not N i think|pg||
nt|friggi: yes but as well as stronger hands this|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: will they reach 6@D?|pg||
nt|kingcur: and with his hand, N will not care too much what South's minor will be|pg||
mb|p|nt|sastro: meine Wahl wäre forcierende 2 Karo|pg||
nt|stc: 6@h is a complex contract(easy in DD)|pg||
nt|glen: well at least picking the "longest and strongest" from 4333 is easy|pg||
nt|glen: here though a @D lead would help declarer|pg||
nt|glen: (how to make 3 tricks with ATx opposite Q8x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = one round force|pg||
nt|anton72: 2 di is positive 8+points 5 +diamonds GF|pg||
nt|anton72: 3 sp ...values ...or just 4 he|pg||
nt|xenya: in either case, N is not excited|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@c just fit, not promising @c|pg||
nt|xenya: cute|pg||
nt|bobholl: pass or 2@D ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzzx: fritsche freut sich, endlich mal einen unkontrierten kontrakt spielen zu dürfen|pg||
nt|runnerup:  needs some guesses to make  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|golfsquash: shame it is going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: seems they have some science in action here|pg||
nt|dburn: probably owes partner a bit more than just 4@h|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may not consider his hand worth a move above game|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i would dbl with East, you want @s lead|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|golfsquash: so much for the theory in the Majors|pg||
nt|sastro: der Ausspieler ist in 4 Farben geendspielt- wie soll er auf klein pik kommen|pg||
nt|luffe12:  he came off very well this time - but not much to do |pg||
nt|gsper:  Know nothing definite about the bidding, I would like @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: or should you really be afraid for @sA and 11 minors?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Mike knows that 6 Nt gors down but 7 in min could|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: it's a good contract i think|pg||
nt|stc: in fact you discard @c on @d and must start @h in the good direction|pg||
nt|stc: of course it is|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N very awkward |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = 15+ HCP  5+@D|pg||
nt|dimi: nice|pg||
nt|stc: with friendly @s you could even make 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: looks like -2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well 2 diamonds looks normal, but perhaps doesn't want to play 2 spades, so an early pass|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: not laydown by any means but worth trying|pg||
nt|stc: the first @h is the key of the play|pg||
nt|dburn: but Siderov has taken the helm now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yorkbeach:  system notes for Walsh-O'Gorman http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/WalshOGorman.pdf|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in board 4 east was in 5 @h xx -and played it -1 ..so bad day it can be -1600 or so -and a good day if you play for it +1600 ,now 400 out|pg||
nt|anton72: yes :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: i do not believe they will bid 7@D:) but mb wrong|pg||
nt|luffe12:  smoth duck i @d|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|xenya: any clue here as how to play trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: some misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|stc: and now samll @d from W, wd|pg||
nt|anton72: i told you ..he si enough smart and agressive :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|anton72: good job |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@d much better then 1NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: GIB gives only one card as a make... J clubs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|golfsquash: amazing result at the other table|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: DEclarer has to establish @C tricks soon, otherwise he will loose control because of bad @S break|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sastro: Karo war noch das beste, weil es die Kommunikation angreift|pg||
nt|dimi: if he tries to finesse in @d even 1NT is down|pg||
nt|anton72: may be the bid is not so theoreticaly good ....but is practical |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|stc: closest to your finger :)|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  heard an interesting analysis last weekend |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov explained 1NT as " I may pass with 12"|pg||
nt|luffe12:  as it is, 3nt still ok|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he must have smelled a rat|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he saw the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: probably :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that's why he smelled it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@D = any negative or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he already saw @CQ and knew west failed to bid positive holding at least one major|pg||
nt|bobholl: but gib sees 52 cards on a@H continuation not made i guess|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to Rory Timlin|pg||
nt|xenya: but now it's makeable|pg||
nt|sommer: guess, this will go 2 down, despite -1 is possible|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board 5 could be a possible 17 swing?|pg||
nt|sommer: N had a strong pass, and does he look like the favorite to have @Dleangth?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  jxxx and QJ blanc.. is it not the same odds?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  jxxx or QJ blanc*|pg||
nt|sommer: it doesn't matter much, if Belgium bid and make 6@D. It's 17 imps instead of 15 for 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with @d xxx North might have dbled 1@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|400 volt: das sieht nach einem Überstich aus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But i had dbl 6 Nt every day|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|400 volt: auf den hohen @C J (nach @C zur 9) kann Fritsche den @S-Verlierer abwerfen|pg||
nt|sastro: allerdings tendiere ich zu 1 C und nicht zum Kontra|pg||
nt|luffe12:  wd|pg||
nt|stc: very lucky, @c 5-2, Q@H on side|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: Hi Julian|pg||
nt|stc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  still some avoidance work to be done|pg||
nt|luffe12:  low|pg||
nt|xenya: still it feels defence could have done better |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  [3@SX-2]  Rehder playing 2@S undoubled|pg||
nt|luffe12:  hard to imagine, how NS was kept away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 38 boards   218 imps    WOW|pg||
nt|sommer: the @Dfinesse is best now, because of the rule of "resricted choice"|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: restricted choice: south might have played @dJ of QJ, but has to play Q with Q bare|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's not over yet, but as the cards lie declarer can hardly go wrong|pg||
nt|luffe12:  that leads from Kxxx are almost as costy as from KJxx|pg||
nt|luffe12:  or Jxx(x)|pg||
nt|glen: was that kit woolsey?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hint for robot tourney players: GIB never leads from Kxxx ;)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|kingcur: N will lose two trump tricks but will hardly go wrong on the D's, making dummy high|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: E should have ducked another @S, Schanka should ruff the @D with K and return small @S to play safer|pg||
nt|friggi: agree |pg||
pc|cT|nt|gronkvist:  very strange bid bye S with 4 Nt|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|stc: playing his only chance, wd|pg||
nt|luffe12:  wd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|luffe12:  no - one of the voice commentaries here on BBO|pg||
pc|d3|nt|friggi: yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: i'm certain 2@D won't be the contract in the OR|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sastro: der SA _Überruf hat ihm verraten, dass West das as Blank haben muss|pg||
nt|stc: he can't, even with 4@c in E he would have no problem, only with 4 in W|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence still ahead it seems|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzyf: I am sure it will be 1NT, a tough contract with @SJ lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|luffe12:  NS has a fine set so far - and a bit of luck too|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N asking?: why did you not bid 4@S"?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kingcur: results of previous rounds at www.tinyurl.com/whj2012, no running scores unfortunately|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Our match after the dinner break at 19.00 will be Israel vs England U20|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D also denies 4@H|pg||

nt|iceking: its agressive for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|iceking: he has a limit @S raise not really the values to force to game|pg||

pc|d2|pc|sK|nt|kingcur: there's a nasty trump split to handle here as well, so not made yet|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could either bid 2@S after 2@D to say "i had only this invit, its up to you to investigate a game" or bid anythingelse, that would have been game forcing|pg||
nt|kingcur: high ruff a first good start though|pg||
nt|kingcur: and @C play required now for the double finesse|pg||
nt|kingcur: for which two entries to dummy are required|pg||
nt|tomi2: since there was no 2@D overcall he might place the @HA to east|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: anyway this is not really the way to make up a 45 imp deficit|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: PO Sundelin here as kibitzer at the table. He's captain of the Swedish team|pg||
nt|kingcur: so far, at least a game on on every board|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: whispering jokes in Tim's ears|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: @C to the 10 in the second trock will win the contract, but hard to see |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: comlicated hand, but it seems declarer had a chance playing side suits first|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he bought a good dummy, but there are worse dummies he could buy where a favourable lead might help him make a poor slam|pg||
nt|anton72: sure|pg||
nt|anton72: you are 100 % right D :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: and both other pairs from the von alvensleben team|pg||

nt|xenya: or just cards (if he thinks he has that)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south may try 4 clubs I suppose|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzzx: south: nowadays splinter shows 3 card fit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north "what else cani do"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south: lead of the ten?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west: single, Tx or HTx|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north: "probably single"|pg||
nt|luffe12:  strong values and lack of space: I like 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south: "yes, because I have the honors it looks like"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east:"oh thats nice"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right since 2@S would be non-force the only other choice was  DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW open 12-14 bal 1NT so the rebid shows the strong NT|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@h apparently shows 4@s too|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: it was not alerted...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe they dont want to investigate the fit after the double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW actually list this treatment on their convention card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all CCs zipped up and available under  http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/2343|pg||
nt|anton72: i feel in double dummy have a way for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|anton72: not 100 % sure|pg||
nt|anton72: what you think david|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  15-17 nt|pg||
pc|d5|nt|400 volt: auch dieses Vollspiel ist relativ normal - bei dem Trumpfstand in @S ist aber das Vollspiel in 3SA deutlich besser|pg||
nt|400 volt: Thomas Gotard jun. denkt auch darüber nach, ob er 3SA oder 4@S reizen soll|pg||
nt|glen: a typical hand that shows why partnership have a variety of raises for S hand, to help N make decisions if bidding gets high fast|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this 4@H C will only be a push i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c is 20-21 or any gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder's pass asks for a spade lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: theoretically it can be even 4@H-1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt is easier here than 4@H|pg||
nt|kingcur: N may have shown an unbalanced hand with 1S...then S should maybe convert to 2@C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|luffe12:  is the X for penalty here - dont think so|pg||
nt|luffe12:  is disagree in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is "make the right decision pard" kind of X |pg||
nt|glen: some play X is penalty, some X is two-way values, some X as I want to bid 5@H but you decide|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1NT 15-17 and will accept the invitation|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: easy 3NT here, time to get some drinks :-)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: It is likely that north's double is technically correct, but as he knows pard has 3 hearts why worry, just bid 2 hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: mixup|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult to for the defence to get this right vs 4 spades|pg||
pc|c5|nt|400 volt: das war die richtige Wahl|pg||
nt|stc: you need A@c on side and if not @d finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south has shown 14-16 with 1642 or 0643 shape|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s still some chance ..but others -with best defence hopeless --like this |pg||
nt|dimi: no X no trouble|pg||
nt|stc: something looks wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they do play 1@C-2@H 4-7hcp|pg||
nt|stc: Obviously w doesn't know about 4@s in E|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west took 2@H as 8-10 then|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, that's pretty obvious now|pg||
nt|dimi: yes that seems to be the explanation|pg||
pc|c8|nt|golfsquash: This is very thin|pg||
nt|golfsquash: west playing east for a better hand for change of suit after double|pg||
nt|sastro: das Single Karo ist fotographiert- da bietet sich 3 SA schon an|pg||
nt|sastro: 6 C ist ein ordentlicher Kontrakt, wird aber vorrausichtlich fallen, weil die Odds für Karoschnitt sprechen|pg||
nt|glen: best for N is to X first, then find out result, the claim X was a certain type of X|pg||
nt|luffe12:  5 looser hand by distribution - bid one more time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: that's a good tip glen, i'll keep it in mind :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i assume that NS use some kind of constructive major raises|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very tough to bid|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s was not good, 3NT is a disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks at the dummy and is kind of shoked, he obviously expected more :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "pfff"|pg||
nt|sommer: here 2N could have been at minimum just as good as 2@H|pg||
nt|sommer: but S was a little too weak to move 2@H to 2N ..I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  idk denmark needs to get something going soon(at this table):)|pg||
nt|sommer: as expected, b5 and 6 cost 27 imps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wilkinsona: yes the diamond 10 at trcick one gets declarer 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: ..sry, 4 and 5|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 9 cold|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i hate to caught with only 3-card support, when supposed to have 4 - but the N hand is just 6 loosers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually, i think 3@S would show 5+@S and @H fit, but agree key feature is short @D rather than long @S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  anybody familiar with Ron Klingers ideas on the rules of Loosers Count|pg||
nt|stc: trump looks best now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cc469: yes, he must ensure he is left with an entry in dummy to @Ds when that suit is established|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch hat 4-7 mit @h fit gezeigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@d should be the end signal to sign off|pg||

nt|friggi: good lead for decl|pg||
pc|d4|nt|luffe12:  bergen raises would lead to 5@h i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: best you make sure you know what you are playing over interference|pg||
nt|luffe12:  S would bid 3@c rather than 2@h - promising 4card support|pg||
nt|glen: its a question whether to use a bergen raise on not: 4 trumps good, but quacks (queens/jacks) not good for playing the hand in a suit contract|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i fully support that - |pg||
nt|sybarra: it is only an 8 count of quacks, 3 @H was also a possibility  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play standard signals|pg||
nt|frankaus: not clear but gr8 switch|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir glaubt sogar 6-7 ... 4@h hätte minimum gezeigt|pg||
nt|runnerup:  7 in nt -or slipping defence|pg||
nt|luffe12:  RON KLINGER: GUIDE TO BETTER BRIDGE awesome|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|400 volt: In Board 4 hat Martin Rehder 4@H sehr gut gespielt - 9 verdiente IMPs|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead of a small club would probably beat 6@H but it's not easy to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: anyway or bid and made 6@h so von alvensleben team will reassert the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  noreal chance here |pg||
nt|kingcur: I am just informed that my co-commentator's mother is a woman I played bridge with in Sopot, Poland in the mid 80's. That's kind of cute, isn't it, andreas? :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sastro: schwierige Entscheidung, was man am Tisch auf die nächsten Karorunden abwerfen soll|pg||
nt|stc: not very convincing sequence, missing a good slam and 12 IMP|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but knowing prd to have xxxx might change the N approach|pg||
nt|stc: A pair in control of the system may stretch to 3@s and play there|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|stc: wd, 4@s was a good save|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south has a really nice 14-16 one must say|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, but if wests 2H shows a good raise, N should not be defending here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south unaware of the split tries a trump|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stc: and here you can't score the 150 for 4 Aces|pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room found the reasonable 6@c on board 19, but didn't find a line to make it with the bad @c bread.  13 imps.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (break)|pg||
nt|stc: here the defense may make 3NT but for only 500|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: that way pard knows I have 4 @H's  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|anton72: 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the deadly lead which W asked for by passing 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is good position for the trailing team|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't know what S was trying to convey with his 2nd double, but it does look like N took it wrongly|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sastro: besser wäre ein schnelles Ducken|pg||
nt|anton72: Vasilev play verry carefuly |pg||
nt|anton72: and that is not bad when u play team |pg||
nt|dburn: I think I'd settle for nine tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: in the other room, a trump was led against 6@H|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so 6NT came in on  20|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after orth chose to open 1@d, schüller was undissuadable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't imagine other table finding the 4@S save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also   too tired to figure out how bad 4@SX really scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: toilet break for west, its his 3rd during the match already|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i mean this segment...|pg||
nt|stc: 200 I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he have an escort?|pg||
nt|stc: they can ruff @d or open @c, both for 4 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: a @D would have set 2@H.. now N seems to make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: if defense nothing wrong they can collect in each suit 1 trick|pg||
nt|stc: but 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|anton72: already 10|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|golfsquash: at Pairs, he might have tried a second spade|pg||
nt|dimi: good contract bad distribution, no justice in the world|pg||
nt|anton72: again :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C makes, so a huge swing for the Dutch|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|dburn: but if my opponents pitched the jack of clubs, I would not tell them to pick it up and try something else - I'd settle for ten tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|cc469: I don't think he should have ducked first @S because @HK continuation could have proved embarrassing ...|pg||
nt|golfsquash: no strip squeeze this time|pg||
nt|xenya: 11|pg||
nt|frankaus: now gets out 4 -1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :) i think it is more amazing that she remembers something so long ago lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south I am sure didn't think his partner had 5 hearts, and while he may have reckond on 4 spades though there was a safe way to make sure...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzzx: east angry he did not play club to the 7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in this case even to make your opponents tierd doen't help -so |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but north could have inserted the 9 to prevent this|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: lol|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jako to ob³o¿¹, ¿eby tylko nasi nie doszli do 5 karo na drugim stole|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Hmmm, "bread"... My inner self must be telling me it's time for breakfast.|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps one more @c trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: both players tried to play low dia spots to show partner values in clubs. N intentionaly blocked the suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know n-s's leading methods, but it seems that the 1 card you can't hold to lead the @c9 is the @c10.|pg||

nt|jaapfr: what a freak here|pg||
nt|luffe12:  looking at running rate = 6 imps it does'nt matter too much, but why did E disc a @c|pg||
nt|dimi: ... he punished his partner|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like a "tilt" play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lost concentration|pg||
nt|stc: not good for the parftnership :(|pg||
nt|dimi: no|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 600 was really expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: wanted to correct him self but it was clear change of mind, he thougt dummys discard is irrelevant, after a short break while Fritsche was claiming he saw what he missed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@h the game to be in here|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@H looking like a good spot here, 3NT less so on a @C lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW discussing whether West should have bid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w 15 grulica WJ-ta - odwrotka wpêdzi³a w  szlemika|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: settles for a safe 10 playing on hearts|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: now we will see some action :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well south has a good hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: and some conplicated contracts, seems all suits are breaking porely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but 6 spades likely it seems|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 6@S or NT should easy to reach with 35 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Not a word from Brandsnes or the Norwegian coach|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Vasilev deserved some credit for that @c9 at the first trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  Likely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|friggi: sure|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1@c 12-14 nt or 18-19 or @c|pg||
nt|sommer: saw that now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt=11-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rather maximum for that i think :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  6@s is laydown|pg||
nt|stc: Par is 4@dX -1 by EW|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 Cl again|pg||
nt|anton72: 16 +|pg||
nt|friggi: so he upgraded that hand:)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  N doubled 2 h - would he do that with 4 missing AK?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I am sure our excellent viewgraph may give us details|pg||
mb|1C|nt|luffe12:  110!|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: last board for the Open room|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would play Sys on and double here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can't give any details on why they defended 3@c instead of bidding their own game, i'm afraid :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stc: of course if you play slam on the same defense, the @d finesse is much better than the sqz, and you go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in fact the first imps for von alvensleben this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminded it was a full book   Ron Klinger "The Modern Losing Trick Count" Modern Bridge Series|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2 over 1 GF|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: still counting points :D|pg||
nt|gsper:  Primitive but easy to remember|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is just insane|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sastro: 4er-C Unterstützung und double Treff können einen schon etwas optimistisch stimmen|pg||
nt|xenya: EW play an 11-13 1N -- hence 1@C|pg||
mb|3S|an|weak|nt|vugraphzzx: i think you all know what 2@c is by now ;)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@C asks if 11-13 really has 14?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so 6@h is more friendly for the specs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = inverted, one round forcing raise, not 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  seems well judged by S: I will have a second chance, to show strong playing values|pg||
nt|stc: very interesting this one !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no, no escort, but he was quite fast and at least we are ahead of the other room, so those boards are not available anywhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this match seems to have theme of finding 5-3 fit that has 5-0 break|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: szlemik nie byl taki zly kiery po 2 - 2 lub trafiony A kier singlowy |pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: lub J / 10 |pg||
nt|friggi: not good|pg||
nt|xenya: now 1N|pg||
mb|d|nt|tomi2: spade finesse not working, hearts are not coming in. 6n seems like the best spot, if you see you cant hold spades to 1 loser, you try the other suits|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sys on or @H?|pg||
nt|friggi: why not @S bid in N|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  When X might be slightly weeaker, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|xenya: a raise by N now would be weak, but perhaps not as weak as this|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just a quick key card check|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@S shows min, can be still 5|pg||
nt|tomi2: this won't be quick, he needs to find a fit first|pg||
nt|xenya: E had a choice between introducing @Ss and showing fit -- he opted for the latter |pg||
nt|andreasw:  7@s looks good but will problably go down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: norths double gives south a problem|pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 4@C i presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some pairs play DBL as GF now, so that it is easier to find out about slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but here South wants to bid NF|pg||
mb|4D|nt|400 volt: das 2@D-Gebot zeigt Fit in @H - entweder mit einer schwachen Hand oder Partieforcierend|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure they can get to 6 @S now |pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h shows either @c as 2nd suit or a 3352|pg||
nt|andreasw:  because of the @d split:)|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@S is very good|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i'm quite surprised that south did not bid 3@c over 2@c here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  you must admit.. it is easy to get to high|pg||
nt|sommer: ..4@D splinter and no aces?|pg||
nt|sommer: will lead to 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: W's jump to 3NT was reckless in my view - E might have minimum values and simply trying to protect the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: den kontrakt aus dem open room werden wir hier wohl nicht nochmal sehen|pg||
nt|sastro: so wie die Hand steht sind 3 SA das optimale. Aber wie soll man mit den unausgeglichenen Händen dort landen. Katastrophen sind hier vorprogrammiert|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h still makeable but now ???|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: 2@d slabe ze wzgledu na QJx @h 1!p imo zdecydowanie lepsze i ewnetulana x na wznowce |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w 16 znowu odwrotka w akcji|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: 1@s*|pg||
nt|anton72: 3 NT is logical choice|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure does, but maybe a pass now...|pg||
mb|5D|nt|cc469: 2NT I could find a case for but not 3|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diesem Fall die starke Variante - jetzt muss Nord @D-Ausspiel finden. Da Süd 2@D (künstlich) nicht kontriert hat, spricht das für ihn vielleicht gegen @D-ausspiel|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the @d7 presumably shows an odd length... and as we know both 1 and 3 are odd...|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 1Nt beatable|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: what now? 4NT would be quantitative only I guess|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south can bid 4 clubs ok|pg||
nt|tomi2: mabw 5nt pick-a-slam?|pg||
nt|dburn: trusting East not to have psyched, or maybe unable to bid spades naturally anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: although 2@s ought to be natural over 2@d|pg||
nt|dburn: just in case East is one of the ungodly|pg||
nt|anton72: i think 2 sp over 2 di is not natural|pg||
nt|xenya: i think S is likely to lead a @D, not a @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: They are playing strong NT|pg||
nt|luffe12:  wd all|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@C= any invit, does not promise clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west did not expect this beeing passed out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east forgot the system|pg||
nt|dimi: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the thought 2@C was pass/correct|pg||
nt|baldfriede: These are probably the seeds of mistrust from previous hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: playing 80 boards yesterday was hard, the night was short|pg||
nt|anton72: in their agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: as spec notices on same defense you should finesse the 10@c to make, yes|pg||
nt|stc: after a small @c lead would be different|pg||
nt|glen: W has tried his hardest to stay out of slam (opening 11-13 1NT with 14, not accepting slam try 4@D)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  top spot|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both sides|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT by W goes down on a @h lead but played by E has much better chances |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: all players discussing, south "lets play, it will not be down 6 times now, i am pretty sure"|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, nice bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good call|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: might be also a grand slamr try id N has a very good hand such as @S AKJxx and @D A|pg||
nt|xenya: N didn't support hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: still a good lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|400 volt: jetzt wird Rohowsky keine Probleme mit dem Kontrakt mehr bekommen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N gets a chance to trump a @H in dummy he has a chance to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs W to play trump when in with @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you've watched NS play before   you KNEW Piek would bid 3@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: *3532|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if east bids 6 now i would raise for sure on W hand (if 4@s is weak which defently looks like an underbid to me):)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5@d cuebid or?|pg||
nt|sommer: it's a good idea to play 4@S weak and 0 aces (keycards)..then even this weak hand COULD splinter 4@D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well no stopping this time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzzx: looks like they are going overboard here thanks to north opening his 8-count|pg||
nt|stc: loosing control|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: of course, north in the open room had it much easier after west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but i'm sure günther in his wildest dreams would not have thought of opening 1@h :)|pg||
nt|stc: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 2nd/4th   that means  from worthless doubleton lead LOW|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: teraz to juz szlemika powinni zagrac :) ale 4!t Andrzeja bardzo celne |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zgadzam siê z Tob¹ Kuba, ale teraz chyba ³atwie dolicytowaæ szlemika bêdzie|pg||
pc|s8|nt|golfsquash: and 2@s beatable but difficult|pg||
nt|glen: finally forced to admit holds @H Q|pg||
nt|dimi: anyway 2@c seems to be a good contract, while 3NT is not a make i think|pg||
nt|sommer: not surprincingly, E WANTS a slam:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this might lead to 7|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|stc: you can make 4@h played on @s but not on @d|pg||
nt|tomi2: i think this is the convention, that made me score / avoid lose most imps at all. if i was allowed to play only one convention, i would kick blackwood and stayman and keep 5nt=pick ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: a slam :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it should be - if 2@d is forcing to game, no need for 2@s to be artificial over it|pg||
nt|gsper:  If 1@H was an ordinary oercall, |pg||
nt|gsper:  Many would pass|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kingcur: it looks very much like Tim Verbeek having learned all the relays by heart: as I said earlier, E is not Berend vd Bos' regular partner|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: anyway, well bid by NS, do we have the bidding from the other table?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..so after ....2@S - 3@S, you promise 1+ keycard!|pg||
nt|sommer: I dont think, E can expect to get rid of all W's @Hlosers...so 6@S..pls:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east should just lay himself in 6@s because of the Ax in @h yes:)|pg||
nt|sommer: p signed off twice...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ryskiel_: eeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Igor nie doceni³ cue bidu kier partnera|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: chyba mu sie A schowal ...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|golfsquash: not beating it now|pg||
nt|stc: 1@h, 1@d, 1@c to loose|pg||
nt|kingcur: but despite the relaying, not landing at the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in a more natural system do you bid 1@s or 2@d on pds 1@h bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Tim Verbeek plays the same relay with his regular partner Danny Molenaar|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results: www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e trema - w koñcu to ich debiut w takiej rangi imprezie|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no running scores|pg||
nt|anton72: 2 Di is GF|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 4@H looks quite reasonable -- but not easy to play on this layout|pg||
nt|stc: I think you can try @s first, then @d if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@H, i fear is doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|glen: and after all of W's efforts to stay out of slam, E bids the grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes the ace of trumps is useful|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i suspect gro meant 4nt as exclusion keycard, rehder misunderstood|pg||
nt|dburn: and although there are fewer people around than there used to be who played a non-vul 1@s overcall of a strong club to show 13 cards, the breed has not entirely died out|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Siderov shaking his head|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: and talking why i didnt passed 3 NT ? :)|pg||
nt|anton72: with 3-2 trumps 5 diamonds have some play|pg||
nt|anton72: with expectable spade lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  and now claim :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i get this hands like one every 900 boards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sign-off to 5@d is a lack of @c-cue|pg||
nt|sommer: it's a rare hand for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: sign-off to 5@s i mean|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and south has his work cut out here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stc: No, just finesse twice in @s|pg||
nt|stc: for 5@h+4@s+2@d = 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: declarer's shape is known exactly from the bidding, so the defense will hardly go wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: why, yes, of course:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder thinking, not schüller|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: meanwhile the imps start to roll in for the jamm team, 6 on  35|pg||
nt|jaapfr: about what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i don't know should i ask him? ;)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HTQ already played?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now schüller is thinking...|pg||
nt|stc: now even 2¨ds|pg||
nt|stc: 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl: "thats probably good news" after n showed out|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well after the 5@d bid followed by 5!n 6@d could be @d Q or?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|glen: i think you are correct Michael, about 4NT as exclusion|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. was out of pass cards so had to use a double instead|pg||
nt|glen: for some expect partnerships, splinter then 4NT is exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  exclusion is tell me your aces outside of @D |pg||
nt|glen: *for some expert|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cc469: I'm referring of course to the previous hand|pg||
nt|stc: It is an interesting question : where the line between fairplay and "team interest" ?|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't think he can manage this with the cards as they are|pg||
nt|anton72: 10 from dummy ...3 trumps ...and 3 rounds of spades discarding 3 hearts|pg||
nt|anton72: but trump is 4-1 |pg||
nt|anton72: yes ...only with 3-2 trumps |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could make it if the heart ace were onside also - it isn't the worst contract in the world|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3NT would certainly have been a better one|pg||
nt|dburn: and Siderov probably should have passed it, although you can see why he thought Vasilev might have a club fit|pg||
nt|anton72: yes ...trumps lay bad ...and A he is offside ...3nt is easy 9+ tricks ...depending on lead|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a fairly extreme example of the notion that you can't go down if you don't play a card|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: but u also wouldnt make it |pg||
nt|dburn: I can't see a way - maybe GIB can|pg||
nt|anton72: m no|pg||
nt|anton72: i checked already |pg||
nt|anton72: just kiding david|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|stc: he will make, when seeing the @d, will be force to play on @s finesse|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has the @c6 prepared...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better not think too long then:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the thinking suggests he has @CKJ6 imo|pg||
nt|stc: this may be the match ball|pg||
nt|bobholl: when east comes in with @C K difficult guess|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will N play the Q?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if small even down 2 looming|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: fairplay would say -4, strict rules -6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no they are discussing this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: -6 was clear for all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the heart has intentionally been played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S certainly tried to keep the kettle boiling for some psychological advantage with his remark|pg||
nt|dimi: well this really a tight match ... difficult situation for "fairplay" whatever this is in such a case|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: or at least something very similar|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kingcur: I'd bid 1@S, since 2@D invites pd to go over 3N with a fitting hand; and you're not strong enough to show @S in a reverse bid with this hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S-2@H-2@S-3@C-3@D-3@S-4@S-5@S-6@D-6@S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|luffe12:  ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sry, miscl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Piek 3@C bid certainly made things difficult for East|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|stc: defense doing the job for him|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead helped a lot. Did E know S had the @S suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Rohowsky simply wanted not to spend to much time discussing about east-west system in a 2@C contract|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: nothing was known about s hand, only relayed|pg||
nt|friggi: why not ruff @C first just incase|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzzx: west forcing declarer to guess whether to play on spades 3-3 or on diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E rescues N:(|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: now -2 |pg||
nt|adonis18:  why double 3 nt when you don't know what to do with 4 @d?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: @H return can never win something imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gromöller says he expected @dJ from @dJ73|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would it make a diffrent if you had 15 insted?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzzx: yes i was right about the misunderstanding|pg||
nt|glen: -2 good, E goes "hey, slam wasn't making either"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 5@c showed 1 or 4 keycards and gro thought it was exclusion so must be @hA|pg||
nt|sommer: now just discard @H on @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: not only difficult but important too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|stc: assume a @c defense, dec will pull trumps, finesse once in @s, play @d and go back to @s...I think you are forced to find the right solution|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: declarer claimed:|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "I pull trump and discard on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: this time its the fairplay case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he claimed before dia was lead|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzzx: NS let the claim through|pg||
nt|dimi: poor EW they have to recover and forget about the last boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west was cut of his spade winner and if he really pulled the trump he would be in dummy then|pg||

nt|stc: wow, why comenting I missed the play...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator job much harder than being player, nicht wahr??|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  38  [4@S-2]  Rohowsky playing 3N West!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: heavy 1@h-opening at the other table|pg||
nt|kingcur: not likely, andreas...I play reverses in answering hand a rock solid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakie +1 to nie umia³ wziac 13?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: claimed 1 trick for EW|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: there was another bid between 6@D and 6@S, guess which :)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  the double of 3 nt cost 8 imp!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: vdBos not happy that vLankveld didn't cash the @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but declarer had no entry as the @d were blocked|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: some discussion what would happen with @h lead on bd 8|pg||
nt|xenya: the only lead to beat it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defending 4 spades not so easy either though|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: back to bidding, I wonder if transfer then bid of @H's would have worked better |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 1 Imp to Ireland, as 1NT survived in the other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzzx: @s2 lead showed odd with honor or even without honor|pg||
nt|stc: 8 dangerous boards for them|pg||
nt|xenya: multi 2@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|400 volt: hier zeigt 2@H auch wieder eine @S-Hebung, 4-8 Punkte in diesem Fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ns play 5-card majors, btw|pg||
nt|jaapfr: does he get away with that excuse:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: for gromöller-rehder 1@h would be systematic on the s cards|pg||
nt|runnerup:  8 tricks in nt but not so easy to stop below game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C shows biggest difference between NS Baltic Club and Polish Club|pg||
nt|stc: in other sports they will take a timeout|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Online players would, of course, both make and accept that claim.)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in the 6NT board Felmy - Khanukov had some strange auction leading to the 4-2 fit in spades and an overtrick..|pg||
nt|stc: many online players reject very obvious claims !!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!n on N hand will go down but on souths it could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyf: EW had a free run to the comfortable 2@s in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|golfsquash: I'm told that north and west are regular partners!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they find 4@S?|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6 more imps to NL Red, with 4@S receiving a double and making +1 in other room on  6|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h forcing, but not yet GF|pg||
nt|sommer: still makeable after just 1 round @S..then @DAK and ruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no running scores, standings on http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ + competitie + White House Juniors|pg||
mb|2C|nt|golfsquash: with spades breaking, this will cruise home|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so indeed it could be either @s32 or @sQ32|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: h+minor|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4@S sind in dieser Hand erfüllbar, ob man sie aber reizen sollte, ist fraglich|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@H zeigt vermutlich fit und 2@S könnte dann ein Versuchsgebot sein|pg||
nt|400 volt: ohne Fit spielen viele, dass nach Kontra das 2@H nicht mehr erzwungen wird|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Polish Club uses Precision 2@C opener with 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/1S|pg||
nt|stc: you mean !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget 6 -- get to 4@S first :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: they might get too high after 2@H GF|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: on the other hand, 4@H can be made after other than @D lead|pg||
mb|2D|nt|400 volt: wenn thomas jetzt aufkontriert, könnte das teuer werden|pg||
nt|santyclz: And then they wonder why no one wants them at their table...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: a heavy 1NT, so might have bid a spade on the way|pg||
nt|stc: but would W  return @s if starting with KQxx ?|pg||
nt|stc: fortunately the choosed the good 4-2 suit, @s and not @h|pg||
nt|anton72: dbl is 3 card supp |pg||
nt|anton72: and good decison by Vassilev to pass of 3 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@s more interesting|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so a nice a weak 2@d  did a good job here|pg||
nt|gsper:  On this lead 9 tricks are fairly easy, but I don't see a tenth|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: what would 4@d by West have been instead of 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can they reach 4@h if E has 3/4 @hs?|pg||
nt|friggi: sure|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  agood raise to 4@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@h is Natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  sry - was interrupted by a Bridgemate Control problem..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 33 minutes left|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@D wd probably be nf for EW after 1@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks available on this lead -- but perhaps he will play it safely...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: I wonder why 1NT and not 2NT with 11 points ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely not really...|pg||
nt|sommer: with @Clead from W vs 3N, E may shift to @S8 after @CQ...|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is not all that silly here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: i think one of the most valuable quality of a top bridge player is to forget about every bad board at once after it was played|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Declarer has to ruff 3rd spade, cross to the @DA and play @SJ discarding anothe @D looser. |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@d makes, so passing out 2@s seems a bit passive|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: good question|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so I missed all the entertainement|pg||
nt|anton72: Siderov may be is a bit scared after 5 diamonds |pg||
nt|xenya: like this...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  3@D Stayman really helps|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s is not bad and makes, both options, @s/@d finesse are good|pg||
pc|h7|nt|stc: and risking to offer a fast @c discard ?|pg||
nt|stc: this is one of the points where professional players are much better then non-profi experts|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van den Bos when he put down his dummy: 'I hope I don't have too much :)'|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: but still one more looser to go, sorry 4 trick to EW|pg||
nt|xenya: but not easy to reach, and 3N is, of course, quite normal|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cc469: I think I would have not bid @Ss with 4333 shape and 4 weak @Ss|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But u have to have a better and longer suit for that|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|400 volt: am anderen Tisch wurde west in 2@D kontriert.Udo Kasimir muss sich anstrengen, um den Verlust auf 2 IMPs zu beschränken|pg||
nt|stc: a desperate 7@d ?|pg||
nt|stc: the only grand you can make is 7@s BY NORTH !|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be disappointed if they reached 7 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @HQ is wasted value|pg||
nt|gsper:  There is a case for bidding 2@H as W, but it is rather hair-raising|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still it is to late now if N takesK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: declarer shows 2 suits lead trump is a fine method|pg||
nt|kingcur: a bit unlucky for EW in the other room to be stuck in 1@H: especially with opps NV, a hand with a short suit almost assures competitive bidding, after which you could show your ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: strength in rebound...not this time though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sastro: Denke mal , dass 2 Pik den 4-4 Fit vorschlägt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben is out of pass cards|pg||
nt|stc: and of course 7NT|pg||
nt|stc: still loking for 7 on the Q@s ?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|stc: if you are in 7@s lightner Xed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: forgetting a bad board is easier said than done|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e-w are pure amateur players. n-s are at least experienced players in the international bridge scene|pg||
pc|s3|nt|400 volt: ich bin verwundert, dass Nord mit XX nicht gute @D gezeigt hat (falls verfügbar)|pg||
nt|400 volt: Süd hätte wohl nicht gepasst mit seiner Hand, aber 2@D ist tatsächlich erfüllbar von N/S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: an elaborate system like theirs should stop them from getting to a grand like this|pg||
nt|stc: looks like the first natural bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a @d back frmo the K now should beat this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|stc: indeed, fair enough|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe using normal responses to RKC after showing 0-4 hcp  is silly|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  no their style is good hands in that position bye W|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  by W"|pg||
nt|sommer: ..my remarc was to Andreas' suggestion about "best in S":)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: can take a @h ruff and have 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed 8 tricks for 1 imp|pg||
nt|bobholl: the weak NT could have cost a lot on a @D lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldfriede: especially when opps rub it in, like Rohowsky did|pg||
nt|stc: he has to finesse here|pg||
nt|dimi: some kibs told me that they even forget about a bad board during playing it ... well :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Smirnov are the only two German (male) players who regullary play professional. Auken- von Arnim are the other professional pair we have|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4th toilet break for Matthias|pg||
pc|h8|nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze werden sich wundern, warum Thomas Gotard seine Hand mit 12 Punkten nicht eröffnet hat. Das liegt an der sehr ausgeglichenen Verteilung und den wenigen Mittelkarten, ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: sodass sie für ihn nicht 12 Punkte wert war|pg||
pc|hK|nt|stc: so 6@d for -3 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north has shown 14-16, 2452 shape, two keycards and no @dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 38   3N made   i would have bet that both rooms would play 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT made in OR and now 32 with 10 results tom compare and a potential swing for the leading team(5@H-1)|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW picked their 4-4 @S fit here, the only denomination to have a chance at 10 tricks for game|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again north might get the chance to play a @d back again:)|pg||
nt|xenya: just making |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS use 2@C to show weak hand with 5+@H and 5+ other suit    [except in ACBL events]|pg||
nt|luffe12:  do u agree on pass by W? Never in a lifetime|pg||
nt|stc: JAMM can start packing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please stay in your seats until match comes to complete stop|pg||
nt|stc: one line of play : AK@s, run @c, finess @ds|pg||
nt|sommer: ..it looks fine i N too:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|anton72: norwegians in other room skip some A ...play 7 @h|pg||
nt|anton72: in board 6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzzx: will try a showup squeeze i suspect|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, there's still a chance to go right|pg||
nt|kingcur: but not at all easy for S|pg||
nt|chmitty: would still make 10 tricks if he decides @s 4-1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzzx: now they were playing way too fast for my computer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer, with discards to find trys the spade hook|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: did he really play that way?|pg||
nt|stc: +2 looks a bit too much|pg||
nt|xenya: i guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they played the board in 30 secs, i cant only click like one time in 3sec because of the connection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good bidding from Khanukov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is best line    without looking at NS hands|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|stc: Yes, the doctors had very, very good results for non profis|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|stc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Wagner claimed he will score all tricks expect of one but he thought this would lead to just made, he miscounted tricks|pg||
nt|stc: As far as I know von Arnim is not a full time profi (school teacher ?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems  play for @S 32   and something good in @C or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2nd trump then @C|pg||
pc|sK|mc|8|nt|kingcur: now @C in N...he can see the @D switch|pg||
nt|frankaus: neded N win @C and push @D|pg||
nt|kingcur: last chance now|pg||
nt|frankaus: too late i think|pg||
nt|kingcur: a warm welcome to Pierre Schmidt as well|pg||

nt|kingcur: the conclusions he draws from that quality may have, Thomas :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|iceking: about open flattish 11count  is matter of style and how your system works|pg||
nt|kingcur: but to support Thomas' argument: we have seen very controlled and fine bidding here by juniors|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C  is 15+ but I think it shows 2+@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: like if you are playing 15-17nt openings its rather big gap top open bad 11counts if you your nt opening is 14-16 most players open all 11counts|pg||
mb|d|nt|tomi2: their 1NT would have been 12-14, even vulnerable, so that 11 point hand would have to be openend 1NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|iceking: but then you look at 4-4 in the majors with 2 aces and you should probably take agressive view and open|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: yes so makes sense N passed his system really didnt led him open|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: 1NT will not always help you to get into a major fit - at least not in the partscore range. if they belong to game his partner will probably open himself|pg||
nt|iceking: agree i would not open that north hand 1nt 12-14 so N had to pass |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kingcur: incidentally: would everyone dbl in pass out seat with this S hand? N can hardly have a trap pass and you're potentially dbl'ing opps into a better contract?|pg||
nt|iceking: W took a rather odd view in the bidding here, would be more normal to rdbl 1@D or pass and dbl @H next turn|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|iceking: its close what S should do here dbl or pass |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceking: pass is probably the book bid, but he does have 16hcp outside @D so i dont mind take some action|pg||
pc|hK|pc|cT|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: wests carding strongly indicated he wanted club back, he won the tricks with the lowest possible honors and exited with his smalledst card|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|hT|pc|s2|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|tomi2: north could now exit in hearts and hope east has only spades left including the queen. other chance is spade to the king|pg||
