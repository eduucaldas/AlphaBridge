nt|vugraphzzx: west is playing 3NF|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players decided to take 15 minutes more break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final 16 boards of the trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: netherlands red is the team with the world champions from the youth congress|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Helmich-Hop and van Lankveld - van den Bos|pg||
nt|andreasw:  http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/program.html The program for this tourny:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: old junior Tim Verbeek is replacing van Lankveld today|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: hello everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, hello everyone|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|tomi2: first question, Milan you probably know more - isnt Michal Kopecky too old for juniors? you cant be juniors all of your life! :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I am here to help you understand the bidding of the Czech pair, both players are my regular partners|pg||
nt|tomi2: I remeber I played against Michal and you back in 2006 and unfortunatly I bacame older since that :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, he turned 26 this year. He is more a playing coach of the rest of the team |pg||
nt|anton72: hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: welcome from a sunny Amsterdam :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Good starting hand :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be an easy slam to reach and an easy sacrefise in 7@c/@d|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|stc: Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: from today on the teams play another 12 rounds Swiss|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 boards per match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NL Red currently leading the Swiss with 105 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Israel is 4th with 98 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: after the Swiss the 4 top teams play semi-finals on thursday|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzzx: hello|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that does give you access to Open Room Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|stc: one big swing difference, the match is open|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the TD stopped punishing such behaviour after both teams agreed. so there are no more time penalties in the final|pg||
mb|4H|nt|400 volt: Guten Abend allerseits|pg||
nt|400 volt: Beide Paare spielen einen schwachen SA in der Eröffnung|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi this time sesson it is not sensible to guess final contracts -so colorful they where last session |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: TD gave them 10 minutes extra and decided that both pairs were responsible for the last delay so assigned NO penalties|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!N here or 4@h? 4@h ofcourse best but 3!N with 5-3-3-2 over 4-3-3-3 is quite common|pg||
mb|5D|nt|400 volt: Das Ost-West-System ist relativ natürlich gehalten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: an agressive 3@c opener here again|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Dutch style :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|400 volt: Good evening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: das n/s system hingegen bringt über 200 seiten auf die waage :)|pg||
nt|danmac: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult break in spades in this first hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if 4@h can be a form of weak bid pass from tofte might be dangerous and chooses to bid 5@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: A@s hilft|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: This is the semifinal of the German Open Team Trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky asks about 3@c, gotard makes some kind of "it's natural" shrugging motion |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, sorry for the confusion just now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS a polish pair, but they do NOT play Polish Club|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS playing weak NT 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Piekarek's DBL = 3@S|pg||
nt|anton72: we will be happy if operator giving us some info about artifical bids|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all and welcome|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW plays a different 2 Nt module|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: interesting to see if he can make|pg||
pc|s9|nt|400 volt: Ja, da sind einige ungewöhnliche Sachen drin|pg||
nt|stc: reicht aber nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: der kontrakt geht nur, wenn west im ersten karo stich mit dem as steigt|pg||
nt|stc: auch nicht, A@D und @H, hat immer noch ein @c zu verlieren|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads  2nd/4th|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: netherlands white is a team with some new Dutch junior players|pg||
nt|kingcur: test|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@s extra and cuebid? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Cor Balfoort|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kingcur: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Frank Budai|pg||
nt|kingcur: from a very sunny and spring-y Holland|pg||
nt|anton72: i am not fully familiar with systems ...just Roland invite me few minutes ago :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: I will if I know|pg||
nt|anton72: thank you ...sure :)|pg||
nt|anton72: N avoid the standart lead in clubs ...|pg||
mc|12|nt|400 volt: Yet, the results were as expected: All teams in the semifinals were expected to get to the semifinals|pg||
nt|400 volt: But there is a very clear favourite - the team "Jamm & Co"|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5@h should not be a good result for e-w .. although 7@c/@d is only -500 so might not be that bad:)|pg||
pg||

nt|stc: but before it have been worked, ending with say 2 @c in dummy and Q10@s in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov was thinking about playing east for one spade more and one @D less|pg||
nt|andreasw:  http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: the official tournament site is www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our other four matches today will be England-Poland, Israel-Czech Republic, Norway-Bugaria and Sweden-Finland|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we all open E hand  I vote yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think results will be on www.bridge.nl|pg||
nt|kingcur: as always well maintained by Rosaline Barendregt and a few others|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 11H |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played for the first hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: well played by Kopecky, may be too fast for some of us :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you must connect both rooms, operator|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 11 tricks  in an easy contract to start with|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@s n-s here?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north claims that he bid as if there had been no 1nt and after 1@C-2@D = hearts 2nt they have a system. south bid system off (=natural)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to endplay n on that line.|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 1@H|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening transfer preempts on 2nd level, too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: certainly a high standard of card play there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H = 8-11 with 6c. or 9-14 with 5@S+5m|pg||
mb|1H|nt|golfsquash: worth 3@s|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diese mBoard könnten Nord/Süd schnell mal zu hoch geraten|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that was a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: then he would need to play a heart from dummy forcing east to ruff|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning all|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s -1 by EW ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier to concede a @d early. 2 3 4 1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky is not very happy with this bid :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: first option is 8-11 with 6 clubs? or 6 cards?|pg||
mb|1S|an|5+!s|nt|400 volt: 4@C bei Nord/Süd und 3@S bei Ost/West ist das Limit|pg||
nt|stc: was für NT spielen sie ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 12-14 beide|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir spielt sogar 11-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@s promises 5, but 1@h only promises 4 in e/w system (swiss acol)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW used to play a modification of NS Baltic club but they found out it was too complicated, so they switched to some easier system at the beginning of the year|pg||
nt|frankaus: i value it a 15 count|pg||
nt|kingcur: agree: if you open light, it's important to have a good suit, and this @H suit qualifies for that|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sorry, 6@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will be more happy now :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS is saved, is there an option to get to 3NT by EW side?|pg||
nt|anton72: Curiosly is that i comentating match between country where i am born ...BUL ...and country where I live ..NOR |pg||
nt|anton72: splinter probably is 3 di|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 6 rounds of 10 boards today|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: yes probably -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ³adnie przepuci³ kiera Robertson, |pg||
nt|tomi2: ISR leading, CZE 2nd. the teams have been put in four grops of 6, playin a compleate round robin today and will go on in a swiss movement tomorrow and the day after|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just checking the website, i see these 2 teams are lying 4th and 1st|pg||
mb|2C|nt|400 volt: Yes, 3 NT can be made by N/S, but east/west will bid 4@S everytime|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat geschrieben "2@s gute hebung"... wundert mich etwas...|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D ist eigentlich relativ natürlich im System von Ost-West. Der einzige Grund für das Alertieren kann sein, dass West auch mit 5er @C und 4er @D 1@D häufig eröffnet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hab ich mir schon fast gedacht, dass er hier mit kontra in die reizung einsteigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: thats the problem with playing artifical methods - you need detailed agreements or some really good working meta-agreements in competition|pg||
nt|stc: I even think that with more free places in E the crossruff line was a bit better|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Good fireworks here|pg||
nt|stc: anyway good start for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Alex said in the end that he should have played the cross ruff. but that needed to start in trick 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: summary of Slawinsky leads in Supplementary Notes of Fantoni-Nunes Convention Card  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBra...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|stc: cards are friendly for NS, EW can't go plus|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now i doubt it:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt opening would be 11-13, so this rebid shows 14+|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players produced so many big swings that they all speed up playing for overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or book that introduced the method   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south passed and explained to west "I have a clear pass on 2@S but I was thinking because I was not sure if thats natural"|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Ja, 3SA können von Nord/Süd erfüllt werden, aber Ost/West gehen immer auf 4er-Stufe|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube nicht, dass 3SA von Ost irgendwelche Probleme bereitet. Sogar 5@D geht. Mal schauen, ob Ost/West sie erreichen|pg||
nt|sastro: mit 6-4 bevorzuge ich zuerst die Wiederholung der 6er-Länge|pg||
nt|stc: keine gute Idee von N|pg||
nt|stc: aber 2@h ist nicht soo schlecht|pg||
nt|dimi: @s K @h Q and 2 @c tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hard to guess the singleton king.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW are very slow players and are in danger of beeing to late every segment|pg||
nt|stc: NS must just cash their tricks before the 5th @d is played|pg||
nt|stc: in other words S must play @c when in hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: novay min 4 me |pg||
nt|frankaus: no way |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results are at www.nbbportal.nl/1003, then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|kingcur: but with two aces and a decent 2nd suit, this is not even a light opening|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|golfsquash: trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but nothing will bother it|pg||
nt|anton72: E hasnt he control ..so...we just in Game|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2 teams here are No 1 (Netherland) and No 3 after 5 rounds  (in 4 groups) now 12 x swiss|pg||
nt|andreasw:  anyone for keeping open with a dbl or a 2@h bid on norths hand?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|400 volt: Auch 5@C kann man schnell mal im Gegenspiel schenken, von daher ist 5@S sicherlich ein akzeptables Gebot|pg||
nt|400 volt: jetzt hat sich Udo Kasimir etwas zu hoch gewagt - die Hand steht aber auch schlecht für ihn|pg||
nt|400 volt: Der Gegner hat @S KB8x UND der @C-Schnitt sitzt nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben got a 10 imp penalty for slow play|pg||
nt|stc: better now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer may simply pull trumps from the top|pg||
nt|stc: not very likely but possible of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ducking that was risky, vuln south could hold 8 hearts and noting outside|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S now game try $ me|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems it is, now how to make it :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: can insert the king and unblock an honor in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: club lead might break the communication. Declarer has to play his suits from his hand which is not good for him in this board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be difficult to defeat...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to get entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry, i mean in 2nd club trick  finesse the 9|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: defence has to put Declarer once on the table with A of @H and another possible entry is @C8, but not easy to find it.|pg||
nt|tomi2: and later overtake the honor, in case michal forgot to insert the 9. south would do well to switch to a small dia when he wins a spade trick, that would denatly cut the ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: communication|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, declarer can play his @S from his hand, establishing 2@S tricks, 4@C, 1@H and 2 @D which makes a total of 9 = just made|pg||
nt|tomi2: cant NS open the hearts in time then, to score 2@S and 3@H?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: timing is important now|pg||
nt|tomi2: they seem to block because they need to finesse dummy's 10|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Another easy 3 nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results at www.nbbportal.nl/1003 Then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: other tournament info at www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|pelu: ok Israke and Bulgaria both 3/4|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2NT does not promise 4@h here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: N can have any invitational hand|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|400 volt: Nord hat nur 6 Figurenpunkte, aber mit einem sicheren 9-Karten-Fit und einer guten Verteilung ist das 3@S nicht völlig unverständlich|pg||
nt|runnerup:  time for 800?|pg||
nt|stc: 5 obvious losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what 1@S asked/showed   but it allowed North any easy bid  [versus something like immediate 3@C]|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: DBL seems ok to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with 5@d-2@h you dbl immediately over 1@s, so now dbl is this shape|pg||
pc|d2|nt|400 volt: hier kostet es 500 - aber gegen mögliche 400 beim Gegner kein allzu großer Verlust|pg||
nt|runnerup:  is south worth 3 @s -with 8 points and 7xxx in @s maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  other room stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: a decent save|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the club finesse is best therefore it seems..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|golfsquash: Good morning all|pg||
nt|stc: wieso hat W @d entdeckt ?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns never mensioned -the suit they make a slam (lucly ofcause ) @s|pg||
nt|stc: clap-clap|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even though east is a substitute it seems they have control over their system:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure how many of his regular agreements vd Bos has agreed with Tim Verbeek but this looks like a relay sequence he used with v Lankveld as well: they play a fairly natural ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: system, but with loads of gadgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: gf relay quite standard among dutch juniors|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H the limit of the hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: the 4-4 fit often plays better, but here we see @s's split 4-1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke mal 2@s zeigt schon 5-4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise to me though that north didn't drive to game here|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: schlechte stimmung bei den senioren, kratz/sträter sind mit der spielgeschwindigkeit ihrer gegner nicht glücklich|pg||
nt|400 volt: Gegen wen spielen die beiden denn?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich glaub der eine ist yves mucha|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe some side effect, that explains the imo poor level of bridge here besides the tight schedule was last night... it was Alexander Smirnovs 30th birthday and most of the players ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: were at the bar (too?) long|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he had bought champagne for all :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andreasw:  4@s could have problems although it should make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 3@C probably does that too :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S seems playable|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C K protected|pg||
nt|kingcur: and W declaring 4@S seems like the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d lead looks best to me? altough North might get creative and lead a small @c here|pg||
nt|tomi2: N could insert the 9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|stc: sry, Ich dachte an einer 1NT Opening !|pg||
nt|tomi2: to prevent this|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  level -to be honist must admid has been a dissopointment but colorful boards and happenings|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Jokisch proved theirs ablities on the piano|pg||
nt|anton72: still could be one down|pg||
nt|anton72: for me looks cool -1 ..let see|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stc: now -2|pg||

pc|c7|nt|kingcur: @HJ not hurting declarer|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So Vesa Fagerlund has played a longtime for the finnish jun team|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: nice game missed here?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: also south sitting over the stuff|pg||
nt|xenya: i hope i'm not resulting, but i'd try 3N as N|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzzx: high = odd count|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps -it will beb down -entryes are too bad -sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: club lead = low from doubleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thats what i meant|pg||
nt|stc: do you think they make 6@s ? big communication problems, don't think they make|pg||
nt|luffe12:  sry for any confussion|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kingcur: and will now look to set up his side suit first|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@s was a mild slam try even|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  lead 2nd/4th   so  weak doubleton leads LOW|pg||
pc|cT|nt|golfsquash: Just 8 tricks, but north coming under some pressure on the run of the hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does north do after  1@C-1@H-3@C-???|pg||
pc|c6|nt|golfsquash: making now if he reads it right|pg||
nt|sastro: pik 8 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@d would have been sign-off|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: hmm have to type the aucion one more, it was too nice|pg||
nt|kingcur: and NS believe he will do just that|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we treat S hand as a weak 2@D?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  slam can make here finding the @s J|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@d for me nv-v|pg||
nt|kingcur: in a junior event, even 3@D is a possibility :)|pg||
nt|anton72: mixed hand ...1 Cl or 1 NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: running scores  Open  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|kingcur: as we see|pg||
nt|frankaus: can get ugly 6322 not a gr8 shape|pg||
nt|kingcur: and it's not even extremely junior-ish to open 3@D nowadays|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i believe preempting high is best at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh -- i should have refreshed screens :(|pg||
nt|kingcur: pressure bidding being the way to go nowadays|pg||
nt|anton72: surely you will miss 1 point ...but ...|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|luffe12:  this board is a fine example on how great 10+ trumphs works |pg||
nt|stc: 6@c is a very decent contract|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@C leaping Michaels presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: non-leaping actually :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east values looks great.. i dont they they will stand at 5'th lvl|pg||
nt|kingcur: and N adding his part in the preemption...E might want to double for penalties now, but not sure if that isn't agreed as forward going|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: interesting to see what Verbeek comes up with now|pg||
nt|frankaus: just @C i ecpect planing to introduce @S later to show 6/5|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: pass and pull? |pg||
nt|kingcur: has E got enough for a pass and pull you think?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe east is afraid of W passing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: very risky indeed in a one-day partnership|pg||
nt|kingcur: for specs: this is an agreement to show a better hand than you would be showing by bidding directly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening 2@C as weak with majors, but this hand is too weak for vulnerable|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: another 3NT contract|pg||
mb|1D|nt|400 volt: hier gehen 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores for Seniors    http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_son.html|pg||
nt|pelu: NS prob in 3@S over 3@D (making)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: things may get too high here|pg||
mb|1H|an|5+|nt|golfsquash: expect to hear 4@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores for Ladies  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_tur.html|pg||
nt|stc: 2@s in N will temperate W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that Kanukov's wife is on the winning team in Ladies Trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we are the only table left in this room, players enjoy the silence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Gromöllers wife failed|pg||
nt|frankaus: pragmatic 6@C is possible|pg||
nt|anton72: nice spot for dutch,s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  e-w will compete to 3@d and n-s 3@h/@s which is a lvl to high|pg||
mb|2N!|an|4+!d, good raise|nt|400 volt: da Ost/West in Gefahr sind, wird auch hier Ost/West keine günstige Verteidigung finden können|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores for Open  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|luffe12:  10 easy tricks on the E-W cards dispite only 18HCP and a worthless @dk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=non-force  [negative free bid]|pg||
nt|stc: here the üar is 5@Dx -1 : 100 EW !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: smirnov: "Josef, pls, your lead"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Jamm must win so that both get to travel to European Championships in  Cardiff|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Dublin it is I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the winner of this event will represent Germany in Dublin (EC) and Lille (WC/Olympiad)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   European is Dublin     Cardiff was in running for the World Championship  but i think final decision is for Lillie France|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Tomi|pg||
nt|stc: needs to guess @h, not impossible after the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: screens in use, so I dont know who is thinking, N or E|pg||
nt|stc: but I think S will take the insurance in 6 @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: am sitting in the south west corner|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s x -4 = 800|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: narazie dwa szczêliwe rozdania dla Brytyjczyków|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: someone told me that 7222 distribution is very close to 6322 which is very close to 5332 which is almost 4333. With that hand, you will bid 3NT immediately, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2nt is positive with fit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 1 Nt could prob be a weak raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We need to shut down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tes, difficult for west not to bid on|pg||
nt|pelu: I forgot - juniors :) - S only have to a contructive raise to 2@s - But "The law" again cost|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tables are not linked|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: first pass, let your pd double and then bid: hence the name|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably would have gone down in 6, losing the @sJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: i even alert my 1nt opening as "may include 7 card suits"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East shows clubs, but there is a nasty duplication in hearts|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 6@D   be honest now -- how many people thought about THAT bid??|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W has bad values for slam even he has a maximum hand in HCP so he shouldnt go for a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dennis will insert scores manually for boards already played when he gets a minute|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: kleine swings für Jokisch|pg||
nt|stc: kann spanend sein|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: interesting auction|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s guess needed -restricted choice if you happened to start from rigth hand |pg||
nt|stc: now 170 EW :)|pg||
nt|stc: of course splits are very bad and even 5 @c is not so easy, 3NT lokks OK|pg||
nt|stc: 9 easy tricks, some endplay with N for ten ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe NS need to lead spades, though|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: as I have written before, inviting slam with 7222 needs a lot of HCP and especially a lot of controls.|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W should bid 4NT now to be able to stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  the law!!|pg||
nt|dimi: but if you only see the EW hands 6@c would be the best contract|pg||
nt|stc: sure, W must be disapointed now but happy later|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can make 5nt double-dummy with the @hKJ- but that's not a likely result at the table.|pg||
nt|stc: DD you can paerhaps even make 6@c guessing @Hs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but west will likely bid 4 hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|golfsquash: lead directing, implying a heart fit on passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ew play weak nt so 1nt shows extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pure Piekarek|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And both pairs use Gazzilli in this sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 3@s eben hat 8 imps gekostet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gromöller wanders off in search of coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ns normally play 2/4 leads but in this particular situation (partner's suit vs nt) they play 1/3|pg||
nt|stc: but whatfor ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: instill doubt in East  in case grand slam is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west is still thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|sastro: denke mal, dass mit Fit die Nordhand ein 4 Couer-Gebot wert ist|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@H sieht hier eigentlich gar nicht schlecht aus - bei dem aktuellen Kartenstand aber nur mit viel hellseherischen Talent zu erfüllen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: der schlitten für die bietkarten ist kaputt, g. thamm versucht ihn jetzt zu reparieren während dieses board gespielt wird|pg||
nt|luffe12:  20 trumphs = 20 tricks totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room   33 [4@HW-1]     Fritsche playing 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: when the tray is on my side i try to avoid clicking immediatly after a bid has been done because it's possile that they hear my mouse on the other side of the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  1M-2M = 7-10 hcp for NS|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kingcur: yes, slam is not plain sailing for EW, and 5@Dx should bring in more than 650...let's see|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well judged...|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: found about missing @S cue. But wrong contract and 2 imps on 8 board match might be crutial|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3NT would be better. on a @D lead they need the finesse now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup:  3nt makeable by guessing @d |pg||
nt|runnerup:  so it means that you you play like this -now @s finess is odds on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missing some hesitations Tomi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: @s10 2nd, 4th|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Switching to English now|pg||
nt|stc: welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking about the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet    Khanukov WOULD have played @H suit correctly after the 4@S opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov shaking his head after seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|tomi2: think they play 10 boards. does not change too much anyway, 1 imp can easy be 1vp, yes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h and 5 @c down because bad sits -with good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south unsure about the meaning of norths bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: not sure whether this contract is doubled...|pg||
nt|pelu: the highest making contract is 3@D - and now fight on the 5-level :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so, peter the 4 spade bid is a winner|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|golfsquash: N/S playing x-y NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 2@c demands 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: mit @hA vor dem k ist hier alles relativ egal, aber jokisch versucht natürlich eine linie zu finden die auch gegen möglichst widrige verteilungen noch erfïult|pg||
nt|runnerup:  on a good day even 6 @c makes ..not this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky seems totaly unsure what is going on but from west questiones he can imagine clubs splitting not so well. unfortunatly for he would be dummy. screens in use, so north and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south do not know who was thinking when|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Probably intended as an entry for the @c finesse, the @hJ dropping changes the line.  He did that just to spite my prediction...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer will give a @c and then has an entry to the @h|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dimi: Joe, declarer might heard your plan for 11 tricks :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl claimed on any return and no single king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to leaders on 33   shouldn't be long wait till we know whether 6@S was good or bad bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: difficult to stop in 3N, should be happy with this I think..|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Czechs reached the slam on the other table, will be expensive|pg||
nt|pelu: only if u play Pokere and weak or very agressiv opponents|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: also not sure re the reference to "juniors" who underbid the last hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andreasw:  im not sure it will.. but taking the safe road is problebly best|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 10 tricks here w a nice @h |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: td called|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps south is out of what is happening |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking what to do when he gets no expainations from south|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south trying his best to explain|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome to felix zimmermann|pg||
nt|400 volt: Hi all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: perhaps N would have done better to overtake and play @HQ -- |pg||
nt|pelu: N will have time for that later|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: on board 21 Israel did not preempt at all, so Helmich-Hop played a quiet 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well netherland Red of to a great start|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with a very likely gain on the next board too|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: and on B22: 3NT +1 = 7IMP|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: so the 6322 shape goes $ 1100|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt ist ost auf jeden fall engespielt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: both discard a heart|pg||
pc|sK|nt|uni_cicam: I will bid 3NT directly against 15-17 NT, probably getting too old :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I may be wrong, but think quite a few teams will be in slam...|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and if north bids on over 2@d he has a game invitation hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:) 1100 seems right|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|runnerup:  missunderstandings continues -now you see other table in 6 @s with 4-1 |pg||
nt|runnerup:  board 17|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|glen: good morning|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzzx: gute alleinspieltechnik|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like a few more imps for Jokisch|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: don't see why it caused him so much pain to part with @d7|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can' t quite manage here if N now returns @D|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat @h2 vorgezogen, denkt aber nochmal nach|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|glen: guten Morgen also|pg||
nt|kingcur: 1100 a decent win versus a game result, and an acceptable loss should open room bring in the slam|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  might go one more now playing to win|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: now S's @C2 gets promoted :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sastro: jetzt kommt ein Endspiel|pg||
pc|sT|nt|golfsquash: 12 Imps for Ireland on bd 2. Scotland played 5@c-5 on 4/3 fit where Ireland made 3NT on strip squeeze.|pg||
