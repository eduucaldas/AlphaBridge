nt|thenapster: 2cl showes 18-19 balanced in bocchi-madala sys|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: i think 2@C was 18-19 balanced and 2@D was 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|athene: no notes for anything after that, unfortunately|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|athene: really impossible for east to find a club lead i think, in practice|pg||
nt|thenapster: 2h=3+hearts,3d strength,3sp cue,3nt unserious,4cl,4d cue,4sp cue,aces,3 aces|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: when you have A,K,Q against a slam you don't expect partner to have anything|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|thenapster: any lead will beat the contract execpt this sp lead|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|athene: yes any non-spade lead is good enough|pg||
nt|thenapster: so 980,a great results for Jacobs in the first board and 10 imps back|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should have gone passive with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Much discussion in Italian . . . |pg||
nt|thenapster: i agree|pg||
nt|athene: but normally when opps bid slam you expect them to have enough tricks if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|athene: so you are supposed to attack|pg||

mb|p|nt|thenapster: for the pepole who didnt follow the last results,the team of Falk won some big teams in the last stages and making a very nice suprise |pg||
nt|athene: i will try and hunt out a cc for EW; 2@C might be DONT (clubs and higher)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|thenapster: i think so too|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|thenapster: 2sp looks like 1 down and push board|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|nt|athene: he might suffer two club ruffs for -2|pg||
nt|athene: for example if he tries to draw trumps from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: east wins king and gets two ruffs, and there is still a diamond to come|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|athene: right, -200|pg||
pc|cA|nt|davpro: 5@h didn't make, but I guess the vulnerablitiy made Cullin bid one more time. To be sure|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi played the @C5 at trick 1 trying to conceal the situation|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Lots of major two-way finesses|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|davpro: Great lead (not that it mattered)|pg||

mb|3N|nt|thenapster: yeah|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 is not obvious when partner could not bid 1@S over 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|thenapster: i dont like the 4h with 3 aces|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he did bid 4@c - what do you want him to do now?|pg||
nt|thenapster: 4sp|pg||
nt|thenapster: 4cl its almost automatic |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: W is devoid of source of tricks after 3 Aces|pg||
nt|thenapster: its just denies 5422 with 11-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: everything behaves for declarer here. In a NT contract at least|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|thenapster: ajxxx ajxx xxx x i bid also 4cl|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you would open that hand and then bid 4@c - you'll be a man, my son :)|pg||
nt|thenapster: :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: declarer might have to guess hearts (finesse 9) to scramble home here|pg||
nt|thenapster: for me west MUST bid 4sp|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: but sooner or later in 2/1 auctions, someone's got to say whether they have a mimimum|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: no, he is ok anyway|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: maybe West's 4@c was "serious", maybe not - but this slam is nowhere near as good as you think it is|pg||
nt|thenapster: so if you dont plan to bid over 4h try to bid other way|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: it is often better to take some risks to get into your 4-4 fit rather than defend 1nt|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|davpro: This is not a good 3NT. Well it is, but 3 kings behave aswell as the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: because a 4-4 fit can only take 4 tricks in defence to 1nt|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: much better if you are playing in it|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it is very hard when the opponents are bidding your suits|pg||
pc|s9|nt|davpro: Nothing wrong in stopping low. Imh (and uncontested)o|pg||
pc|d3|nt|thenapster: and than you did enough|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, they stayed out of a so-so slam that might or might not make - probably tough to make on this lie|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|mc|7|nt|athene: even if 1@C is known to be very loose, it's still hard to get into 2@C with these NS cards|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Lots of boards left :)|pg||

nt|sundiszno: 6 can be made on a non-@d lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Entries?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, not trivial for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you just concede the @D10 to establish communications in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: concede the @DQ sorry|pg||
nt|athene: but with only 5 diamond tricks you need another from somewhere|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Then need heart A onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe just try for stiff @DQ and then concede diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but now if madala, say, won the @DQ and returned a diamond, declarer might feel he has to run them, and that is going to squeeze his hand |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Entries?  D spots?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Outdoor patio next to restroom :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2@s opening interesting. was it intermediate?|pg||

nt|athene: know it's bad|pg||
pc|dK|nt|szalay: 2N is xfer to @Cs|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|davpro: passs suggested; Yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 5@c looks like a phantom save|pg||
nt|thenapster: a new leader|pg||
nt|athene: when dummy hits, of course, east wants to have doubled 2@D :) |pg||
pc|dA|nt|koksoy: with 7411  its  normal  to  bid  5@C  for me ...  if   one  contract is  makeable you  may  win..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not many dummy entries to take all finesses|pg||
nt|koksoy: but  both  are  down  ý  guess...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: how about a dbl? instead of 3@c?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: partner could have 5 card hearts|pg||

nt|agumperz:  64 boards a day against expert players trying to squeeze out every trick|pg||

nt|hedyg: the EW bidding told him pd was short in @d|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and tiring|pg||
nt|tez: he knows pd has shortness in @d..he has nothing in @d|pg||
nt|agumperz:  so especially at the end of matches|pg||
nt|agumperz:  players tend to tire|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and occasionally lose concentration|pg||
nt|agumperz:  that is one of the reasons that 4 man teams dont win these events|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|koksoy: EW can  make  3@C  so  3@S  down  one  is  normal|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead, will bocchi take the queen and then finesse the ten? he needs all the dummy entries he can get|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: easy 9 tricks with @H hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|thenapster: i think he will for sure,does it enough?kx sp onside and jh as well,might work somehow|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: lots of options in the play; for example if you had to bring in clubs with limited dummy entries, you might start by leading them from hand|pg||
nt|athene: that gains if east has @CKx or CQx, if you read the position|pg||
nt|athene: @CKx or @CQx|pg||
nt|athene: this is really a hand for intermediates :) declarer has an army of tens, nines and eights all eagerly awaiting orders|pg||
nt|thenapster: :)|pg||
nt|athene: usually the best way to make use of these cards is persuade the defenders to open up suits|pg||

nt|davpro: true. But it's high, isn't it?|pg||
nt|bt: i agree but what can you do, wait for partner to T/O double when you have all those high cards?|pg||
nt|davpro: Whatever you do. in all situations; do the right thing :) Bridge becomes easy then :)|pg||
nt|bt: i think a jury would be equally split between D and 5@H|pg||

nt|agumperz:  that is usually just an overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: good 3NT, unlikely to make 4@s|pg||

nt|thenapster: 7 imps back to Falk|pg||
nt|athene: north will bid 1@S over 1@H, i assume|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: rather than showing a 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bt: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KJ98+Tx+J9xx+Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: ghestem or something would say "i have ten black cards, but i am at unfavourable, so i can't buy the contract, but i thought you might like to play double-dummy and get into the ...|pg||
nt|athene: bulletin with a brilliant line"|pg||
nt|thenapster: bocchi and madala will overcall ANY possible time when they have the @s suit|pg||
nt|thenapster: ANY!|pg||
nt|athene: lauria versace had a period where they literally bid 1@S any time with 5 - that included 0 counts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some sort of experiment i guess|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzfg: Lusky thinking of "unusual" 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Long thought :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bt: i think 3@S is a nice bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sundiszno: not too much chance for Dumbovich|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|davpro: I agree. Again.|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  play  4 card  major ??|pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: danger of a @s ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|thenapster: if he play heart to k and heart bocchi will endplay on trick 3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bt: what, u agreed twice with me, i dont believe u|pg||
nt|davpro: Neither do I...|pg||
nt|koksoy: lets  see  how he  will  play  trumps...|pg||
nt|koksoy: may  not  be  flat..|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bt: u must be crazy|pg||
nt|davpro: Yes. I've got papers to prove it :)|pg||
nt|bt: anyway a normal contract with som nice endplay possibilities|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|bt: ew will be forced to open up hearts and that @H7 is huge then|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt: decl ruffs a spade, pulls trumps and plays on diamonds|pg||
nt|bt: of course north my insert @H9 |pg||
pc|d3|nt|bt: may|pg||

mb|2H|nt|agumperz:  how many spades now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you Dan, a pleasure to commentate at your table :)|pg||
mb|4D|an|Strong spade bid|nt|agumperz:  none|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you Andrew and Tezcan :)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  presumably 4@D is an artificial call showing long strong spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: and thanks specs for joining us, we hope you are enjoying the show|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: we will be back for more fun in ca 45 minutes |pg||
nt|agumperz:  yes, and hedy appreciates the tips|pg||
nt|tez: ty all ..ty Hedy @h and Andrew:)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  ty hedy and tez :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hedyg: so 4@d here like a namyats 4@d|pg||
nt|agumperz:  yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|an|3KC & void|nt|agumperz:  i wonder how they show a stong hand with spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: not via leaping michaels |pg||
nt|agumperz:  but i can see the advantage of this treatment|pg||
nt|agumperz:  it allows west to choose who should declare 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: will not expect long @ds with Q@D in the N hand|pg||
nt|tez: 6@c from Dahl..lead direction|pg||
nt|tez: or to play:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could already have bid 5@c earlier|pg||
mb|7C|nt|hedyg: Hampson opened the N hand 3@H and is in 5@H X|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: not a misclick|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: did i say bid 5@c ? |pg||
nt|tez: Cheek knows grue has void in @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  nice way to end the set!|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh wow!|pg||
nt|hedyg: fireworks!|pg||
nt|agumperz:  ok, joe|pg||
nt|agumperz:  show us what ya got|pg||
nt|tez: Cheek's pass i..i want to bid 7@s |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|agumperz:  jim fox points out|pg||
nt|agumperz:  30 IMPs could swing on this board|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: big brorher says he can make it..|pg||
nt|agumperz:  tense hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Joey is getting a drink of water while he thinks this over...ask about their weak 2 bid style|pg||
nt|agumperz:  to make|pg||
nt|agumperz:  joe has to cash spade ace|pg||
nt|tez: ruffing finesse @d|pg||
nt|agumperz:  then take a ruffing finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to play A@S, AK@D and run J@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit DD?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|agumperz:  looking good for joe|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: yes the 7@c bid might be of help here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|mc|13|nt|hedyg: fantastic!!!!!!|pg||
nt|agumperz:  great job joe|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty all, see you soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Yes, can't believe he'd get it right without the 7C bid|pg||
nt|tez: see you soon..ty all:)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  great set for joe and curtis|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: at least a 30 minute break|pg||

nt|athene: he took the club finesse and ran into a vicious defensive crossruff?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|MolvaM: thanks Enver for the commentary and thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the 3@D bid should have warned him|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|davpro: At the other table they are in 4@s X. Down one /or possible two) on the previous board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we have 2 more segments (32 more boards)|pg||
nt|thenapster: so what is the best line you think?|pg||
nt|thenapster: he cant avoid of loosing 2h tricks,this was his last entry to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: very hard to say, knowing all the cards|pg||
nt|athene: he led a club to the queen with the idea that if it lost, the jack would be a dummy entry for a trump play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4H was unmakeable last hand|pg||
mb|5S|nt|koksoy: ty  Murat...  and  specs who  watch  us...|pg||
mb|p|nt|thenapster: dbl by east|pg||
mb|6S|nt|koksoy: not  easy  to  make  4@S...  diamond lead will force declearer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow 5@d at unfav vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: looks like 500|pg||
nt|thenapster: forgot the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: Bd 15 4C-1, will fix later|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: bocchi a little unlucky to find partner with three small hearts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thenapster: wow,sadek made a tricky play in other room and made 4h|pg||
nt|athene: yeah, played other way up after leaping michaels, and he tried a small trump off dummy|pg||
nt|thenapster: indeed|pg||
nt|thenapster: 5cl going down other room|pg||
nt|thenapster: 5 or 7 imps back to Falk|pg||
nt|thenapster: but a big set for Jacobs..+35 imps|pg||
nt|thenapster: 5 back...55-17 this set|pg||
nt|thenapster: great segment by both of jacobs sides..all 4 players|pg||
nt|thenapster: so thank you all|pg||
nt|thenapster: we start soon again|pg||
nt|thenapster: next match start in few minutes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kvzacc: 2s and 3h are also made, not a good sign for dumbo|pg||
nt|koksoy: yes...  partner  has passed  hand..   sacrifice can not be  succesful  on  red vercus white..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs predict 800 if def leads trumps but with @hK onside I thk 500 is the limit|pg||
nt|koksoy: but  their teammates made 4@S  so  they  will  only loose  2 imps ý  guess|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: operator, when do we start the 3rd segment pls?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfg: 7PM|pg||
nt|thenapster: will he duck?|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause really east wondering what to do here?|pg||
nt|athene: i am thinking maybe west should have played the @D6 as a clearer count signal|pg||
nt|athene: is east thinking that declarer must have another diamond|pg||
nt|athene: because west would "surely" play the 6 from Q643?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: E doesn't know about the A of H is worried|pg||
nt|athene: and if so, maybe ducking the first diamond will make declarer's life a little harder|pg||
nt|athene: the motto is, if you are giving a count signal, make it as clear as you can|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: you could just claim 2 off undoubled :) same score|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: that must be 2 hrs from now I guess?|pg||
nt|koksoy: ok  :)  then  whats  the  time over there  now ??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 7PM Eastern Daylight 2 hours from now :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: but madala might resent the implication he can take only 8 tricks on this hand|pg||
pc|cA|mc|12|pg||
