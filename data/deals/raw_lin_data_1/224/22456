nt|fabsayc: kansas 80 UNC 67|pg||
nt|kareno: The match is only half over.  It's way too soon to swing like that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco: "leads and carding?" "3/5 and upside down"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Surely S could have the QJ of diamonds or a 4th diamond and this would be excellent, instead of not very good?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: probably 4@D should show 4 diamonds, the jump is nice but it eats bidding space|pg||
nt|kareno: For all those who think that 46 IMPs in 32 boards is a match out of reach, think again.|pg||
nt|kareno: It is four to five swings and now Greco has pushed it to six swings.|pg||

nt|penseur9: Hi Joe...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco in 6@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: hiAL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set both pairs for Diamond playing big club|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Al (better :) )|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: and both pairs for Amoils 2/1|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 3@H not natural  sort of repeat 4th suit|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Players continue having much fun :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you flip-flop Del'Monte @H & @C  then Ish would rebid 3N|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|penseur9: we all saw that the Diamond team had a difficult 2nd round... let's see how they fare in this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intersting  in other room hampson started with semi-force NT and after north showed max 55 raised @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  Bessis bids 2@C but doesn't show @D fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [i really like Bessis' auction]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone know if NS have been partners before this tournament?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Play of @hQ an option?|pg||
nt|ritong: they have practiced some on BBO|pg||
nt|penseur9: bonsoir Henri... welcome|pg||
nt|ritong: for the live tourneys, i do not know|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ritong: in any case, they have not practiced enough to set this kind of auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 of the players on Amoils team were 2nd last year|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bessis playing with his father as part of Zimmermann team won this event in 2010|pg||
nt|ritong: which might sound strong, but is in fact a search for NTs, then a choice of game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it has been a banner ACBL debut   2nd in the 3-day Platinum Pairs and going for the win in this even more prestigious event|pg||
nt|ritong: bessis has tried to orientate notrumps to his pard, Axx being a weak holding to receive the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 of Amoils played last year   cheek-grue, ish del'monte and amoils|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5th member was bakhshi  [hope i spelled that correctly]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: Gitelman had a sound balancing X and Moss had a bit better than a typical pass and showed some positive values with the jump;  Now EW ended a bit too high and the trump break ...|pg||
nt|bagman: complicates even more|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: brutal situation - even for long time partnership|pg||
nt|penseur9: very but 5@C seems a reasonable contract here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: when in doubt take a plus ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transportation issues if you take the "free finesse"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume Diamond would NOT lead away from trump Q, so  play king and finesse is very reasonable line|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes -- i'm very jealous|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: With 13 hcp and support for unbid suits, X is (in my opinion) a sound choice|pg||

mb|2H|an|minors < invitational|nt|ahollan1: going for 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but the idea is to keep opponents off the auction|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss asking questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Moss is going to lose 2 trump tricks one way or another|pg||
nt|ritong: yep|pg||
nt|ritong: 300 away in any case|pg||
nt|bagman: Assuming Moss is not going to ruff with @S2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Deep thought|pg||
nt|bagman: Moss has the read of the club situation as the defense would have cashed the 3rd club in case they had the transportation|pg||
nt|dburn: practical shot by Bessis also - he could make some technical bid like 4@d, but he didn't want to give West a chance to double that|pg||

mb|3D|nt|kareno: For those who think north had to have that good a hand, think again - it is a game of competition for the partscore.  North had a particularly good hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|poohbear: i guess hampson just answered my question|pg||

mb|1C|an|strong, artificial|nt|ritong: delicate choice for moss here|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming north opens 1@c|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|ritong: anything goes versus a strong @c opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5+ suit, game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ritong: 1NT has the merit to picture the hand, despite the feeble @c stopper|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table North overcalled 2@h, and South made a technical bid of three of a minor, and West doubled that, and East saved|pg||
nt|ritong: hoping to be raised, not the case here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ritong: a classical raise with singleton, but lots of quick tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue: "Could have jumped to 2@h to show invitational hand"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Great Shuffler was playing a joke on EW this hand|pg||

nt|ritong: it is not over|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: east has a real good hand|pg||

nt|ritong: when opener was supposed to hold a six bagger|pg||

nt|penseur9: difficult hand to bid... and to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we see that Diamond can pin the @C9   but we're cheating|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJT too  but  a bunch of @S doubletons in south good for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession: i didn't think of that on my own|pg||
nt|ritong: unless he can create an entry playing the @h Q, he has few options|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: and as we can see, our heroes are well- equipped|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: both contracts making, so no big swing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: this will hold?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: south is not scared with @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  difficult to bid, difficult to play, difficult to defend|pg||
nt|ritong: so he does not care offering an entry|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - South does not fear the diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: but this is problematic for Diamond now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: A club would not have helped as declarer could have ruffed with the ten and taken the rest|pg||

nt|dburn: was wondering if he would do that|pg||
nt|ritong: i was thinking 3@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: but we've learned that 3N almost never gets lead of opener's suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S would ask for @S stop|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: let @h take care of themselves :)|pg||
nt|ritong: and the first among us who tells the zia story will be punished|pg||
nt|dburn: and heart stop, and diamond stop...|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: in the same situation, hampson bashed 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Diamond might think he has enough of those stoppers to do something....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D thinks partner has @SKx|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: i stand corrected :)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|chmitty: best defence leads to 2 down as declarer is facing transportation problems to cash both @d and @h|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it possible that Del'Monte will think 3N was with psychic @S stop?  i.e. west holds @SKQx|pg||
nt|ritong: if we give any credit to the auction, pard has stiff @sA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: the @d 5 comes from 3, so the hand is clear|pg||
nt|poohbear: I believe they use udca|pg||
nt|ritong: so @sQxx is zilch|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Al welcome|pg||
nt|poohbear: so a @d pitch will appear encouraging though the general rule defending nt . Dont pitch suits you want led|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: right, but they might cash out, threatened by @ds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue playing confidently|pg||
nt|chmitty: if declarer unblocks @d at trick 2 (as suggested by audience) @h will be blocked|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss understandably deep in thought|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW standard carding|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves:  a very flat set it seems|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: not so much that West holds @sKQx - maybe East holds @sKQ doubleton|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: either boring boards or good Bridge Allan .  U decide :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Other table very deliberate|pg||
nt|algraves:  these days 2 imps a board per team seems normal but this is very low scoring|pg||
nt|poohbear: interesting play |pg||
nt|poohbear: Intuitively I would exit Spade Jack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: @dJ came out in a flash :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this will endplay West if it is ducked|pg||
nt|algraves:  Kibitizers on flooding he airways with the exact number of imps per board|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think he will take and return  a @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No @s return knowing @sJ in Grue's hand :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss deep in thought|pg||
nt|algraves:  Moss is watering his diamonds hoping they will grow |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Every IMP counts! :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I don't think has any choice but to take... what to return may be the problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gitelmans spade pitch will cost a trick unless partner ducks the @d  . |pg||
nt|penseur9: that's is East as to...|pg||
nt|penseur9: let's see what he decides :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Could Gitelman have afforded the @s9 first discard?  Upside down|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  Since they are behind the time schedule even with Joe-Boo at the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: TIme on clock OK +2 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|ritong: redouble, perhaps|pg||
nt|kareno: Unfortunately not a swing hand (unless someone bids slam without checking for aces)|pg||
nt|ritong: intending to raise @hs later on|pg||
nt|ritong: but a chunky 2@h or the equivalent would be fine too  hand is ugly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and from what i read -- Ish's father was even more  ummmm   colorful|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|ritong: stiff honors are not the best features, in general|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: redouble was fast, Brad thought long about how many @S to bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: your opinion about the 3NT bid Henri ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Henri(s) :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pragma|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue "he provides the running suit? :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 10 form Jack or shortness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss thinking deeply|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT certainly has the merit to diminish the chance they find a sacrifice|pg||
nt|chmitty: good point|pg||
nt|algraves:  so playing precision where 1@D is limited gives Grue a chance for very accurate description 5-6 13-15 pts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: on the other hand, if they do have a cheap sac, perhaps they will lead something else than @s and i won t make 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: but, all in all, if i bid the contract i have under my eyes, should be plus at the end of the year|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cheek refusing to lead what declarer expects|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|algraves:  Cheek has to weigh 3 contracts, game in red suit or 4@D|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT not an option really|pg||
nt|algraves:  typically gamble the contract that has the best chance of a good swing|pg||
nt|penseur9: trump play will decide if it makes or not|pg||
nt|algraves:  This is very close|pg||
nt|algraves:  lets see how it goies|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss thinking carefully|pg||
nt|penseur9: very|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems like a stretch to bid 5D with no working cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|algraves:  for sure declarer has 5 trumps, 4 black tricks and a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Black Aces cover Grue's black holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: @d109 huge|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: still need to produce 9 other tricks |pg||
nt|algraves:  so the battle will be over trick 11 for declarer and / or trick 3 for defense|pg||
nt|penseur9: exactly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That game is named "bridge" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ish and his father Curly were known for creative bidding and card play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both very well respected for their style|pg||
nt|penseur9: at the rate they are playing... either this round will be cut short or the final one delayed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|algraves:  that is a good lead as it threatens one of the black tricks|pg||

nt|ritong: well controlled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct me if i'm wrong  Ish is mid/hi 30s?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ritong: cullin heard no cue over 3@s, so his hunger decreased violently|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: @h overruff = down 1|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves:  for those of you at home who are not yet good squeezers, many of them play themselve as long as you do not destroy the communication in one of the suits. That one operated because he has the club communicationn sitll intact|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: A normal 1nt by south would create a big minus for n/s|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|dburn: still, he hasn't made it yet...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he has now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just too tough -- nice bid Brian|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Platnick:  "you've got yours"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chmitty: 3@c = no shortness ?|pg||
nt|ritong: they should discover the @c weakness in time|pg||
nt|algraves:  Gittleman has a 7th spade to make up a few points|pg||
nt|penseur9: good advice Allan|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfb: 2@C = @C and another|pg||
nt|ritong: and prolly will lose 1 imp|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe that's redouble|pg||
nt|kareno: I play that a double of 1nt creates a force through 2@d - they cannot play 2 of a minor undoubled.|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, east has opened third seat at fav|pg||
nt|algraves:  Moss shows a limit raise and a diamond control|pg||
pc|h7|nt|algraves:  tricky lead|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps this factor alterates some your point|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: I would accept that a third seat opener isn't forced :)|pg||
nt|ritong: which is valid under other circumstances|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4@h denying @c and @d control they stop safely|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pc|d5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|dburn: a spade lead would, somewhat randomly, have beaten the contract, but that wasn't even fourth best from South's strongest suit|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||

nt|kareno: Oh, now I hear the auction is not over.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 17+ bal  [but not 19-20]|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ritong: mine are tip top:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h lead, 11 tricks ... next :)|pg||
nt|ritong: cheek has no reason to monkey around  1NT usually shows like 8/10, so he simply bids the obvious spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: wooow|pg||
nt|chmitty: OK there is a reason to lead a @d : if you want to defeat 3NT, you must find some cards in your partner's hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss was toying with @h7 then switched|pg||
mb|2S!|an|usually 5-4-2-2 with a minor|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||

nt|penseur9: will they press for slam? let's see|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: isn t that a cute dummy, freddy boy?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oops - swing to Diamond.  Double?  Not my style with the north hand.|pg||
nt|algraves:  This is the type of hand where you want to avoid the weak  4-4  . Two strong long suit fits . Make one of them trump. Use the other for tricks|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chmitty: and as he did not double 1@s, you can't expect too many @h in his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
nt|dburn: still, all the rotten ones will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought i saw 1@D   so 1N unlimited over 1@H|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: @c 7 = good lead pal|pg||
nt|ritong: aka smith peter|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: open room on their last board|pg||
pc|h6|nt|penseur9: this will hurt the Diamond team|pg||
nt|algraves:  not a very good contract. Gittleman liked his black cards , and Moss his aces|pg||
nt|algraves:  but the mesh is not very good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: We know the @cfinesse is off, Moss doesn't :(|pg||
nt|algraves:  6C down on a Heart lead |pg||
nt|penseur9: possibly will also be bid at other table... otherwise ????|pg||
nt|algraves:  Bridge is a gambling game first and foremost and presents many opportunities for chance to play a role. They could easily have this auction on a different set of hands with similiar values and end in a very good contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: distribution is nearly always the determining factor|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes and the location of the high cards for the fit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chmitty: on the other hand, lead a @h may be good if you hit the 5 cards in the suit in your partner's hand, even though he is weak, when the 5 cards in @d may not help|pg||
nt|penseur9: that's another consideration Allan|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kareno: I think the double by north is like the opening 3nt saying I have stoppers if you have a 7 card running suit :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: so a good advice : at the end of the year, do what is good with the actual layout :)|pg||

nt|kareno: True.  Nonetheless the north hand has a huge excess of offense over defense.|pg||

nt|ritong: because 2@h would be too pedestrian|pg||
nt|chmitty: I doubt that on a long term you get to a better contrcat than 1NT by bidding rather than pass, but the point is that it makes it much more difficult for the opponents to enter in ...|pg||

nt|chmitty: the 8 Imps scored by Diamond so far involved 6 different boards ... :)|pg||
nt|daman:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 actually|pg||
nt|penseur9: last board here for this round...|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer wouldnt have scored the long @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Last board of "afternoon" hope all are enjoying this fine bridge :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I wish to thank Gary Hann, our great operator for a job well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OK - last for the set|pg||
nt|penseur9: last board of this session |pg||
nt|ritong: an other opportunity for the trailers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: last board of the set     final 16 boards begins ...  whenever they restart|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: we can call that grinding, yes  fireworks are scheduled later on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i guess cullin will reopen|pg||
nt|chmitty: may be this board ?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Double = strong|pg||
nt|poohbear: will restart in a few mins|pg||
nt|penseur9: a big hand of applause for Joe Stoke, our excellent operator...|pg||
nt|dburn: pre-emptive effect of the strong club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another very fine session for  Bessis-Del'Monte|pg||
nt|ritong: lol david|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  no declarer is always down only two from the beginning but subsequently , yes .|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pass = 0-4|pg||
nt|poohbear: strong @c  . Dbl shows the majors  . |pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  I was talking against par|pg||
nt|algraves:  sorry|pg||
nt|penseur9: i also wish to thank my co-commentators Barry, Allan and George for their fine work|pg||
nt|ritong: @d should reopen|pg||
nt|ritong: weak, but shaped|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, the strong no trump may prove an equally effective pre-empt|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks to my co-commentators (who did most of the work :) ) Al, Henri and David|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: final board of the session   restart in about 30 minutes  [unless players agree to start earlier]|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: same start in other room|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: and now, moss faces a hand almost woth a superaccept|pg||
nt|kareno: Congratulations to Diamond and we wish them luck tomorrow.  Thanks to our excellent operator <applause>|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, hold your tickets for tomorrow's final!!|pg||
nt|ritong: so he might be tempted with 3NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Final is noon Eastern time.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody knew whether East 2N was minors or just stronger NT hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: maybe EW could have escaped the x in other room, but let's pay credit to Greco for the @h lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree Henri. Partner either leads your singleton or they run that suit. |pg||
nt|ritong: you can do something big, overall|pg||
nt|poohbear: or partner leads your 6 card suit and you missed game :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pard obv has cards, well placed|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a fit and here we go|pg||
nt|dburn: not so clear - if you bid, sometimes partner bids more than you can make|pg||
nt|ritong: vulnerable, i disagree with this pass|pg||
nt|ritong: right, david  the jackpot syndrome|pg||
nt|dburn: but at least 1NT might go down more than one here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never knew it had a name|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|algraves:  Precision club, X for majors|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9: we must not overlook the fine contribution of all our listeners... thank you all and hope to see you back for round  3 in about 2 hours and 10 minutes|pg||
nt|algraves:  cheek X for takeout|pg||
nt|algraves:  North converts|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|poohbear: Passing 1NT in bal with a 6 card suit and a singleton is losing Bridge in my opinion|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: 8 nice imps|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, Platnick won't know how good his lead was|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: via 3@s, that is  but brad rejects it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding 5@D would just be greedy|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have balanced over strong C pass 1D p 1NT p p like in other room|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: and del Monte will rewrite the Dictionary of Suit Combinations|pg||
pc|sA|nt|poohbear: plus all the finesses are working|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: only 1 pitch in 5@D   retraction please|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess Grue took Cheeks 2 of @cs as suit preference|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: we stayed absolutely quiet:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: so 8 imp's to Diamond on this one, and 24-16 in total of the set :) see you all soon|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Kantar used to write up suit combinations like that  from his partnership disasters with Marshall Miles|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the stories were hilarious|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: The finals will be played in 64 boards tomorrow|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d8|pc|h3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|corplaw:  W can make if he plays to ruff out club|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chmitty: tx to 4560 kibs for watching, and @h:) tx to our great operator|pg||
nt|penseur9: the 2 hour break might give time for the Diamond team to recoup...|pg||
nt|algraves:  Edgara Kaplan always advised to take out takeout doubles if it is close.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grue didnt think it was close :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue has set up at least +200|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|corplaw:  now he can still make; N had to duck AD|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  great bridge show|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thx :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: right. How they got to there 2-1 fit at the 7 level and the lucky 6-4 break and miles stealing a trick held it to down 5 :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: mind you, Diamond might have played the jack to the first trick|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: He had to duck that diamond.|pg||
nt|ritong: fortunately for bertheau, this hand does not decide the match  but he is currently swearing at himself i m sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Does Fred have enough info to guess right if N leads @D now?|pg||
nt|corplaw:  not much of a guess; J in N vs Jx in S|pg||
nt|ritong: but north did not duck|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he likely has not @d AJ under his eyes|pg||
nt|kareno: True - if north ducks the diamond there is a trump endplay after ruffing out the club.  My bad :)|pg||
nt|corplaw:  declarer might have had QC instead of QD|pg||
nt|corplaw:  then duck would look very foolish|pg||
nt|corplaw:  but if N smoothly ducks diamond, W might play S for AD and lead another up instead of trying for endplay|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: If declarer doesn't have @DQ, he would play 3 rounds of @C first?|pg||
nt|kareno: Wheels within wheels|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred: Nothing makes any sense.|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
nt|corplaw:  if declarer had Ax, KJx, Kxxxx, AQx, can't play three rounds of clubs at that point as needs entry to play up diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit overstated, perhaps, but true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Both sides just agreed to ask me if this board matters for the match outcome, so I told them.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: ciao a tutti|pg||
nt|chmitty: ciao ciao|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  merci a tous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Then he quickly played @D10|pg||
nt|kareno: Good - let the players who are advancing get some sleep.|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks all and see you tomorrow!!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|algraves:  yes it was a good decision to convert|pg||
nt|penseur9: thank you all and hope to see in about 2 hours...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Players run out of the room|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks again Gary|pg||
nt|algraves:  Joe Grue has played a good half |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks all :)|pg||
nt|algraves:  He has a lot of confidence in his partnership with Curtis Cheek|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Very enjoyable watching these top level players up close, great attitude and demeanor|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes they were great|pg||
nt|algraves:  Partnership confidence is so important in bridge these days.|pg||
nt|algraves:  All the top pairs are very well practiced|pg||
nt|penseur9: let's go watch the open room... thank you all and bye bye for now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't go to far   restart should begin fairly soon after comparisons|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  terrific game from delmonte/bessis|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, well - 12 IMPs to nobody (apart from the fearless balancers on the commentary team)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: Since the scheduled start time for the last round is passed, maybe we should wait to see what Joe(operator) has to say about that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: strarting again very soon, I assume|pg||
nt|penseur9: ok thanks Joe|pg||
pg||
