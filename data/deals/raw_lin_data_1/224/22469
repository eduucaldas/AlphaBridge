mb|2N|nt|thomsen: but saved by kralik who bid 1 spade :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fortunately not all that in the picture, after 1@S|pg||
nt|kam_88: hello all|pg||
nt|kingcur: I'm being informed that Dror Padon (N here) and Lotan Fisher are the only remaining experienced juniors from the Israeli team that won in Veldhoven, the rest players of less ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: international experience|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|athene: nice @S7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|kingcur: that 1@S overcall kept NS out of their 4-4 fit in that suit, I'm sure|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: been in worse slams than 6@s|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|athene: in theory declarer can make twelve tricks now - he has 11 on top and west gets squeezed in hearts and clubs - but entries are a problem|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kingcur: and after that @D lead, a player like Dror Padon may well be seeing through the cards already|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: he can't come to hand to finesse spades enough without severing his club communications|pg||
nt|athene: so only 11 tricks i guess|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  690 in the other room, tables are not linked|pg||
nt|athene: west not covering the @C10 didn't make any difference, amusingly - declarer could take four clubs but not four spades, only leading once from hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzye: I'm sorry due to circumstances I missed the play|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: i guess declarer might have refused the club finesse second time|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: and you have no more entries to hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S looks ok, and then i suppose west swings the axe, does he?|pg||
nt|thomsen: i would double with west hand for sure. and i think he will if meyuhas bids 2spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you are supposed to have an opening bid to overcall over a pre-empt but still i would think many would go 2@S with south|pg||
nt|athene: it's not that far short of a 1@S opener|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|dburn: just as well he didn't - even at favourable vulnerability 2@s would be expensive|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT going to make|pg||

nt|stc: but before it have been worked, ending with say 2 @c in dummy and Q10@s in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov was thinking about playing east for one spade more and one @D less|pg||
nt|andreasw:  http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: the official tournament site is www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our other four matches today will be England-Poland, Israel-Czech Republic, Norway-Bugaria and Sweden-Finland|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we all open E hand  I vote yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think results will be on www.bridge.nl|pg||
nt|kingcur: as always well maintained by Rosaline Barendregt and a few others|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 11H |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played for the first hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: well played by Kopecky, may be too fast for some of us :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you must connect both rooms, operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: welcome back, everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north claims that he bid as if there had been no 1nt and after 1@C-2@D = hearts 2nt they have a system. south bid system off (=natural)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to endplay n on that line.|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear 1@H|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS opening transfer preempts on 2nd level, too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: certainly a high standard of card play there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H = 8-11 with 6c. or 9-14 with 5@S+5m|pg||
mb|2H|nt|golfsquash: worth 3@s|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diese mBoard könnten Nord/Süd schnell mal zu hoch geraten|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that was a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: then he would need to play a heart from dummy forcing east to ruff|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning all|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s -1 by EW ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier to concede a @d early. 2 3 4 1.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky is not very happy with this bid :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: first option is 8-11 with 6 clubs? or 6 cards?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|400 volt: 4@C bei Nord/Süd und 3@S bei Ost/West ist das Limit|pg||
nt|stc: was für NT spielen sie ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 12-14 beide|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir spielt sogar 11-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@s promises 5, but 1@h only promises 4 in e/w system (swiss acol)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW used to play a modification of NS Baltic club but they found out it was too complicated, so they switched to some easier system at the beginning of the year|pg||
nt|frankaus: i value it a 15 count|pg||
nt|kingcur: agree: if you open light, it's important to have a good suit, and this @H suit qualifies for that|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sorry, 6@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will be more happy now :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: NS is saved, is there an option to get to 3NT by EW side?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: yes probably -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ³adnie przepuci³ kiera Robertson, |pg||
nt|tomi2: ISR leading, CZE 2nd. the teams have been put in four grops of 6, playin a compleate round robin today and will go on in a swiss movement tomorrow and the day after|pg||
mb|3H|nt|400 volt: Yes, 3 NT can be made by N/S, but east/west will bid 4@S everytime|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky hat geschrieben "2@s gute hebung"... wundert mich etwas...|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D ist eigentlich relativ natürlich im System von Ost-West. Der einzige Grund für das Alertieren kann sein, dass West auch mit 5er @C und 4er @D 1@D häufig eröffnet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hab ich mir schon fast gedacht, dass er hier mit kontra in die reizung einsteigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: thats the problem with playing artifical methods - you need detailed agreements or some really good working meta-agreements in competition|pg||
nt|stc: I even think that with more free places in E the crossruff line was a bit better|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Good fireworks here|pg||
nt|stc: anyway good start for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Alex said in the end that he should have played the cross ruff. but that needed to start in trick 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: summary of Slawinsky leads in Supplementary Notes of Fantoni-Nunes Convention Card  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBra...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|stc: cards are friendly for NS, EW can't go plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt opening would be 11-13, so this rebid shows 14+|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: players produced so many big swings that they all speed up playing for overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or book that introduced the method   http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south passed and explained to west "I have a clear pass on 2@S but I was thinking because I was not sure if thats natural"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|400 volt: Ja, 3SA können von Nord/Süd erfüllt werden, aber Ost/West gehen immer auf 4er-Stufe|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich glaube nicht, dass 3SA von Ost irgendwelche Probleme bereitet. Sogar 5@D geht. Mal schauen, ob Ost/West sie erreichen|pg||
nt|sastro: mit 6-4 bevorzuge ich zuerst die Wiederholung der 6er-Länge|pg||
nt|stc: keine gute Idee von N|pg||
nt|stc: aber 2@h ist nicht soo schlecht|pg||
nt|dimi: @s K @h Q and 2 @c tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hard to guess the singleton king.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW are very slow players and are in danger of beeing to late every segment|pg||
nt|stc: NS must just cash their tricks before the 5th @d is played|pg||
nt|stc: in other words S must play @c when in hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: novay min 4 me |pg||
nt|frankaus: no way |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: results are at www.nbbportal.nl/1003, then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|kingcur: but with two aces and a decent 2nd suit, this is not even a light opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but nothing will bother it|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Auch 5@C kann man schnell mal im Gegenspiel schenken, von daher ist 5@S sicherlich ein akzeptables Gebot|pg||
nt|400 volt: jetzt hat sich Udo Kasimir etwas zu hoch gewagt - die Hand steht aber auch schlecht für ihn|pg||
nt|400 volt: Der Gegner hat @S KB8x UND der @C-Schnitt sitzt nicht|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben got a 10 imp penalty for slow play|pg||
nt|stc: better now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer may simply pull trumps from the top|pg||
nt|stc: not very likely but possible of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ducking that was risky, vuln south could hold 8 hearts and noting outside|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S now game try $ me|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems it is, now how to make it :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tomi2: can insert the king and unblock an honor in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: club lead might break the communication. Declarer has to play his suits from his hand which is not good for him in this board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be difficult to defeat...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to get entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry, i mean in 2nd club trick  finesse the 9|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: defence has to put Declarer once on the table with A of @H and another possible entry is @C8, but not easy to find it.|pg||
nt|tomi2: and later overtake the honor, in case michal forgot to insert the 9. south would do well to switch to a small dia when he wins a spade trick, that would denatly cut the ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: communication|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, declarer can play his @S from his hand, establishing 2@S tricks, 4@C, 1@H and 2 @D which makes a total of 9 = just made|pg||
nt|tomi2: cant NS open the hearts in time then, to score 2@S and 3@H?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: timing is important now|pg||
nt|tomi2: they seem to block because they need to finesse dummy's 10|pg||
pc|c7|nt|400 volt: Nord hat nur 6 Figurenpunkte, aber mit einem sicheren 9-Karten-Fit und einer guten Verteilung ist das 3@S nicht völlig unverständlich|pg||
nt|runnerup:  time for 800?|pg||
nt|stc: 5 obvious losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what 1@S asked/showed   but it allowed North any easy bid  [versus something like immediate 3@C]|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@S denied 4 spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|400 volt: hier kostet es 500 - aber gegen mögliche 400 beim Gegner kein allzu großer Verlust|pg||
nt|runnerup:  is south worth 3 @s -with 8 points and 7xxx in @s maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  other room stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: a decent save|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the club finesse is best therefore it seems..|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Good morning all|pg||
nt|stc: wieso hat W @d entdeckt ?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns never mensioned -the suit they make a slam (lucly ofcause ) @s|pg||
nt|stc: clap-clap|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even though east is a substitute it seems they have control over their system:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure how many of his regular agreements vd Bos has agreed with Tim Verbeek but this looks like a relay sequence he used with v Lankveld as well: they play a fairly natural ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: system, but with loads of gadgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: gf relay quite standard among dutch juniors|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H the limit of the hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: the 4-4 fit often plays better, but here we see @s's split 4-1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke mal 2@s zeigt schon 5-4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzzx: schlechte stimmung bei den senioren, kratz/sträter sind mit der spielgeschwindigkeit ihrer gegner nicht glücklich|pg||
nt|400 volt: Gegen wen spielen die beiden denn?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich glaub der eine ist yves mucha|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe some side effect, that explains the imo poor level of bridge here besides the tight schedule was last night... it was Alexander Smirnovs 30th birthday and most of the players ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: were at the bar (too?) long|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he had bought champagne for all :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andreasw:  4@s could have problems although it should make|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C probably does that too :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S seems playable|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C K protected|pg||
nt|kingcur: and W declaring 4@S seems like the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d lead looks best to me? altough North might get creative and lead a small @c here|pg||
nt|tomi2: N could insert the 9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|stc: sry, Ich dachte an einer 1NT Opening !|pg||
nt|tomi2: to prevent this|pg||
pc|s3|nt|runnerup:  level -to be honist must admid has been a dissopointment but colorful boards and happenings|pg||

nt|athene: i am betting the 2@H was just entered wrong|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|athene: i wonder if they have a firm agreement about 3@H here - in my experience people bid this thinking it is a cue for clubs but their partner thinks it is natural (or semi-natural) ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north thinks he wants a diamond lead? - i guess sometimes that could be necessary|pg||
nt|athene: when the ace is in dummy and declarer needs to set up spades for a diamond pitch|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: someone told me that 7222 distribution is very close to 6322 which is very close to 5332 which is almost 4333. With that hand, you will bid 3NT immediately, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2nt is positive with fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: first pass, let your pd double and then bid: hence the name|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably would have gone down in 6, losing the @sJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: i even alert my 1nt opening as "may include 7 card suits"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East shows clubs, but there is a nasty duplication in hearts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: 6@D   be honest now -- how many people thought about THAT bid??|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W has bad values for slam even he has a maximum hand in HCP so he shouldnt go for a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: kleine swings für Jokisch|pg||
nt|stc: kann spanend sein|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: interesting auction|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s guess needed -restricted choice if you happened to start from rigth hand |pg||
nt|stc: now 170 EW :)|pg||
nt|stc: of course splits are very bad and even 5 @c is not so easy, 3NT lokks OK|pg||
nt|stc: 9 easy tricks, some endplay with N for ten ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe NS need to lead spades, though|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: as I have written before, inviting slam with 7222 needs a lot of HCP and especially a lot of controls.|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: W should bid 4NT now to be able to stop|pg||
mb|4H|nt|luffe12:  the law!!|pg||
nt|dimi: but if you only see the EW hands 6@c would be the best contract|pg||
nt|stc: sure, W must be disapointed now but happy later|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can make 5nt double-dummy with the @hKJ- but that's not a likely result at the table.|pg||
nt|stc: DD you can paerhaps even make 6@c guessing @Hs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but west will likely bid 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: lead directing, implying a heart fit on passed hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: instill doubt in East  in case grand slam is possible|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well judged...|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: found about missing @S cue. But wrong contract and 2 imps on 8 board match might be crutial|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: rohowsky seems totaly unsure what is going on but from west questiones he can imagine clubs splitting not so well. unfortunatly for he would be dummy. screens in use, so north and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south do not know who was thinking when|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Probably intended as an entry for the @c finesse, the @hJ dropping changes the line.  He did that just to spite my prediction...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer will give a @c and then has an entry to the @h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dimi: Joe, declarer might heard your plan for 11 tricks :) |pg||

nt|frankaus: 11000 in the bank would be nice |pg||
nt|kingcur: I'd say EW made the correct decision here, so well done for this occasional partnership|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems the bidding will go 1@C-1@S-1NT-3NT if EW will pass all the time|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 4@C bid also made the club slam beeing played from the wrong site in case partner has some kx holdng in spades and potential discards in another. maybe a jump to 4nt after 2nd ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be right. partner could pass on a "bad" hand or convert to 5 or 6 clubs on a better one|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: agree with Thomas|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@C from S will shown 11+ unbal with @C, 18-20 bal, or 21+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: west claiming he would have doubled if he got some better information about the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: this smells like slam, maybe a grand|pg||
nt|frankaus: another 5 level excursion to a loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: this will end up in 4@S EW, potentially very fast|pg||
mb|1C|nt|golfsquash: could bid 4@c if not too strong in his methods|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@H sieht eigentlich recht gut aus - aber gegen @H 5-0 und @D AJ hinter KD sieht es nicht erfüllbar aus|pg||
nt|glen: classic question - red, in 2nd seat, the N hand does not fit a weak two, but does it anyways|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Grand on a @d guess|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@D probably some good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: as this E hand seems a little heavy for current tandards for bidding 1mi-4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: standards*|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: vdBos-Verbeek also play strong jump shifts, so 2@s would have been GF 5+@s with more outside values|pg||
mb|1D|nt|400 volt: 2@D zeigt einen zweifärber mit @S und einer zweiten farbe, @H oder @C|pg||
nt|sastro: Kontra heisst iA : Ich kann eine mögliche Farbe des Gegners kontrieren- sehe ich hier nicht|pg||
nt|400 volt: entweder unter Eröffnungsstärke oder eine starke Hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kontra wurde schlicht als "punkte" erklärt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@s könnte sogar gehen... spannend|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C?|pg||
nt|glen: the reason for not opening - poor playing value, the reason for opening, hey, i would have opened it in 1st or 3rd seats|pg||
mb|d|nt|golfsquash: I like 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@c is nat or 15+ balanced|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: south and west seem to thinkk north has hearts!|pg||
nt|dimi: 7 will probably go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: nice opening by E, makes it more difficult to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but EW do not keep quiet|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: magical 25 HCP slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch-kasimir have a quite unique system|pg||
nt|stc: This result may be anything, push or swing in any direction !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@D overcall shows 10+, solid hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|runnerup:  ew can make 5 @h but can be many down if different sits |pg||
nt|frankaus: this auction right sided the contract now @D lead gives up a trick|pg||
nt|kingcur: the danger with transfer-agreements always being that it allows your opponents a double to indicate values in that suit and enter the bidding at lesser risk|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3@C asking for stopper will get NS there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, he sure has that|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: could have tried 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch hatte erklärt dass 2@d in dieser geflage eröffnungsstärke zeigt|pg||
nt|xenya: S can hardly make a move now -- has to take it like a man|pg||
nt|luffe12:  11 from the top - 12th from at possible double squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: bright an early in Washington DC |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west explained 2@D as if 1@H = hearts would have been bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south to west: 1@H is natural|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north would perhaps be declarer in 4 @s (d?)  if he had bid a couple of @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now rohowsky remembers|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they agreed to treat the system as polish club and 1@H showed spades against non natural systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2 [5@DX-2] von Alvensleben playing 5@C South|pg||
nt|luffe12:  good "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|baldfriede: W may get into a squeeze when trying to protect Q@c. which is not the way to brin it down, bzt hard for W to know unless E shows it somehow|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but*|pg||
nt|kingcur: but here it worked out well, with @DK now protected|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky now regrets his 2@D bid :-) but he has to show the stopper|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben bei ansicht des dummys: "damit eröffnet ihr?!?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 24-26 but might be on a very nice 23, we are told|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 8 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: td was still at the table, he has not to be called :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  7 tricks seems sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can be 7+ with no 4-card major   or  7-11 wrong for 1N|pg||
nt|kingcur: and brining in a discard for a loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: getting 9 tricks shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
nt|luffe12:  3nt is easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: from souths point of view the lead must be a singleton|pg||
nt|luffe12:  would u X with the N hand or 3nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low from xx does NOT include  10x   that leads 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N way too much opposite balancing DBL|pg||
nt|xenya: down 2 for 500 -- but 3N NS is very very close -- 4@H might go down though|pg||
nt|tomi2: he has 3 card fit and two kings, nothing to regret|pg||
pc|c5|nt|golfsquash: and possibly another one in hearts|pg||
pc|c7|nt|golfsquash: cash 4 side suit tricks and claim|pg||
nt|xenya: there is an entry to dummy in @Ds, so...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir studies opponent's cc|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they lead 5/3|pg||
nt|xenya: whichever high heart will do here|pg||
nt|dimi: ok also 6NT is an easy make, probably loses only to the @d Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, but didn't clarify strength|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|luffe12:  S could be a little bit less i 4th seat but N have fine support all over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  2   looks like 5@C going down|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so close to "All Square"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west asking about the lead agreements again, south looked suprised expecting partner and not opp wil ruff this|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i was wondering -- on the surface, 5@C looked like a make, but there are pitfalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he did know SOMEONE was going to ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: first double explained "we mandatory double with spade shortnes and 7+hcp"|pg||
nt|stc: yes, DD you just give the K@c and score 5@s, 5@c and A@H in 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and 5@C on 2 did fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2nd double: "double on 2@S would be penalty, so I guess this one is penalty too"|pg||
nt|stc: I think that 500 here will by a swing for NS|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but they pl @dk to @dA and a @h|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so u are doomed, right?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  since u are looked in hand |pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: ew asking abut the auction|pg||
pc|d7|nt|golfsquash: 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|xenya: of course W could have @H9 or @HQ |pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i thought it was   example:  includes 18 hcp 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: it can be weak nt with 4 spades or 3 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|stc: in fact 6@c as spec noticed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or 4 spades and 5+ clubs any strength that survives a pass from partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or 5+ spades, 18+ hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: WOW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = not 4@H, a) 11+, 3/4@S  b) 18-19, 5@S  c) 11-20, 5@C & 4@S|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: N: I should have shown the fit, you would be declarer in 7@D and you get it right then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: angry discussions in both partnerships|pg||
nt|stc: very unlikely ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room bidding 35 now|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: well bid by all, especially E 1@C opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: NV, EW will compete heavily I expect|pg||
nt|frankaus: really interesting hands - did they feed the dealing machine red meat?|pg||
nt|kingcur: and there they are|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 5@dx -5 won 7 imps for red|pg||
nt|kingcur: same final contract on  3 in open room, but only 4 off there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|400 volt: ungewöhnlich, dass man eine 5er-länge gegen die 1SA-eröffnung gegenreizt|pg||
nt|400 volt: meine Wahl wäre hier Kontra gegen den 12-14 SA|pg||
nt|sastro: sieht für Alvensleben stark danach aus , dass Partner ebenfalls die Coeur hält|pg||
nt|santyclz: I seem to recall an old column by Reese in which he was faced with a 2-way finesse.  He solved the problem by leading the J of a suit in which he held the Q and observing LHO's ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: reaction.  He then led the suit in which he didn't have the Q and noticing a slight difference in the reaction finessed LHO for the Q.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|400 volt: gut, dass West Kontra als pass/correct zur Verfügung hat, so wird der @S-Fit gefunden|pg||
nt|400 volt: mal schauen, ob man 4@S findet|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jetzt kann ost evtl 3@s reizen?|pg||
nt|sastro: kontra zeigt Hand mit Bereitschaft in Pik. Hat Partner Coeurs soll er drin bleiben|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i could have been drunk this very wednesday on that account :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: understandably, gotard not happy to open 1@d, so 1nt the practical choice|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s 4-1 ,@h finess of -so probÃ¶ems in 4 @s|pg||
nt|runnerup:  problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: actually they have discussed their system in that sequence 20 minutes ago, hope both remember|pg||
nt|dimi: NS can make 2 @c, EW can make 2-3 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: we had some similar problem yesterday, when one player complained his oponent took some short time to follow a single honor|pg||
nt|stc: yes, the winner must play better in the euros|pg||
nt|kingcur: 5@C a make for NS here, and they may bid it too|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S showing an opening hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2 d is transfer to hearts|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|400 volt: 3@D wird vermutlich eine Werte in @D zeigen mit einer guten Hand|pg||
nt|400 volt: (und natürlich die @S), da 3@C einen guten @H-Fit bestätigt|pg||
nt|sastro: ein gutes taktisches Gebot von Kasimir, das den C-Fit verdeckt|pg||
nt|400 volt: das ist für West natürlich ein Traumgebot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch erklärt dass ohne zwischenreizung 3@c jetzt maximum, 4er @c und kleines double in @c gezeigt hätte|pg||
nt|runnerup:  wd -now ew makes 9 in @s and ns 10 in @c |pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to defend with the N hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pachnie szlemikiem|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: gives N a better raise by 2@H, but still too weak for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: e/w playing some funny defense where they pass some strong hands... perhaps west regrets that now|pg||
nt|santyclz: My partner and I used to have on our convention cards: "Opening leader's partner always hesitates at trick 1, even with a singleton."  |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: sehr diszipliniertes pass von rohowsky|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks in @h on a sqz @s/@c against N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drury|pg||
nt|kingcur: doubling 4@H showing interest to bid on, I expect|pg||
pc|d6|nt|golfsquash: Looks like this will just about get home|pg||
nt|golfsquash: this knocks out an entry but should be ok for 8 tricks, play on spades first|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably not|pg||
pc|dA|nt|luffe12:  i booked 4 X !7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time east had 17 -did west know that? -i douth|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzzx: seems to have reached a normal contract though... unlike the other room!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = nat or 4-fit 10-11 hcp  or  3-fit one round force|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and a little respite for the Scots|pg||
nt|sastro: warom nicht Treff Dame ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: He could have opened 1@C and repeated 2@C, showing 15+ with 5+ @C|pg||
nt|luffe12:  @d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: dont know how that works but 2@C was explained as drury or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: as i mentioned earlier NL white is a team with quite unexperienced players. this is their first international tournament|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzzx: ah yes, right|pg||
nt|sybarra: this wont work out well,  @D's not behaving |pg||
nt|luffe12:  no chance whatsoever|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: oops|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dimi: Wagner needs 2 entries into the W hand to double finess in @h first to the 9 later to the J|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: drury OR nat??|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not a transfer to 1NT|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|golfsquash: could have tried @s10 at trick 1 but didn't really matter|pg||
nt|golfsquash: no, ignore that|pg||
nt|golfsquash: good duck, keep control|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: aeh 4er @h meinte ich|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben fragt nach @c9, antwort zeigt länge|pg||
nt|luffe12:  declarer should run the clubs immediately and hope for a miracle|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|stc: nice result from OR, wow !|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|frankaus: just -2 |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|dimi: ok no finesse :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 10 tricks could have been made from double dummy, but Schanka playes safe, trying to postpone the @H guess|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dimi: know he might go down, @c to N and a @s back|pg||
nt|dimi: now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: hmmm |pg||
nt|luffe12:  careful now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|uni_cicam: honors should be clear now, W will probably not bid 2D with onle @CK and @HQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: looks like EW's defence against NS's 1@C roughly comes down to this: you pass with a balanced hand, no matter how strong, but bid on an unbalanced hand, no matter how weak |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sastro: hätte er klein zugegeben, hätte er seinen König wohl immer nch gemacht, weil AS das falsch raten würde|pg||
nt|kingcur: with x@D lead, 5@C should be played with care btw to not lose a ruff to E|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|400 volt: Gromöller is not sure how the @H distribution is - but he seems to be sure not to give the trick away when he plays a @S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 4@s costs 500|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  35  Fritsche-Rohowsky stop in 5@H   but Gunther still has chance to bid 5@S |pg||
pc|h2|nt|400 volt: still has the important @D J - if Gotard had 9 tricks, he would hav etaken them|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: when west bid stayman his plan was for his partner to bid 2@H, i think|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4 flat boards in row|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|xenya: something you might do when bidding against a genuine stron 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i think any bid shows either the next suit or the two above|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  declarer did not apply Rabbi's Rule  [when king is singleton, play the ace]  so 4@D down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still 3 imps to tie the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final contract  5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we'll never know if Piek 6@S good or bad   but it doesn't lose a lot against the game|pg||
nt|kingcur: so two off a good result for NS if the other room makes 5@C|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s here seems normal?|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW, sorry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  results to date are http://www.camrosebridge.com/|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  currently England are in the lead with 134, Scotland are second with 121, Wales are third with 114|pg||
nt|cc469: on the last board, S is the hand that essentially makes slam a possibility - I think N's rebid of 4@H opposite the announced singleton with his p was quite proper but S should bid ...|pg||
nt|cc469: 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: weak 6/7 clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The SBU has 97 Ireland 91 and Northern Ireland 71|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only bad if Khanukov was going down in 6@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|luffe12:  but 5 x @c from the start could have made life a bit more difficult for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: here we see the weak nt version of the polish 1@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|golfsquash: the 4/4 fit may be better than the 5/4 fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hm sollte das ein alert sein? bin mir unsicher|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1sa zeigt 4er @s und 5er UF|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e.g. 1@d would have shown @h or @s+@c|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can make 3nt here -but hardly will be bidden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with only 42 boards to play|pg||
nt|dimi: @s from S was a bad  card|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he did not read parners signal in clubs as encouraging|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north did not want to overtake in case the lead was from Tx he said|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and he reminded partner of the low spotcards in dummy|pg||
nt|stc: not a lot, just 3 IMP|pg||
nt|stc: or 4 if only 5 made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5+@S   [Kaplan Inversion]   so why 2@S???|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west said he was thinking about bidding 6nt or even 7 because he expected 6@D to be void and he had aj... so he planed on some finesse |pg||
nt|kingcur: S bidding his 2-suiter...looks like Michaels, is that correct, Dennis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@h to play here, with INV+ van den Bos can make a cuebid|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: this does not seem as a openning hand to me Thomas :-)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|400 volt: 10-16 punkte|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: may not need the club guess playing in hearts with a club going on the long spade|pg||
nt|cc469: ... with controls in both side suits and a 5th @H to boot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sicherlich nicht die antwort die rohowsky befürchtet hat|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c starts relays|pg||
nt|stc: EW on the way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: according to the system, he could bid 2@S to show 54 with minor|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H is a better raise to @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: you mean 1@D by east?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales needs to regroup after the loss to England - tough for Goodman-Pownall who played both sets in that match|pg||
nt|400 volt: der Trend geht allgemein dazu, Kontra als Stärkekontra erst ab 18 Punkten zu spielen, für Rohowsky aber offensichtlich nicht :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. kann in dieser sequenz auch 4@d5@c haben|pg||
nt|sastro: polnisch - 8-15  4er Pik und längere Minore|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: no, sorry, overcall by S, should be an openning hand as in previous board|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzzx: 3nt shows 14-16, 55xx|pg||
nt|stc: the trailing team recovered almost all, now a very close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so a slight upgrade but i think the hand is surely worth it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir can now bid 4@h rkcb or 4@d to sign off in 4@h i believe|pg||
nt|tomi2: did 2@H show hearts? or do they play some sort of transfers.  would find kjx in spades and some ruffing avalues the most important thing to show in this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: oh maybe 4@s is rkcb for @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: I hate the leads from  4333's  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Slavinski leads for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fritsche played @H for no loser so made overtrick in 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: saves an imp|pg||
nt|stc: this IS FAIRPLAY from Smirnov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and implies 6@H would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in our room|pg||
nt|stc: in fact he expect AQ @s in W !|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: This is the par contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: low = odd count with honor or even without|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: NS play the cuebid as other Major + @d |pg||
nt|kingcur: 10 imps away for NL white on  4, when they didnt reach a rather obvious 4@S vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in Holland many top pairs play Michaels with known suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so partner can judge better if bidding gets high quickly|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, 2@H shows 3@S fit and 8-10 HCP|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jaapfr: will they reach 6@D?|pg||
nt|kingcur: and with his hand, N will not care too much what South's minor will be|pg||
mb|p|nt|sastro: meine Wahl wäre forcierende 2 Karo|pg||
nt|stc: 6@h is a complex contract(easy in DD)|pg||
nt|glen: well at least picking the "longest and strongest" from 4333 is easy|pg||
nt|glen: here though a @D lead would help declarer|pg||
nt|glen: (how to make 3 tricks with ATx opposite Q8x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = one round force|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: fritsche freut sich, endlich mal einen unkontrierten kontrakt spielen zu dürfen|pg||
nt|runnerup:  needs some guesses to make  |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: shame it is going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: seems they have some science in action here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|golfsquash: so much for the theory in the Majors|pg||
nt|sastro: der Ausspieler ist in 4 Farben geendspielt- wie soll er auf klein pik kommen|pg||
nt|luffe12:  he came off very well this time - but not much to do |pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: it's a good contract i think|pg||
nt|stc: in fact you discard @c on @d and must start @h in the good direction|pg||
nt|stc: of course it is|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N very awkward |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = 15+ HCP  5+@D|pg||
nt|dimi: nice|pg||
nt|stc: with friendly @s you could even make 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: looks like -2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: not laydown by any means but worth trying|pg||
nt|stc: the first @h is the key of the play|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  system notes for Walsh-O'Gorman http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/WalshOGorman.pdf|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in board 4 east was in 5 @h xx -and played it -1 ..so bad day it can be -1600 or so -and a good day if you play for it +1600 ,now 400 out|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: i do not believe they will bid 7@D:) but mb wrong|pg||
nt|luffe12:  smoth duck i @d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: any clue here as how to play trumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: some misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|stc: and now samll @d from W, wd|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|golfsquash: amazing result at the other table|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: DEclarer has to establish @C tricks soon, otherwise he will loose control because of bad @S break|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sastro: Karo war noch das beste, weil es die Kommunikation angreift|pg||
nt|dimi: if he tries to finesse in @d even 1NT is down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: closest to your finger :)|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  heard an interesting analysis last weekend |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Smirnov explained 1NT as " I may pass with 12"|pg||
nt|luffe12:  as it is, 3nt still ok|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he must have smelled a rat|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he saw the bidding|pg||
nt|dimi: probably :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that's why he smelled it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 1@D = any negative or natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: he already saw @CQ and knew west failed to bid positive holding at least one major|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to Rory Timlin|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|400 volt: das sieht nach einem Überstich aus|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|400 volt: auf den hohen @C J (nach @C zur 9) kann Fritsche den @S-Verlierer abwerfen|pg||

pc|s5|nt|golfsquash: Hi Julian|pg||

nt|luffe12:  still some avoidance work to be done|pg||
nt|luffe12:  low|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  4  [3@SX-2]  Rehder playing 2@S undoubled|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 38 boards   218 imps    WOW|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|xenya: well it's not over yet, but as the cards lie declarer can hardly go wrong|pg||

nt|kingcur: N will lose two trump tricks but will hardly go wrong on the D's, making dummy high|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed|pg||

nt|stc: and next slam hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: anyway this is not really the way to make up a 45 imp deficit|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: PO Sundelin here as kibitzer at the table. He's captain of the Swedish team|pg||
nt|kingcur: so far, at least a game on on every board|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome PO|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: whispering jokes in Tim's ears|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: @C to the 10 in the second trock will win the contract, but hard to see |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: comlicated hand, but it seems declarer had a chance playing side suits first|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: score for board 4 has been adjusted to 4 hearts =|pg||
nt|runnerup:  looks like 3 @h ns --1@c -2 @s -p-p-x-p 3 @h --- to me here --makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: td trusts west that he would have raised hearts and east would have raised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lee trevino:  the more i practice, the luckier i get|pg||
nt|luffe12:  running rate is 6imps - !!|pg||
nt|dimi: i thought this is the slow table ... they play like Speedy Gonzales|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzzx: for both pairs 1@D promises long @D and an unbal hand. they open 1@C with most balanced outside their nt range|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: sry, take it back, only for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: and both other pairs from the von alvensleben team|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Fritsche is usually a fast player|pg||
nt|santyclz: Slawinski leads are sometimes called "combined leads".  A brief overview may be found at:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/SGlossary/GlossS.html|pg||
nt|dimi: yes he is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S will go down in other room too|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this one no game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 5+suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dla W nie zabrzmia³ mi³o ta odzywka|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: troche dziwne ze Igor nie otowrzyl 11 PC w 43 w starszych ale szczesliwie chyba|pg||
mb|2H|nt|golfsquash: That will be a surprise gain for E/W, seeing that 4h was making|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: witaj Jacku|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Igor sied cicho|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: here we see how they bid with some points and majors, thats why they could not have the king in the previous board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh someone still plays sandwich nt as 2-suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chyba te 2pik to by³ blok s¹dz¹c po pasie W|pg||

mb|2N|nt|stc: very good in played by S, which would be the case|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1!N?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzzx: 2@h zeigt, wenn ich mich recht entsinne, ein w2 in @s oder eine starke hand mit @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: hard not to bid on with such a nice shapely hand in north|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: south: nowadays splinter shows 3 card fit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north "what else cani do"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south: lead of the ten?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west: single, Tx or HTx|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north: "probably single"|pg||
nt|luffe12:  strong values and lack of space: I like 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south: "yes, because I have the honors it looks like"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east:"oh thats nice"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right since 2@S would be non-force the only other choice was  DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: EW open 12-14 bal 1NT so the rebid shows the strong NT|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@h apparently shows 4@s too|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: it was not alerted...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: maybe they dont want to investigate the fit after the double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW actually list this treatment on their convention card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all CCs zipped up and available under  http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/2343|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: auch dieses Vollspiel ist relativ normal - bei dem Trumpfstand in @S ist aber das Vollspiel in 3SA deutlich besser|pg||
nt|400 volt: Thomas Gotard jun. denkt auch darüber nach, ob er 3SA oder 4@S reizen soll|pg||
nt|glen: a typical hand that shows why partnership have a variety of raises for S hand, to help N make decisions if bidding gets high fast|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this 4@H C will only be a push i assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@c is 20-21 or any gf|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder's pass asks for a spade lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: theoretically it can be even 4@H-1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt is easier here than 4@H|pg||
nt|kingcur: N may have shown an unbalanced hand with 1S...then S should maybe convert to 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  is the X for penalty here - dont think so|pg||
nt|luffe12:  is disagree in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is "make the right decision pard" kind of X |pg||
nt|glen: some play X is penalty, some X is two-way values, some X as I want to bid 5@H but you decide|pg||
pc|d3|nt|golfsquash: 1NT 15-17 and will accept the invitation|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: easy 3NT here, time to get some drinks :-)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|400 volt: das war die richtige Wahl|pg||
nt|stc: you need A@c on side and if not @d finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: south has shown 14-16 with 1642 or 0643 shape|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s still some chance ..but others -with best defence hopeless --like this |pg||
nt|dimi: no X no trouble|pg||
nt|stc: something looks wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they do play 1@C-2@H 4-7hcp|pg||
nt|stc: Obviously w doesn't know about 4@s in E|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west took 2@H as 8-10 then|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, that's pretty obvious now|pg||
nt|dimi: yes that seems to be the explanation|pg||
pc|d7|nt|golfsquash: This is very thin|pg||
nt|golfsquash: west playing east for a better hand for change of suit after double|pg||
nt|sastro: das Single Karo ist fotographiert- da bietet sich 3 SA schon an|pg||
nt|sastro: 6 C ist ein ordentlicher Kontrakt, wird aber vorrausichtlich fallen, weil die Odds für Karoschnitt sprechen|pg||
nt|glen: best for N is to X first, then find out result, the claim X was a certain type of X|pg||
nt|luffe12:  5 looser hand by distribution - bid one more time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: that's a good tip glen, i'll keep it in mind :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i assume that NS use some kind of constructive major raises|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very tough to bid|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s was not good, 3NT is a disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: west looks at the dummy and is kind of shoked, he obviously expected more :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: "pfff"|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes the diamond 10 at trcick one gets declarer 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|golfsquash: 9 cold|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i hate to caught with only 3-card support, when supposed to have 4 - but the N hand is just 6 loosers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually, i think 3@S would show 5+@S and @H fit, but agree key feature is short @D rather than long @S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  anybody familiar with Ron Klingers ideas on the rules of Loosers Count|pg||
nt|stc: trump looks best now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cc469: yes, he must ensure he is left with an entry in dummy to @Ds when that suit is established|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: jokisch hat 4-7 mit @h fit gezeigt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4@d should be the end signal to sign off|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: trochê nieprzyjemn¹ ma sytuacjê Igor|pg||

nt|k_u_b_a: A@c *|pg||
pc|hA|nt|luffe12:  bergen raises would lead to 5@h i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: best you make sure you know what you are playing over interference|pg||
nt|luffe12:  S would bid 3@c rather than 2@h - promising 4card support|pg||
nt|glen: its a question whether to use a bergen raise on not: 4 trumps good, but quacks (queens/jacks) not good for playing the hand in a suit contract|pg||
nt|luffe12:  i fully support that - |pg||
nt|sybarra: it is only an 8 count of quacks, 3 @H was also a possibility  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: EW play standard signals|pg||
nt|frankaus: not clear but gr8 switch|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: kasimir glaubt sogar 6-7 ... 4@h hätte minimum gezeigt|pg||
nt|runnerup:  7 in nt -or slipping defence|pg||
nt|luffe12:  RON KLINGER: GUIDE TO BETTER BRIDGE awesome|pg||
pc|h4|nt|400 volt: In Board 4 hat Martin Rehder 4@H sehr gut gespielt - 9 verdiente IMPs|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead of a small club would probably beat 6@H but it's not easy to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: anyway or bid and made 6@h so von alvensleben team will reassert the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  noreal chance here |pg||
nt|kingcur: I am just informed that my co-commentator's mother is a woman I played bridge with in Sopot, Poland in the mid 80's. That's kind of cute, isn't it, andreas? :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sastro: schwierige Entscheidung, was man am Tisch auf die nächsten Karorunden abwerfen soll|pg||
nt|stc: not very convincing sequence, missing a good slam and 12 IMP|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but knowing prd to have xxxx might change the N approach|pg||
nt|stc: A pair in control of the system may stretch to 3@s and play there|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|stc: wd, 4@s was a good save|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzzx: south has a really nice 14-16 one must say|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stc: and here you can't score the 150 for 4 Aces|pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room found the reasonable 6@c on board 19, but didn't find a line to make it with the bad @c bread.  13 imps.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (break)|pg||
nt|stc: here the defense may make 3NT but for only 500|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: that way pard knows I have 4 @H's  |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: the deadly lead which W asked for by passing 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is good position for the trailing team|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sastro: besser wäre ein schnelles Ducken|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: in the other room, a trump was led against 6@H|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so 6NT came in on  20|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after orth chose to open 1@d, schüller was undissuadable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can't imagine other table finding the 4@S save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also   too tired to figure out how bad 4@SX really scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: toilet break for west, its his 3rd during the match already|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i mean this segment...|pg||
nt|stc: 200 I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he have an escort?|pg||
nt|stc: they can ruff @d or open @c, both for 4 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if defense nothing wrong they can collect in each suit 1 trick|pg||
nt|stc: but 10 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|dA|nt|golfsquash: at Pairs, he might have tried a second spade|pg||
nt|dimi: good contract bad distribution, no justice in the world|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cc469: I don't think he should have ducked first @S because @HK continuation could have proved embarrassing ...|pg||
nt|golfsquash: no strip squeeze this time|pg||
nt|xenya: 11|pg||
nt|frankaus: now gets out 4 -1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :) i think it is more amazing that she remembers something so long ago lol|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzzx: east angry he did not play club to the 7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in this case even to make your opponents tierd doen't help -so |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but north could have inserted the 9 to prevent this|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: lol|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jako to ob³o¿¹, ¿eby tylko nasi nie doszli do 5 karo na drugim stole|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: Hmmm, "bread"... My inner self must be telling me it's time for breakfast.|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps one more @c trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: both players tried to play low dia spots to show partner values in clubs. N intentionaly blocked the suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know n-s's leading methods, but it seems that the 1 card you can't hold to lead the @c9 is the @c10.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but now W tries to gut north of his dias|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: if north rose @HK he had discards|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: it was still not trivial as he could have been getting forced, and there are two clubs to knock out|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: now south blackwoods over 4@S and ends in 6|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if he is thinking about 6nt as well - it might be better if partner has weak spades and more in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: you could have two spade losers but still twelve notrump winners|pg||
nt|ntmon: the best will be to squezze out the NT bid from North somehow|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: it would be hard to blackwood and THEN use 5nt pick a slam though|pg||
nt|athene: as 5nt would sound like king ask after blackwood|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|athene: i have to say i would have simply bid blackwood over 4@S and then bid the appropriate number of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzye: Padon smiling|pg||
nt|athene: (7 if he has @SAK @DA)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|athene: if south is thinking here that means they are not on firm ground, systemically|pg||

nt|jaapfr: what a freak here|pg||
nt|luffe12:  looking at running rate = 6 imps it does'nt matter too much, but why did E disc a @c|pg||
nt|dimi: ... he punished his partner|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like a "tilt" play.|pg||

nt|dimi: no|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 600 was really expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: wanted to correct him self but it was clear change of mind, he thougt dummys discard is irrelevant, after a short break while Fritsche was claiming he saw what he missed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@h the game to be in here|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@H looking like a good spot here, 3NT less so on a @C lead|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: w 15 grulica WJ-ta - odwrotka wpêdzi³a w  szlemika|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: now we will see some action :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well south has a good hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: and some conplicated contracts, seems all suits are breaking porely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but 6 spades likely it seems|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 6@S or NT should easy to reach with 35 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: 1nt=11-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rather maximum for that i think :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  6@s is laydown|pg||
nt|stc: Par is 4@dX -1 by EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|luffe12:  110!|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: last board for the Open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: of course if you play slam on the same defense, the @d finesse is much better than the sqz, and you go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in fact the first imps for von alvensleben this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminded it was a full book   Ron Klinger "The Modern Losing Trick Count" Modern Bridge Series|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2 over 1 GF|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: still counting points :D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sastro: 4er-C Unterstützung und double Treff können einen schon etwas optimistisch stimmen|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: i think you all know what 2@c is by now ;)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@C asks if 11-13 really has 14?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so 6@h is more friendly for the specs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = inverted, one round forcing raise, not 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  seems well judged by S: I will have a second chance, to show strong playing values|pg||
nt|stc: very interesting this one !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no, no escort, but he was quite fast and at least we are ahead of the other room, so those boards are not available anywhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this match seems to have theme of finding 5-3 fit that has 5-0 break|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: szlemik nie byl taki zly kiery po 2 - 2 lub trafiony A kier singlowy |pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: lub J / 10 |pg||
mb|2S|nt|tomi2: spade finesse not working, hearts are not coming in. 6n seems like the best spot, if you see you cant hold spades to 1 loser, you try the other suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  When X might be slightly weeaker, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|xenya: a raise by N now would be weak, but perhaps not as weak as this|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just a quick key card check|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@S shows min, can be still 5|pg||
nt|tomi2: this won't be quick, he needs to find a fit first|pg||
mb|3C|nt|400 volt: das 2@D-Gebot zeigt Fit in @H - entweder mit einer schwachen Hand oder Partieforcierend|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure they can get to 6 @S now |pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h shows either @c as 2nd suit or a 3352|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: W's jump to 3NT was reckless in my view - E might have minimum values and simply trying to protect the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: den kontrakt aus dem open room werden wir hier wohl nicht nochmal sehen|pg||
nt|sastro: so wie die Hand steht sind 3 SA das optimale. Aber wie soll man mit den unausgeglichenen Händen dort landen. Katastrophen sind hier vorprogrammiert|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h still makeable but now ???|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: 2@d slabe ze wzgledu na QJx @h 1!p imo zdecydowanie lepsze i ewnetulana x na wznowce |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w 16 znowu odwrotka w akcji|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: 1@s*|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cc469: 2NT I could find a case for but not 3|pg||
nt|400 volt: In diesem Fall die starke Variante - jetzt muss Nord @D-Ausspiel finden. Da Süd 2@D (künstlich) nicht kontriert hat, spricht das für ihn vielleicht gegen @D-ausspiel|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the @d7 presumably shows an odd length... and as we know both 1 and 3 are odd...|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 1Nt beatable|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: what now? 4NT would be quantitative only I guess|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south can bid 4 clubs ok|pg||

nt|vugraphzzx: west did not expect this beeing passed out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east forgot the system|pg||
nt|dimi: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the thought 2@C was pass/correct|pg||
nt|baldfriede: These are probably the seeds of mistrust from previous hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: playing 80 boards yesterday was hard, the night was short|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: as spec notices on same defense you should finesse the 10@c to make, yes|pg||
nt|stc: after a small @c lead would be different|pg||
nt|glen: W has tried his hardest to stay out of slam (opening 11-13 1NT with 14, not accepting slam try 4@D)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  top spot|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both sides|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT by W goes down on a @h lead but played by E has much better chances |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: all players discussing, south "lets play, it will not be down 6 times now, i am pretty sure"|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, nice bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good call|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: might be also a grand slamr try id N has a very good hand such as @S AKJxx and @D A|pg||
mb|6N|nt|400 volt: jetzt wird Rohowsky keine Probleme mit dem Kontrakt mehr bekommen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N gets a chance to trump a @H in dummy he has a chance to make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs W to play trump when in with @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you've watched NS play before   you KNEW Piek would bid 3@S|pg||
nt|luffe12:  thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: *3532|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzx: looks like they are going overboard here thanks to north opening his 8-count|pg||
nt|stc: loosing control|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: of course, north in the open room had it much easier after west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but i'm sure günther in his wildest dreams would not have thought of opening 1@h :)|pg||
nt|stc: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 2nd/4th   that means  from worthless doubleton lead LOW|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: teraz to juz szlemika powinni zagrac :) ale 4!t Andrzeja bardzo celne |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zgadzam siê z Tob¹ Kuba, ale teraz chyba ³atwie dolicytowaæ szlemika bêdzie|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and 2@s beatable but difficult|pg||
nt|glen: finally forced to admit holds @H Q|pg||
nt|dimi: anyway 2@c seems to be a good contract, while 3NT is not a make i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: you can make 4@h played on @s but not on @d|pg||
nt|tomi2: i think this is the convention, that made me score / avoid lose most imps at all. if i was allowed to play only one convention, i would kick blackwood and stayman and keep 5nt=pick ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: a slam :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kingcur: it looks very much like Tim Verbeek having learned all the relays by heart: as I said earlier, E is not Berend vd Bos' regular partner|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: anyway, well bid by NS, do we have the bidding from the other table?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ryskiel_: eeeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Igor nie doceni³ cue bidu kier partnera|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: chyba mu sie A schowal ...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|golfsquash: not beating it now|pg||
nt|stc: 1@h, 1@d, 1@c to loose|pg||
nt|kingcur: but despite the relaying, not landing at the best spot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in a more natural system do you bid 1@s or 2@d on pds 1@h bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Tim Verbeek plays the same relay with his regular partner Danny Molenaar|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results: www.nbbportal.nl/1003 then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e trema - w koñcu to ich debiut w takiej rangi imprezie|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no running scores|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 4@H looks quite reasonable -- but not easy to play on this layout|pg||
nt|stc: I think you can try @s first, then @d if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@H, i fear is doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|glen: and after all of W's efforts to stay out of slam, E bids the grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes the ace of trumps is useful|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i suspect gro meant 4nt as exclusion keycard, rehder misunderstood|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: No, just finesse twice in @s|pg||
nt|stc: for 5@h+4@s+2@d = 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: declarer's shape is known exactly from the bidding, so the defense will hardly go wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: why, yes, of course:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder thinking, not schüller|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: meanwhile the imps start to roll in for the jamm team, 6 on  35|pg||
nt|jaapfr: about what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: i don't know should i ask him? ;)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HTQ already played?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now schüller is thinking...|pg||
nt|stc: now even 2¨ds|pg||
nt|stc: 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: decl: "thats probably good news" after n showed out|pg||
pc|h2|nt|glen: i think you are correct Michael, about 4NT as exclusion|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: gotard sr. was out of pass cards so had to use a double instead|pg||
nt|glen: for some expect partnerships, splinter then 4NT is exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  exclusion is tell me your aces outside of @D |pg||
nt|glen: *for some expert|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cc469: I'm referring of course to the previous hand|pg||
nt|stc: It is an interesting question : where the line between fairplay and "team interest" ?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|stc: he will make, when seeing the @d, will be force to play on @s finesse|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has the @c6 prepared...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better not think too long then:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the thinking suggests he has @CKJ6 imo|pg||
nt|stc: this may be the match ball|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzzx: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/DBV-Quali-2012/12_03_09_team.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will N play the Q?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if small even down 2 looming|pg||
pc|s8|nt|stc: fairplay would say -4, strict rules -6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: no they are discussing this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: -6 was clear for all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the heart has intentionally been played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S certainly tried to keep the kettle boiling for some psychological advantage with his remark|pg||
nt|dimi: well this really a tight match ... difficult situation for "fairplay" whatever this is in such a case|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: or at least something very similar|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kingcur: I'd bid 1@S, since 2@D invites pd to go over 3N with a fitting hand; and you're not strong enough to show @S in a reverse bid with this hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S-2@H-2@S-3@C-3@D-3@S-4@S-5@S-6@D-6@S|pg||

nt|stc: wow, why comenting I missed the play...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator job much harder than being player, nicht wahr??|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  38  [4@S-2]  Rohowsky playing 3N West!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: heavy 1@h-opening at the other table|pg||
nt|kingcur: not likely, andreas...I play reverses in answering hand a rock solid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakie +1 to nie umia³ wziac 13?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: claimed 1 trick for EW|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: there was another bid between 6@D and 6@S, guess which :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: back to bidding, I wonder if transfer then bid of @H's would have worked better |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 1 Imp to Ireland, as 1NT survived in the other room|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzzx: @s2 lead showed odd with honor or even without honor|pg||
nt|stc: 8 dangerous boards for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: hier zeigt 2@H auch wieder eine @S-Hebung, 4-8 Punkte in diesem Fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ns play 5-card majors, btw|pg||
nt|jaapfr: does he get away with that excuse:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: for gromöller-rehder 1@h would be systematic on the s cards|pg||
nt|runnerup:  8 tricks in nt but not so easy to stop below game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C shows biggest difference between NS Baltic Club and Polish Club|pg||
nt|stc: in other sports they will take a timeout|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Online players would, of course, both make and accept that claim.)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: in the 6NT board Felmy - Khanukov had some strange auction leading to the 4-2 fit in spades and an overtrick..|pg||
nt|stc: many online players reject very obvious claims !!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: I'm told that north and west are regular partners!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they find 4@S?|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6 more imps to NL Red, with 4@S receiving a double and making +1 in other room on  6|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@h forcing, but not yet GF|pg||
mb|3H|nt|golfsquash: with spades breaking, this will cruise home|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: so indeed it could be either @s32 or @sQ32|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: h+minor|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4@S sind in dieser Hand erfüllbar, ob man sie aber reizen sollte, ist fraglich|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@H zeigt vermutlich fit und 2@S könnte dann ein Versuchsgebot sein|pg||
nt|400 volt: ohne Fit spielen viele, dass nach Kontra das 2@H nicht mehr erzwungen wird|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Polish Club uses Precision 2@C opener with 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/1S|pg||
nt|stc: you mean !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget 6 -- get to 4@S first :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: they might get too high after 2@H GF|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: on the other hand, 4@H can be made after other than @D lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|400 volt: wenn thomas jetzt aufkontriert, könnte das teuer werden|pg||
nt|santyclz: And then they wonder why no one wants them at their table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: a heavy 1NT, so might have bid a spade on the way|pg||
nt|stc: but would W  return @s if starting with KQxx ?|pg||
nt|stc: fortunately the choosed the good 4-2 suit, @s and not @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  sry - was interrupted by a Bridgemate Control problem..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 33 minutes left|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 2@D wd probably be nf for EW after 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: I wonder why 1NT and not 2NT with 11 points ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely not really...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dimi: i think one of the most valuable quality of a top bridge player is to forget about every bad board at once after it was played|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Declarer has to ruff 3rd spade, cross to the @DA and play @SJ discarding anothe @D looser. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: good question|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so I missed all the entertainement|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  3@D Stayman really helps|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s is not bad and makes, both options, @s/@d finesse are good|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|stc: and risking to offer a fast @c discard ?|pg||
nt|stc: this is one of the points where professional players are much better then non-profi experts|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van den Bos when he put down his dummy: 'I hope I don't have too much :)'|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: but still one more looser to go, sorry 4 trick to EW|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cc469: I think I would have not bid @Ss with 4333 shape and 4 weak @Ss|pg||
pc|cA|nt|400 volt: am anderen Tisch wurde west in 2@D kontriert.Udo Kasimir muss sich anstrengen, um den Verlust auf 2 IMPs zu beschränken|pg||
nt|stc: a desperate 7@d ?|pg||
nt|stc: the only grand you can make is 7@s BY NORTH !|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be disappointed if they reached 7 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @HQ is wasted value|pg||
pc|c7|nt|frankaus: declarer shows 2 suits lead trump is a fine method|pg||
nt|kingcur: a bit unlucky for EW in the other room to be stuck in 1@H: especially with opps NV, a hand with a short suit almost assures competitive bidding, after which you could show your ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: strength in rebound...not this time though|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sastro: Denke mal , dass 2 Pik den 4-4 Fit vorschlägt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: von alvensleben is out of pass cards|pg||
nt|stc: and of course 7NT|pg||
nt|stc: still loking for 7 on the Q@s ?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|stc: if you are in 7@s lightner Xed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: forgetting a bad board is easier said than done|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: e-w are pure amateur players. n-s are at least experienced players in the international bridge scene|pg||
pc|s2|nt|400 volt: ich bin verwundert, dass Nord mit XX nicht gute @D gezeigt hat (falls verfügbar)|pg||
nt|400 volt: Süd hätte wohl nicht gepasst mit seiner Hand, aber 2@D ist tatsächlich erfüllbar von N/S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: an elaborate system like theirs should stop them from getting to a grand like this|pg||
nt|stc: looks like the first natural bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a @d back frmo the K now should beat this|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|stc: indeed, fair enough|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i believe using normal responses to RKC after showing 0-4 hcp  is silly|pg||
pc|cK|nt|baldfriede: especially when opps rub it in, like Rohowsky did|pg||
nt|stc: he has to finesse here|pg||
nt|dimi: some kibs told me that they even forget about a bad board during playing it ... well :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Piekarek and Smirnov are the only two German (male) players who regullary play professional. Auken- von Arnim are the other professional pair we have|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: 4th toilet break for Matthias|pg||
pc|c9|nt|400 volt: Einige Kibitze werden sich wundern, warum Thomas Gotard seine Hand mit 12 Punkten nicht eröffnet hat. Das liegt an der sehr ausgeglichenen Verteilung und den wenigen Mittelkarten, ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: sodass sie für ihn nicht 12 Punkte wert war|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|stc: so 6@d for -3 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north has shown 14-16, 2452 shape, two keycards and no @dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 38   3N made   i would have bet that both rooms would play 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT made in OR and now 32 with 10 results tom compare and a potential swing for the leading team(5@H-1)|pg||
nt|kingcur: EW picked their 4-4 @S fit here, the only denomination to have a chance at 10 tricks for game|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again north might get the chance to play a @d back again:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: NS use 2@C to show weak hand with 5+@H and 5+ other suit    [except in ACBL events]|pg||
nt|luffe12:  do u agree on pass by W? Never in a lifetime|pg||
nt|stc: JAMM can start packing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please stay in your seats until match comes to complete stop|pg||
nt|stc: one line of play : AK@s, run @c, finess @ds|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzzx: will try a showup squeeze i suspect|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, there's still a chance to go right|pg||
nt|kingcur: but not at all easy for S|pg||
nt|chmitty: would still make 10 tricks if he decides @s 4-1|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: now they were playing way too fast for my computer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer, with discards to find trys the spade hook|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: did he really play that way?|pg||
nt|stc: +2 looks a bit too much|pg||
nt|xenya: i guess not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they played the board in 30 secs, i cant only click like one time in 3sec because of the connection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good bidding from Khanukov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is best line    without looking at NS hands|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cT|nt|stc: Yes, the doctors had very, very good results for non profis|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: Wagner claimed he will score all tricks expect of one but he thought this would lead to just made, he miscounted tricks|pg||
nt|stc: As far as I know von Arnim is not a full time profi (school teacher ?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems  play for @S 32   and something good in @C or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2nd trump then @C|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dJ|nt|kingcur: now @C in N...he can see the @D switch|pg||
nt|frankaus: neded N win @C and push @D|pg||
nt|kingcur: last chance now|pg||
nt|frankaus: too late i think|pg||
nt|kingcur: a warm welcome to Pierre Schmidt as well|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|stc: I think this is the best line|pg||
nt|chmitty: hi all :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|cc469: as a passed hand 2NT would be a perfect descriptor of hand value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pitching @D from dummy|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|golfsquash: I suggest no-1@c-1@s-1NT-2NT-3NT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|stc: combines Qx in @S with @C 3-3 and last hope @d hook|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i need more time to think about play from dummy|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|glen: not a really sqz since E discards before S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  east can still go down finessing !bh|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think if he had pitched @D on 2nd @C   he could eventually ruff @DQ in dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzzx: claimed on pitching dias now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still true this way|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @h*|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|kingcur: and another 10 in the bag for NL Red|pg||

nt|400 volt: Nord sollte maximal bis 2@S mithalten, was auch schon Probleme bereitet |pg||
nt|stc: almost 4@s here ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: something strange happened here in other room ... seems thay had a misunderstanding about the number of keycards|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: therefore, 1NT forcing might be a good alternative. 1S-1NT-2D(shows 11-14)-3H-p|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: looks like a phantom save in OR|pg||
nt|glen: (no idea why N played @S Q, but perhaps though E was ready to play the T)|pg||
nt|thetaker: but North will bid @S now |pg||
nt|andreasw:  is this 10 board matches?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: unlucky missfit, but 2 hearts game force optimistic|pg||
mb|2H|nt|golfsquash: will sail into 6@c|pg||
nt|400 volt: Nach @D K wäre es von Kasimir erfolgreicher gewesen, wenn er einfach Trumpf spielt - West muss dann @D in D10 spielen oder die @S|pg||
nt|stc: It's sad that EW are losing IMP's on such incidents...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: after this round the von Alvensleben team might have similar problems |pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT version of multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 10 board per match|pg||
nt|chmitty: 5 matches today|pg||
nt|chmitty: the field has been divided into 6 teams "sections" for the first day|pg||
nt|kingcur: and if they bring in 6@C here, NL Red will be close to a max result in their first match of today|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzzx: if kasimir were a solid citizen, jokisch might well bid 4@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6 hcp   only Walter the Walrus would count north as 7 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: need 1 more imp for 25-5|pg||
nt|chmitty: they will start a full "swiss" tomorrow with starting positions depending of today's results|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: why cant south bid 2 hearts over 2 diamonds in your suggested auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: das künstliche 2@D-Gebot gegen die Eröffnung von Nord hilft West sehr - er weiß jetzt, dass er die beste Hand hat, die er haben kann|pg||
nt|sastro: im polnischrn <Treff von der Verteilung her eine 2 Treff-Eröffnund- aber die Qualität spricht dagegen|pg||
nt|400 volt: alle Werte bis auf ein Ass in Partners Farben|pg||
nt|400 volt: Ja, und bei Gotard-Gotard ist die 2@C-Eröffnung keine reine "Precision-Eröffnung", sondern zeigt immer ein 6er@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: ich denke, thomas behandelt seine hand als schwachen sa|pg||
nt|sastro: 2|pg||
nt|400 volt: Rohowsky fragt sich sicherlich, ob 4@H hier gehen können|pg||
nt|stc: but defense must play @d early to beat 4@h, if not E is endplayed in @d|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but check the result, was probably +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4@D 4@C, EW always open 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: but afterwards they needed longer to count the tricks as to play the hand before. they agreed on 10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  after 1@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  6 [3N=]  von Alvensleben playing 2@D South    so STILL no pushed boards|pg||
nt|dimi: 4@h is a nice spot for NS|pg||
nt|stc: This hard week-end is a good trial before a two weeks competition as noticed by specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: would also expced 1@S from north|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: they are systematicly allowed to bid 1@S or 1@H on 3 cards if no other bid fits well|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: or if they fear to wrongside a NT contract by bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: in the open room, Aarnout Helmich in N threw in a 2@S bid over 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: Da aber Fritsche nicht 2@H eröffnet hat (mindestens 5er @H und 4er+ Unterfarbe, unter Eröffnungsstärke), ist das ein Argument dagegen|pg||
nt|400 volt: Ob man jetzt aber West oder Ost den letzten Trumpf gibt, ist fraglich. Spielt man Trumpf und Ost hält ihn, hat man den Kontrakt verspielt, da man @S-Schnitt nicht mehr machen kann|pg||
nt|glen: modern bidding, S gets to open worst suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I prefer 1 @D promises 4 |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|golfsquash: benjamin 2@d|pg||
nt|cc469: p can bid @Ss himself if he has distribution that makes a suit contract look more attractive from his pov than NT|pg||
nt|stc: that NS "produced" an almost impossible extra trick, wd :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: will be sign-off and shows only 5. 11 count and 6c. is better to show immediately|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzzx: i could not hear souths explaination but 2@S can show several at least invitational hands|pg||
nt|kingcur: after which EW actually have an easy way to get to 6@C, but as said, sth seems to have gone wrong after that when it came to keycard asking|pg||
pc|h8|nt|golfsquash: misprint|pg||
nt|golfsquash: the equivalent of 2@c in most natural systems|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@C ist ein partieforcierendes Relay und fragt|pg||
nt|400 volt: ich weiß leider nicht, was die weiteren Gebote heißen, bin mir aber sicher, dass Nord Süd über die Verteilung und Punkte ausfragt|pg||
nt|sybarra: even if only 2 @C |pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: don't worry they open 1@c on 4342 as well :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is agreement/style etc |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|luffe12:  take it back - second round|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 1@D-2@S would be 4-7 HCP, so this sequence is constructive|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: lead of  = attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why 2@S was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: either from 4 or 5 cards with an honor|pg||
nt|stc: looks like making 1@s 4@h 3@c at least|pg||
nt|luffe12:  on  9 would u guys give up at 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east asking, north "2nd/4th" ah "nooo attitude"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: east "thats better!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the final board of this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: our next match will be Israel - Czech Republic|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzyf: that match will start at 15.20 local time. That is in 20 minutes from now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|400 volt: In dem anderen Halbfinale hat der eine Tisch 7@H erreicht und erfüllt, während der andere Tisch in 4@H gestrandet ist|pg||
nt|glen: i like systems where 1@C is natural or balanced, so I like the NS modern bidding|pg||
nt|chmitty: if 3@s shows shortness in the suit, they are on good tracks here also|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: supposedly i played attitude leads for a long time with one partner [his choice] -- but turns out he always assumed 4th|pg||
nt|k_u_b_a: i znow dziwne ze N nie otworzyl uklad 44 na starszych na drugiej rece powinien zachecic zdecydowanie |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: after likely missfit established, down valuing is in order|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzzx: 4@h vermutlich forcierend, 4@d hätte 4@h erzwungen um in partie zu bleiben|pg||
pc|s7|nt|400 volt: ich denke 7@H sollte man nicht reizen, aber 6@H sieht nach einem sehr gutem Schlemm aus|pg||
nt|xenya: i weould love to be in 4@H on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: north semi claiming|pg||
nt|kingcur: W actually has a fine hand for an old fashioned 1@C-3@S splinter bid, but nowadays that bid is often used to show suit, not shortness|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|golfsquash: no trump finesses now Derek!|pg||
nt|cc469: safest contract is 6@C but hard to get to a slam in a suit that has never been bid :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should East have shown 2-suiter immediately over 1@D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stc: 1@s is a safe contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|golfsquash: This will not make|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and 2 down is a possibility.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: N thinking|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If south had raised earlier to 3@h, that might have ended the matter|pg||
nt|golfsquash: earlier Ireland had a 6@s contract depending on playing trumps for no loser missing Qxxx. A seconround fimesse was taken after all followed.|pg||
nt|kingcur: but they got there, well done|pg||
nt|kingcur: the play should be too hard|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzzx: actually they play very old-fashioned polish club|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H was a touch aggresive|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to see cash of @H a now |pg||
nt|sybarra: @S ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder has it at his thumb but is thinking some more|pg||
nt|glen: -200 is nice too, deciding if he can afford not to cash now|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: to fasten up the play he tells west what he will play in the next few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: the 600 board has now been scored against some normal contract|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chmitty: tough start in the competition for Netherlands White, sure they will recover |pg||
nt|kingcur: which brings us to the end of this first round and allows me to thank Dennis Stuurman for the excellent VU graph work|pg||
nt|kingcur: and my fellow commentators for their wisdom and wit|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: next round will be in 12 minutes|pg||
nt|chmitty: tx Dennis :) good job|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: bye|pg||
nt|kingcur: see you soon|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|golfsquash: trump best now|pg||
nt|kingcur: same lead as in other room, and it will likely result in 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|uni_cicam: yes, but still, you want to bid the game if possible. Still can have 25 HCP and 3NT can be cold|pg||
pc|c8|nt|400 volt: Kasimir ist auf dem Weg in den Großschlemm - Jokisch wird aber wohl jegliches Interesse verneinen|pg||
nt|sybarra: better part of valour?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|stc: why, you have almost no play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cc469: this only makes because @Hs are 3-3 - 36% slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: *valor|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: rehder surprised|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzzx: 12 imps for JAMM that is|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the extra 2 tricks produced 1 additional imp.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4@H has play too|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last time in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzx: piekarek played polish leads all his life|pg||
nt|santyclz: When you look at it that way, it's easier to forget the bad results -- same as an undoubled overtrick.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: but it does look unmakeable|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|stc: 3NT -6 gave 12, -4 would have been -11, just 1 IMP|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: in theory at least|pg||
nt|luffe12:  they duly found the @c ruff on  23 - mainly because N bid 5@c in the process|pg||
nt|kingcur: Thanks to Dannis Stuurman for the excellent vugraph work|pg||
mc|11|nt|uni_cicam: I always tell people if one shows a exact range, the other one should tell what to play, and will 11, you want to invite, or not?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: thats it, thanks everyone and good luck to the players in the next rounds|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: thank you we have a break now see you at 1800 hours |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not: with opening bids less these days and a missfit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks all|pg||
pg||
