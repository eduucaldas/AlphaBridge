nt|vugraphzas: I didnt see|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: maybe declarer played a small @d from hand|pg||
nt|april7: N should have discarded, and leave decision to E|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then? he ruffs small and exits in @D and waits|pg||
mb|1H|nt|engsetter:  a simple 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: they don't play |pg||
nt|vugraphzas: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  would you make a negative X after P-P-1@h-1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzas: I believe he did|pg||
nt|mamos:  North has a nice hand does outh have enough|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is close, but I would|pg||
nt|ybob: i pass|pg||
nt|ybob: better with 2@H|pg||
nt|ybob: or 9 cards minors|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ybob: 9 tricks on @S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  or another Q somewhere, even better|pg||
nt|lokaty: nieporozumienie:(|pg||
nt|lokaty: Aka myla³a, ¿e 2 NT na m³odszych:(|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lokaty: a to ju¿ za wysoko, jakkolwiek by nie gra|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: 20 hcp either way; this will end in a part score.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: East will They bid faster than I can commentate.|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: Piganeau's team is the holder of the senior bowl, the world senior championship|pg||
nt|engsetter:  not so simple now|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I had not anticpated the one spade overcall opposite passed p|pg||
nt|engsetter:  my reason is that against enemy contract I would not want to commit my side to a spade lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|rnmalik:  minus top control in minor suits would require some work. 8 tricks there.|pg||
nt|engsetter:  when a minor lead could be easily best|pg||
nt|baldfriede: good morning all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome.|pg||
nt|april7: EW might go to slam in @S or @D , but both not makable|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre has not a fantastic hand for @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 3NT would convey that message|pg||
nt|hedyg: the misfit should discourage them|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  2@c French is a good but not gf hand|pg||
nt|lokaty: she was thinking 2NT was both minors below opening preemptive|pg||
nt|lokaty: and now one bridge to far....|pg||
nt|lokaty: the basic of partnership in bridge is to know the openings:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: then , poizat is not out of gas|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzas: senior is 60+ years old in bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a @s loser, ok, but rest might be good|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hard for N to tell, but he would have done better doubling 2@s|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|baldjean: I thought W might have invited.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|april7: but with 2 aces in E's hand, W will go to 6@D|pg||
nt|lokaty: mo¿e to tylko taki pechowy ten stó³ jest jak w ostatniej rundzie siê zaczyna:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|baldjean: declarer would like to know where J@d is|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: if it is in north it cant be 4th|pg||
nt|mamos:  this will work out well enough|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: EW can make 3nt here if they find the @c |pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: now 4NT to play or BW|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@H 2@s by E would have been forcing so 3 @s really showed his hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ybob: lost 1@H and 2@C or 1@C and 2 h@S|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|baldjean: E would have declined though.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|april7: pass is now best, but human is to go on|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h a sort of last train, meaning " you really don t like your hand?"|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C & 2@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: last chance|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Besides the J@D @H hook required for 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|h9|nt|ritong: lasserre says " no, i really don t like it", but poizat really has a monster|pg||
nt|hedyg: no leaddirecting double by N|pg||
nt|hedyg: he doesnt think he would like opps to play in 5NT instead of in 5@s|pg||
nt|april7: @H ace ,then  @D ruff, and down you go unfortunately|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: hirschwald is thinking a lot...|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: for the lead|pg||
nt|april7: S might even start with @D and then E goes 2 down|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: huge swing possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: wondering why his pd didnt double|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: when other room managed to stay in 3NT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: the @c2 will seal it|pg||
nt|lokaty: ca³y czas s¹ problemy techniczne|pg||
pc|h5|nt|baldjean: N can be endplayed for making|pg||
nt|april7: 6 he would but not 5|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @D asks for @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: the very light major 2suiter overcall in the OR kept EW from bidding too high there|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@D promises the 9|pg||
nt|ritong: was not good news for east, right|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: niestety|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ritong: no JT stiff on|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|mamos:  there seemed lots of ways of arriving at his contract|pg||
nt|ritong: hi again there|pg||
nt|ybob: hi|pg||
nt|henryb:  is 420 really as good as 800? should S have doubled 2@s? what should a X of 2@s mean?|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 3/4 italian controls|pg||
nt|ritong: A=2, K=1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: I thought that S at these colours may come in with 2NT but had no plausible defence to @S contract, so a pass.|pg||
nt|april7: but the lead might also convey suit preference|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|baldjean: And claim.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dT|nt|mamos:  in very traditional English methods where 2@c was GF  double of 2@S would have been a poor hand but for pens  -- not sure you will make game p  \i think we could defend|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Henri, what are the specs on the 2@c opening?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|lokaty: Zawodnicy JOTER maj¹ takie ciê¿kie nazwiska?|pg||

nt|ritong: we call it "semi forcing"|pg||
nt|ritong: as opposed to 2@d full game forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: can be 22/23 balanced or any strong 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  So its not well defined|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: Slam time.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: for people who have worked on it, also covers some exotic handtypes|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: like 6@h/4@s, or the reverse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: lost 6@C|pg||
nt|ritong: identical auction next room, so a push|pg||
nt|engsetter:  east should downgrade hand with doubleton QJ|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@h is @h and a minor?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would say so|pg||
mb|4N|nt|baldjean: @c slam would be right-sided now.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The DBL would prevent EW from bidding higher then required.|pg||
nt|ritong: not like them to distort a nat w2|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 2@s is nf |pg||
nt|mamos:  DDid South expect this to be passed?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that is unplayable|pg||
nt|lokaty: witam|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand. W may opt for 3NT here. |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|engsetter:  yes indeed without the double- normal  a bad no trump contract loomed|pg||
nt|lokaty: teraz bardzo szczêliwe 3 NT|pg||
nt|lokaty: ale czy trafi karo?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|frankaus: this will not challenge declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldjean: Which will make without a problem.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is an overbid|pg||
nt|lokaty: Dobrze, ¿e Justyna doci¹gnê³a sama, bo 4@S mi siê nie podoba³o.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|ritong: hirschwald does not know how @cs are made|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: the Piganeau team has been very successful internationally|pg||
nt|april7: this will go down, but 4@S might also have gone down on @H KA lead and then @C , 2 down|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|baldjean: With this lead an ot even.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unless your partner is al roth|pg||
nt|lokaty: Marek jest pe³en nowoczesnych ustaleñ i by³ pewny, ¿e 4 d to piki|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c5|nt|ritong: problem is, 1@d followed with 1NT is like 5/7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its easy to let being vulnerable effect your bidding decision but many IMPs are lost by overbidding in the situation|pg||
nt|ritong: when 1@c 1NT is like 8/10|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ritong: so, his other choice was immediate 1@c 1NT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: which would look like a serioàus underbid, wouldn t it?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lokaty: 5@H powinno go uczujniæ, bo po tej sekwencji nie am ju¿ cue bidów|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ybob: 3nt was cold any lead but 6@C defeat @S lead|pg||

nt|baldfriede: Trumping high would not have got him into any trouble; always 3 tricks. but chnces for ovrrtricks then|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had a chance to make an extra trick.|pg||
nt|april7: instead of KA @H lead showing doubleton!!|pg||
nt|ybob: lost 1 in 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@h 2@d X 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 3@d not mandatory, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: likely @h/@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s 3@c would show @h/@d|pg||
nt|engsetter:  another low level contract about to happen|pg||
nt|ritong: i just suspect he will|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@h-2@d-2@h? that's what I would do|pg||
nt|ybob: with a nice K @H :) ?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ritong: guess lassere will opt for @hs|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre|pg||
nt|ritong: hoping for a raise(!)|pg||
nt|mamos:  id be happy with 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: south is a strong believer in 4/4 fits|pg||
nt|ritong: but he goes for reasonable action|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|barbyh: ew have a heart part score|pg||
nt|ybob: short by 1... change to J @H after A @C|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm a strong believer in fits, and we have already found an at least eight card major suit fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: nice !!|pg||
nt|ybob: X by S pls|pg||
nt|henryb:  double?|pg||

nt|lokaty: bad decision on imps by Zmuda|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ybob: lost 1 4@H|pg||
nt|lokaty: przepraszam, z³a decyzja w meczu Justyny|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this will roll home comfortably|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S by S here, losing 2 @H and a few @S|pg||
nt|mamos:  the trouble with bids like three Diamonds is that p   will almost inevitably go 4@d|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: small @s from hand would make sense here|pg||
nt|ritong: thinking " if the A is on, i can lead towards K later on"|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes if nothing happens you can play a @s towards the king later|pg||
nt|ybob: 3 rounds @D defeat|pg||
nt|ritong: really?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have good defense and not so good offense opposite a non-invitational partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  oh dear|pg||
nt|lokaty: przyzwoity kolor trzeba powtórzyæ.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: NT final contract or may be 2@S.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is tough:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: red games attract the over bid|pg||
nt|april7: S should play for doubleton ace of @S so losing only 3 @S instead of 4 by playing to the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|lokaty: ale teraz Jaworski le:)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: sry Henri, you are too quick :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ritong: and see what happens...bingo!|pg||
nt|ritong: now, he just has to find @d K with the overcaller|pg||
nt|ritong: which is likely, when west did not lead a top @h, a priori denying AK in this suit|pg||
nt|lokaty: a m³ody zaufa³ i wyszed³ jak Zab³ocki na mydle:)|pg||
nt|lokaty: taryfa dla OWCY|pg||
nt|lokaty: DZiewczyny bêd¹ mia³y niez³ego Butlerka:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: here east went to 4@d because of the 6/4 shape and good hand in general|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lokaty: o pojawi³y siê nazwiska:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: he must have some cards to justify the overcall, right?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: these guys are not suckers, you know  when they do something, there is an other reason than " but pard, we were not vulnerable"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h must surely be just competitive?|pg||
nt|ybob: yes and why S bid the game |pg||
nt|henryb:  Poizat is trying to resurrect the @hK by pretending he does not have it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: if EW cashes the @H tricks, S doesn't need the @D finesse|pg||
nt|lokaty: na razie pierwszy fart, ¿e @h po 4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|engsetter:  yes but north is allowed to give his p chance to play a part in the decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that too|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe declarer will play Laserre for stiff K|pg||

nt|ybob: cold 4@S here|pg||
nt|ritong: this looks like a pure 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: or equivalent|pg||

nt|april7: 5@C looks quite good but goes down if W doesn't play ace of @C on first lead from S|pg||
nt|hedyg:  The winning team will represent France at the European Championships in Ireland next June |pg||
nt|henryb:  263 would be a LOT of high card points|pg||

nt|henryb:  You will note that the N-S pair have let 20+ available imps get away so far|pg||
nt|ritong: added to a four cards fit, might be brilliant|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzas: depend which team you are rooting for :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: let s sit back and watch them bid this|pg||
nt|hedyg: Guy Lasserre has played before|pg||
nt|ritong: south shouold certainly reopen here|pg||
nt|april7: to induce W to take the ace, its a try!!|pg||
nt|ritong: and north will like it|pg||
nt|hedyg: you play the 10 to tell him you dont have the jack?|pg||
nt|ritong: and @s Q10x|pg||
nt|ybob: 6@S or 7@D ?|pg||
nt|ritong: promising|pg||
nt|henryb:  7@d is a very good contract. Can they find it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|baldjean: I meant for declarer. It will depend a lot on where the other room lands.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ybob: hard after S shows @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c and not 2@d?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, i m surprised too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzas: can hardly be good for EW imo|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I think we can safely predict here making 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: and expect him to crush his pd's jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: with this opening hard to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: moderately, though|pg||
nt|april7: W doesn't know what S has, but I think the 10 is a better card|pg||
nt|ybob: now 6@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  on a 2 loser hand with first round control of all suits!|pg||
nt|ybob: old way ...|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|ritong: but raising a reopening bid is already a sign of strength|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is a passed hand but the 4th @s and void made N raise|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|henryb:  Maybe 6@d on the way?|pg||
nt|mamos:  its incredibly difficult to get back to  Diamonds on this type of hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  nope. lazy :(|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ybob: but if u bid 6@D play it only|pg||
nt|ybob: was 1390 or 1430|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  really? should be grand try, I think|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: @H lead and playing small provides 2 checks.|pg||
nt|ritong: and poizat says " come on, guys"|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baldjean: This 2@h does not have a chance.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 4, on @S lead only 5@C was made.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the best hand at the table never made a bid|pg||
nt|april7: no, he doubled|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am afraid i have to leave now, gl to both teams and good afternoon to you all :) bye!|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao ciao|pg||
nt|april7: bye|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|ritong: ole|pg||
mc|10|nt|ritong: glingo|pg||
nt|baldfriede: That lead gave a trick.|pg||
nt|ybob: after 2@C ??|pg||
nt|ybob: with 2@D open maybe ...not over 2@C|pg||

nt|ritong: i do not think 6@s/5@d is schedulable|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S  vs 5@H |pg||
nt|vugraphzas: 2@c is Game forcing|pg||
nt|ybob: both makeables|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  ty|pg||
nt|henryb:  ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  3Nt going down?|pg||
nt|ritong: makes more sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: (sorry to react late, I just ask him ;) )|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzzt: results: http://tinyurl.com/6nonvf8|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s, what else?|pg||
nt|ritong: we suspected that, but good thing you confirm|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@D X 1@H , 3@S or 4@S ?|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s stands out imho|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 4, but that is me|pg||
nt|ybob: i like 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 4 trumps, but flat|pg||
nt|april7: another 4@S contract going down|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rnmalik: @C guess and home.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: Interesting board; 3nt will probably be reached but should not make.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Next|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: lasserre will work on @hs first|pg||
nt|ritong: claim:)|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W win 5@H , nice result to Salliere|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|frankaus: could try either side 4 @CQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correction right @C guess:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: odd R that dec will gett it wrong IMO|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: position is not absolutely clearcut for marlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: friendly lead but defeat anyway|pg||
nt|ybob: @C was better|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: but he should sense a @c is called for now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  Still working on Bd 7 in the other room|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: or not...ok|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ybob: better 4@S here, 3nt defeat @D lead|pg||
nt|ybob: sry no if play over @C|pg||
nt|ybob: now 4@D 1@C 4@H|pg||
nt|ybob: run @D´s , play @H later K @C to A and cash @H´s|pg||
nt|ybob: run @D dsicard @C|pg||
nt|ybob: later @H and cold|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ybob: when A@H on E, declarer can open cards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: good pass by S, but N could have tried 4,would a XX shown a stronger raise?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ybob: no run @D now down |pg||
pc|dK|nt|engsetter:  interesting they conspired to show south has 5 spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|engsetter:  the unblock....|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: now ruff a @D and give up 3@H tricks then N could make 4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Why doesn't Marlier claim?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Looking for a @D return.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|engsetter:  it tipped the balance a little|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ybob: no way because @D lead because no comunications to cash @C´s|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S was cold with trump 3/3 ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ah did not take the making chance of playing on @C but our observation is on seeing all cards.|pg||
