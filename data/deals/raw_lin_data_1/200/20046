nt|petka: IMO EW were lucky on that last one. If some card had been right for declarer then he is only -100, and EW make 110. At MPs and these vulnerabilities I think E might balance in that ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzqc: not agreeing on system, east thought lebensohl, west natural|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|nilsland:  With a diamons lead 6 H is certainly better than 3 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: looks like eleven|pg||
nt|petka: so, west has some HCP, but very few aces and kings. After this 2N bid 3H becomes not only gameforcing but a little extra. I still don't think the west hand is easy to bid over 3H|pg||

nt|affe82:  i like invite vs 11-13. N has a good hand.|pg||
nt|nidhoegg1:  with transfer they could invite and still stop in 2 spades|pg||
nt|affe82:  given that we will often need 140 for a good board anyway there is not much to lose. just 7 losers as well.|pg||
nt|affe82:  prob not Kicki. at least I have not seen a trf sys where 1@h-1@s would promise 4c sup.|pg||
nt|petka: playing the transfer style many pairs make distinction 1C-1H-2S= 12 balanced and 1C-1H-3S is a normal opening with 5+clubs and 4S|pg||
nt|affe82:  and if bidding this any other way than a direct 2@s over the trf you lose too much of the aggressiveness in my opinion|pg||
