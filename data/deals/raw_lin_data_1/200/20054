nt|petka: 1NT as alerted it seems, so perhaps south might have a spade suit. That would mean that she does not always have 4+clubs in this auction|pg||

nt|petka: commonly in sweden 2H is not forcing there|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't like the idea of having to wait till we get to the 3 or 4-level before one can introduce a suit with 6-5 shape|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petka: I absolutely agree. On the other hand I don't like to double 1S with KQJxxx heart and then guess over 3 or 4S next time|pg||
nt|nilsland:  The idea of bidding non-forcing bids at the two level is popular, but highly over-rated|pg||
nt|petka: I guess the reasoning behind the popular transfer structures in these situations is revealed :) It is always good to either get in a suit or a tempo with your bid|pg||
