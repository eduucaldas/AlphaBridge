nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think W overbid by quite a lot when he cue bid and then bid 3@h. Jist 2@h over 2@c would have been enough in my opinion|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcn: here u can find the running scores, including the results from the consolation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: regardless of the result on that hand, the moral is that a partnership should have clear agreements about how a sequence like the one chosen by W (X then cue then hearts) differs ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from a direct jump to 3H over 2C|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: hi bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and how strong X followed by 2@h can be|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|mcphee: an odd sequence in the other room?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mcphee: seems W pushed to the slam off 2 key cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|support|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  at the other table E opened a sort of Polish Club in the long clubs variation. W responded with a forcing 1N and the auction proceeded from there in a mysterious fashion|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Did 3@s promise @s or could it be looking for a @h stopper for 3N?|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh I think it showed @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 4N Blackwood or a value raise?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcn: wasn't alerted too|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that will depend on what 3N was I suppose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcn: does someone have an oracle's cell phone? |pg||
nt|mcphee: here I believe the rule is no alerts over the level of 3NT after the first round of bidding|pg||
mb|5N|an| |mb|p|nt|Vugraphzcn: this was alerted|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe WBF rules on alerts is a little different|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  A kib suggests E-W may be lost in the jungle :) I certainly am|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the rule that Bob alluded to about alerts is only in effect when screens are not in use, as in the recenbt tournament here in Croatia|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh no kidding Marshall, I never heard that|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am not sure but i think so. rationale would be that behind screens you can alert without serious security consequences|pg||
