nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: are not NS the 2/1 pair|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, no shrinking violets here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so NS play multi?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulhac:  A fourtunate game here with East having two heart discard and the Q@S dropping|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Hi Shirley nice to see you, welcome all|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: and Panos|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx :) |pg||
nt|panosk: hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: This must be a very light 3rd seat 1@D by S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: If this auction is to make any sense?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or do we just have it all wrong?|pg||
nt|rv: South will double this, could be phantom save though|pg||
nt|andyv:  do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@Sis a two-suiter, known as Muiderberg in the Netherlands|pg||

nt|sz16f: ´ó¼ÒÏÂÎçºÃ£¡|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Routine 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|panosk: double is support i guess meaning 3hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with all bidding, a good stop, looks like just a make|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4333 in E not very appealing |pg||
nt|panosk: redouble probably honor in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes bet so panos|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi kibitzers and operator :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although a heart lead would have beaten it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: hi Raija welcome|pg||

nt|zhoufly: ·¨¹ú¶ÔÕóºÉÀ¼|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this should make|pg||
nt|psyck:  This is generally played as invitational' sequence|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will not accept any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: playing a strong club you don't need the 2NT rebid to show strong balanced|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as the cards r 6@d on after isolating @c's a sq of @s and @c|pg||
nt|athene: so, many pairs use it for a 3@D jump rebid with three-card spade support|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N not quite as good as the excellent 6@D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panosk: yes gd stop indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs play 5-card majors, 2/1 responses are not GF|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck:  generally as 5+ card @s any inv hand, some also play it as 4+card @s inv hand|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: There are no words for my view on this 1@D opening.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Andy, no sleep:)|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Germ...how was breakfast?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fine ty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|psyck:  If W had a hand to accept inv, I assume E's plan was to say correct 3N to 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  Spec an listen to the voice commentary if using the browser version|pg||
nt|psyck:  *specs can...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this event is an 8 teams comptition after round 1 France with 25 vp is leading Sweden23 end netherlands 22  then come the 2 chinese teams england usa and canada|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you can make 6@D on ace and a heart lead? aren't you short of an entry to ruff two clubs?|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|rv: not me with especially with @SQJX|pg||
nt|twcho: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|psridhar: the idea behind opening thaat E hand was the shape, but Larsson chickened out |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ssbux: it is also common in this part of the world, but usually 55|pg||
nt|jcwla: Something about rather trying to take 3 tricks than 11.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or even 4.|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes too much defensive value|pg||
nt|rv: I will take my medicine (even if fixed) and choose to quietly defend 4@s|pg||
nt|chnjcc:  åä½å¥½|pg||
nt|jcwla: This opening is so cheesy, really deserved a worse fate but the pressure bid pays off this time.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panosk: re hi, slight connection error apparently|pg||
nt|rv: North might struggle to make even 9 tricks in @s strain|pg||

nt|athene: i don't have a convention card for EW in my collection of Venice Cup 2011 cards but i assume they play precision, as that seems to be standard in China|pg||
nt|nkgupt: then a positional double sq with well placed @s lenth i think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: nice convention this 2 Nt  rebid   does any one knows the name of this convention ?|pg||
nt|cmule: +1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: So joanna neve sit south and Danielle gaviard North|pg||
nt|peachy: heart lead is by NO MEANS obvious or even necessarily a good choice|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Fiona needs to drive out the A@C and get to dummy with a heart and lead up to the J@D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: After 1st round, France is the leading team with 25 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: yes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standings can  be reached on bbo  programm of vu graph|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|ntmon: hi to everybody|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|panosk: 2 Aces missing so 5 is enough|pg||
nt|ntmon: @S lead perhapd best in teams but the format here dictated as safe lead as possible  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulhac:  Even that is not necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kathrine is married to Swedish star Peter Bertheau|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "2NT is never to play" could be a good name for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why she pulled 6 @D?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: OTOH, west reasonably was trying to avoid a ruff in a side suit, but the exact @H split prevents that . . . |pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: Majority of Chinese players play Precision or similar strong club system|pg||

nt|peachy: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
nt|sybarra: chinese commentary in closed room  english here|pg||
nt|psridhar: in general +180 on 20-20 deal should not be bad...|pg||
nt|othered1: west probably thought south had both the extra @S and the @HA for her 4@S bash.|pg||
nt|cmule: ¿ªÊÒ·ÀÊØ7NTÊ×¹¦D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcwla: We have different definitions of "just barely there."|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even on a heart lead South has to win the first club and play another one|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi kezhang|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  2+|pg||
nt|athene: NS play what is pretty much "expert standard" these days:- strong notrump, 5-card majors, short club|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  E may just bid game here|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D seem plausible here|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: shaky hand   South have the points  East the distribution|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  and S will have hard time ignoring the 6 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h or 4@s will make|pg||
nt|twcho: I believe EW is playing 5 card M with 1C including all bal hand outside NT range|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Henry, alway happy to have you join us|pg||
nt|peachy: Even if W had much less than she does, it is valuable interference after they open 1D, to overcall 2C.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it would be the Swedish equivalent to Gazzilli, named Häxan (the witch)|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  in 4@h, you don't have to worry as much about the Q@s.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=VeniceCup&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards%2F2011Veldhoven   for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: convention cards|pg||
nt|rv: West will drive to game here, first bid 2@c as good raise in @h and then maybe bid and rebid @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/Netherlands/dekkers-michielson.pdf|pg||
nt|peachy: Many pairs, even experienced or experts, have trouble in the auction after that start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although some may have doubled i prefer 2@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 3@d as W, or started with double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming 3@d means "bid 3N with a stopper, otherwise do something intelligent"|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice spot for EW.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: they played 4 @H's making in closed room |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H= spade rasie |pg||
nt|sybarra: also takes 2 @H bid away from W |pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|jcwla: This pace is glacial.|pg||
nt|andyv:  watch out Jordan...they're moving faster and faster|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, but then come the undos -- no new bids, just an alert.|pg||
nt|rv: important system aspect for partnerships to discuss? 3@c could potentially show both majors with longer OM (@s here)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E trying to slow the train down|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think EW in CR are going to have a chat about this auction.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a 3 loser hand...they should reach game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should 2@S not be forcing on the auction in the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it is not, you have to bid 4@H over 1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Only on this planet, Roland, not on several others.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 2@C followed by something|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd have a hard time bidding with the E hand on that aucition in the CR...only 100% force to cue bid and then bid @s|pg||
nt|athene: you can use redouble to show a strong hand but after 1@C it's practically impossible to get the opponents for a worthwhile penalty, as they have the whole of the 1-level to choose ...|pg||
nt|athene: from|pg||
nt|othered1: but does allow the double, which some partnerships make into a meaningful  action|pg||
mb|d|nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi pano!|pg||
nt|loe48: Hi Dennis welcome :)|pg||
nt|panosk: even 7 @D is makeable as card lie but i doubt they will get there|pg||
nt|psridhar: N was close to a take out X in terms of shape but light on values and RED|pg||
nt|jcwla: And opp a passed pd - nothing to protect.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
nt|andyv:  E here decides to show the @c stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W decides to dive off the deep end|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the best spot  is reached by West|pg||
nt|psyck:  With a hand unable to show @d's later, I'd prefer to open 1@d & rebid @c|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if Dekkers had to bid in front of partner with semibal hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
nt|jcwla: To quote "Miracle Mile," What's the hurry, Harry?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will make with no problem losing 4 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a little difficult to handle the spade break |pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs will be difficult to handle also |pg||
nt|sybarra: lot to do in the hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bep Vriend did not make the 6 nt in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||
nt|panosk: now secured , the friendly lie that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the difference between 6@H now and 6@H over1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will likely duck on sp  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *duck one |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: she wanted to show a weak opening|pg||
nt|rv: after Marion's redouble|pg||
nt|ntmon: these hands do not provide much room for wild competing |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I am not surprosed, it looked like a 7 count at first glance|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT seems like the field resting spot here.|pg||
nt|peachy: *surprised|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she might as well have bid 6@H directly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps less likely to make now?|pg||
nt|ssbux: why 3C, either 2c or 4c will be better and not misleading as notrump probe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can play her cards at random here and emerge with ten tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@C puppet to 2@D and subsequent 3NT = a choice between 4@H and 3NT |pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  this looks more scientific, Roland...esp. when her partner showed her useful values in the @c suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: but I agree that it is usually unbalanced|pg||

pc|h2|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||

nt|twcho: The total prize money is US$200,000|pg||
nt|sybarra: teams from all over the world|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not 1NT by West before you may wonder. Because they play a 14-16 NT, a popular range in Sweden|pg||
nt|cmule: ÊÖÉÏAÌ«¶à£¬±¬ÁÑ½ÐÒ²ÊÇ°×±¬ÁÑ|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: On the cards and S's opening, 6@H is not an outre spot on 2, but the best-bid hand award awaits further nominations.|pg||
nt|rv: what is 4@d here by Smith, some play it as good raise in @Cs, a few others play it as both majors|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 4@d as both majors 5-5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E has a solid road here, showing @S and forcing now, can show the @H later.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: if S bids his hearts.....|pg||
nt|rv: can E-W push N-S to 3 level?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and like the typical Neth.  fearlss overcalls|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: west can do something over 1@S now - 1nt, double, 2@H, 2@C?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: par contract in 5 in a minor for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, they have very generous sponsors in this Hua Yuen Women Elite Cup|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would much rather have four counts all day than these 10- and 11-counts where you start to get your engine revved up and then shut it down.|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing Trf responses to 1@C opening that 1@s shows @d|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 3@d is touch and go|pg||
nt|granguru:  in total you may find 10.000 I am told but used are around 2000|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D coming up|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and shows diamonds. 3@H a splinter|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 3@H =self splinter |pg||
nt|athene: i certainly would not want to pass, with a near-opener and 5-4 in the unbid suits|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is probably a sort of Lebensold to start a weak bid.|pg||
nt|twcho: with the winner taking 30,000|pg||
nt|twcho: and the last team will still have 12,000|pg||
nt|paulhac:  There are three events closely following each other this one, Beijing and Tianjin the later two being open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Over a more natural 1@C-1@D-1NT auction, E also could bid 3@H to pinpoint the concern.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: west did|pg||
nt|ntmon: do NS play completely natural system?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: Anybody have a problem with 3@D?|pg||
nt|rv: this slam is worse than 1 of 2 finesses, if @h finesse is off chances are not very bright|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally a splinter bid supports partner -a form of raise; but a self splinter suggests a good long suit that doesnt need much support + stiff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West promised a balanced hand, so East knows there's a fit and can splinter for diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the 4 matches going on in round  4 at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=4&tourid=1174|pg||
nt|psridhar: borderline but we can see 3N is right here- West's 3@s will steer them away i expect|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, those intermediate @H spots come into play and though 3@S is thoughtful, it may give E no choice.|pg||
nt|psridhar: E may even think slam now|pg||
nt|psridhar: useful black cards |pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably want a second @S honor to bid 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is Q986 enough to go for 3NT? Borderline|pg||
nt|psridhar: how would W bid @S AQXX,@H JXXX, @D QX, @C AXX ?|pg||
nt|athene: i want to get both suits into it but also showing the fifth heart might be nice|pg||
nt|rv: I like double with Wu's hand on 1@s with 5-4 in reds having passed earlier|pg||
nt|athene: it's just a matter of WHAT you bid over 1@S, not whether you bid :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ssbux: are they playing Lebansohl after a reversed|pg||
nt|psridhar: In my experience bidding 3N with a stopper of sorts AND length = u wont go wrong often|pg||
nt|ntmon: difficult lead for W|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
nt|ssbux: another unlucky slam for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's all coming up orange so far.|pg||
nt|rv: still very decent slam just on @h finesse|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes very decent, but unlucky|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 Nt is aking to go back to 3 @c in first stage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and  last !!!|pg||
nt|rv: my preference is 1n from Wu's hand is scrambling even from unpassed hand to show other 2 suits (prefer it to 5-5 though)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Plenty of room for both major K's to be in N, let alone just the @HK.|pg||
nt|twcho: is this common method played in France?|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd in the end the swedes !|pg||
nt|sybarra: Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174  to see.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: if @h finesse is off, you need @s finesse on and black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: perhaps 3NT should show stiff J or 10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: north, with a little extra, may consider to take action other than 3C, but she has a boarderline hand. |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rv: atleast 55% or so |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes   perhaps  South was not  very optimistec   it  not such a bad slam!!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  All are 8 team tournaments|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nkgupt: prefer X to be take out of opened suit (@c)|pg||
nt|rv: sry 1n sandwich nt and not scrambling |pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 1nt for 5/5 reds w/ lesser def|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes and got many comments on the matter that  is the reason I gave a public answer...they continue...|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can wander around site and find results as well as standings|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
nt|ssbux: ten of D, signal for S?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes  from a passed hand    it is  Take out double|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: @S lead did not cost a trick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panosk: for more info check this link http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TwoWayCheckback.html|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @d would be easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a hand of various judgments where each bid sort of means what its bidder wanted to mean at the time.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Exactly, Roland.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: good unblock N after his good lead|pg||
nt|rv: agree with NK on double is t/o of shorter suit on any (1x)-p-(1y), (ex) (1h)-p-(1s)-X here is t/o of @hs with @s tolerance|pg||
nt|nkgupt: also has the advantage of noncommitment to play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: now 2@H and still a @D to lose|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: The 3@S could have been a slightly better suit, the 3NT could have been a slightly better stiff, 4@D presumably would be forcing (but was there an ounce of fear that maybe it would ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: be passed), 4@S would likely have shown a slightly better second @S card, and on and on.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: Paul, I think you will be joining the Open events|pg||
mc|10|nt|jcwla: Right - here, it is clearly showing @D length.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was a horrid contract created by E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True, Aces needed for upgradation.|pg||

nt|ssbux: as I said previously, it is unusally to start with same boards when directed by Anthony|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If I was green I might be tempted|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just feels like a "good" hand |pg||
nt|nkgupt: one good reason for getting in on priv. is also having no clear lead on @s partial:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as W i mean|pg||
nt|cmule: ¶«Î÷·½×î¼Ñ¶¨Ô¼ÊÇ4-3ÅäµÄ6d|pg||
nt|ntmon: still i think S hand is worth some attempt|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  everyone wiling to play 1N except the author of the bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will be fortunate to go down 1|pg||
nt|ssbux: very lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for 2@H opening in fourth chair?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: n/S being talked out of good spot in @S's|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirmed by a spec, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: I really do not have any first hand knowledge, but looks like Precision|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C shows more high cards indeed so in case EW go to 5 level N doent have a clue about pards hand|pg||
nt|loe48: many use 2nt as good raise in this pos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Carl|pg||
nt|loe48: invite + in spade|pg||
nt|panosk: with the 4@S bid that is, agree with Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes many alternative bids...depends on partners aggrements|pg||
nt|kemperg: to much in @C nothing in red suits, 4@S good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't this the hand for it?|pg||
nt|granguru:  Probably could not double because of conventional meaning |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|panosk: N was a bit conservative for me shud have tried 2 spades|pg||
nt|rv: anyone open 2n (20-21) with North hand, what does K-R say?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michielsen showing 18-19 balanced with her 1NT|pg||
nt|twcho: south is conservative not to overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: the winner of the 8-team competiton will take home US$30,000 and the  8 also has US$12,000.  At moment, France is leading after one match and the Dutch is lying 3rd.|pg||
nt|twcho: probably deterred by the spot cards she held|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D GF checkback; i don't know what range of shapes they allow for the 1nt rebid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d is a FG  check back|pg||
nt|granguru:  some pairs play 1m X 1@S X as @S  to avoid psyquics|pg||
nt|othered1: The long and the short of it is don't lose more than 2 red tricks.|pg||
nt|granguru:  having all the intermediates in @D is a nice thing|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are bringing up 2 more tables shortly|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: @d most likely, will cost a trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Ns   remained silence with 25  hpc |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: 12-15 with 6 or some such|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: I suspect K-R will show more than 19 hcp for North hand, possibly not enough for 2n opening|pg||
nt|granguru:  alternative use is a responsive double the traditional way i.e. other 2 suits|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@h and @h|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes shape and values suit 2@H opening -but some authorites feel the hand should not have > 4 controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards not lying well for Heather Dhondy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well that @C9 ain't bad.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must still lose 2 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 club|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S should show a fairly poor hand i think; 4 of anything else must be a cue for spades|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: 20.45 per KR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And can easily go 2 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: John and Ed,,   you will be on your own for a bit  while I set those up |pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|peachy: This event does not have website or any other information online|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S made on 3 so an early 12 imps to HuaChu|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@s probably denies M|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ssbux: with a passed partner, no convenient bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW need to dodge the @s @d squeeze|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: oh oh  hope we are not losing it again  |pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes Shirley|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can build a heart trick here without too much problem i think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|twcho: Paul, do you know about EW bidding system?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: however can't beat 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one of those hands that cries out for a trump lead|pg||
nt|loe48: but..as crazy cards can be..opponents may have contract too..so 4s is also blocking alot same it can make|pg||
nt|twcho: and the double indicates @s suit|pg||
nt|peachy: The auction, to me, sounds like N did not believe South knew it was spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S= 1n?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I suppose Susan was afraid that if she bid 3@C she might push them into a makeable game|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl by S clearly penalty|pg||
nt|psridhar: but can be beaten yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  there is a good decision to play the hand by N if S has @SAxx|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ssbux: dangerous with 1NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree with south's pass over 1C, but may overcall 1H with the N hand.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: south is bit weak   to vercall 1 Nt and has 2 cards in @h not enogh to double she estimated|pg||
nt|gracelin: not for lead directing, of course, but allows partner to join the party with suitable hands.|pg||
nt|twcho: if the @c7 is replaced by @c10, I guess many will overcall 1NT then|pg||
nt|granguru:  in order to protect the @SQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psridhar: declarer herself may seek an entry in @d queen|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: no |pg||
nt|panosk: with @D 2-2 and J10 @C dropping they can even make 3@C :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: the uppercut works !|pg||
nt|sybarra: miight get a trump now |pg||
nt|rv: will anyone in panel open 2n?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think 3@C is better as N will know S also have defensive values. I wud bid 4@S without @CKJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes indeed, Tommy.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 3 NL pir reached 3Nt which should nod be a success|pg||
nt|ntmon: let's see CR result|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kerasidis: in one of them doubled could gain some imps|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: paying on @h after cashing the trump insutre 10 tricks  11 here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulhac:  If Norths X showed spades I wonder why she did not then bid 2@H if she was prepared to stand the X|pg||

nt|andyv:  I would only because I hate the rebids|pg||
pc|sT|nt|twcho: some imps back to France then|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe it's good for NS to defend 2S rather than bidding their 25 points game which wouldn't make.|pg||
nt|peachy: Exactly|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|panosk: my only concern is that if opps bid 5@C pass by N isnt forcing after 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: can see only 7 tricks for declarer.|pg||
nt|athene: just better not try something cute, like leading to the @CA intending to try to sneak the singleton @HK through|pg||

nt|athene: maybe north just wanted to speed things up :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 10 well-deserved IMPs to ZhuJiang there for getting to and making the @H game.|pg||

nt|cmule: µ«ºóÃæCµÄ´ò·¨±È½ÏÒµÓàÁË|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: NT range possibly 14-16, but we have no evidence other than bidding and the fat they play Precision :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's fine otherwise. I have a @D suit that is well worth mentioning (playing in, leading) and I don't expect the counterpart to bid 2NT, so I would open 1@D.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but most like a push board even after opening 2NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@s  two suiter|pg||
nt|gracelin: West cannot afford to see which minor partner has.|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@s, 4+minor, 8-10hcp usually|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: west shoud pass   with obvious misfit|pg||

nt|rodal f: 2@C pre an d the end.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rv: 2@d by East could show no preference to majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d here...pick your major|pg||
nt|twcho: we have to guess the meaning of the bids then. :(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: at last a swing on 3 NS pushed to 5 level by W's 5@D bid then X'd|pg||
nt|panosk: had to cash A@S first to defeat 3@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D forcing Stayman?|pg||
nt|sharkey: gf|pg||
nt|kerasidis: can anyone inform us pls|pg||
nt|kerasidis: from the kibbs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bertheau may just leap to game in spades now|pg||
nt|psridhar: this shd be a flat 4@s making 11 tricks i expect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would|pg||
nt|jcwla: Dhondy might have trotted out 2@D over the X.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Scientific bidding, splinter for spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: bit of daisy picking -slam chances are remote|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But are you slam-going opposite a passed hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and you are too strong to invite, so just bid 4@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agreed.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just helping opps.|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be KQXXX,XX,XXX,QXX and opener gets to ruff 2 diamonds..|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry even one ruff wd do there|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: This is an invitational event, 8 sponsors with their teams|pg||

mb|p|nt|panosk: for me 4@S can be 6small spades and some single, but is a matter of approach |pg||
nt|rv: 2@d shows equal length (2-2 or 3-3) in majors usually|pg||
nt|psridhar: THIS hand -if W is allowed 2 ruffs...slam|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@C 6@d 6!NT are there...7 with a good guess|pg||
nt|granguru:  6NT was the most dangerous slam|pg||

pc|c2|nt|peachy: I was kind enough not to say anything about hte 1NT last hand, but the words are just bubbling on my tongue|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just cruising for a bruising here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H=4 card support good hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  no battle at all as S decided to open a light NT|pg||
nt|loe48: true|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume 1 NT =13-15 or 12-14|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice advantage of a system that leaves that step in between.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is exactly why you need 2@C for the majors, and not 2@D or 2@H as in Capp and DONT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standard lead onthis bidding should be trump with strong opposition in minors|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: now he has to make 6 |pg||
nt|ianmcc: could be up for another -100|pg||
nt|loe48: 13-15|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner must be able to ask for the longer with 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when she has equal length|pg||
nt|athene: north didn't want to wade in over the strong club with a mediocre 5-4; it's sad being at adverse vulnerability :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru:  but it os hard for N to lead @H|pg||
nt|othered1: but with @S lead is 100 percent on @C safety play|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Has anyone heard from Basia lately?  We need her.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: I was sent a story yestaerday on Barry cranes rules for finding the missing Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: with nothing to go on |pg||
nt|sharkey: West made slam try in @D but E turned it down.|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt here is 17-19 probably, assuming they play 14-16 NT opener|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: do tell Gary |pg||
nt|rv: low @h best now|pg||
nt|rv: still likely to be trick short|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some had a noice here.|pg||
nt|cmule: È»ºóC»¹ÊÇ¶ÂÈû×´Ì¬|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: 6@D not unreasonable with decent trump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see declarer coming to 8 tricks with proper defense.  With club forcing fummy to ruff, defense will be ahead.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: sure Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: either club or trump return will be fine.|pg||
nt|twcho: and good shift to @d by north|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, thougful defense before declarer's diamond losers pitched on the good H.|pg||
nt|gracelin: thoughtful|pg||
nt|psridhar: @d lead and contn =slam rt?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks a fairly dull hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: but she is getting a @h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: same in CR|pg||
nt|granguru:  usually the lead against 6NT is the one who does not give anything|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: 2@s, 2@h and 1 trick in each minor for defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: daisy-picking was a term used by Hugh Kelsey in one of his books. Don't mess around when you know what the contract should be is what he meant|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcwla: You expect to be getting a @H lead and you have a very unappetizing holding.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: in a Major it is always over the Jack he claimed|pg||
nt|sybarra: its something about if they dont cover they dont have it?|pg||

nt|rv: pitch a @c now and another on @HK, can he make it now?|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Playing highest @S to prevent short honors from taking tricks to extent possible and draw trumps like so.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: well done and thanks to our great operator for getting the comparisions|pg||
nt|ianmcc: after @sK, @hQ, @hx|pg||
nt|kerasidis: interesting b|pg||
nt|sybarra: saving time with a claim |pg||
nt|athene: many would open 1nt with the east cards|pg||
nt|granguru:  here that rule doesnt work because EW have 2 suits where to play the contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the end.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W chose to defend passively (leading back a @s).  If instead W continued with @hs, it would have been down 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS will do some bidding here I think|pg||
nt|rv: England open their IMP account|pg||
nt|rv: well played by Sally Brock to capitalize on misdefense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the chance of a 4333 all round?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10.9 per KR on the S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer asking if there is time limit for bid and play. The Conditions of Contest say 2H 15 min is allotted for the whole match.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they are also fairly strict to that,  but Tommy or Paul could tell us|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes time penalties are enforced normally|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If South overcalls 1NT what should West bid?|pg||
nt|penseur9: you can watch the results from all 8 teams at:results and standing for all 8 teams at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c...|pg||

mb|1C|nt|kiwibridge: I was told that was gospel Shirley and that she never failed to find the queen :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2@d?|pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer after dbl?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: @h trf?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: part score battle in majors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: 1@D in E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D transfer ..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have any mathematicians in the audience?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  With a doubleton heart x did not look like an option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S constructive, 8-11|pg||
nt|nkgupt: cold 4@s ...unlikely to be reached|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well maybe they play "old-fashioned" precision with 13-15 1NT opener, or maybe east just thinks she has a 17 count|pg||
nt|othered1: Is south allowed to pass nowadays?  That hand is good for play in multiple strains and can hang partner out to dry.|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H is compettitve NF|pg||
nt|granguru:  E should pass|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ianmcc: the dreaded 2@cX|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will be happy to sit|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: dbl on that:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont doubt it |pg||
nt|peachy: East will likely balance with a Dbl, at least he should or else neg dbl would be a worthless convention for them|pg||
nt|peachy: West at the crossroads, what to do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, in an ugly spot|pg||
nt|peachy: he cant leave it in|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S the least of evils|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which pill would you swallow, pass or 2@S?|pg||
nt|peachy: bitter pill, but 2S for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: me too|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i can not imagine 2 pairs playing same contract here...so a swing will come|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can win the battle by playing 2NT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Probably the vulnerability put West off bidding as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S super accept and max?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H down on @S lead|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S looks a bit wet, but maybe she fears the 1@S is aggressive; e.g. just a good 4-card suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  b5 made 7NT in the other room but they biid just 3NT|pg||
nt|granguru:  10 IMPs to USA|pg||

mb|2D|nt|kiwibridge: now we have traded 30 imps in 5 boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but NO he finds the pass|pg||
nt|peachy: he is lucky to have partner hold the HA|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure what West has shown...|pg||
nt|psridhar: perfectly judged by W -if pd cannot bid over it there is no game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=4&tourid=1174   running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cant be S playing 2 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: a transfer interference? |pg||
nt|andyv:  this could easly go down 800|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It isn't obvious but that suit not good enough|pg||
nt|panosk: why S passed ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: plenty of work to do Larsson, take your time ! :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=VeniceCup&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards%2F2011Veldhoven  for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: convention cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: suppose so|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no, operator will fix|pg||
nt|rv: max of 6 tricks for E-W if they cash out|pg||
nt|twcho: difficult to find the 2N bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  As Garozzo says; if you have a singleton lead it |pg||
nt|granguru:  N is considering |pg||
nt|granguru:  S might have @DQ4|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Statistician - real mathematicians can't count, I am told :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: with the Major suits lying as they are this contract needs some double dummy play |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: both hands NS match very well with a double fit  very difficult to reach 4 @s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kerasidis: no will he try to secrifise or can see defensive vallues ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: expected to beat 4@S I assume|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: ok but 4@C doesnt preclude 4@S :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree.  though they might also make 3H with D 3-3.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes because the second @s stop is almost invisible|pg||
nt|twcho: NS have won the battle with the master suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Precious practice for all the top teams ahead of the Venice Cup next month in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|granguru:  in which case returning a @D might be wrong|pg||
nt|penseur9: as you can see, only 4 VPs seperate the first and 3rd position teams...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|nkgupt: only possible way....3@d(fit ) from S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: this deal would be more interesting in MPs or BAM than at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: this one may not be a success |pg||
nt|granguru:  but defense needs 5 tricks to beat|pg||
nt|granguru:  N does not cash the @SA in order to reenter|pg||
nt|granguru:  @C3 shows @C interest|pg||
nt|granguru:  now N has the dilema if declarer has only 1 @C|pg||
nt|othered1: I wondered about the significance of @C3 in their methods -- does that suggest that another @D not be played?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they almost avoided the failing game|pg||
nt|twcho: there is a promotion chance with 4th @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 4th round D may put declarer into guessing the trump position to make 2S.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: I was surprised he passed 4@S...|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D made in closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: yes took some effort to make |pg||
nt|loe48: 2 inputs|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like this off 2 so shud be a good score for NS|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any to bid one @H after pard have paased at opening hand?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am not sure she has enough points   @d  shape etc..|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|rodal f: New @H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: should be 4 * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 4) divided by (52 choose 13)|pg||
nt|granguru:  Means @C strenght..if declarer has stiif @C then the correct defense would be @C to @CA then @SA and just now another @D|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now you know!|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is thinking whether she should return a H after the first D, if declarer has a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|granguru:  S shows @CA also because t might be that N is singleton in the suit|pg||
nt|cmule: Î÷¼ÒÔÚ1NTºó2C±íÊ¾Ë«¸ß»¨£¬¶«¼Ò6ÕÅCpassÁË|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: defence's start promising|pg||
nt|twcho: not easy for west to find the @d continuation|pg||
nt|granguru:  a nice uppercut|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: N achieved the desired result with that x. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W is flat and minumum so should decline the invite|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gracelin: in that case she needs to take their HA before the 4th D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Tommy, unless East has a way to deny the holding of HA in her discard.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be west shoul have switched to @h at trick 2  keeping options|pg||
nt|twcho: unless east find the K discard|pg||
nt|twcho: @hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: East should know west has two Hearts by passing 2H, so maybe he could pitch HK to deny HA.  If West has it, West will cash it anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: then it will be a masterpiece|pg||
nt|ssbux: difficult to discard HK, what if declarer hold AQ in heart and Ax in C|pg||
nt|twcho: and one of the best defended hand then|pg||
nt|gracelin: SS, then partner won't pass 2H with a singleton.|pg||
nt|athene: quite tricky for south there without discussion, to show a good or mixed raise|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't the 3@C bid mean *anything*?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: And even then I wouldn't jump out of bed at night to write home about it.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: because she doesn't have a cue-bid available|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very   bright!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2NT is a raise|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: they need @h ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  they'll get one simply by the fact they will run out of cashers|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West might|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: low@d now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: @c ace pitching @d, @c ruff, @d to king, @c ruff, cash 2 @d pitching @H from dummy and hope for an endplay in trumps on N was a possibility |pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: but I prefer 4@C cue and max.|pg||
nt|rv: good switch|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: will try for K@D doubleton?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why bridge is so interesting - S never supports @C and N bids 5@C all by himself on the 5 card suit....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: 5 was not flat as PS predicted. West underbid with 2@S over partner's double|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: sry - 6 card suit|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: not rewarded enough at IMPs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: essentially she had to hope to limit her losses to 2@H and one trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and it went all pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pusillanimous.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|pg||

nt|rnmalik: agree, slam should have been bid.|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @s was not such a bad spot |pg||
nt|andyv:  EWW can only hope that NS have a game that's bid and made in OR|pg||
nt|kerasidis: now they discuss if WE has 4@s|pg||

nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: a chance for brilliancy missed|pg||
nt|athene: i guess any jump should be a spade fit, though|pg||
nt|athene: given she didn't overcall|pg||
nt|granguru:  if they play udca not|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kemperg: E had a good rebid on 1major|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: they might even have 5@S|pg||
nt|granguru:  it is a crucial moment in the defense...you must make the most significant signal possible|pg||
nt|cmule: Öé½­¶ÓÆ¾½è2¸±Âú¹áÓ®µÃ24µã£¬Õâ¸±ÓÖÊÇ6H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h vs 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: many would open that south hand 2@S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 4 Arnolds suprinsingly went down in 4@s   cold despite the @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: ok, east just noticed she has some hearts|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: Yes, far more worthy of a bid than the 1@D S egested on 1.|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl could be showing majors, a common def to strong C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same story can be repeated in CR:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect the CR auction to be widely duplicated.|pg||
nt|sybarra: little imps may count  but you probably dont worry about them this early |pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16 again|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps quite a cruel penalty really|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2@c bid was reasonable on previous board|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer had a trickier job in the other room after @CQ lead and north ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: but she played against the odds|pg||
nt|athene: trying to ruff down the @HQ rather than just taking the ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|athene: much more likely once clubs are 5-0|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: north is entiled to bid on !|pg||
nt|athene: inverted doubles would help NS here|pg||
nt|athene: so if south passes over 4@H that asks partner to double|pg||
nt|athene: now bidding 4@S shows a better hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I would bid 4@s  after  North double    not directly  solid @s in enough for  slam!|pg||
nt|athene: this is not at all clear, i don't think, for north|pg||
nt|athene: south might have a better hand than she has?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even a LOT better|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: should have|pg||
nt|athene: just give south seven solid spades and out for example|pg||
nt|athene: i would open that 4@S but everyone seems to open them 1@S these days|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @s you mean ?|pg||
nt|athene: probably is a good idea to play forcing pass and inverted doubles after a 2-over-1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 2@c being a gf(i supose) think they play pass and pull better so dekker is obliged to bid now imo|pg||
nt|athene: that might help a bit with sorting out situations like this one|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that is what i mean - IF they know pass is forcing, then the direct 4@S is not such a great hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "of course pass is forcing, it's obvious it should be" but nothing is ever that obvious, you have to discuss it|pg||
nt|nkgupt: it is for N to figure pd did not want to create a pass -pull|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: note that   the 5 level is still safe|pg||
nt|granguru:  a good philosophy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought it should be only -1|pg||
nt|blewah: i think that's the most likely scenario, Rashed|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play 2@c (fourth suit) as Inv+ and not unconditional GF here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 1NT best now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing is ideal|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasting into 3 nt  most likely |pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: DF makes 7@D on this hand :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 2@c as Inv+ with opener to show 2 ranges (11-bad 14) and good 14-17|pg||
nt|gracelin: bue even West did find the 4th round D play, declarer may still guess it right since SA is sure with East after west has shown an AKQxx suit in D.  also a likely honor in H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some don't like to multi with a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no strong feelings|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but a bit lucky; cld easily be a club ruff or something|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as the cards r...but maynot be on a diff layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Not the most beautiful hand to lead from.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D can only be hearts if weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H was forcing|pg||
nt|athene: or just @SA10xx with west|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system in action |pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe over 2NT an accepting 3@H and then back to 3NT.|pg||
nt|athene: north might be considering passing this!?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @c   0 or 1 KC ??|pg||
nt|athene: why else would she be thinking?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 KC  !!!!|pg||
nt|athene: NS play 1430|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@C known to be one key|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: does not seem obvious to North|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Surely N is minimum for the original X?  Oh well, S would have done anyway and maybe should have to begin with.|pg||
nt|sybarra: on this bd|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11+11 = game vul I think|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1-2 down|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs to guess whether East start with AJ of trumps or AJ10|pg||
nt|granguru:  so if I play UDCA and partner plays @C3 at the first opportunity (when I have @C2) s/he is showing @CA or similar|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a difficult contract to fulfill|pg||
nt|granguru:  but also not easy to defeat|pg||
nt|granguru:  you make your choice: what would you like to be declarer or defender?|pg||

nt|granguru:  lets see what happens|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit sad at EW now. Do W have a opening hand?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: 4@D x was -3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A nice way to resolve the angst about the imperfect 1NT rebid.|pg||
nt|othered1: are you talking single or double-dummy?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would you open W hand?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think I wud|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The favourable heart lie can produce 9 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer can make a backward finesse in @Dto win|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panosk: depends on my mood, if serious no :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: makes even on the improbable @d lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see N leading a @D nor doest it really mater |pg||
nt|nkgupt: good @h10 else @sA underlead @h and @s ruff:)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: she just had a doubt on the trump suit to choose|pg||
nt|athene: east wondering whether to continue hearts?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|twcho: without any significant spot cards, west wisely chose 4@s to be the final contract|pg||
nt|nkgupt: meanwhile  6 china did get to 4@s|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: best contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we warn them about 6 @D|pg||
nt|panosk: 6nt looks gd as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 12 in NT again a friendly K@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D I'm told is GF stayman, why he'd do it with only one major I don't know|pg||
nt|athene: no rush to try partner for the @DA, is there?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT in W or 2@D?|pg||
nt|blewah: NS would go for more if they know they also have fit in @c |pg||

nt|jcwla: @CQ likely here to try to create an entry.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: quanti raise |pg||
nt|panosk: the friendliest kind |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: or the @D do not behave H|pg||
nt|henryb:  you have 4@d tricks on any break: look at the spots|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm watching live cricket from England I bet Roalnd is too|pg||
nt|panosk: the real question here is shud he accept?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland it probably at the match  |pg||
nt|henryb:  England - India?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, and England again amassing a huge 1st innings score|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we in deep thought? or losing conex?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think thought |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D for me, welcome Rashed :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing 2/1, I think 2D is automatic|pg||
nt|rv: best lead, now if North can win and switch to @h, I suspect Smith will cash 3@hs and switch to @s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|peachy: We dont have access to the player's system details|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E must have a plan as he continues to force|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|blewah: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome also aria|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary and Raija.|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Gary|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nice play by N.|pg||
nt|rv: good play and defense|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: they'll live to regret the result anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: I am happy that we now have more commentators, I was hoping to leave soon. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the more the merrier it is for me, one is quite lonely|pg||
nt|andyv:  since EW can make game, was E's 3@h bid conservative?|pg||
nt|kemperg: doubt, but we would end in 2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldt either|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H makes whereas @S does not.|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary shift for declarer maybe|pg||
nt|psridhar: one adv of Multi is the strong hand becomes declarer -if u bid game|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooer|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is the word oof|pg||
nt|panosk: that was a danger after 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N should possibly be converting|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see he should but at the table not sure you know to do that |pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect some to end in 2@H after an original P by S and an NT opening by N.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panosk: bad lead for decl cant see bare K@H |pg||
nt|peachy: I think four is the perfect number, three is great too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: W bids reds and NT, E blacks only|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely end up playing 6NT or @D, as per their system.|pg||
nt|blewah: sure they are on the same wave |pg||
nt|ssbux: famous dish in Beijing, the Peking duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: PASS and use ure pard for a ree opening.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: high quality bridge as mentioned by Roland right at the start of this broadcast|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The least expected.:)|pg||
nt|blewah: i was wrong, ok.|pg||
nt|peachy: G'night all, enjoy the match!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't look like it thought E was heading for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Bye Raija, nice sleep.|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW plays 2/1 I think - East showed limit raise with 3 trumps so they stopped in 3@S|pg||
nt|loe48: its not an opener 1,2 seat imo|pg||
nt|kerasidis: aceless with no alternative bid|pg||
nt|loe48: 3rd seat 1s okay|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: can he do 6 @d only loding 1 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be able to make it as E also has 4@C|pg||
nt|twcho: though even 3NT is cold with even break in minors|pg||
nt|twcho: but 4@s rates to be a superior contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer wisely won the first club trick, or a D shift might be damaging.|pg||
nt|gracelin: though with HA in south and, even an opening D lead will not hurt the contract.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok 10 easy tricks  |pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks to the H10.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some player play a response of 3@D to show 4-4-1-4 or 4-3-1-5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kemperg: N has enough to try make life diff. for strong @C|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes agree|pg||
nt|rv: now another @c, if finessed by Smith, North can win and back a @h, still declarer can get home for 9 tricks with @s breaking|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to say I prefer even the @C5 to the 7 for the opening salvo.|pg||
nt|rv: yes I like second best leads from poor suit, many experts even prefer attitude leads against nt|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Here you can put on your best air of faux innocence but it's kind of a readout.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|panosk: its not i agree , but im not always rational on table :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dag i have seen you open weaker hands in 3 seat :)|pg||
nt|loe48: 7 hps :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think most players wud open - but Pass will get many votes too|pg||
nt|panosk: 3rd seat is quite different|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S 2@C gf or inv+ with 3@Ss, 2@D, less then 16 pts, 2@S inv with 3crd. end|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: no option for N i think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: against nt, many folks don't show count by leading 4th best or 3/5, leads are attitude showing interest (low card lead) or disinterest (high card lead) in continuing suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: the 2nd 13 imp swing to jiegao|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 aces, a singleton and pd known to have some shortness in @s suit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one can make 6 but hard to get to|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT a much better contract than 4@S here|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 2@s has to be the min of the range for raises|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: I think they've found one they can't miss.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W hand not big enough for 4@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 6, 2@C x in CR.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: doing well for 450 odd|pg||
nt|blewah: as you predicted|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: I still think it's a bad 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should get them to 6|pg||
nt|blewah: another example that a singleton meets xxx can be very valuable here|pg||
nt|athene: all west's 1nt bids have been a bit bent so far :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  and tried to establish her suit |pg||
nt|rodal f: On we are.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi=weak on one major|pg||
nt|ianmcc: who wants to be in 6?|pg||
nt|ssbux: Patrick, will you open W hand with precision 1NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not to stay out of slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: like a wk 2 bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree, no harm to pass 1@H and wait for P's response who is not a passed hand.|pg||
nt|athene: on 4 she rebid 1nt with 2524|pg||
nt|athene: on 5 she rebid 1nt with 1444|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  still, need to guess @s Q and need K@d on side...so not a great slam|pg||
nt|rv: 2n seems to be jacoby showing 4+@s, 12+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: no no cant be S bidding 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: undo operator |pg||
nt|athene: good for her :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: 4@S is off from the top if they find the heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even now it has problems|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W is gonna leap to game on that hand then it is better to go via 1N on tht E hand even|pg||
nt|jcwla: EW eschewing any revealing bidding on a couple such auctions here, in both cases with the strong hand having a side 4-card @H suit that (besides 3NT) might also have been a ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: preferable alternative on other hands.|pg||
nt|granguru:  the lead of the @H3 ensured her max of 3 tricks in @H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: E in good position to check on keycards |pg||
nt|rv: seems to be conventional (possibly home-grown) treatment subsequently|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern style|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: we didn't play Board 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: after 8, we will play 6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed, 3NT .|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2N guarantees 4@s...many play garbage stayman and would have to bid 2@s with S hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|panosk: E doesnt know which major but he correctly thinks its spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are various methods, my multi 2@D = weak 2 either major OR 20-22 with a 5 card suit OR and 8+ playing tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a lot of folks include a strong bid in multi  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not as a rule with most pard's I play with on bbo |pg||
nt|andyv:  but momentum may put them there|pg||
nt|granguru:  @H means 4 +@s|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 2 strong as in NZ version|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may try 5@d now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @h should  show 5 5    usually|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: without fit with partner, east stayed low by bidding 2N instead of 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|twcho: and with much better than minimum hand, west happily accepts the invitation|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: 2 finesses.|pg||

nt|cmule: Î÷¼Ò»á½Ð3H£¬¶«¼Ò2NTÓÐ¿ÉÄÜÓÐ4ÕÅH|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  W must have realized the 4@c bid was already an overbid and did well to stop in 4|pg||
nt|blewah: agree, 4@c was an upgrade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: I see 11 tricks, 12 made in CR|pg||
nt|penseur9: sorry to be a little quiet... like you I came here to watch the final round of this women elite tournament...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: funny USA, trying to protect the innocent, actually it's easy enough to defend|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: with  9 minors cards known in West hand , East judged that she does not care to propose her second major suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: next week in Tienjin China will see another Men's Elite team invitational with high cash prize.  USA, Italy/England, Netherland, Sweden, Norway , 2 teams from China and the Asia ...|pg||
nt|gracelin: Stars will compete in this event.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: we need help from operator or spectators to decipher subsequent auction post 2n|pg||
nt|twcho: a very sensible auction|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: that was fairly fearless|pg||
nt|penseur9: it's actually 2:15am here and my brain is a little asleep...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  right...if they had garbage hand...but since 2N over 2@h would deny a 4 card major, they would have to bid 2@s with the invite hand and 4 spades.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart pitch now will allow it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that did not happen|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzmc: 2NT show 4 support|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: agree Gary,  and many have heard me say I played in Neth.  and evey jr, youth and granny had a defense to multi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the bidding CR had better chance of playing 6@D.|pg||
nt|rv: conventional (read traditional) response to jacoby 2n is 3 level bids show stiff, 3M denies stiff with extra length, 3n shows extras hcp possibly 15-17 (maybe 5422), 4 level bids ...|pg||
nt|rv: shows second 5 card suit, 4M shows sub-min/min opening with no redeeming feature|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to beg off here, thanks all, enjoy the rest.|pg||
nt|rv: there are plenty of variations to traditional jacoby and conventional jacoby is hardly played by most of the experts nowadays|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  Not true, Shirley. Multi can be used in any team game of 6+ boards where the players are "Flight A"|pg||
nt|panosk: yes if you dont know what to bid wait till they say their suit and then take action like double |pg||
nt|granguru:  the idea is to try to make always overcaller the initial leader|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: now she needs the spade finesse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: our Juniors love to play and defend it|pg||
nt|athene: can't use the @HK for a pitch in time|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry she is one down anyway|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcwla: Relaxing to know off a keycard, don't have to think.  Can't complain about this pace - halfway through in 40 mins.|pg||
nt|twcho: what is the prize size? it is comparable to this tournament?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good defence by Heather Dhondy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: but it is limited Henry |pg||

nt|rnmalik: too many tricks.|pg||
nt|rv: well bid nonetheless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: ok|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the 8, why not the 9?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C opener for NS can be weak with diamonds|pg||

nt|penseur9: These are: Beijing Hua Huan: 119... Sweden: 116 and France: 115 at present|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: the one i like and its completely banned is 2@H weak in unknown major|pg||
nt|gracelin: But every match has a match prize.  Winner take US$1,500 and loser $500.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That should bring England back into the match|pg||

nt|granguru:  another easy 4@H EW|pg||
nt|penseur9: It seems probable that one of those 3 will win the tournament... although still much bridge yet to come...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: thats really dangerous|pg||
nt|rv: last part of last auction can be explained 4NT = RKCB 5@D = 1 key cd 5@H = asking 2nd rd control 6@C = yes + 3rd rd control|pg||

nt|jcwla: Precision 2@C here, 6+ in the absence of a major, now 7+  NS will shortly be in game.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S is good raise of @D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since about 60% of our tables are now in team events, either 2-day KOs or Swiss, its not true that it is even close to barred|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: thats tempting :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i would|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or is it bad|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I don't like vul 2 level O/C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you take the money as South or just bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|rv: sitting here I will surely take money|pg||
nt|rv: at the table, I will contemplate a bit more and still take the money|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense it could go for 800?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price right for a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Thx Roland|pg||
nt|rv: Hi P.Sridhar, gm|pg||
nt|ssbux: welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am in full agreement with RV there- odds do not favour that 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: GM Andy/RV :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: high level competitors have tools these days to reach their contracts even after 2@d/2@s, so some usefulness of intervention is already lost|pg||
nt|psridhar: and the risk of going for 500/800 exixts still|pg||
nt|psridhar: exists|pg||
nt|rv: 800 is not possible for N-S, on perfect defense declarer could still get out for -500, not very costly|pg||
nt|ssbux: Sorry, I mean veteran pair|pg||
nt|sybarra: could be either |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nevena Senior has been passing all set and lost patience. She loves to bid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kemperg: dbl should be inviting for me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Too good for 2@H?|pg||
nt|loe48: to strong for 2h non vul|pg||
nt|twcho: who will be your partner, Patrick?|pg||
nt|athene: better not pass this|pg||
nt|vugraphzpz: ÍõÈñÔÚ³¤¿¼£¬³Â×ÜÔÚ³éÑÌ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpz: ³Â×ÜÐÄÏë£ºÄãÀ´²Â²Â¿´£¬Ã°½Ð¹ÖÄã£¬¶ª¾ÖÒ²¹ÖÄã|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: Logically, it should be that for others, too|pg||
nt|loe48: if vul 2h okay|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, weak 2 is 4-8 with green against red|pg||
nt|rv: Brock must have heaved sigh of relief|pg||
nt|psridhar: meanwhile appreciate how much better the E hand is if one of those minor honors she has -is in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least this can't be misinterpreted as a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: pref both:)|pg||
nt|rv: yes I would O/C with KQJ9XX, AX, XXX, XX even at these colors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Marion may think that this is a slam invite since Dekkers did not bid 4@H the round before|pg||
nt|psridhar: and that hand also is 10 HCP :)|pg||
nt|rv: and still may not with just J or Q in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand her way of thinking|pg||
nt|rv: 5 level is safe, no harm even if Marion bids 4@s|pg||
nt|ssbux: Herstein?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk: weak 2 is out of the question in any vul for me|pg||
nt|loe48: vul vs non vul i open 2h|pg||
nt|athene: west might be worried this is based on a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: but in my experience people cater for that far too much|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kemperg: just a max in other circumstances for me|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers will sign-off in 5@h quickly|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brock's pass of X must show @d , 2@d X is possibly a good spot for EW ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not bid 4@H before? Double + 4@H slam invitational she must be thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: Herstein Liu, used to be my teammate but in this tournament I will partner with him.|pg||
nt|twcho: good luck Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks, ust try not to disgrace ourself.  |pg||
nt|jcwla: K&R 9.75 here, I tell you having all these 10's and 11's really can get to you.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Much easier to have 4 and 5's.|pg||
nt|psridhar: TWO aces the only feature of opener's hand |pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fairness, the 1NT rebid shows (11)12-14 according to their CC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 11 is legitimate|pg||
nt|athene: usually these things are just strong balanced and you should go to your long major|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: made |pg||
nt|nkgupt: this looks ;ile a big loss for EW|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not now :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kemperg: agree with you on the last hand, 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  W better lead a trump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can borrow one from E.:)|pg||
nt|panosk: if you need to open 1 is much beter |pg||
nt|gracelin: It's nice to see a natural 2D over the 1NT rebid.  Many play this as a GF check-back.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  anyone like N's 4@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still time for brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps S should keycard and then sign off in 5@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland's point is very valid -but before that we should know whats X of 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding 5@h directly might give N some encouragement to bid on|pg||
nt|rv: Marion Michielsen has an excellent hand opposite unilateral jump to 4@h, a) no wastage in @h, b)4 trumps and c) all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double of 2@D would usually be "I want to double at least one major"|pg||
nt|psridhar: if it was a value showing X , N is justified in slam try; if it was a take out X, i think she has less cause|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh penalty X ?|pg||
nt|rv: I would treat North's hand as super-max for the auction so far|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: N agrees|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would not be my choice with 4-card @H's but they're obv on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|peachy: North is delighted to go, five good trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the match is very tight   now 2 imps difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even @DA and a low heart through will not be enough|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and what % are Flight A ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he can't have liked his 2@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 2 aces S must bid 5NT. GS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: then they also use 2C to force a 2D rebid to stop in 2D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when spades arefavourable|pg||
nt|psridhar: some times defense has to be content with declarer making the contract :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: What will come back a @H or a @C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't take bets :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that not many in North America and Europe have heard about the city Shenzhen in the Guangdong province, the venue for this tournament. Shenzhen has more than 10 million ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inhabitants!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: French pair Ns  uses only 2 @c as a check back stayman|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: @C lead would be interesting.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if K@c is lead, E needs to rise with A and return @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: N has a difficult task -if she is required to guess that her partner made a "penalty oreineted X" and changed her mind later|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, no worries for 5@d:)|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if N-S playing any last train cue bids, if they play Dekkers could have bid 5@d with any sort of interest and her 5@h would state I have no interest|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h = long @H, with that suit, she couldnt possibly have expected to defend 2@H X|pg||
nt|psridhar: good, thoughtful lead -will set 5N here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like your question, Jordan|pg||
nt|psridhar: @d back is another format for submitting your resignation|pg||
nt|athene: well, sometimes a club lead would have worked better|pg||
nt|cmule: µÚÆß¸±ÄÏ¸Û½Ðµ½6c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rnmalik: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one probably won't make the textbooks|pg||
nt|blewah: and 5 card support|pg||
nt|rv: yes great lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a horror double|pg||
nt|blewah: E "knew" S has his own suit|pg||
nt|twcho: a very comfortable contract for NS|pg||
nt|athene: either a club or diamond lead is asking for quite a lot from partner|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: why x in S where opps are being vul are in a losing contract.|pg||
nt|twcho: CR NS bid to 3NT and make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is  Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
nt|sybarra: see http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TableResult.aspx?tourid=1174&section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=3&stanza=0&tableNO=1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: I am told the E player is young Aussie player,   Her mother Janet Brown is a well known player from the eastern coast of NSW (she plays in a seaside town called Ballina).|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True she nows lives in harrogate England and is the partner of the Irish international Hugh McGann|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Roland, your suspicion is spot on, I'm sure|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, he can afford to misguess everything.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|penseur9: In the same order: they are now 120...119...118 :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kerasidis: this b would be very interesting in pair contest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well played|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ssbux: ok, which room, Open?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West suprisingly did not continue @h losing a trick|pg||
nt|twcho: Even 4@h is not without chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe she feared partner would be ruffing with Qxx or A10x for a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|athene: north shld duck this playing her pd for @SK and two diamonds?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|rv: North should duck this to restrict damage|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may have been a battle between 500 and 550|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6N was indeed found CR for another 2 imps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  In Swiss, about a third; in KOs about a quarter; but anyone is allowed to play Flight A in a Swiss|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: Bill tells me CR in 6@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: vul against non -vul.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so EW probably saved a couple of imps by pulling 5@dx|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lebridgeur: 4 @h   is very optimistc contract !|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: certainly. :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  E/W are a young pair (both under 30) who have established themselves in the England team|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: you see luck has already evened out, E-W bid a good slam on deal 3 which went down, here 2@d O/C has caused problem to opps who have overreached|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|blewah: from +400 to -130|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
mc|6|nt|jcwla: Presumably E thought maybe just maybe this 4@S was on dist'n |pg||

nt|sharkey: NS likely to get to 3 NT here|pg||
nt|ssbux: as stated previous by Roland, the English pair is not affected the unlucky bd 2 and 3.  They are now coming back|pg||
nt|psridhar: slam on then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All the top teams next month in the Venice Cup in the Netherlands|pg||

nt|penseur9: Here:England in 5th and USA in 6th tied with the Netherlands|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kiwibridge: 10 with W having all the rest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  2+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|penseur9: again...results and standing for all 8 teams at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=7&tourid=1174|pg||
mb|d|nt|panosk: 10 actually and yes why didnt he tried at least ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 10, with all suits behaving nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: right 10 |pg||
nt|psridhar: yes-so slam on with less one card less|pg||
nt|rv: even if South had one of the minor honor cards missing in PS's example hand, LS would be cold|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a not so routine 3NT for NS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@h will go down if defense find the @d switch in time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @h by North|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: showing good @d   and propose for NT contract|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwibridge: more Precise here|pg||
nt|athene: not a very enjoyable hand to play on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: or EW may be in trouble...|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess it's a fit showing jump showing invitation strength.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: you want to go for hearts but that means finding the jack right away|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  usually done with 5 card @c though|pg||
nt|paulhac:  So with board 3 to score England take the lead for the first time|pg||
nt|psridhar: the @C suit is fast becoming a mere stepping sttone in all auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: its not just the actual pts count he also had gd spots|pg||
nt|henryb:  Slam on a hook that loses|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@H down on the losing finesse|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcwla: What's good for the goose is good for the gander here with the ace underleads to NT dummy.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: S doesnt know N has values - unless he x|pg||
nt|panosk: he will soon :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  but this hand seems to be a good time to uise it with 4 esp woth those @d's|pg||
nt|twcho: with all those spot cards, 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3@c  shows @d and @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: even those who bid it naturally do it on 2 cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: is 1@c forcing Roland? i thk not -Bd 1 we saw 1@c all pass by W|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do not understand eigher the !@S or the 3@S. W are the badest here.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: 6@C was -3 to make the carnage worth 15|pg||
nt|blewah: did it really make?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange and defence to other contracts after preempt by P.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure Jean-Paul is right.  3C showed a 3NT invitational hand with D fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might return a H after winning HK.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer will play on @c  for sure butwill she guess ?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W keeps them out by bidding probably|pg||
nt|psridhar: but NS need to sort out if Dekkers wd bid that way holding such pattrens|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S is normally a weak NT, but the question is if you should still invite with 2NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: only point for consideration, would South have bid 5@d as last train cue bid with such hands?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kerasidis: weird in my opinion....N doesnt know south's 18 points hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Score another one for weak NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: to make sure she establish a 2nd H trick.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no  3@c   shows limit fit in @d  with @c suit usually 5 4 the other way|pg||
nt|twcho: so another sensible auction leading to a cold contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: OK, Jeam-Paul must be right about the French girls bidding :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, 1@C is NF|pg||
nt|athene: well, if she chooses ace and a club, probably she should guess it right, on restricted choice|pg||
pc|s4|nt|loe48: south shall x again|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats a shrewd 2@c escape attempt|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: Bertheau played 1C on board 2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could be 300|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 was not that difficult to bid on last hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats another crucial point rv|pg||
nt|peachy: Board 3 is already included in the 21 England has, it was a 1IMP for making 7, French pair made 6 |pg||
nt|sybarra: did E have a better play,  like J of hts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does she get the @D switch?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  benedct Cronier passed the hand Fiona Brown opened 1@H|pg||
nt|peachy: or is it?.  The website running score shows 16-20|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does she need the @D ruff?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: i'm a huge meckwell proponent as far as slam bidding is concerned need more than 50% chance to bid it |pg||

nt|lebridgeur: thanks Patrick :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Heart return is a sure play while to establish a club trick is not.|pg||
nt|athene: (KJ more likely than J10, after the fall of the jack)|pg||
nt|athene: also that way you get 3 clubs if the jack was singleton|pg||
nt|athene: i still don't think it's so clear to play clubs though instead of hearts|pg||

nt|psridhar: losing just 2 trumps, 2 aces and 2 @s ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and this will likely only go 1 down|pg||
nt|jcwla: They were about to play 1NT, wtp|pg||

nt|Walddk2: hearts come in|pg||
nt|psridhar: play @h her side suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: cant see any other line of play |pg||
nt|psridhar: even single dummy it is natural to play side suit at the earliest|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I play 12-15NT and I'd be adavncing with the N hand|pg||

pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: I did not expect her to finesse|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh, so she was calculating the % behind that fiinesse|pg||
nt|psridhar: the time she took was for that Roland|pg||
nt|psridhar: calculating odds of that play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know, and perhaps it was with the odds|pg||
nt|psridhar: so i wd not fault in a hurry |pg||
nt|Walddk2: if anyone has 4 hearts it's East and if she has, she is a favourite to have the 10 too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did not fault her|pg||

nt|granguru:  I am guessing their overcall system but if they play as I explained normally 1NT would show 10+ FG. then 2C is Gazzilli to explain min-max hand and distribution also|pg||
pc|c3|nt|blewah: i pass with N hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: certainly seems an unnatural thing to do -though the count probably shows @H length with opener|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulhac:  Got to say goodbye everyone|pg||

nt|athene: but her partner has the @D8 so all is well :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h6|nt|psridhar: one flop side to the finesse is -u r 2 off when it fails ...i wonder is she factored that|pg||
