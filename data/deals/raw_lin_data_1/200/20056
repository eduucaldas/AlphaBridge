mb|3H|nt|strike12: Hi Markand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not|pg||
nt|dslee: not a bad sac satya|pg||

nt|peachy: Maximum IMP exchange per boar 17 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play modified precision|pg||
nt|jcwla: Willing to sit if E elects, or correct 4@D to 4@H - or ? over 4@C.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW  is a pair fom Ahmedabad vinay is a veteran and Sapan a promising youngster |pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: hi all hi promod :)|pg||
nt|babs59: so they should all be familiar with each other's games/styles|pg||
nt|psridhar: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: pls check out the scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome Barbara|pg||
nt|psridhar: 'spy vs spy ' |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: and ofcourse welcome Sridhar |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW play two systems depending on vulnerability |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Again a Home team where the pairs play together as a team |pg||
nt|patricck: aah, now that makes more sense :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|strike12: 11 tricks to go with for this deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: please check out the scores at http://royale.hpages.com|pg||
nt|strike12: 10 sry|pg||
nt|nkgupt: u mean 9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Need to discuss with your favorite partner whether this double is penalty, responsive (not classic after the weak-2 opener), or just DSI.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW play precision modified |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome back sorry |pg||
pc|s8|nt|dslee: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Subhash and Venky need no introduction |pg||
nt|jcwla: Well done by W.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Suhas Vaidya has played for India alreay |pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: looks like 6 losers|pg||
nt|psridhar: ty|pg||
nt|dslee: can we have the top 6 positions mak?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: pls see the weblink as above |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|dslee: thanks mak|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sunit thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: It is rare that 2C is passed,  2C can be a big hand, just short of a jumpshift or 2NT bid as it was here|pg||
nt|babs59: hi all|pg||
nt|babs59: a newly-formed team, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi Barbara welcome GM|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: pls check scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  with an opening hand and 3@d, 2N is a bit of an underbid but E was able to raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders have changed now it is Jaggy and Dalal|pg||
nt|patricck: The difference of 416 can really be divided by 13 because each score is matched with every one of the other 13 tables, so it is like being about 32 imps behind the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi yes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nkgupt: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi welcome NK|pg||
nt|dslee: none of these folks except sunit is very spontenous - i wonder why this bid happened|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is headed for 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: oh yes, sorry typo, already said 9 earlier|pg||
nt|patricck: 20 points each|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: lead of 9 0 or 2 higher cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: looks like -100, with care|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi in long trance |pg||
nt|nkgupt: did not understand seeking pd's opinion and then overrule him :)|pg||
nt|patricck: which I guess is why West doubled, but wasn't he fortunate to find that  both the AK of @S were in the South hand?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: av sud be about 120 to N so 5@sX-1 translates to about -65/70|pg||
nt|granguru:  right |pg||
nt|granguru:  easy contract it seems|pg||
nt|granguru:  10 tricks probably |pg||
pc|d5|nt|dslee: well there you see|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Anal Shah has been two times Commonwealth Teams winner|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good line, I fancy|pg||
nt|granguru:  if not 11|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|strike12: we have every round updates at the above link, so keep urself posted |pg||
nt|dslee: difficult to crack|pg||
nt|dslee: -1|pg||
nt|animeshraj: becoz 6S . should come with HA.J sort of|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  how high would they stop? even grand is makeable|pg||
pc|h3|nt|patricck: 2 spades and 2 trump losers unless declarer is a genius|pg||
nt|patricck: 2 spade losers and 2 heart losers on the face of it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzjh: 7 claimed|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gm all.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: After this round will be lunch break and we shall be back at 1345 i.e. after 1 hr 45 minutes |pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT probably would also have been 1 light|pg||
nt|babs59: Sunit bought a very good dummy, tho the 4@C bid would have shown spade support and shortage|pg||
nt|babs59: Ajay is trying to shorten dummy's trumps to make the hearts worthless|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last seven rounds to go . For running scores please visit http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html |pg||
nt|ianmcc: back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi Ian|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ianmcc: 10 should score well continuing clubs pays off|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, this certainly is safe enough|pg||
nt|babs59: the top 3 remain unchanged... yet again|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  but to bid it, E has to imagine exactly such a hand by partner - with long side suit|pg||
nt|peachy: W needs to have control of the auction, E described his in opening and then 3S, I assume|pg||
nt|peachy: This is still makeable if declarer is careful|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: and this tournament is his brain child|pg||
nt|granguru:  K is the best normally from AKQ|pg||
nt|granguru:  deceptive play I mean|pg||
nt|granguru:  very slow play |pg||
pc|h7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: Anil will lose 2@h and 4 trumps for d1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi makarand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Makarand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzjh: hello again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT was possible, not 5@c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: one of the flatest i suppose 4@h-1 all round?|pg||
nt|patricck: can be hard to guess the average on a board like this|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: or has X-ray eyes :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|babs59: placed currently 4th and 22nd|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lucky 3 @d with Wet|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|psridhar: RV in lead still?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|babs59: but only 9 ahead of Ashok Goel trio|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a matter of overtricks only|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|strike12: if S can steal a @c trick he could had made 11 |pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: looong way to go|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|strike12: too late nw|pg||
nt|babs59: I must admit to being somewhat unfamiliar with Invititational Pairs where threesomes play!|pg||
nt|psridhar: now even d2 ? kind of dummy reversal defense with long trump taking two ruffs?|pg||
nt|babs59: seems that way now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: venky in a trance|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: the J@H led from hand would have lost only one trump trick, but it only works on this layout and gives up on West holding Q10xx|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but secures the contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: of courde only 1 @h|pg||
nt|granguru:  now looking for a @D-@C squeeze|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice exit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|sga1: 1@d showed 4+@hs and 1@s promised 5@cs and 4@s|pg||

nt|strike12: to claim 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: as far as i think he didnt unblock|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: discussion about if 3nt shud have been passed |pg||
nt|nkgupt: std people will not come to know there 6/6 fit so early to block all the way|pg||
nt|jcwla: A warm welcome to Andy Vinock.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone...hi Jordan|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi andy welcome|pg||
nt|jcwla: Could be a bonanza of cross-IMPs there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggy and Rajesh need no introduction in the international circuit having played for India several times|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well bid should be +4IMPs or so|pg||
nt|vugraph815: this is actually the last match, should read 6/6 at the title line|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ianmcc: close to 6@c here|pg||
nt|babs59: PS, how come you aren't playing here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: my partner is not free|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: both Venky and Sreedharan also have played for INdia the BB|pg||
nt|peachy: Venky also an international level player|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome |pg||
nt|patricck: I am told the difference is 330 imps, as the website is a round behind, so Gupta and Venky are effectively about 25 imps behind the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thats why i announced the scores after 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this vul they play 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: no results put up as yet|pg||
nt|animeshraj: 3NT is a good spot for NS.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Oops, sorry mak, you already said it|pg||
nt|sga1: The Positions are     1    1197   Subhash Gupta - K R Venkatraman ,  2     1168   Raju Tolani - Ajay Khare   |pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely in 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will get a dbl in but will be hard pressed to come back into auction after that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: now NS play Std 2/1 in this Vul|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: maybe 3@s N/S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: E/W have nothing|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT-2@D-2@H (unlikely 2NT good fit max hand)|pg||
nt|animeshraj: I THINK 1nt-2d-2h-3h-3nt...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S look to be OK in 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 is 1556   2 is 1259 |pg||
nt|patricck: P P P 1@S, and then stop in 3@S I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: yes|pg||
nt|sga1: 3 1142 Jaggy Shivdasani - Rajesh Dalal ,|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 898 V M Lal - Raju Bhiwandkar|pg||
nt|sga1: 5  832  Ashok Goel - Sudhir - Suhas Vaidya|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS 2/1|pg||
nt|babs59: a very light 3S bid by Sunit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, maybe NT or just pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: The truly amazing part about this segment is that it started on time.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A little birdie told me you had better not make close doubles of E.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  with Aces and Kings, 1@h might have been a better choice|pg||
nt|jcwla: Certainly not playing the part of an overly busy bidder.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S may play spades, likely 140 again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S in 3NT have only 8?|pg||
nt|patricck: but 10 tricks are actually there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: nothing much will make|pg||
nt|patricck: just hard to get there|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: So the lower N/S stop the better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS aren't strong enough to reach the game but EW may push them|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S might be a pre-blocking bid|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ah! there u go.|pg||
nt|patricck: should just reach a club partscore here|pg||
mb|d|nt|strike12: the page is still to be updated|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I am informed of a change in the lunch times and next round will start at13 30 i.e after 1 hr 30 minutes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: but trump leads break it|pg||
nt|nkgupt: X=4M+longer m|pg||
nt|dslee: trick is to lead @H|pg||
nt|dslee: lets opps struggle to get the tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sandwich NT not in favor among the upper echelon.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Vinay has played for India for Zonal trials and Sapan for INdia Juniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 3@d will be the right spot to play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Germ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi all |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, looks like preempt, but N will be surprised with result|pg||
nt|sga1: Scores are available till last round on this website :  http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d expensive|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 1@c-1@s-2@c-4@s-5@c now N wud hav had his word in @s and free to X now|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT by West probably would have made, but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|nkgupt: kb surely not passing 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he is dep in thought|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|nkgupt: he hasnt come all the way from home to pass:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mak|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good lead.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: surely 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3NT alway OK, overtricks if @d not led|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to reach a slam on 5-2 |pg||
nt|strike12: do we have the current results after round 8 Mak?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to X|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can do quite well in hearts but not so easy to come into the auction|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ianmcc: losing 1 in each suit. average|pg||
nt|babs59: this is one of those hands where the transfer doesn't exactly improve the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: please check out the running scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome Prakash Paranjape for comments pls|pg||
nt|panja: hi Makarand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: a Doctor in Chemical Engineering|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi Prakash|pg||
nt|patricck: well, Mazumdar did well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: open room did well|pg||
nt|animeshraj: well bid N-S|pg||
nt|dslee: good lead anil|pg||
nt|panja: the question is, can he make 12 tricks...|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Prakash, glad to see you volunteering your expertise for the kibs|pg||
nt|panja: 11 should be easy..but with @DK off..12 will be difficult...|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d switch now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Ashok Goel has been a former National Champion|pg||
nt|patricck: nice controls A A and K, but jumping to game opposite a passed partner?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Positions before the last round are|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: and hello Srini|pg||
nt|strike12: Hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm, I don't like that on such a ragged suit, AJ10xxx maybe|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe there are some inferences from the 3@D?  Seemingly an immediate 3NT by E would have drawn a @D lead.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT is a perfectly reasonable place, can't anticipate duplication in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and to our operator, Makarand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks folks ;) I am doing the netcast first time so pls execuse for any mistakes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes it is|pg||
nt|nkgupt: quite a position to take to defend 1ntX when pd did not open even 3rd seat|pg||
nt|nkgupt: other table bidding brd 2 on almost anticipated line for std ew:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: brd|pg||
nt|patricck: probably 0 or 2 higher lead. That is going to help declarer more than the defence|pg||
nt|nkgupt: brd1|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: Raju Tolani Ajay Khare 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Anal in deep thought|pg||
nt|granguru:  this is an Open brasilian championship.. therefore you may see many argentinian players around|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: 2 defensive tricks...  that's all to this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4@h should make|pg||
nt|ianmcc: makes double-dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  even Agustin Madala, who will play with Norberto Bocchi for Italy, in the next Bermuda Bowl in October|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|strike12: The @s position is favourably placed, so dec has good chances for scoring it|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Sveta|pg||

nt|andyv:  that play made little sense|pg||
pc|c8|nt|strike12: N has got the tempo now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: Sunit can smoke out the trump ace now |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: live scores can be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will make 90|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  E will get his 4 tricks and that seems to be it|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, 2@C is Drury, but still a big result for NS here, perhaps they are trying to make something happening in the last rounds|pg||
nt|kemperg: no problem for leader|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the air|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may anticipate difficulties with rebid after 1@h opening, but this time both 1NT and @h partscore -  no play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not much worse in NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  true as to play of hand...and 1N usually fine with a 5 card major...here, however, the major is top heavy and the outside points are in Aces...those cards belong in a suit contract.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ianmcc: maybe not a @d|pg||
nt|patricck: that is the end of the defence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzjh: claims 7|pg||
nt|babs59: Sunit is considering 4-1 spade breaks and the overtrick|pg||
nt|babs59: now there is no problem|pg||
nt|vugraph815: thinking|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzjh: the running scores can be seen on the link http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|psridhar: he then has 8 ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I can't think releasing @hA was good but no hope|pg||
pc|h4|nt|strike12: @s 10 vital card|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a correct guess in diamonds probably brings 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting position appears after 6 @h tricks, let's see|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: interesting position for Vinay |pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: looks like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: about 15 kibitzers around the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Rajesh dep in thought|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzjh: all smiling on the table |pg||
nt|babs59: yes - I had the hearts inverted in my mind (defensive hearts)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|patricck: oops|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that there are two entries to dummy to play a spade|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  costly switch by S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: unless that induces some discarding problems|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|psridhar: that misguess however spells doom|pg||
nt|patricck: now the heart loser goes on the spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  or so may be the case - playing W not to have last spade |pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer is taking a line that will allow making.  Ordinarily 5-3 fit in trump contract is preferred, but with enough for game+, NT often better|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W was concerned about the entry problem, should have ducked the 9@s|pg||
nt|vugraph815: sorry, lost trackof play... 2 down|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|strike12: This will be home soon|pg||
nt|sga1: Really expensive sacrifice by Kiran|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: as Khare has realised - good work|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nkgupt: +1?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: In a 20-21 context, North's hand was an absolute supermax, luckily they do not have slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he plays too fast :( |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: for me to follow all cards |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: at the same pace|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: both pairs playing some variations of precision|pg||
nt|psridhar: JM wasnt tested in other room|pg||
nt|peachy: E might have played the last spade when he was in with a diamond|pg||

nt|ianmcc: sif they lead 4th besst South should play @hQ at trick1|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: I think that will be some imps in there for making 3NT, much harder on a heart lead|pg||
nt|patricck: both sides can make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: For running scores please visit http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sandip is multiple Ruia Gold Cup winner |pg||
nt|babs59: this hand fits really well but even so 6@H would rely on an endplay in clubs.. which works|pg||
nt|jcwla: Very nicely done by NS.|pg||
nt|andyv:  something happened...in end position didn't N haave to lead a @d or did I miss something|pg||
nt|babs59: sure - but his DJ was high and then his partner's D7 won trick 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: no he was left with all winners|pg||
nt|babs59: a nice little defensive beer card|pg||
nt|jcwla: S did that at T8.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: where do they find these deals?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@c looks OK......|pg||
nt|patricck: I am told NS are 22nd out of 28, maybe that explains the wild leap as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: leaders S Gupta Venky 1917|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Second Jaggy Dalal at 1790|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Third Raju Tolani Ajay Khare at 1579|pg||
nt|granguru:  interesting hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psridhar: Sunit 's first seat preempts are not bonded by Llyods of London :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 4@H will need careful handling|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be a snacks break and the next match would start at IST 1745 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: alerted|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good stuff where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: @h6 is a powerful card after j7 drops|pg||
nt|babs59: however, it relies on South having no wastage in the diamond suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Fourth Sunil Macchar Arun Bapat at 1349|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: a big pickup for NS as they gain in terms of Total Imps|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N made good decision - knowing partner has good @h fit, N sees 6 tricks in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, so declarer gets 2 hearts 2 clubs 3 diamonds and a spade before EW get 3 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|patricck: hard to know about the first board, but that was definitely a few imps for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3NT NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  two lively NS auctions...now time for EW although S, with this vul, can jack up the ante quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Andy:) |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: another trouble hand, but not big trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N balanced in passout seat over 1N, E dbld and W played in 2@d, making|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@C with a @S lead |pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Shirley:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably for the majors and will slow down S|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks as if EW play 10-12 or 11-13(14) NT range...unfortunately I don't have any CCs from them|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: W might just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: that puts Arun in a fix|pg||
nt|ianmcc: noone told Anil Padhy|pg||
nt|peachy: Was fortunate they had the agreement to show max with good supp|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, ok, that is what i missed...ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Fifth Sandip Thakral Kaustaubh Bendre at 870|pg||
nt|sybarra: any suggestions andy for this hand?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ianmcc: Isn't this pairs?|pg||
nt|panja: 25 HCP..this should be a routine game..10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this foursome have played for INdia so many times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome back |pg||
nt|sga1: 1@C - 17+, dbl 5-7 HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can have two heart tricks, I believe a heart lead from east is awkward too|pg||
nt|ianmcc: South has 9 tricks but East has 11|pg||
nt|ianmcc: better than 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  very awkward bid for E....3N by W probably makes as it's unlikely that N will find a @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: it is IMP pairs |pg||
nt|strike12: 6@s is on if bid|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not familiar with NS system, sorry|pg||
nt|peachy: Standard, with transfers over 1C opening, I was told|pg||
nt|peachy: If anyone interested to see what K & R hand evaluator says about it, here http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@hX -1 or -2 looks about right|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 1@H is a transfer style response|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: 1NT isn't to everyones taste on the South cards, but it can be a very effective tactic|pg||
nt|andyv:  S did not bid 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet S did not bid 4 @S |pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzjh: The Pair of A Goel and Suhas Vaidya will be playing for Indian in this BB|pg||
nt|babs59: 2NT is likely 20-21 (and many 19s :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: This will be costly for EW|pg||
nt|strike12: Very Costly now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: OK tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: total 28 contestanting pairs |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all play all each pair plays 6 boards against each other barometer|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Modified Precision|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N opens with the end-contract possible, but both sides here have to tell something|pg||
nt|babs59: 3@C is Smolen|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would anyone have passed 1@H with the E hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W continued with 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo operator |pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: is N still thinking for a Save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could go down 4|pg||
nt|panja: if W gets to underlead the @CA sometime..it could get interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should duck this|pg||
nt|patricck: takeout double from Soth?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: and pass from North|pg||
nt|babs59: now Anil has shown 4 spades, 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: and Sunit's 4@H bid confirms 3 hearts but a minimum 2NT, else he would cuebid|pg||
nt|andyv:  wellm maybe he did!|pg||
nt|sybarra: same thing I was writing |pg||
nt|andyv:  the short @s bid is certainly news to N|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not news |pg||
nt|andyv:  unless he passed figuering down 10 undoubled wasn't so bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: NS miscommunication|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but success!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|andyv:  I mean N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sixth VM Lal Bhiwandkar at 769|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi thinking about lead |pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: Anil knows it alright-but his 5@d was calculated to test Arun -he knows he has long @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: we will do without those snacks but pl provide us coffee :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: that is abut 45 minutes from now |pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you kibs and Mak|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 27 natural def beats 5@s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|strike12: no X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes was a pause |pg||
nt|ianmcc: how do we get a score so fast?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this score is only a comparison of the two vugraph tables|pg||
nt|psridhar: +300|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has an easy dbl....will be interesting what N does|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ianmcc: bad bad|pg||
nt|babs59: that's one double too many for Sapan|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Vinay explaining his doubles |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: ruff now and dia back, can make east nervous, but wont help the defence|pg||
nt|kemperg: good fight for part score|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the game is tooo fast to make all explanations of alerted bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: It is no problem, Mak.  Let me quote somebody: Operator is like a long tailed cat in a small room of rocking chairs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|babs59: hi Ian.  Kiran had to find the lead of a small Diamond|pg||
nt|nkgupt: but is a good save:)|pg||
nt|patricck: it is true eats woud have to pitch a heart if declarer started with two rounds of clubs vs 3NT on a heart lead, but what declarer would cash 2 club tricks at the start of that ...|pg||
nt|patricck: hand?|pg||
nt|patricck: ah yes I said both sides make 11 tricks, but I was wrong, the @D ruff holds spades to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: South was planning on bidding spades twice before bidding @H|pg||
nt|patricck: the transfer response means South is playing this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 H was transfer positive response|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that pull to 2@s never crossed my mind i must admit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: could have been lucrative, but it went so quickly it seemed North wasn't even slightly interested in defending|pg||
nt|babs59: with the 2-2 hearts it is viable to ruff out the diamonds and find the magical club position for the endplay on West|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzjh: ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: @D and @C don't behave, but the magic @S position should be enough to see declarer home I think|pg||
nt|granguru:  not the contract I expected|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzjh: after a long thought|pg||
nt|andyv:  first dbl is ok...2nd dbl puts too much pressure on partnership|pg||
nt|jcwla: W really tempting fate here.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  I believe 3@c is rubensohl|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow..this is one strange auction!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the best way - try to reach the table with @s|pg||
nt|sga1: seems like 4 losers 2@d, 1@h and 1@c|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: about 20hcp each ...odd breaks vul opps only 7@s per say cant see a logic for the pull|pg||
nt|granguru:  hard decision|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: Club lead, or club now, will give declarer plenty trouble making|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @c leads this hand is going down like a rock|pg||
nt|patricck: 3@D and 2 tricks in every other suit = 9. But declarer doesn't know he can get 2 spades|pg||
nt|granguru:  a transfer to 3@d to show a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|granguru:  another interpretation is an acceptance to play @H and SPL @c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianmcc: wrong guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now the roof falls in|pg||
nt|psridhar: plenty of tricks , can make for sure |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  got this experience few times (fortunately) commentator's job looks better :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|patricck: maybe he does now, or at least suspects it|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|ianmcc: he might make if he doesn't touch hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: of course Subhash could make but only if he flies the DK immediately|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: the black suits were lying quite well for declarer and he still wouldn't have been close to making 2@H|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and dont expect dummy to turn up w/ good @hs (afterall just 4/5 hcp there at most) do well placed 5@h's|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nkgupt: so well...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on board  31 North's preference for @h was excellent|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzjh: yes sorry my fault|pg||
nt|psridhar: np|pg||
nt|psridhar: tough job|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think 5@s quite wrong|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm sure Subhash would have expected a trump lead from Venky on the auction|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: cant be |pg||
nt|psridhar: @d king for @h pitch|pg||
nt|jcwla: W bid the same hand twice, that's the problem.  Had a perfect original X.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 off, 2@S was contract|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  in mp, you have to be...but in teams, best contract wins most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claim|pg||
nt|patricck: After the duck if Declarer had foolishly played a 2nd trump then a 3rd trump would have trapped him in dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: Sunit will also need to cash his @CA early enough |pg||
nt|granguru:  I like to play moysean fits but this one is not going to work|pg||
nt|granguru:  generally speaking they work when you can make a cross ruff|pg||
nt|granguru:  or when u can use all trump in 1 hand ruffing and taking out opponents ones later with the other hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|babs59: if he has to lead clubs from his hand, West will be able to unblock on the @CA|pg||
nt|babs59: however, their trump spots are good enough|pg||
nt|andyv:  now hand has some play|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@D wasn't alerted, but if it is showing @D and @H then declarer has a good idea about the hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ianmcc: West will be endplayed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi sees it ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: in a trance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  troubles are over now |pg||
nt|panja: @D9, what else now?|pg||
nt|patricck: must be red suits of course because East bid 2@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: Kib says Raju not yet awake :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Raju =  E|pg||
nt|panja: and a Club after that...from W....|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will be -200 - could have done better|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is easy to be careless on such hands|pg||
nt|patricck: maybe they recently conceded -670 in another match, you would have thought at least it was worth considering the pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play for what?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|babs59: would I fly the DK?  I doubt it - but I would wonder why they'd led dummy's suit (such a lead is usually a singleton)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims 10|pg||
nt|babs59: it is possible he might try for a squeeze given the @DA lead, instead|pg||
nt|granguru:  usually you need a 33 or at most a 4-2 opposite trump distribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  hawaiilike hands are a problem not to say 6-0|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: South decided to try sqz|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if so you are dead anyway|pg||
nt|babs59: however, everyone at this table knows each other's game and style very well, so it might depend on that|pg||
nt|nkgupt: was a 99.99999% pass for me|pg||
nt|patricck: not sure of the exact percentage for me, but something close to that :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|buddyshah: trying 11 |pg||
nt|peachy: He has contract made of course, just for the 11th|pg||
nt|babs59: for minimising the damage!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|strike12: NS will pare all gains earned before on this deal |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: amarnath in a pause|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Mrs Nadar played the hand for 11 on a squeeze ;)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|strike12: -2 would had been par score|pg||
nt|nkgupt: ok 99.99998% i wud agree to|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nkgupt: hi panja.makrand/ll|pg||
nt|panja: of course, against careful defenders...this is not a choice for the Declarer..|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, private to spec|pg||
nt|sga1: fatal @c8 discard br Rajeev|pg||
nt|granguru:  a Hawai hand is where opposite trumps are 5-0|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzjh: claims|pg||
nt|sga1: by|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can get two ruffs in|pg||
nt|babs59: this was just the hand Subhash had been hoping for - in 2nd place!|pg||
nt|jcwla: As they said in "Clue," "It's a bit late for that."|pg||
nt|babs59: East trumps aren't exactly winners, given South's are bigger|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Barbara|pg||
nt|babs59: hi guys|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hiya.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzjh: A Goel|pg||
nt|babs59: oops - that was where he had to cash @CA first|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly would not be my choice of auctions|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|patricck: hmmm|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|peachy: Hello NK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|strike12: S would not be pleased with this bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: please check out the running scores of the event at http://royale.hpage.com|pg||
nt|jcwla: Amazing how good -110 can look in the rearview mirror.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand just too tough for E to do much|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|babs59: it's easy for me though, I can see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|psridhar: wd|pg||

nt|babs59: good work|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d8|pc|h9|nt|andyv:  down 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Subhash claims one more via promotion|pg||
nt|andyv:  no trump promotion here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  but damage is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: CQ promoted|pg||
nt|babs59: must have been a slight misclick by Makya?   I'm sure the claim/promo was legitimate|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not with A and K left in dummy, maybe something was missed in translation.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  by far the strangest bid was the 4@s bid by S|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|babs59: however, had Sunit cashed the CA before ruffing the last diamond, Ajay could not unblock successfully because Sunit would have been in dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: and could then lead towards his CJ (if the CQ had gone)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: well done by Ajay to unblock as the table compliments him|pg||
nt|babs59: one that got away|pg||

nt|ianmcc: 4@h for N/S|pg||
nt|nkgupt: adv brd 26/equaled in 27:)|pg||
nt|patricck: this won't be the only table to score 5@H doubled I am sure, but still a very good board for EW|pg||
nt|patricck: that should be flat across the room|pg||
nt|nkgupt: tnt wise 7@s+7+@h=14+tricks if u can make 8 tricks they make 6 and if u r -1 they r -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: should be an easy 3 NT due to favourable locations of @SJ and @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Score is correct |pg||
nt|andyv:  probably|pg||
nt|babs59: @CAK could not have been left in dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: it was trick 6 for those who want to check - Subhash did not trump his partner's winner|pg||
nt|andyv:  N could have pitched 2@s but, as Jordon mentioned, E should work out the @c suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trouble in open room I'd like to play 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the funny part is S might have gotten away with it if he had bid 5@c instead of 5@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: my hunch is a misunderstanding of 2 @D  |pg||
nt|andyv:  I think so...maybe they play two different styles over NT depending on the strength of the NT bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: can NS find 3N here?|pg||
nt|peachy: The heart switch was not bad, E expects W to have something, due to N limited opening|pg||
nt|peachy: South is a She, sorry all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: np my fault of entering names :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: East should have bid 4@h fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: After round 15 the leaders are |pg||
nt|jcwla: Aggressive @S game does not come home on this layout.|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice deal:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: that was a bundle of IMPs for Raju and Ajay who are lying 3rd|pg||
nt|babs59: if Sunit had made 6@H it would have been very expensive for their 3rd position|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  tough call for S|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h could go for 800|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S seems too strong to preempt, even after passed partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be the lunch break and next match will start at 1400 Hrs IST i.e about an hr from now|pg||
nt|babs59: Kiran and Satya play transfer responses to 1C, so this shows spades|pg||
nt|patricck: another board with not many imps at stake|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice little hand, majors for E/W, NT for South|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe   benefit of doubt to them  re the bidding|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: this one interesting Little for anyone|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opponents are guessing and the 5-level too expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: but She has played for India in BB several times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: in the open catagory |pg||
nt|peachy: Hearts play remarkably well|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: subhash writing explanation|pg||
nt|babs59: despite the big fit, there are lot of losers for NS.  EW can only make 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|babs59: I think we are heading to 4SX again?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzjh: pls visit http://royale.hpage.com for running scores |pg||
nt|babs59: it might go 1H  1S  2D  P?|pg||
nt|babs59: or  1H  1S  2NT  |pg||
nt|babs59: if the latter, then 3NT will be reached|pg||
nt|psridhar: subh's decn now|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@d will go all pass|pg||
nt|panja: this must be @H and @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Venky explaing to Sreedhar subhasgh 2S|pg||
nt|peachy: 4D could fit jump apparently, promising nice diamonds _ heart fit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: counting carefully I see 5@c should fail|pg||
nt|kemperg: NS a @C system I suppose|pg||
nt|granguru:  there was 6@D on a @S lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, If S invites, N should accept because of the vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: Kokish relay on 2@c going on here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@c was an underbid, lucky|pg||
nt|ianmcc: perhaps they will reach 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggi  + Dalal|pg||
nt|patricck: will NS bid their game now they have been given a 2nd chance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: it was not alerted on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: undo pls|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - he's more likely to downgrade than upgrade that hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing small @h E expectes exactly the @hK, Ace could have been better, as for me|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks to make|pg||
nt|patricck: or will they take a huge penalty from the balancing 1NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  hut off!|pg||
nt|andyv:  normal 4@h contract although 3N may play better because of the @h split|pg||
nt|ianmcc: double dummy maybe beatable|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: and 2D could be on a 3532 hand shape too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N played by Subhash may be in trouble on @s lead|pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.com/ website with info and results after Round 9|pg||
nt|babs59: that North hand is remarkably similar to Kiran's hand last board!|pg||
nt|patricck: this will be difficult to make on a @H lead|pg||
nt|babs59: with the @H position you can make 11 tricks EW in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: can they find the grand slam ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  3n is not a bad contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: but perhaps still in shock from last hand,   just gives pard a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: certainly not 5@d|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner's strength is unknown and the decn to bid 5@s is making an unwarranted assumption tht they can make and we shd save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@d better|pg||
nt|babs59: 2D by Subhash won't pose any difficulties tho|pg||
nt|panja: this will be difficult..|pg||
nt|patricck: @C offside and @S onside, with one pitch forom the diamonds there should be 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North has a beautiful hand in this auction, the auction made it even beter than it initially is|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *hat|pg||
nt|panja: unless @D are brought in....it will not make...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Ashok thinking |pg||
nt|patricck: provided declarer guesses @H|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you prefer a low @C lead or @CJ lead here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 3 depending on agreement|pg||
nt|patricck: well, 2@D is "only" 500|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably although 8 hcp hands without 5 card suit often don't make for good invites|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: Suhas thinking|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@s likes @h, pass or correct|pg||
nt|sga1: 2NT = 24-25 HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: 2 clubs 4 dimaonds, 4 spades and 1 hearts for a quick 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ianmcc: maybe only 100|pg||
nt|patricck: I have sympathy with Wests desire to balance, but it was dangerous with such soft queens and the unprotected K@H under the opener|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sga1: 3@c = Puppet Stayman, 3@D = one major|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@C now Natural slammish with 4@Hs|pg||
nt|babs59: on a club lead, you cash the @DA and then use 4 rounds of hearts to discard the 3rd club|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think after 1@s North is worth another move|pg||
nt|sybarra: true a rather flat hand  nothing to give encouragement with  (no tricks)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: Playing Precision, N might not be sure of South's diamond length though|pg||
nt|peachy: \|pg||
nt|peachy: Even then, might run short a trick|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|panja: hi Pramod, all|pg||
nt|panja: 7@D better than 7Nt here..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi this is Makarand ;)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N could be hardly blamed for this opening lead|pg||
nt|sga1: Heading towards 6NT|pg||
nt|sga1: He will bid 5NT, choose lsam or can be 6NT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: far-sightedcover, means West will be endplayed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psridhar: on correct defense yes they can beat it by 1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not enough entries |pg||
nt|sga1: slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: now seems to be doomed after H lead |pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: or, rather, 7@S..|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@S cue, he has assumed @D as cue in support of @Cs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: @h now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jeetu in a trance|pg||
nt|patricck: praying for a singleton Q@C, things wer ethat desperate|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nkgupt: n    |pg||
nt|panja: and the play will go...remove trumps, ruff a Club...cash last trump discarding Dummy @S, and then @HAK..black suit squeeze if @S don't break|pg||
nt|twcho: 7@d is probably the best contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  was it @sK indeed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can only imagine S's desperation|pg||
nt|granguru:  btw let me say that 2@d is the best contract here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|patricck: were that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|twcho: with squeeze possibility|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm not sure about Anil's double - where were his defensive tricks?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: I'm still looking to understand why K might have worked/under what circumstances|pg||
nt|peachy: Good play, tring to make and if the 8 didnt work, didnt matter because it was going down anyway without it|pg||
nt|babs59: the club at trick 2 was a tidy play, despite the CA offside|pg||
nt|sga1: 1-4 key card assuming @C as suit|pg||
nt|nkgupt: odd hand ...ns hav cold 9 tricks in @s's|pg||
nt|nkgupt: for a good save DD|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sga1: Ashok finally makes the bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: suhas explaining the auction to Rajeev|pg||
nt|patricck: at least West didn't lead the K@C, that would have been 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: well done |pg||
pc|h9|nt|babs59: when I double there, even the @DA is over my king|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: of course @S are 32...so there are easy 13 tricks..|pg||
nt|panja: @HA...then @DA..and @DQ|pg||
nt|babs59: I guess he trusted Sunit's 4C bid rather than the opponents' bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  no play now|pg||

pc|hK|pg||

nt|panja: now..this might go two down...@C ruff too early wasn't all that useful|pg||
nt|nkgupt: ?|pg||
nt|granguru:  on the last set we were saying that 50% of the hands are game-level hands|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psridhar: did he do that?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|ianmcc: well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya concedes last |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjh: 2H was both majors |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so the play more double dummy |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: No entries to do it AND return to dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: marked most of the outside values with West...  but East's diamond return was kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims|pg||
pc|d4|nt|babs59: shuld be contract I believe Mackarand|pg||
nt|babs59: (sorry I keep mis-spelling between Makarand and Mackulky)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes corrected |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: both are ok Barbara :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: i realised the VU graph operator is much tougher than playing :)|pg||
nt|babs59: I've been told to call you Makya :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: also accepted|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: Still prob will, though, N and S in no trouble following suit or discarding|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya claimiing|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H missed, E had no bid for a 2 suiter?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: ok he survives pitching a @S now|pg||
nt|psridhar: other tbl sniffed game thru the right route but chickened out at critical stage|pg||
nt|granguru:  so it is most important to be accurate on that part of the bidding |pg||
nt|andyv:  W needs to play K@S to prevent pd from being endplayed|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|granguru:  a competitive freak hand appears around 1% of the time..so 1 in 6 matches of 16 hands |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|peachy: Sad ending for NS, interesting postmortem in which I think N gets the short of it|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure of value of playing Q@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  a version of the crocadile coup|pg||
nt|sybarra: glad only in 1 |pg||
nt|andyv:  NS have jumped to a 22 imp lead thanks in large part to the slam bid on board 18|pg||

nt|sybarra: and 12 back on bd 19 |pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: the scoring is Total IMPS |pg||
nt|ianmcc: the perennial question to open or not 11 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well played for -300. not a great result|pg||
nt|psridhar: win trump in dummy, @s ace and ruff, @h exit..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 20 minutes to the next round KNadar + B Satya Vs Anil Padhye + Sunit choksey|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S and E in discussion about the last board|pg||
nt|peachy: Results after Round 9 (last round). Will be updated soon to include this round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html  Results after Round 10.  Will be updated after this round 11 is finished|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: intermediate|pg||
nt|nkgupt: strong weak knowing his style :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry the score for last board is -1|pg||
nt|andyv:  16 imps almost impossible to recover in a short match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: two more boards for the match |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S may be hard to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: next match is leaders Subhash Gupta and Venky Vs KIran and Satya |pg||
nt|sga1: If S opens the hand, then may reach|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: usual team mates |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggy has finished his set and passing bye the home game ;)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: even after the first @h play this hand could still be made...@d to hand and a @s towards dummy and eventually endplay S with the 3rd trump...as per junaid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last two boards for the day . |pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure there is some discussion about whether South should have ducked the A@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Thank you all for being with us and we look forward to be with us tomorrow for the last six rounds|pg||
nt|jcwla: That was undoubtedly -2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes corrected sorry |pg||
nt|jcwla: And 3@D on that cheese got its just deserts.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some will be in game|pg||
nt|granguru:  some kibt are remembering it and express that board 17 is an example of it..|pg||
nt|andyv:  play of 10@D was too fancy...simply the Q@d back and W would have had no troubles|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW have an easy game in 3NT byt N may drive hand to 4@s|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: by|pg||
nt|patricck: bidding is slightly wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry for last seven rounds |pg||
nt|andyv:  good catch|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: yes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: North/south better silent here|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS dont have values for 3N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think @d9 promotes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably about 95% responsible for that disaster|pg||
nt|sga1: As per latest running scores, Raju Tolani and Ajay Khare have overtaken Subhash - Venky|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, thats better, pass then 1C, 1s|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d multi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: to open S or not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html is the exact webpage for running scores |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for E/W but not in clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: X looks brave - will he pass 5@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya in a trance|pg||
nt|granguru:  a good/bad game decision cost 10 imps..and it might happen many times in just one match|pg||
nt|granguru:  one way or the other|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will bid 2@h (p/c)|pg||
nt|andyv:  what a flat match|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
nt|peachy: East hand is much too good for any sort of premptive action, 1S is normal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: where are the present pairs running?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all scores may be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@d shows hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tomorrow the tourney starts at 9 AM IST |pg||
nt|ianmcc: another misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
mb|1N|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
nt|babs59: I have help :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks like best game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: we will play 22 later as North Tabled 23 before |pg||
nt|andyv:  W apparently can't bid 1N which explains this rather flat double|pg||
nt|andyv:  redbl may show a @d honor...not sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably would not have been my choice to X |pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: Transfers in Intervention - a good tool|pg||
nt|sga1: Now slam chances with aggressive bidding by S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too hard for the elderly|pg||
nt|babs59: pick a slam?|pg||
nt|babs59: you do a great job as VG op - I esp like it when you pass on the tension and the atmosphere|pg||
nt|babs59: wow - I never trust Subhash with the boards!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: reaching 4@s good work|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW play precision modified|pg||
nt|patricck: Hard to see that this set is working out very well for Jaggi and Dalal who are currently 2nd|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: is this Match Points or IMPS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd suggest 2@s bid by W|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S can make 3 of a major amd EW can make 4 of a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I thank on behalf of the Sponsers and Organisers BBO and BFI for allowing this transmission|pg||
nt|ianmcc: every E/W contract terrible|pg||
nt|ianmcc: as we see|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W will bid 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C might be transfer, in competition|pg||
nt|peachy: transfer to 2D, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was alerted by Satya |pg||
nt|sga1: Now 5@c cue should take them to slam|pg||
nt|patricck: Sorry, table collapsed there for a moment.... presume players are just picking the cards up off the floor and reorganising :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board?  yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  low level bid and acceptable doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: one more after this |pg||
nt|babs59: now 6D by Satya, and 6H by Kiran|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks that gets more enjoyable watching on the net to get a feel of the table :)|pg||
nt|patricck: It isn't a disastrous set, but with NS bidding 3 games that some will miss they are sure to be losing ground|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @h lead, W will drive out A@s and then simply duck the @h from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: might specifically be honor X |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: IMPS Total|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@H showing 4+ @s, 1NT - denies 3@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by N my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW will make 11 tricks as in the CR|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction came to a quick halt|pg||
nt|sybarra: screeech! |pg||
nt|andyv:  since it doesn't appear that EW have a game, I guess this is as good a contract as any|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: 6 boards per rd, Total IMPs scoring (Pairs)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D will go one down for sure...two likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: trying to correct the score of last deal|pg||
nt|panja: W is taking a huge gamble with that double, holding five of his HCP in @H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opportunity lost|pg||
nt|sga1: you never know, S may carry on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good sequence|pg||
nt|patricck: Any other vulnerability it would have been Ok to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|patricck: Thank you for operating the Vu Graph :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: The slam looks easy on any lead |pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H EW failed by 2 so 12 to B there.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just short of being doubled|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised we are playing at the 1 level|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
nt|panja: ah..the lead solves one big problem for the Declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: He is following the pronciple that the person short in their fit suit must be aggressive, but I'm sure he too wishes his 5HCP in hearts were in another suit :)|pg||
nt|peachy: *principle|pg||
nt|jcwla: The wonderful @S leads continue by Jaggy.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Ashok in deep thought|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well if the deep thought leads to 3NT-2 like it did last time at least it will be a gain for EW.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: South had a problem on lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  W showed a strong hand 4@s-5+@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: GIB might show this as one down...but will likely be -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  only  point of interest on this hand is if N can guess the @hs|pg||
nt|patricck: and now they have missed a thin game themselves|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly without the lightner it is easier to beat slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S would have shown a small profit for NS -500 instead of -620|pg||
nt|patricck: North will eliminate the spades and diamonds and then run the J@C for an endplay, but as one of the club honours is onside the endplay will have been unnecessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome :) and I thank you all commentetors for bearing with my errors and undos :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Presumably W would want another @C and/or more strength to raise the @C here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E opened 2@h in that room|pg||
nt|babs59: however this is an IMP Pairs tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: The heat of the tournament can be felt in the air |pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer 3@c to 2@s but final contract is fine|pg||
nt|babs59: each result is cross-IMPed with the other 13 tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Although the playing arena is Air conditioned|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that a while ago, Subhash was sort of Sapan's mentor|pg||
nt|patricck: would have been tricky to make if the @H were 4-2 as lonfg as the trumps were still 3-1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|babs59: and board 1 reflects that policy too|pg||
nt|patricck: ??|pg||
nt|patricck: not making 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: corrected :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was 11|pg||
nt|patricck: ty|pg||
nt|ianmcc: return @h 8 trix|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: As we see the choice of opening bid in Satyas seat made the swing|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: 1NT gets him into @h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec and I don't like 1NT 5422|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont know anything about systems of both pairs.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: rt|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must like to live dangerously....leaving the dbl in is not to be recommended to the faint of heart|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA, @dA, @d ruff, @h finesse, @d ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E locates the @h A, he will be able to figure out the @s situation|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it will be North who carries on|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: quick work by Anand to claim after cross ruffing and finally playing a spade to K|pg||
nt|babs59: So that would add to the tension - Sapan wanting to prove something to Subhash |pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: if East is smart enough to bring in Clubs to discard a loser...it will be -1...|pg||
nt|panja: but he does not know @C are 33...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but East has multiple problems|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psridhar: a@c lead shd do|pg||
nt|ianmcc: in reality I'd say hopeless|pg||
nt|babs59: I thought Anil might win the HK (H10 being 0/2 higher honours) to lead a club towards the CJ97xx|pg||
nt|granguru:  Chagas leading a trump is something peculiar..just because he has threats in all side suits|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psridhar: any other lead makes -at least dbl dummy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i mean any lead other than @c lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why the @d back...must feel more comfortable with opps on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to see S lead the K of @C now? |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sga1: S after very aggressive bidding didn't cur his singleton @c the most imp information for N|pg||
nt|sga1: cue|pg||
nt|andyv:  very little to the play of the hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h was encouraging....S may play N for AQof @h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sga1: I wud say Lucky for Satya-Kiran|pg||
nt|granguru:  10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzjh: Raju Ajay in discussion about the board how to get to 6 after 4H open|pg||
nt|peachy: He has club losers no matter what, might as well try it as he does|pg||
pc|sA|nt|strike12: this line of play wont work i think|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: low @c safe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianmcc: looks like 130, not great|pg||
nt|andyv:  only a question of N getting squeezed and/or endplayed in the black suits|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|ianmcc: recipe for minus|pg||
nt|patricck: Well there is a similarity to board 14 where North bid an agressive game because of holding only Aces and Kings. Jaggi might well have gone 4@S here on the same reasons, but it is ...|pg||
nt|patricck: a close decision|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS cleaning the platter for declarer...making the hand easier and easier to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 1 trick in the air now|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" are only in 1 |pg||
nt|andyv:  N has come up with K@d and A@h....declarer should figure out who has the Q@s|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer has no trouble taking ten tricks when club ace is sitting in front of the K and there is no guess involved, |pg||
nt|andyv:  W has 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S did open |pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: in practise the @d lead shook up declarer ok u win Arun|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzjh: N asking the range of NT overcall|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  and hand is over|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psridhar: Anil cannot make it if that lead was stiff, so could have tried finessing may be|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|ianmcc: they can cross-trump now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: All considerations would have pointed to bringing the @C's in - inc shorter @H in N|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @h obviously|pg||
nt|andyv:  E must be a male...give him a road map and he ignores it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  the counting begins for the location of the Q@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: now in a trance|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably should have led the A@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, Q@d|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzjh: last board for the set . next round after 15 will the last for the tournament . Thanks all |pg||

nt|andyv:  good evening everyone|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|jcwla: "Who are you going to believe, honey, me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|sga1: -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|sga1: that is the score entered in Bridgemate|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: i am trying to correct it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: have difficulties in correctng|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's OK I think we can handle that.  Last board of the round, thanks Makarand and all kibs.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: both E and W here are fans of Anil -used to seeing him make an OT all the time ( Raju even calls it the " usual anil OT" ) |pg||

nt|Jacki: welcome Andy, thanks for commentating here|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Jacki|pg||
nt|andyv:  or maybe E "hoped Q was with N so that game wouldn't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  normal 3N hand for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  over 2@c, S may bid 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: This round shiuld help Subhash and Venky to improve their score|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would you, Andy?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s may be hard if you play restricted choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  different approaches |pg||
mb|1S|nt|strike12: tx Mak|pg||
nt|panja: NS with only 16 HCP are close to10 @S ticks..|pg||
nt|vugraph815: 2@s alerted as either 6@s or a 2-suiter without @s|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzjh: board 34 was 4@H -2|pg||
nt|babs59: ok, website not updated, thanks Mulkulky :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: nice fit jump :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: rather nfj:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Explanation being written down |pg||
nt|nkgupt: fnj|pg||
nt|andyv:  at this vul, yes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT better|pg||
nt|kemperg: No Brasilian commentators in both rooms?|pg||
nt|granguru:  Ernesto Muzzio used the conservative one|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: Most would open at West. 3@s for E/W|pg||
nt|peachy: 1H = limites to about 15. Mod Precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last deal of the set |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 1NT - kind of 1-round-forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand of this round is up. Results after Round 11 here http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html, update will show shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: positions before this round|pg||
nt|sga1: must be trf to @ds|pg||
nt|sga1: 2NT here is @cs|pg||
nt|patricck: EW realistically make 5@D although 6@D can make double dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: and no reaction by kibs:(|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s should be par for EW...with the vul NS might try to enter the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: the lead will decide the result of 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: North gets to be declarer in club contract, |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Daxin in trance |pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html - running scores after round 10, updates will be posted there shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: will be S Gupta Venky Vs Sreedharan Daxindas|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 15 more minutes last board of the set|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 75 hcp pack :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Exclusion RKCB in @ds|pg||
nt|jcwla: If nothing else can always run to one of E's majors :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  a kind of deceptive also|pg||
nt|andyv:  not quite good enough to bid slam so 4@s will probably be final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: sandeep in a trance|pg||
nt|babs59: Venky has a great hand opposite Majors|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is Drury...@H fit...|pg||
nt|panja: gives a chance to North to have some say|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes min 4card as announced|pg||
nt|twcho: north could double|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some X|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: pity the splinters are the same suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sunit has gr8 support for @d too -but 500 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so Rajesh after exlaation took his bid back |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, he doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders before this round are |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should N bid better minor this time? I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S Gupta Venky are current leaders|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should S introduce 6th- heart or 3-cards @s support - a problem indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Aah, we get to watch the leaders next round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 12 tricks here...with @S 32..and @C finesse in|pg||
nt|sga1: Satya showing one @s honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggy Dalal 1313|pg||
nt|sga1: 6@c - Zero|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: again explanations been written down|pg||
nt|patricck: a moderate slam which can make with the @CQx onside|pg||
nt|patricck: one of  Bob Hamman's Bols Tips was always concentrate extra hanrd on the first board of a set and the last board|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d looks like a limited splinter bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  if, however, their range is 12-14, W may be tempted to push|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: it is not a good slam to bid...with @D values, most of them, wasted|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry for the scoring error on board 34 I am not able to correct it .Kindly bear|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: an easy looking game, but with both red suits breaking badly it isn't so easy|pg||
nt|granguru:  expressing nore strenght than distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  operator, do we know what their NT range is?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4N quantitative|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like it is |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: too many|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the results have been posted on the Results link on webpage http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: at the bottom of the page there is a hyperlink to results |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing ordinary 1NTF, North's rebid is 2C|pg||
nt|ianmcc: XX?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 8 card fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  more<+|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzjh: inquiry from declerer about the lead |pg||
nt|strike12: 10 tricks now |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing support doubles, the decision is pretty easy = Dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  N good enough to bid 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2Raju Tolani Ajay Khare 1186|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 Subhash Gupta Venky 1036|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was a chance|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead now|pg||
nt|andyv:  although the bid doesn't improve W's hand, his 5th spade and good controls make it easy to bid game|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not tricks again |pg||
nt|andyv:  if E passes, we'll know he's at the bottom end|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, probably 12-14 or maybe 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like it |pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: sory the player cant be disturb yet|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Ajay thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the rare exception when it could only be 2-card suit, normally longer minor or 2C with 3-3 minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a bid by S!|pg||
nt|peachy: South's bid is much too frisky, given their methods, but he is probably attempting to get something back from the unfortunate -930.  I dont like that strategy though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder what was the reason|pg||
nt|peachy: But that is an "if" because I dont know if they have Support Dbl on card|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and with @c shortness the choice could be dbl|pg||
nt|panja: similarly, @H values in N hand are wasted...|pg||
nt|patricck: Partner didn't double 6@C so South shouldn't be tempted to lay down the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: crowd gathering around the table|pg||
nt|nkgupt: MrSG must be baffled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he is sitting with crossed hands deep in thought|pg||
nt|nkgupt: i suppose a save in 6@h coming:)|pg||
nt|patricck: 8@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the usual Jackson relay many play in INdia|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: also on the other table|pg||
nt|granguru:  will not be fun to play |pg||
pc|s2|nt|nkgupt: dont think 4@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and to win it - an easy deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: transfer?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he shrugs and passes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think that's high standard|pg||
nt|granguru:  vulnerable|pg||
pc|s9|nt|babs59: thanks Makulky - seems the top 3 just keep shifting around :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@H  sorry typo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, this is a lesson hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Vinay thinking on lead|pg||
nt|patricck: should lose just 2 trumps and the K@D tho|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3 level toxic|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 VM lal Bhiwandkar 980|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last deal of the match |pg||
nt|patricck: mind you declarer can go wrong in trumps, small to the K@C works when the @CAx on side and also @CAxx, bit not against @CAQx so finessing against the queen is better by a few ...|pg||
nt|patricck: percent|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: nothing much exciting in the set :(|pg||
nt|babs59: Precision auction here - EW play Precision (4c M) when NV, Standard when vul|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty PT|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North over the top|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Subhash Gupta + Venky |pg||
nt|nkgupt: fit jump/nfj/or trf to 3@d but surely a ilmsv bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: @DQ coming back?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @h suit splitting, W has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ianmcc: but not impossible - well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2 Ashok Goel Sudhir Aggrawal Suhas Vaidya|pg||
nt|babs59: the 4S/5H hand went badly for Raju and Ajay (currently 2nd place) at the other table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: when is restart? I need dinner|pg||
nt|babs59: they over-reached to 5S, -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on  15|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 5 Ashok Goel  Suhas Vaidya Siudhir Aggarwal 681|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Note that E in OR rebid 3NT, which is fine.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT also is fine, typical of E here, but the idea is you can't have both super conservative invitations and a super conservative accepting style.|pg||
nt|jcwla: You have to either invite conservatively and accept liberally OR invite liberally and accept conservatively.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't play Drury can't see need - bid what's in front of you|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and don't indicate the lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h lead well read as top of nothing|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzjh: director called |pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will win a couple of IMPs in the wash here|pg||
nt|panja: S knows North's shape now...but he does not know where the honours are..|pg||
nt|patricck: Last board of this set, but more excitement to come shortly|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty straight forward method used by N to show 5-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  for a long time 3@h and 3@s over 1N showed 5-5 (wk and strong) in the majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  with A|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzjh: so this match shud pull them back up |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u after 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I regret the errors in broadcasting |pg||
nt|patricck: but any more than 10 tricks declarer will need to drop the K@D without any clues|pg||
nt|vugraph815: amaral asks about 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraph815: fornasari says new minor forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is very little to the play of hand and W should make 6|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|strike12: but N might get fished by the lead and try something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 R Venkatesh A Srinivasan|pg||
nt|peachy: At least whenever I tried that , I just get more minus.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 round of @h let declarer with no chance|pg||
nt|nkgupt: to much values to miss the slam!!:)|pg||
nt|peachy: South has good controls everywhere so he is going for it|pg||
nt|panja: N could have @CK instead of @HQJ..and the bidding would have been the same|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Director hurrying up |pg||
nt|patricck: A very poor slam, would need 3-2 spades and the A@S onside and the K@D onside, so makes only about 17% of the time|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: this needs care|pg||
nt|twcho: how about trump lead and @d shift?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzjh: about the explanation of the meaning of 2S now all ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 'slam' effect from last deal perhaps|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good auction for partnership|pg||
nt|peachy: This would have been a working sacrifice, had either N or S been void in clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@s sitting in front of K and 3-3 @hs...this will be an easy game to play|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzjh: claims 12|pg||
nt|patricck: true, a fairly quiet affair, there were a lot of good ones in the previosu set though, and they are probably saving the best ones for the last set :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: we shall be back after 15 :)|pg||
nt|patricck: OK, see you soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  good shift|pg||
nt|jcwla: Of those 2, the better is the former: invite conservatively and accept liberally.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: This set has been bad for Jaggy and Rajesh and may cost them the second position|pg||
nt|patricck: If hearts are 3-3 you don't need the @D finesse. That improves it slightly, but still in the low 20's|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 Jaggy Rajesh |pg||
nt|peachy: Surely was not bid to make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh!|pg||
nt|peachy: This is not a great slam, however|pg||
nt|panja: A guessed slam.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sreedhar making inquiries|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mak and Sveta|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all for joining in and look forward to see u after 45 minutes .Tx Andy and TX Sveta |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: quick claim made|pg||
nt|patricck: running the 9@C and then the 8@C plays clubs for one loser, but I don't think declarer will seriously consider it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all see u in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|babs59: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: bye for now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: tricky now needs trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|granguru:  w should have continue with his line and just bid 2@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@c let E no space...probablt best to bid 3@D instead of 3NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzjh: Subhsh in deep thought|pg||
nt|panja: N could also play on @H finessed...then ruff two Hearts....that will work too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: a priori about 42/45/5 i wud say|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 42/45%|pg||
nt|peachy: There is also the spade loser to worry about, he does not know QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|nkgupt: in fact less|pg||
nt|panja: 41 @S break would be too difficult to handle...so I guess he will work on the assumption of 32 @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: bye all |pg||
nt|jcwla: This way you avoid the death contracts (2NT, 3M etc) as much as possible and are safe on the rare occasions you do play them.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A game invitation should be accepted -- ESPECIALLY given E's super solid style - on anything other than a dead minimum.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Playing with this partner I would consider 3NT automatic and expect to make in comfort most of the time.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|strike12: doesnt matter now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: incautious duck|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all we shall be back after lunch after 45 minutes |pg||
nt|jcwla: The W hand is a VERY nice hand, this hand proves both partners cannot be super conservative, it doesn't work, you lose 7 or 10 at a time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: look forward to see u after 45 minutes for the closing stages of the tournament .|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: we have four more rounds to go|pg||
nt|patricck: My apologies for not providing the commentary. This session started an hour earlier than the two previous days and I didn't check :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: no problems Patrick please we need u for the last set to start in 15 minutes .Expected many swings in the positions |pg||
pc|c9|nt|psridhar: assuming Padhey will guess @c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: duck and set up @d for @c discard ...2@c entries there fr the purpose|pg||
nt|nkgupt: these leeds r to well known to SG i suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all and see u soon in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|patricck: that was probably a fairly flat board across the field|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: not as i heard as some did not get to 3nt|pg||
nt|patricck: Thz for doing some commentary Makarand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Surely everyone got to game?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: except one as I heard |pg||
nt|patricck: A few in slam perhaps, but no real fit and 30 points|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 'one'must hv climbed to slam making|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the results will soon be out |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: rather not stayedshort of a game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: and since it was a pair who also did not get to grand but only a game amongst the top 6 the whole scene shud change |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u soon|pg||
nt|granguru:  E knows that if the @C is not solid there must be a second @H stopper (or 1/2 stopper) to have a reasonable chance|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, perhaps even then, NS could only make 3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  sorry, no problem - still one down|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite @c lead, W fated to go down...he had a dbl dummy play to make this|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yup off one - see y'all next round.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Vinay in deep thought|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye Jordan|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: See u Jordan|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  lead certainly did not hurt declarer...leading from KQ with no spots not really recommended|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ianmcc: N/S lead looking shaky|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders after round 3  are|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Arvind Vaidya Manoj Nair|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2 Ashok Vaidya Nitin Shah|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 Keyzad Swarenndu|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 5 Vinay Sapan|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 6 Arvind Vaidya Manoj Nair|pg||
nt|nkgupt: mb not biddable but decent chance for 4@s?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: have to go bye|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 7 V M Lal Bhiwandkar|pg||

nt|strike12: Tx to BFI and BBO for broadcast and organising this event|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes sorry i missed BFI the apex body in INdia and the work thats being done |pg||
nt|granguru:  I think many of you would in fact open 3@C vulnerable|pg||
pc|dA|nt|strike12: making 6 looks impossible, |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks for all shall be back after 15 minutes|pg||
nt|strike12: is it right Mak?|pg||
nt|strike12: tx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: no was 11 |pg||

nt|sybarra: wk in one major |pg||
nt|sybarra: where to start with S hand?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: nice to have methods to immediately make a takeout bid of a specific major suit.  Lots of defenses are available.|pg||
nt|sybarra: W will be flabergasted that E has a major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think West should bid 4@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  N would like to bid but really doesn't have that much to say|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need agreements here |pg||
nt|sybarra: if 4 @H is pass or correct,  then fine|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what 4 @D would be?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West wimps it.  The Law of Total Tricks should apply here.  10-card major suit fit ... just bid to the 4 level before the opponents have even mentioned a suit|pg||
nt|othered1: What methods you choose are less important than having something firmly agreed.  I'd bid 2@S, showing a takeout double of 2@H (not a recommended defense, but I am lucky with it.)|pg||
nt|andyv:  brilliant bid by W...he knows 4@h is going down on eventual @s switch from S:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph815: 2@h alerted as 0-4|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  an adventurous E might bid 3@H, hoping for pd to have a @h stopper and the A@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he bought it!!! |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it certainly has turned brilliant, but he got some help from N/S who have unaccountably passed this out|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|granguru:  6@d passed would have meant 12 IMPs to NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will need to guess @ds to make this|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can't really assign blame, because we don't know what the double meant|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder why S didn't dbl again|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: X = nat D|pg||
nt|othered1: In north's defense, if east's suit is @S, west's implied @H strength sits over south's . . . |pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraph815: 2N not alerted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well once again, it depends what double meant|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|andyv:  as cards lie, EW can make 9 tricks on @c finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h lead might have been better...W probably has @ss and thus, S will be short in that suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 23 proved to be a 13 imp swing as NS played 4@s making 5 in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|andyv:  S should run the @ss first to see if he can get some information on the hand...after two rounds of @s, S will know W started with a stiff @s and 4@hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|veistikke:  hmm|pg||
nt|vugraph815: answer seems to be they like 3NT|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @c out leads to 9 top sticks|pg||
nt|veistikke:  not the best when you have a 5-5 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to be careful on entries to board but he only needs 4@ds to make contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|veistikke:  there you gp|pg||
nt|veistikke:  go*|pg||
nt|andyv:  W ready to go down 1 or 2.. very happy with developments|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should claim here and breath a sigh of relief.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  dbl quite often shows 5@d and 5 of major...here it looks as if S had a tweener...the other practice would be to pass 2@d and when the known suit (expected to be @hs) dbl as take out.|pg||
nt|othered1: natural @D, then south certainly owes north another double.  Almost automatic, I'd think.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru:  trick nr 6|pg||
nt|granguru:  how do we follow now?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Delete "almost"|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever the case may be, S needs to dbl again|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Are there screens?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

mb|2D|nt|granguru:  so a good undertanding of what you are doing at the 5-level is extremely important |pg||
nt|othered1: Do  you  really think of a major suit fit here?  could be the only thing going down on a  horrible split.  Assume 2N shows around 20 or more|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's work on a hand for West where you need to play 7 of a suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  the trouble with finding a 4-4 fit is two fold...one, bad trump split and 2, unexpected ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  tough to make 3N when you are missing all 4 aces|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C seems to have been Puppet Stayman or some other variation|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  NS on different pages |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraph815: ty, trying to compensate the lack of commentators:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  also, this type of auction allows the defense to possibly get information that might be damaging|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|jbgood: good game missed|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes we have too many toys to play with|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like the way this is going |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  credit E for the dbl of 2@d...not too many would dbl with E hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h probably kickback|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they have agreements that are far from standard here.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes blasting might have been better |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I give up ... I can't construct a 20 point hand where you don't belong in 7NT|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a @s will knock out W's only entry and S should take at least 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzqe: 4@h agree with @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can probably construct a hand with 5 of a major that belongs in the suit ... but West denied a 5 card major with 3@D|pg||
nt|othered1: We don't know th eir tendencies.  Maybe they are more frisky in practice with their 2N openings than we might be|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  I think just the opposite....they have a toy and they want to use it.  Old fashioned rubber bridge players would have no problem with this hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|veistikke:  the worse u can do inn a dbled contract is rushing.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  let the opponent play the cards|pg||
nt|othered1: If east now bids 7N,he's put unnecessary strain on the partnership|pg||
nt|andyv:  and they did arrive at a reasonable slam....only rule with 7 is if you can take the tricks off the top, you belong in NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may have to buy his partner some rolaids|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a drink|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Poor old East ... thinking about whether one or the other of the two contracts is half a percent better ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  probaby better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can live with such decisions|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may not even realize that it is his bid|pg||
nt|othered1: East's thinking may be along the lines of "why should I just punt 7N, when I can find out lots more about partner's hand then make the decision on which grand to bid.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|granguru:  around 50% of the hands are game level hands|pg||
nt|granguru:  around 40% (a little less) are partials|pg||
nt|granguru:  around 1% passed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now prays for trumps to behave|pg||
nt|othered1: andhe has decided.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If trumps are 5-0, then hope the defender has 5332 shape :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and final result is they got to the grand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|veistikke:  best is to lead a little @d and let west return the @h :)|pg||

nt|jbgood: sry...|pg||

mb|5C|nt|andyv:  pass seems timid by W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I'm not sure we have the right auction....I don't know why W opened 1@d instead of 1@s|pg||
nt|othered1: "everyone" plays 2@S forcing, I think, just showing extra length|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I don't play 3@D as forcing here, but east has a bid with all those extra high cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and then we might discuss the 1 NT ... and the xx|pg||
nt|granguru:  N refused to transfer|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|granguru:  with @CQx might have been a good decision|pg||

pc|c6|nt|andyv:  practical contract|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||

nt|veistikke:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  the contract was too hard to handle...again EW will need to find out why they missed two good major suit fits in order to play at a higher level in a minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, did manage to squeeze one more trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|andyv:  interesting that both Souths had same 3@d bid...here S thought it was good enough for game and not in OR.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  board 24 turned out to be a push as both rooms couldn't find 5@d|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  2@h with this vul and that quality of suit is not recommended for the weak of heart|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS will get to a game which will not be a picnic to play|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraph815: kaplan interchange here... standard in Brazil|pg||
nt|vugraph815: 0-4@s, akin to a forcing 1NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: Is Chagas the famous one or a younger version?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N?|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS start with 8 tricks in NT and have plenty of time to develop a 9ths|pg||
mb|p|nt|veistikke:  looks like other table plays game 22|pg||
nt|vugraph815: yes... Madala likely opened with Amaral's cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  if S had the 10@h, this would be an interesting board|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|vugraph815: the one and only|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needs to develop a lot of tricks so ducking this @h may not be possible|pg||
nt|othered1: somehow I'd be concerned if my system didn't allow me to get a long major suit to three honors into the auction.|pg||
nt|andyv:  forcing I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  another auction that doesn't quite fit the hands that we are looking at.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jbgood: no bonus for being in 3 at the other table|pg||
nt|veistikke:  10 of @h. please return @s back :P|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 1N probably 17-19|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  some partnerships would play the J@h instead of 10...that way later, partner would know they have 2 @hs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: thats not realy old|pg||
nt|andyv:  in any case, N has more than enough to bid game|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|ahalim: Hi Andy, Open Room is finished so we all move here|pg||
nt|andyv:  induced the wrong lead from E so have to give it a positive I guess|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  E did duck...this could be expensive although it is difficult to find 9 tricks for E|pg||

pc|d3|nt|andyv:  end of line for the defense here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to be on his own radar tonight|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|nt|othered1: even with the friendlier @H lead, this had no play as cards lie|pg||
nt|andyv:  but the @h return may be right as it knocks out the only entry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  J@d will clarify everything for E who then will be busy trying to scramble for as many tricks as possible|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  there was very little reason for E to split the @c suit...that made it a lot easier for S to develop the 9th trick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: I thnk he had to lead low @C there, not pull trump|pg||

nt|josj: hi Andy :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S allowed to play 3@s unmolested in OR|pg||
nt|westjava: hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd be tempted to bid 3N with the W hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: another game missed in the OR - not that it is a good one|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 26, the lucky 3N for EW gained 10 imps as 3@d was bid in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Liliek|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @h lead, N might actually make the hand by playing 2 rounds of @hs (after winning @d switch) and pitch @d, ruff @d and lead ! toward Q|pg||
mb|2D|nt|josj: you will make it on the likely @D block|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  if N finds a dbl over 3@h, this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|josj: @DK lead...|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice contract reached by NS in OR|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie (but very consistent with opening bid) 4@H is a winning spot here.  6@C is magic, but won't even be sniffed at.|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  again Muzzio with a near pre hand now 7 cards only and white vs red|pg||
nt|kemperg: thinks, but also youth had passed|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't pass|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  I just have a hard time stiing still with a 17 count, a 5 card suit and 3 stoppers in opps preemptive suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  sitting|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so much for can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S should have little trouble making 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not sure what 3@d is unless it was N who bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if 2@c is single suiter, dont or one or two majors|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|granguru:  according to his style he opens 1@H and jumps in the second turn|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must bid quite lightly over a weak NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  another big score for the Timah team|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|jbgood: an effective way this time|pg||
nt|veistikke:  he dont wanna be inn 3!n |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|veistikke:  good pass|pg||
nt|vugraph815: not this time :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  typo...2@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  now S will make 3|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think N was at fault here....He has to take some action over 2@h|pg||
pc|dT|nt|veistikke:  most people take !n for granted|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will not do well|pg||
nt|josj: this looks a normal enough contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|josj: but W has no reason to play DD|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will lead 10@h and should float it since declarer will be losing 1 trump trick|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: Old theory used to be: destructive actions over strong NT; contructive, over weak.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|veistikke:  not sure if they wanna be inn 2|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe|pg||
nt|veistikke:  2!n is the worse contract to play|pg||
nt|veistikke:  except 7!n with 3 missed kings|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 trick in 4 coloyrs for defense|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraph815: Amaral asks whether Barcellos may have 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraph815: answer is yes|pg||
nt|mathat: x @d to the J made 2|pg||
nt|veistikke:  yes|pg||
nt|veistikke:  of corse he have 4@s|pg||
nt|mathat: no 3 @s|pg||
nt|veistikke:  nvm|pg||
nt|veistikke:  looking at dummy|pg||
nt|vugraph815: E-W play 1N-2@c-2N as 4@s+4@h minimum,and 3@c 4@s+4@h maximum|pg||
nt|veistikke:  playing @d would be good|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|granguru:  I have been out of the table for a while discussing about the importance of the freak hands sorry|pg||
nt|granguru:  most of the points won or lost are in the game level zone as in 16 hands you may get 4 wrong/right decisions |pg||
nt|granguru:  which depending on the other team decision might produce up to 40 IMPs without any really terrible play|pg||
nt|granguru:  a freak, around 1% of the time comes out 1 in 6 matches or 1 in 12 matches of 8 hands|pg||
nt|granguru:  so if you always make the wron thing on the last type it is in fact not as important as to do the right thing on the game level hands which are 50 times more frequent|pg||
nt|granguru:  players who do play finals of the BB do pretty much the same as declarers and in defensive bidding. |pg||
nt|granguru:  What really is needed to arrive at that point is that you be an excellent defender playing the cards|pg||
nt|granguru:  no pair who makes mistakes defending arrives to a world final...because you defende twice as much as you play a hand |pg||
nt|granguru:  c u later|pg||
nt|westjava: ugh...|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's actions seemed reasonable|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|veistikke:  like this. let them play the cards :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  E was in a quandry when W dbld....E doesn't really have enough defensive tricks to sit for dbl but has no place to run (as it turns out)|pg||
nt|josj: the simple approach is certainly not good enough here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: so I think north is worth 2@S over 2@H or whatever would show a good hand.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: but the heart jack is surely wrong - loses to the singleton king witn south|pg||

nt|othered1: You need to discuss methods, beyond just what bids directly over 1N mean.|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway 5 imps to Timah who has taken a sizeable lead over the last 9 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: In casual partnerships, if I don't have time to discuss a convention's extended auctions, I refuse to play it.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|andyv:  N opened the hand 2@s in OR...looks like a polish weak 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  and played it there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this looks like a straightforward 3NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  EW took the 5@d sac over 4@h in OR|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|andyv:  4@h can be set with @c leads and underleading the A@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may not have that bid avialable so simply opens 1@s...my own preference if I had to open that would probably be to bid 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and treat the @s suit as a 4 card suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|westjava: result after RR-4 http://halamanbridge.org/timah-mlg/q4.php|pg||

nt|andyv:  thank you everyone for joining us|pg||
nt|andyv:  if pd signed off, then 3@d has to show better hand, at least distribution wise....should S expect that poor of a @s suit for the bidding?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I didn't agree with S's 2@h bid but I don't think it's a terrible bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: so, e ven if you know partner would bid 2@H on qJxxx, you have to p ass rather than trying to run to a plus?  I think you have to have a way out.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|westjava: yup, last hand and next roundwill be soon after a short break|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  coming to last board of this set...thank you everyone for joining us|pg||
nt|andyv:  S doesn't have that much to enter into the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, the way out is for S not to bid like that:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  in OR, S liked hand enough to bid 2@hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but, if S had x, KJxxxx, xx, Qxxx...where would you like to play it?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: This looks to be the last hand of the set.  We owe thanks to our operator for a fine effort. And to the organizers of t his event for bringing it to BBO for webcasting.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  I think this is the 2nd hand where 3NT has been bid with one side having a void|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty PT and ty Ed, it's been a pleasure|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: for info, this event is limited invitation, 12 national best club, included open and ladies national teams|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  with 8 trick off the top, W should have no trouble making this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead will make it interesting|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andyv:  but it will alwo develop the 9th trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably best for W to win this trick and run 5 diamonds immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will have 4 very uncomfortable pitches|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us...it's been a lot of fun|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|othered1: I would have your hand, not south's actual hand.  But their partnership has other standards and, to be effective, must make accommodations elsewhere in the system.'|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I agree Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: thanks again, everyone and bye for now.|pg||
