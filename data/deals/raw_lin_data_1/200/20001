nt|athene: with slightly better diamonds and only one heart he might have tried 3@D, weak and natural|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|hK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: some would play west's double of 2@H as penalty, some as light takeout|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: some even play it "two way" i.e. it might be light takeout OR a penalty double, but this is really playing with fire|pg||
nt|athene: the idea behind that is, partner is supposed to know from his own holding whether you have 0/1 hearts or 5+|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: but you can get stung sometimes e.g. responder has more hearts than he should have|pg||

pc|dT|nt|athene: because, just because you pass a takeout double, doesn't mean you have lots of HCP|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not obvious that your side wants to be in a forcing situation|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: but if you are NOT in a forcing situation, and you play double is penalty, then it can be very difficult|pg||

nt|athene: i would have thought, without special agreement to the contrary, a "free" 2@S over 2@C shows not that much less than what west actually has|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: maybe he felt it would actually show quite  a weak hand, similar to 1something (double) redouble, when you pull right away as opener|pg||
