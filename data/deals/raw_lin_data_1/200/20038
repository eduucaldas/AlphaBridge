nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary & Aria.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are not NS the 2/1 pair|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, no shrinking violets here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so NS play multi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  A fourtunate game here with East having two heart discard and the Q@S dropping|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: Hi Shirley nice to see you, welcome all|pg||
nt|panosk: hi shirley|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and Panos|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx :) |pg||
nt|panosk: hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: This must be a very light 3rd seat 1@D by S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: If this auction is to make any sense?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or do we just have it all wrong?|pg||
nt|rv: South will double this, could be phantom save though|pg||
nt|andyv:  do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@Sis a two-suiter, known as Muiderberg in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|zhoufly: µÚ¶þÂÖ±ÈÈü¿ªÊ¼ÁË|pg||
nt|sz16f: ´ó¼ÒÏÂÎçºÃ£¡|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Routine 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|panosk: double is support i guess meaning 3hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with all bidding, a good stop, looks like just a make|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4333 in E not very appealing |pg||
nt|panosk: redouble probably honor in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes bet so panos|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi kibitzers and operator :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although a heart lead would have beaten it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Raija welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Gary|pg||
nt|rv: Muiderberg: 5M+4+m less than opening hand|pg||
nt|zhoufly: ·¨¹ú¶ÔÕóºÉÀ¼|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this should make|pg||
nt|psyck:  This is generally played as invitational' sequence|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will not accept any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: playing a strong club you don't need the 2NT rebid to show strong balanced|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as the cards r 6@d on after isolating @c's a sq of @s and @c|pg||
nt|athene: so, many pairs use it for a 3@D jump rebid with three-card spade support|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N not quite as good as the excellent 6@D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk: yes gd stop indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs play 5-card majors, 2/1 responses are not GF|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck:  generally as 5+ card @s any inv hand, some also play it as 4+card @s inv hand|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: yes Tom|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcwla: There are no words for my view on this 1@D opening.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Andy, no sleep:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 1 off|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Germ...how was breakfast?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fine ty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|psyck:  If W had a hand to accept inv, I assume E's plan was to say correct 3N to 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  Spec an listen to the voice commentary if using the browser version|pg||
nt|psyck:  *specs can...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this event is an 8 teams comptition after round 1 France with 25 vp is leading Sweden23 end netherlands 22  then come the 2 chinese teams england usa and canada|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you can make 6@D on ace and a heart lead? aren't you short of an entry to ruff two clubs?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|rv: not me with especially with @SQJX|pg||
nt|twcho: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|psridhar: the idea behind opening thaat E hand was the shape, but Larsson chickened out |pg||
pc|h7|nt|ssbux: it is also common in this part of the world, but usually 55|pg||
nt|jcwla: Something about rather trying to take 3 tricks than 11.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or even 4.|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes too much defensive value|pg||
nt|rv: I will take my medicine (even if fixed) and choose to quietly defend 4@s|pg||
nt|chnjcc:  åä½å¥½|pg||
nt|jcwla: This opening is so cheesy, really deserved a worse fate but the pressure bid pays off this time.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|panosk: re hi, slight connection error apparently|pg||
nt|rv: North might struggle to make even 9 tricks in @s strain|pg||
nt|chnjcc:  æ¬¢è¿åä½è§çåè¿æ¯å½éå¥³å­ç²¾è±èµ|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have a convention card for EW in my collection of Venice Cup 2011 cards but i assume they play precision, as that seems to be standard in China|pg||
nt|nkgupt: then a positional double sq with well placed @s lenth i think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: nice convention this 2 Nt  rebid   does any one knows the name of this convention ?|pg||
nt|cmule: +1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: So joanna neve sit south and Danielle gaviard North|pg||
nt|peachy: heart lead is by NO MEANS obvious or even necessarily a good choice|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Fiona needs to drive out the A@C and get to dummy with a heart and lead up to the J@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|twcho: After 1st round, France is the leading team with 25 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: yes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standings can  be reached on bbo  programm of vu graph|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nkgupt: the @h4 wud be trick 12:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N a passed hand so likely a pass by S and it is.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@C a phantom save against 3@S.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Ian welcome|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ianmcc: hi Gary|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think the 2NT bid has a name|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi to everybody|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panosk: 2 Aces missing so 5 is enough|pg||
nt|ntmon: @S lead perhapd best in teams but the format here dictated as safe lead as possible  |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even that is not necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kathrine is married to Swedish star Peter Bertheau|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "2NT is never to play" could be a good name for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why she pulled 6 @D?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: OTOH, west reasonably was trying to avoid a ruff in a side suit, but the exact @H split prevents that . . . |pg||
pc|c9|nt|peachy: Majority of Chinese players play Precision or similar strong club system|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c5|pg||

mb|1C|nt|peachy: Welcome back everybody. Here is the link to the tournament website with list of teams, running score/results and other info|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
nt|sybarra: chinese commentary in closed room  english here|pg||
nt|psridhar: in general +180 on 20-20 deal should not be bad...|pg||
nt|othered1: west probably thought south had both the extra @S and the @HA for her 4@S bash.|pg||
nt|cmule: ¿ªÊÒ·ÀÊØ7NTÊ×¹¦D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: We have different definitions of "just barely there."|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even on a heart lead South has to win the first club and play another one|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi kezhang|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  2+|pg||
nt|athene: NS play what is pretty much "expert standard" these days:- strong notrump, 5-card majors, short club|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E may just bid game here|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D seem plausible here|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: shaky hand   South have the points  East the distribution|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  and S will have hard time ignoring the 6 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h or 4@s will make|pg||
nt|twcho: I believe EW is playing 5 card M with 1C including all bal hand outside NT range|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Henry, alway happy to have you join us|pg||
nt|peachy: Even if W had much less than she does, it is valuable interference after they open 1D, to overcall 2C.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it would be the Swedish equivalent to Gazzilli, named Häxan (the witch)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in 4@h, you don't have to worry as much about the Q@s.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=VeniceCup&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards%2F2011Veldhoven   for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: convention cards|pg||
nt|rv: West will drive to game here, first bid 2@c as good raise in @h and then maybe bid and rebid @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/Netherlands/dekkers-michielson.pdf|pg||
nt|peachy: Many pairs, even experienced or experts, have trouble in the auction after that start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although some may have doubled i prefer 2@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 3@d as W, or started with double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming 3@d means "bid 3N with a stopper, otherwise do something intelligent"|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice spot for EW.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sybarra: they played 4 @H's making in closed room |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H= spade rasie |pg||
nt|sybarra: also takes 2 @H bid away from W |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|jcwla: This pace is glacial.|pg||
nt|andyv:  watch out Jordan...they're moving faster and faster|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, but then come the undos -- no new bids, just an alert.|pg||
nt|rv: important system aspect for partnerships to discuss? 3@c could potentially show both majors with longer OM (@s here)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E trying to slow the train down|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think EW in CR are going to have a chat about this auction.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a 3 loser hand...they should reach game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should 2@S not be forcing on the auction in the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it is not, you have to bid 4@H over 1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Only on this planet, Roland, not on several others.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 2@C followed by something|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd have a hard time bidding with the E hand on that aucition in the CR...only 100% force to cue bid and then bid @s|pg||
nt|athene: you can use redouble to show a strong hand but after 1@C it's practically impossible to get the opponents for a worthwhile penalty, as they have the whole of the 1-level to choose ...|pg||
nt|athene: from|pg||
nt|othered1: but does allow the double, which some partnerships make into a meaningful  action|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi pano!|pg||
nt|loe48: Hi Dennis welcome :)|pg||
nt|panosk: even 7 @D is makeable as card lie but i doubt they will get there|pg||
nt|psridhar: N was close to a take out X in terms of shape but light on values and RED|pg||
nt|jcwla: And opp a passed pd - nothing to protect.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
nt|andyv:  E here decides to show the @c stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W decides to dive off the deep end|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the best spot  is reached by West|pg||
nt|psyck:  With a hand unable to show @d's later, I'd prefer to open 1@d & rebid @c|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if Dekkers had to bid in front of partner with semibal hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
nt|jcwla: To quote "Miracle Mile," What's the hurry, Harry?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will make with no problem losing 4 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a little difficult to handle the spade break |pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs will be difficult to handle also |pg||
nt|sybarra: lot to do in the hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bep Vriend did not make the 6 nt in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||
nt|panosk: now secured , the friendly lie that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the difference between 6@H now and 6@H over1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will likely duck on sp  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *duck one |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: she wanted to show a weak opening|pg||
nt|rv: after Marion's redouble|pg||
nt|ntmon: these hands do not provide much room for wild competing |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: I am not surprosed, it looked like a 7 count at first glance|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT seems like the field resting spot here.|pg||
nt|peachy: *surprised|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she might as well have bid 6@H directly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps less likely to make now?|pg||
nt|ssbux: why 3C, either 2c or 4c will be better and not misleading as notrump probe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can play her cards at random here and emerge with ten tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@C puppet to 2@D and subsequent 3NT = a choice between 4@H and 3NT |pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  this looks more scientific, Roland...esp. when her partner showed her useful values in the @c suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: but I agree that it is usually unbalanced|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 1@s by Dekkers to show more distribution like say 5@c+4@s|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: the only chance for 11 is to lead a small heart from hand (you are almost certain the ace is wrong) and hope west ducks|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: hello patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Jean-Paul and Tommy|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: a decent save non-vul here as 4@H easy|pg||
nt|athene: sorry you are almost certain the KING is wrong|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: I am guessing that W took 3NT to show the high end of a 1@H-response in values.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panosk: redouble showing 1st round control in @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator are rooms connecting |pg||
nt|twcho: hi Shirley and Raija|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at these colours asking for too much. pass the right decision.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice auction|pg||

pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately game not reached CR|pg||
nt|panosk: gd lead to try to defeat, spade is no use since auction revealed singleton opposite A|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: South might still have considered balancing 1@H -pd may bid some NT and wont be disappointed with the dummy-but when a fit exists.....|pg||
nt|othered1: there are 9 top tricks and plays for a 10th in @C or a @D ruff, if you can get that before EW find 4 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panosk: even possible void (3@S)|pg||
nt|ssbux: Hi Patrick, will be seeing you playing next week|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gracelin: oh  yes, in a similar event with Men's teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Tommy welcome |pg||
pc|hK|nt|blewah: from the 3@h response to 2@s I think NS play 2/1|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Tommy, glad you could join|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  nothing left but the @h gess and N may even lead that|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: almost? make that 100% after the double|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: i don't trust anyone that much, NV vs V with a passed partner|pg||
nt|athene: there are only 13 hcp missing but 10-hcp doubles are not unheard-of|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome John |pg||
nt|ntmon: declarer has the tricks but may have problem to untangle them|pg||
nt|ntmon: sry, no problem, missed @S10 in first trick|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|panosk: E showed 3 spades i think with mud|pg||
nt|blewah: S treats his hand minimum|pg||
nt|blewah: so 15-17NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi aria|pg||
nt|blewah: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: elimination play needed, which would be good play to avoid @S guess.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and rashed:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Andy.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ian and I are here also Andy, quite a party|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lebridgeur: impossible to play a low @h  and be down with 5 @d and K of @h  in East|pg||

nt|sybarra: good point |pg||
nt|panosk: has to decide but after N showing no more @D ruff was safe|pg||

nt|twcho: This tournament is the one that offers the highest prize money for Women bridge players ever|pg||
nt|psridhar: as cards are however, NS havent lost anything |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A nice third-seat weak 2 if available.|pg||

nt|sybarra: Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||

nt|gracelin: The 8 teams will share a pool of US$150,000 in the teams.  Another US$50,000 for the pairs.|pg||
nt|twcho: the prize money is enviable for men. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: The total prize money is US$200,000|pg||
nt|sybarra: teams from all over the world|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not 1NT by West before you may wonder. Because they play a 14-16 NT, a popular range in Sweden|pg||
nt|cmule: ÊÖÉÏAÌ«¶à£¬±¬ÁÑ½ÐÒ²ÊÇ°×±¬ÁÑ|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: On the cards and S's opening, 6@H is not an outre spot on 2, but the best-bid hand award awaits further nominations.|pg||
nt|rv: what is 4@d here by Smith, some play it as good raise in @Cs, a few others play it as both majors|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 4@d as both majors 5-5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E has a solid road here, showing @S and forcing now, can show the @H later.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: if S bids his hearts.....|pg||
nt|rv: can E-W push N-S to 3 level?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and like the typical Neth.  fearlss overcalls|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: west can do something over 1@S now - 1nt, double, 2@H, 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: par contract in 5 in a minor for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, they have very generous sponsors in this Hua Yuen Women Elite Cup|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would much rather have four counts all day than these 10- and 11-counts where you start to get your engine revved up and then shut it down.|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing Trf responses to 1@C opening that 1@s shows @d|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 3@d is touch and go|pg||
nt|granguru:  in total you may find 10.000 I am told but used are around 2000|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and shows diamonds. 3@H a splinter|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 3@H =self splinter |pg||
nt|athene: i certainly would not want to pass, with a near-opener and 5-4 in the unbid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is probably a sort of Lebensold to start a weak bid.|pg||
nt|twcho: with the winner taking 30,000|pg||
nt|twcho: and the last team will still have 12,000|pg||
nt|paulhac:  There are three events closely following each other this one, Beijing and Tianjin the later two being open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Over a more natural 1@C-1@D-1NT auction, E also could bid 3@H to pinpoint the concern.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: west did|pg||
nt|ntmon: do NS play completely natural system?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: Anybody have a problem with 3@D?|pg||
nt|rv: this slam is worse than 1 of 2 finesses, if @h finesse is off chances are not very bright|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally a splinter bid supports partner -a form of raise; but a self splinter suggests a good long suit that doesnt need much support + stiff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West promised a balanced hand, so East knows there's a fit and can splinter for diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the 4 matches going on in round  4 at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=4&tourid=1174|pg||
nt|psridhar: borderline but we can see 3N is right here- West's 3@s will steer them away i expect|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, those intermediate @H spots come into play and though 3@S is thoughtful, it may give E no choice.|pg||
nt|psridhar: E may even think slam now|pg||
nt|psridhar: useful black cards |pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably want a second @S honor to bid 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is Q986 enough to go for 3NT? Borderline|pg||
nt|psridhar: how would W bid @S AQXX,@H JXXX, @D QX, @C AXX ?|pg||
nt|athene: i want to get both suits into it but also showing the fifth heart might be nice|pg||
nt|rv: I like double with Wu's hand on 1@s with 5-4 in reds having passed earlier|pg||
nt|athene: it's just a matter of WHAT you bid over 1@S, not whether you bid :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ssbux: are they playing Lebansohl after a reversed|pg||
nt|psridhar: In my experience bidding 3N with a stopper of sorts AND length = u wont go wrong often|pg||
nt|ntmon: difficult lead for W|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
nt|ssbux: another unlucky slam for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's all coming up orange so far.|pg||
nt|rv: still very decent slam just on @h finesse|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes very decent, but unlucky|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 Nt is aking to go back to 3 @c in first stage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and  last !!!|pg||
nt|rv: my preference is 1n from Wu's hand is scrambling even from unpassed hand to show other 2 suits (prefer it to 5-5 though)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Plenty of room for both major K's to be in N, let alone just the @HK.|pg||
nt|twcho: is this common method played in France?|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd in the end the swedes !|pg||
nt|sybarra: Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174  to see.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: if @h finesse is off, you need @s finesse on and black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: perhaps 3NT should show stiff J or 10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: north, with a little extra, may consider to take action other than 3C, but she has a boarderline hand. |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rv: atleast 55% or so |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes   perhaps  South was not  very optimistec   it  not such a bad slam!!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  All are 8 team tournaments|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nkgupt: prefer X to be take out of opened suit (@c)|pg||
nt|rv: sry 1n sandwich nt and not scrambling |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 1nt for 5/5 reds w/ lesser def|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes and got many comments on the matter that  is the reason I gave a public answer...they continue...|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can wander around site and find results as well as standings|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
nt|ssbux: ten of D, signal for S?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes  from a passed hand    it is  Take out double|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ntmon: @S lead did not cost a trick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panosk: for more info check this link http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TwoWayCheckback.html|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @d would be easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a hand of various judgments where each bid sort of means what its bidder wanted to mean at the time.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Exactly, Roland.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kiwibridge: good unblock N after his good lead|pg||
nt|rv: agree with NK on double is t/o of shorter suit on any (1x)-p-(1y), (ex) (1h)-p-(1s)-X here is t/o of @hs with @s tolerance|pg||
nt|nkgupt: also has the advantage of noncommitment to play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: now 2@H and still a @D to lose|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcwla: The 3@S could have been a slightly better suit, the 3NT could have been a slightly better stiff, 4@D presumably would be forcing (but was there an ounce of fear that maybe it would ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: be passed), 4@S would likely have shown a slightly better second @S card, and on and on.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: Paul, I think you will be joining the Open events|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcwla: Right - here, it is clearly showing @D length.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was a horrid contract created by E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True, Aces needed for upgradation.|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is enroute to china now |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: unless|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|twcho: still they are NV so south no need to push so hard|pg||
nt|gracelin: south does have only one Q and 2 Jacks, but his minor suit fit plus a H shortage maybe enough to find a game invitation bid.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulhac:  Tianjin only but my sons are playing in Beijing also|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||

nt|panosk: there was a minor squeeze to N but thats double dummy|pg||

mb|2N|nt|andyv:  EW don't have enough to compete at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dont like emmediate 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: North's 1n shows 18-19 here|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally 9 tricks are available for N-S with lucky lie of red suits|pg||
nt|twcho: depends on the overall opening bid structure|pg||
nt|granguru:  North made an agressiv bid. |pg||
nt|othered1: Looks good enough for a vulnerable game and it's the red intermediates that make it even that good|pg||
nt|ntmon: N has nice fit for parner, given the circumstances|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: The bridge Championship is being played at Shenzen, a beautiful city adjacent to Hongkong. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: catching up the scores now|pg||
nt|panosk: yes that was the threat but how can he know club honors not divided|pg||
nt|kerasidis: as it could be with weaker habnds|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hands|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 3@c maybe|pg||
nt|kemperg: did not know that, but @H had no use|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|kerasidis: there are partners with great aggrements with such hands...2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi carl|pg||
nt|ssbux: as I said previously, it is unusally to start with same boards when directed by Anthony|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If I was green I might be tempted|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just feels like a "good" hand |pg||
nt|nkgupt: one good reason for getting in on priv. is also having no clear lead on @s partial:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as W i mean|pg||
nt|cmule: ¶«Î÷·½×î¼Ñ¶¨Ô¼ÊÇ4-3ÅäµÄ6d|pg||
nt|ntmon: still i think S hand is worth some attempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  everyone wiling to play 1N except the author of the bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will be fortunate to go down 1|pg||
nt|ssbux: very lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for 2@H opening in fourth chair?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/S being talked out of good spot in @S's|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirmed by a spec, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: I really do not have any first hand knowledge, but looks like Precision|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C shows more high cards indeed so in case EW go to 5 level N doent have a clue about pards hand|pg||
nt|loe48: many use 2nt as good raise in this pos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Carl|pg||
nt|loe48: invite + in spade|pg||
nt|panosk: with the 4@S bid that is, agree with Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes many alternative bids...depends on partners aggrements|pg||
nt|kemperg: to much in @C nothing in red suits, 4@S good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't this the hand for it?|pg||
nt|granguru:  Probably could not double because of conventional meaning |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panosk: N was a bit conservative for me shud have tried 2 spades|pg||
nt|rv: anyone open 2n (20-21) with North hand, what does K-R say?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michielsen showing 18-19 balanced with her 1NT|pg||
nt|twcho: south is conservative not to overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: the winner of the 8-team competiton will take home US$30,000 and the  8 also has US$12,000.  At moment, France is leading after one match and the Dutch is lying 3rd.|pg||
nt|twcho: probably deterred by the spot cards she held|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D GF checkback; i don't know what range of shapes they allow for the 1nt rebid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d is a FG  check back|pg||
nt|granguru:  some pairs play 1m X 1@S X as @S  to avoid psyquics|pg||
nt|othered1: The long and the short of it is don't lose more than 2 red tricks.|pg||
nt|granguru:  having all the intermediates in @D is a nice thing|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are bringing up 2 more tables shortly|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ianmcc: @d most likely, will cost a trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Ns   remained silence with 25  hpc |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-15 with 6 or some such|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: I suspect K-R will show more than 19 hcp for North hand, possibly not enough for 2n opening|pg||
nt|granguru:  alternative use is a responsive double the traditional way i.e. other 2 suits|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  A@h and @h|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes shape and values suit 2@H opening -but some authorites feel the hand should not have > 4 controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards not lying well for Heather Dhondy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well that @C9 ain't bad.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must still lose 2 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 club|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S should show a fairly poor hand i think; 4 of anything else must be a cue for spades|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: 20.45 per KR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And can easily go 2 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: John and Ed,,   you will be on your own for a bit  while I set those up |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: This event does not have website or any other information online|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S made on 3 so an early 12 imps to HuaChu|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@s probably denies M|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ssbux: with a passed partner, no convenient bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW need to dodge the @s @d squeeze|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: oh oh  hope we are not losing it again  |pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes Shirley|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can build a heart trick here without too much problem i think|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|twcho: Paul, do you know about EW bidding system?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: however can't beat 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one of those hands that cries out for a trump lead|pg||
nt|loe48: but..as crazy cards can be..opponents may have contract too..so 4s is also blocking alot same it can make|pg||
nt|twcho: and the double indicates @s suit|pg||
nt|peachy: The auction, to me, sounds like N did not believe South knew it was spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S= 1n?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I suppose Susan was afraid that if she bid 3@C she might push them into a makeable game|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl by S clearly penalty|pg||
nt|psridhar: but can be beaten yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  there is a good decision to play the hand by N if S has @SAxx|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ssbux: dangerous with 1NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree with south's pass over 1C, but may overcall 1H with the N hand.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: south is bit weak   to vercall 1 Nt and has 2 cards in @h not enogh to double she estimated|pg||
nt|gracelin: not for lead directing, of course, but allows partner to join the party with suitable hands.|pg||
nt|twcho: if the @c7 is replaced by @c10, I guess many will overcall 1NT then|pg||
nt|granguru:  in order to protect the @SQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psridhar: declarer herself may seek an entry in @d queen|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|panosk: no |pg||
nt|panosk: with @D 2-2 and J10 @C dropping they can even make 3@C :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: the uppercut works !|pg||
nt|sybarra: miight get a trump now |pg||
nt|rv: will anyone in panel open 2n?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: I think 3@C is better as N will know S also have defensive values. I wud bid 4@S without @CKJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes indeed, Tommy.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 3 NL pir reached 3Nt which should nod be a success|pg||
nt|ntmon: let's see CR result|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kerasidis: in one of them doubled could gain some imps|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: paying on @h after cashing the trump insutre 10 tricks  11 here|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If Norths X showed spades I wonder why she did not then bid 2@H if she was prepared to stand the X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=4&tourid=1174   running scores|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psridhar: now there is no chance of misdef|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Disappointing tournament for USA and China Utd so far, great performance by the Dutch |pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Sweden until early this morning|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  making 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would only because I hate the rebids|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: some imps back to France then|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe it's good for NS to defend 2S rather than bidding their 25 points game which wouldn't make.|pg||
nt|peachy: Exactly|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s4|nt|panosk: my only concern is that if opps bid 5@C pass by N isnt forcing after 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: can see only 7 tricks for declarer.|pg||
nt|athene: just better not try something cute, like leading to the @CA intending to try to sneak the singleton @HK through|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|cmule: E¼ÒÔÚ½«ÅÆÉÏµÄ´¦ÀíºÜ×¨Òµ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: par contract par result perfect :)|pg||
nt|athene: just lead the @HK from hand, boring but 100% |pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  S needs to cash A@h and exit with @s or @c|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcwla: E feeling comfortable to underlead @DA with the big hand coming down in dummy.|pg||

nt|jcwla: This one went pear-shaped, though was never going to be pretty.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  that's why I open 2NT...pd can't bid 1@s|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 8 now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
