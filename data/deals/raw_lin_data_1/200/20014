mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: but it has been 10 hards days for the young players|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: pretty strong for Multi, even at these colors, but as i mentioned earlier, the national tendency in france is to be solid|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of play - and prob some party'es :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I would also open 2@D :):)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: even within the context of French standards, 2D is marginal I think because of the playability in spades|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: here all roads lead to 4S, though the D lead would probably be somewhat harder to read had the opening bid been 1H|pg||
nt|pelu: to day - spec in Europe - a lot of playeres know very well how to defend against Multi, so there are "many" who play Multi a little more contructiv that before |pg||
nt|marlowepi: here declarer can afford to suffer a ruff and it might well simplify the play for him by drawing a half-round of trumps:)|pg||
