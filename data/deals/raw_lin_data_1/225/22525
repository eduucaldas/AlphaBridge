nt|kingcur: of course, but it sure contributed to the excitement!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: we all win matches by 1, and lose them by 1, over the years|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|kingcur: And Gerbrand Hop quietly hoping the trump split may be enough to set this 4@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: not going for @C ruffs but leading the long suit, often the best idea when you have defensive values in trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East may play on clubs immediately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can afford to lose three tricks|pg||
nt|kingcur: in the closed, it was S who preempted 3@H after a 2nd seat 1@S opening by E there. @HK lead there too|pg||

nt|lady007:  welcome to the final of the white house juniors|pg||
nt|lady007:  we saw 2 very close matches yesterday, lets hope it will be just as exciting today!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lady007:  on the first board EW can make 4@s, even with the bad breaks, but they shouldnt get any higher|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzbn: they play Capp (transfers)  over 1M  -  X  - |pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials segment 2/4 from lahore.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: I missed the bidding but the contract is 2NT by South|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|lady007:  Fisher leads his nice heart sequence instead of his singleton, because he has good spades and is not looking for a ruff|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: @cQ can be only vital card of the whole deal|pg||
nt|lady007:  now lets see how van den Bos should play. he is probably worried about spades 4-1, but the bidding makes it more likely its with north than with south|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lady007:  he pitches a diamond, because if diamonds are 32, he can always discard a club on the diamonds later|pg||

nt|kingcur: a nice start|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzye: 1nt alerted 5+ spades |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kingcur: The Dutch pair in the closed - Joris van Lankveld & Berend van den Bos - did double a number of games that came in with overtricks earlier this tournament. It will do their ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: composure good to see their first try today resulted in 800|pg||
nt|mdgraham: worth doubling 4@s at the start of a long match - only 5 out (if team-mates bid and make it too) abd a nice investment if it goes off (plus it tells the oppo not to over pre-empt) |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: suspect 1NT=@s|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: nice bid given that they are trying to recover alot of imps this segment|pg||
nt|lady007:  they can make both 6@h and 6@s if they guess the spades (and possible the clubs, on a unlikely club lead if played by north)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to small slam   and make it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: i'd bid 4@h with the S hand|pg||
