nt|serhat: an other 4s.. DF would make it again:)|pg||

nt|serhat: on a@C lead he has only one line trick by trick|pg||

nt|stiffqueen: now david lille needs to make it - not easy with the doubleton dueen of diamonds off-side a 9th trick isnt all that easy to find|pg||

nt|stiffqueen: unlikely that lillee will find thew winning queen of spades|pg||

nt|stiffqueen: lille will in effect be able to play either defender for the queen of diamonds but he will need to pick norths shape |pg||

nt|jlall: delmonte answered keycards for clubs |pg||
nt|serhat: seeing Burgess so far they might bid 6s|pg||
nt|gambler3: can he stop in 5@S?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlall: if he signs off in 5S, gosney should double imo|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jlall: he will "know" his partner has 2 keycards|pg||
nt|jlall: thus, club ruff, cross to partners ace, club ruff is indicated|pg||
nt|jlall: and partner will work out that its a club void if you double|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gambler3: Just backed another loser!|pg||
nt|jlall: well, thats a good reason to not double...they could run to 5N which is cold|pg||
nt|jlall: oh no, its played by south|pg||
nt|serhat: :)|pg||
nt|jlall: gosney would still have to find a heart lead rather than diamond|pg||
nt|gambler3: Choice of slams I think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: on a @D lead it makes :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jlall: i think that ish thought 3S was a cuebid, not a fit, and that 5S was a request for partner to bid 5N|pg||
nt|jlall: if spades was not a possible suit, 5S would ask partner to bid 5N to play when youre off two keycards|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|serhat: J @H ?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|s4|nt|jlall: I think gosney has to lead a diamond, he knows an accident has occurred and dummy has a stiff diamond, hoping for partner to have AQ of diamonds plus his other keycard is really ...|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|s5|nt|stiffqueen: playing quickly as he spots 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jlall: if you lead a heart youre playing partner for the heart king as well as 2 keycards|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: via 1 spade - 4 hearts - 2 diamonds - and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: this was a fine choice to play 3nt instead of their 8 card spade fit breaking poorly - a likely swing|pg||
pc|sT|nt|serhat: no he knows Ish is short in D|pg||

nt|cathychua: Maybe it will be hard not to play 4S now.|pg||
nt|cathychua: If 3D over 1D was inappropriate, then 3N now can't be right, can it?|pg||
nt|cathychua: 3C if it is forcing?|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: peter might contemplate a more agressive auction knowing its likely that the other table might too|pg||
nt|cathychua: Not to mention he is making 6S opposite nothing.|pg||
nt|cathychua: I mean, the right nothing, of course!|pg||
nt|cathychua: Though 2N is discouraging.|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: i think he will tank for another minute or 2 and bid 3nt|pg||
nt|cathychua: But what was the point of his auction then?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: i suspected burgess would never play 3N after 1S p 2D with his actual hand, well judged i think|pg||
nt|serhat: yes I didnt expect Steve would pull it|pg||
nt|jlall: ish will bid 4@S with stiff T i think|pg||
nt|jlall: the ten is a big one, especially if his auction suggests not having 2 spades|pg||
nt|gambler3: He had shown no @D support|pg||
nt|jlall: his slow round suits also argue for bidding 4S, as well as mediocre diamonds|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: 9 tricks the limit in spades with a loser in each suit - i think lillee will pass|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|jlall: nice bid|pg||
nt|cathychua: Damn it. You win again.|pg||

nt|gambler3: very good bid from Ish|pg||
nt|serhat: may be 5d is also possible|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
