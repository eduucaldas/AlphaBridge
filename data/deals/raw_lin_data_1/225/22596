nt|gambler3: Hi Justin|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|jlall: ish recently won the vanderbilt in USA, one of our two most important national knockout events in USA|pg||
nt|cathychua: Yes, but maybe that should force 3N from Sartaj...if pards has weak clubs, then above 3N will be too high.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: not correct auction... but we are caught up to the play (waiting for West to lead)|pg||
nt|serhat: an other 4s.. DF would make it again:)|pg||
nt|cathychua: On the other hand, on that auction, why not protect your club queen?!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gambler3: But he only game 2nd in the big pairs event won by Justin and Bob Hamman|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambler3: came 2nd|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: this appears to be 3nt going off when an unlikely 4 hearts is a make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: 4S seems very aggressive|pg||
nt|serhat: yes and very hard to make|pg||
nt|jlall: I see on every board that Burgess is always aggressive so I am not surprised|pg||
nt|serhat: on a@C lead he has only one line trick by trick|pg||
nt|gambler3: taps will defeat this|pg||
nt|jlall: after club club you can play diamond diamond, now if they give you a ruff sluff you ruff in dummy and lead a spade to the ten|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|cathychua: I wouldn't mind spec doubling this one and taking them to dinner if they run to 4H making.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|serhat: yes -lets see|pg||
nt|jlall: ish did well to pass, probably figured 5D was unlikely to make |pg||
nt|cathychua: Given the state of the match, I mean...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gambler3: all true-3/3 with J onside  18% but I have been in worse|pg||
nt|serhat: also it looked like 6-6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|jlall: also 2-2 diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|serhat: and no C pro|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|gambler3: ok 7.2%|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jlall: but when you have 10 opp 6 and a 5-2 fit you probably need some luck :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|jlall: they even had 3 wasted jacks|pg||
nt|serhat: going well so far|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is a good example of what to do when youre in a 5-2 or 4-3 fit facing taps, you set up your side suits first in order to keep control in trumps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hT|pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cathychua: Note the opponents bid neither of those hypothetical slams either.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|jlall: if you pull the trumps first then you can only ruff clubs in your hand and you lose control|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: 3N is safe if he bids it, but 4H will have no problems either as he can just ruff  spade in dummy|pg||

nt|jlall: yes, I imagine hes considering between 3N or 4H or 3S to try and get partner to bid 3N, doubt he will pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: last board before lunch|pg||
nt|mwigor: what will ish open justin?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: 4@H|pg||
nt|jlall: or 3@H|pg||
nt|jlall: :)|pg||
mb|2C|an|(17) 18-19 BAL|nt|serhat: good guess|pg||
nt|serhat: :)|pg||
nt|jlall: i think in first seat he'd open 4 but in 2nd seat too likely partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|cathychua: One would think not.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gambler3: will Steve wait to hear 4?|pg||
mb|4C|an|hearts|nt|davidstern: The scores posted here are TOTALLY incorrect|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mwigor: dyke found a very nice line in the other room to escape for down 1|pg||
nt|gambler3: same auction in other room|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: 18 to maybe a poor 20 if their usual method|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: definitely not clear to X 3@S, would have worked better to pass this time|pg||
nt|mwigor: he eloped with his two low trumps and endplayed south for the @dK|pg||
nt|jlall: yes down 1 looks amazingly good|pg||
nt|bebechira: last board now..thsx a lot to Michael Cornell,Justin Lall, Michael Wilkinson and Serhat Ozenir for a fantastic job|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlall: yes, timing is off now, he needed to ruff the clubs and strip the trumps THEN play the HA (which is what they did at the other table)|pg||
