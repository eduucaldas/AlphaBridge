nt|vugraphzyh: this can get painful|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: normally loosing 1@H and 1@D, maybe Karlsson is afraid of a heart ruff (south has overcalled 3@S)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: first round heart finesse a possibility on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzyh: Gal should pass, if p doubles and you have 2@C|pg||

mb|1S|nt|pbertheau: another what it looks like  boring hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: when you play middle of remaining cards you only create confusion|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzyg: I suspect Padon was in a suit pref situation with his 2nd @C - seems odd to choose middle one otherwise|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: suit preference pointless on bidding, spades not going anywhere|pg||
nt|pbertheau: daniel might be looking for 3nt  now|pg||

nt|vugraphzyh: well I dont see any other option|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and N took care to play his highest club|pg||
nt|xenya: so that S now knows there is no future in the suit|pg||
nt|april7: S knows ace of @H is sngleton, because E overtook with J first trick|pg||

nt|xenya: declarer would have done better to play the @HQ at trick 1, ensuring 10 tricks -- but what's an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: guess so, but if p has @CJ it is off with clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: and I guess Lotan is thinking about that|pg||

nt|april7: as he really did|pg||
mb|3D|nt|april7: a partial in @S or @H, but now EW could get into trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: good agressive double by Karlson drives North- South to 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyh: asking for the wrong ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: this can get interestigng|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the W hand is definitely worth upgrading|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: good lead by Gal|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Gerstner|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: although I would have led the J, what would you have done Vladimir and Johan?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm asgraid i would have led the J too :)|pg||
nt|xenya: *afraid|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: we lack talent for this game Vladimir|pg||
mb|3H|nt|april7: and what about the K of @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 5@s exclusion would have been better|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: I agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: now you really dont know|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have to assume that 6@h is on, of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: but in the worst case it is on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|april7: is S going to lead the ace or a trump|pg||
nt|april7: I mean in 7!!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but given the heart support and 2@c response, that's pretty darned likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: 7@C and north has to lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: is this possible?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Lotan telling which ace he has|pg||
nt|april7: now its over with the possible wrong lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent of East to give South the chance |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: most certainly, Tim|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Daniel not sure which trump is agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Karlsson|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: good lead|pg||
nt|april7: outcome depending on @C play|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: think best line is to play on the spades in trick two|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: pitching two diamonds on the spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: and guess the clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: don't think he can quite manage that|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|april7: and also telling E that the @D ace is in S's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: at least I guess|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: nevertheless a good board for the Swedes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - 3@s was presumably a splinter agreeing clubs, but the 4NT bid came after heart support    |pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: since the Israelis missed a great sacrifice|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzyh: Ida has to find 2 Queens for making this contract|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  she will i think|pg||
nt|xenya: looks right to play S for the @DQ |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they have got to a making vulnerable slam, and NS have missed an 800 save, so it's a pretty decent board for EW  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Lotan thinking of a heart switch|pg||

nt|vugraphzyh: west can now make some diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzyh: good bidding by north south, with the favorable layout of the cards this will pretty easily make|pg||

nt|vugraphzyh: I would think bidding is at least -500|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: 4@S making is just 790|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: and sometimes partner has 4 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Better than 790|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: But the board was lost for Sweden in the other room anyway|pg||
