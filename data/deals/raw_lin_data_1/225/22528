nt|lady007:  welcome to the final of the white house juniors|pg||
nt|lady007:  we saw 2 very close matches yesterday, lets hope it will be just as exciting today!|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we are go|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lady007:  on the first board EW can make 4@s, even with the bad breaks, but they shouldnt get any higher|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzbn: they play Capp (transfers)  over 1M  -  X  - |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: so 2@s is a weak  raise |pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @S guess i think|pg||
mb|2N!|an|inv+ 4+!s|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials segment 2/4 from lahore.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzbn: I missed the bidding but the contract is 2NT by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: they will bid 4s and will come down to find the trumps quuen|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lady007:  Fisher leads his nice heart sequence instead of his singleton, because he has good spades and is not looking for a ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan Open teams National Trials from Lahore|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: @cQ can be only vital card of the whole deal|pg||
nt|lady007:  now lets see how van den Bos should play. he is probably worried about spades 4-1, but the bidding makes it more likely its with north than with south|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzyf: if you misguess can eliminate @c and @d and let them open the @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: queen even|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but won't work here|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lady007:  he pitches a diamond, because if diamonds are 32, he can always discard a club on the diamonds later|pg||
nt|lady007:  north might have made it more difficult for declarer here to duck his ace|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

pc|dK|pc|s2|nt|lady007:  declarer cant ruff his club anymore, but he can discard it on the diamonds. so 10 tricks it is|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: one @S and then @C would have been better|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lady007:  a possible slam hand for NS coming up here|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 15 flat.. 4s bid and made at both tables|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|qasim2003: nice bid given that they are trying to recover alot of imps this segment|pg||
nt|lady007:  they can make both 6@h and 6@s if they guess the spades (and possible the clubs, on a unlikely club lead if played by north)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to small slam   and make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @C wrong so 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|qasim2003: i'd bid 4@h with the S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|qasim2003: but 3@h makes so a nice result for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess he 'll show a good "pudding"raise now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@c should show 4@s now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lady007:  hmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: this reminds me of a friend -  has no dbl in my mind|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@s seems rather passive|pg||
nt|bobholl: joris inspired ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think he should pass now. 4@s shows a bad hand for slam (else 4@c)|pg||
nt|bebechira: tell him not to pass Dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: without @c lead it's one out of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 trupms and 12 points doubtfull|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with @c lead you need @dK onside (best chance)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: you don't finesse @c at trick 1 as you need at least another finesse, take @cA and finesse @d only 1 finesse needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: S has no|pg||
nt|ady: no   not even a try from North   maybe direct raise to 3 limited with their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: pity but understandable|pg||

nt|bobholl: but the red kings position he didn't like :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Israel in 4 as well in the open room..so it will be flat|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in their system van den Bos could have bid 3@h over 1@s as well to show 4@s and good hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: well, S started it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: weak NT coming in action|pg||

nt|lady007:  3nt is a good contract but it is unlikely to make on this lay out (diamonds 41) and van Lankveld didnt believe in such a good hand from his partner and didnt try for game|pg||
