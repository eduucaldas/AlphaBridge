mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and apparently people from Monaco are called Monagasques|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|henryb:  pushy to double with N hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  they play 1 NT as forcing 1 R  I think  |pg||
mb|d|nt|smoller:  Yes, 1NT to @S would be forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  suddenly south hand came to live|pg||
pc|dA|nt|smoller:  'I dont think they can beat 2C|pg||
nt|henryb:  It's pushy because you know your side has at most 20 points - and partner could bid in balancing seat|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|henryb:  S led a low club in the other room|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|thorvald: This lead will allow East to make the contract, with some right views|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dkkello:  easier to find J @D now |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|thorvald: With 6QC in south he must finess i @D|pg||
nt|henryb:  North is getting sort of squeezed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|smoller:  3 times clubs will not make North happy|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|smoller:  North might reveal a lot|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the iddle fifth|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer can cash AK of both majors, and then if no Q drops take his best play in @d, which is the finesse|pg||
nt|smoller:  but Sout must help - if not playing to more clubs|pg||
nt|thorvald: thats only 8 tricks South haven't given the club yet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: from this club holding and this bidding - top honour lead or fourth/fifth best? |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|smoller:  still only 8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now a @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  A suit splits 4-2 48% of the time. the Q is doubleton in 1/3 of those cases. so Qx is 16%|pg||
nt|thorvald: AK better as T og Q might drop|pg||
nt|thorvald: You get 3 spade tricks when 3-3 og with Q or T doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  or single|pg||
nt|henryb:  @sAK and another loses only when S has @sQ10xx|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|smoller:  yes, otherwise you can still finesse hearts|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|henryb:  and probably will|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|smoller:  he is on his way down|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still got an endplay on north i he has 4 @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  great play by Auken, ducking the @sQ|pg||
nt|smoller:  yes, right tvorvald|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: he's got the 8of spade ready.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: now he's leaning back, thinking...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Voice points out, like Thorvald, that declarer can (should?) rise, and perhaps play N for both major suit Qs if he has 4 spades|pg||
nt|thorvald: Even i martin gets it wrong its still 3 imps to Schaltz, but Martin won't be happy going down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a compliment to South, that he is taking this long|pg||

nt|othered1: HI, Ole|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|othered1: Probably headed for a straightforward 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  Hi all: CC's here: http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=5654|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW play quite complicated system, so E opened with 1@c - better minor style, W jumped to 2nt|pg||
nt|luffe12:  2@h |pg||
nt|luffe12:  Asking for a stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  showing minors and up to 8 points|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|luffe12:  if u reach 3nt the @h's is the lifeline - and the defence will find it diffcult to prevent W from the @c-suit|pg||
nt|pelu:  EW: relay-precision, NS: 5 card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|sfoxa:  so EW finished in 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  and here EW got an opportunity to play the same suit 1 level lower, but doubled|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  let's see the outcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S has to shift to @hJ now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to clarify the situation in the suit |pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|luffe12:  11 tricks is not that difficult, the 1@h-bid taken into considerration|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning David|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB will take 9 tricks here (by seeing all cards).  May be tougher for a human declarer|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  and defence has to manage red suits carefully to execute full penalty|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|oleberg:  1@H showed 20+|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: not straight forward |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|d7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Dorte & Peter lead low from xx, @s 5 indicates odd number|pg||
nt|ady: if playing ace and another club   douth should play a 2nd spade|pg||
nt|othered1: actually east had  10 tricks double-dummy.  At least, this line will save time|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  4@h don't seem as overboard, but the lay of the card is extremely unlucky for declarer|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  not till the end, actually - @sA is onside|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  NS play Walsch|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Walsh|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if W applies drury, it comes to a push, probably|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C?  SA TExas?|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  where u skip @d on a non gameforcing hand|pg||
nt|ady: west does best to duck |pg||
nt|pelu:  3@D = 1 0r 2 4 card major, 3@H I have @s|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like it (minor suits transfer to majors)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  W can try 3NT now|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  declarer can try his luck in @d - no success|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  and small @s for getting off lead|pg||
nt|luffe12:  still 9|pg||
nt|ady: might try low club|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|henryb:  fourth best from his longest and strongest?|pg||
nt|smoller:  Can he escape for 500?, if hearts are not led|pg||
nt|mdgraham: both Easts, not unreasonably, taking action, but the West hand is not what they were hoping for   |pg||
nt|henryb:  I always heard that the congratulatory jack was played by declarer to reassure partner that the contract is secure|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Roland says this called for the congratulatins Jack @D J  |pg||
nt|henryb:  as spelled above|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Likely will pick up an imp or two for EW (or more, perhaps, if played by east at other table)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sfoxa:  obvious style with 5 spades and good @h fit is to bid @s first and jump in @h next|pg||
nt|pelu:  Hi John has just joined another table|pg||
nt|athene: east might double 1@S, if playing equal level conversion - or even if not|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  may be, this pair has different methods|pg||
nt|othered1: North's preempt is sound by today's standards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s are likely to get to game    but looks a struggle|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he goes quietly|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sfoxa:  3@c was for 9-11 balanced with 4-cards fit|pg||
nt|luffe12:  the defence from S on  2 still wonders a bit - as he could count to 10 in with @c k|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: might have a cjance on a club lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you double with east's cards, opposite a passed hand?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, one loser is gone|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|athene: even though (in theory) it looks as though the defence can get 6 tricks with two overruffs on spades|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|luffe12:  based on the bidding the @H lead is not too far away|pg||
nt|athene: it just won't work because declarer throws a club |pg||
pc|sK|pc|cT|nt|athene: and if north had cashed his @CJ first, he would not have an entry for the second trump promotion lead|pg||
nt|athene: as so often, ONE ruff with a natural trump trick does not help - in fact costs a trick|pg||
nt|pelu:  not the best defense - N sh have taken @CJ first|pg||

nt|athene: just too tough|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ady: re-double looks as though says show the minor|pg||

mb|p|nt|oleberg:  A club switch is needed, but they will get two chances|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: without the 2@H intervention showing spades   would presume east west would have played in spades|pg||
nt|luffe12:  at least not a pretty result for EW, as 3@c is close|pg||
nt|athene: not sure where 4@H came from - west couldn't have a worse hand, could he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to lead @hK|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @cA lead seems nornal, but fails|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ady: looks like a quiet 1NT passed out|pg||
nt|pelu:  dont count when @D = trumf|pg||
nt|othered1: Could south have inferred north had only a doubleton @D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  2@d is multi-like opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but has only weak variant (by this pair)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  so, it means, weak two in major|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  3@h - pass or correct|pg||
nt|ady: should not have any problems on the lay with K@S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  1NT = 12-14 so E too strong - and he dont like 2 small @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt is showing clubs?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I recall correctly, 1Nt is artificial, showing clubs|pg||
nt|athene: EW are strong club and weak NT, so 1@D is always unbalanced?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  With longest diamonds or even length|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3NT will just make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so transfer rebids|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: should do well   around 9 tricks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  at this point very quite, but some interesting hand though|pg||
nt|othered1: your lead here?  Trying to find partner's long suit is possible, but partner doesn't have lots of entries.|pg||
nt|othered1: Can north duck this to keep communications?|pg||
