nt|vugraphzyh: so good board for Israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: very aggressive bidding by S and W|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: good bid by Gullberg, think he will make this contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzyh: but that is not the right bid on this board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4NT maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: I would think bidding is at least -500|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: 4@S making is just 790|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: and sometimes partner has 4 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Better than 790|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: But the board was lost for Sweden in the other room anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: so safeing is only right when its 500 vs 790 |pg||
nt|april7: or @D switch, but not enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
