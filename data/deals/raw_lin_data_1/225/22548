mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  showing minors and up to 8 points|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  carryover is gone|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  obvious style with 5 spades and good @h fit is to bid @s first and jump in @h next|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  may be, this pair has different methods|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: n/s are likely to get to game    but looks a struggle|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  3@c was for 9-11 balanced with 4-cards fit|pg||
nt|luffe12:  the defence from S on  2 still wonders a bit - as he could count to 10 in with @c k|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: might have a cjance on a club lead|pg||

mb|3H|nt|dagold: on the bidding in the other room, east had a very good hand but only 3@s so took the low road reasonably enough|pg||
nt|smoller:  I guess that West will never be able to show his 5th spade|pg||
mb|d|nt|dagold: some people open 1M with 5M/6m poor hand for this reason|pg||

nt|henryb:  What? East would bid 4@h after partner opened 1@s and North overcalled 3@h|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to join us on 10 local time (8am GMT, I suppose) - a little bit early for playing but pretty well for watching :)|pg||
nt|luffe12:  @s + minor |pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 2@H?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Michaels cuebid revised = @s + longer minor|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make game in both majors   will they play spades now?|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ady: re-double looks as though says show the minor|pg||
nt|luffe12:  the pass from E is forcing, i assume|pg||
nt|ady: e/w only have borderline values for game   so may be in a part score|pg||
nt|luffe12:  we shall see in a sec|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|ady: without the 2@H intervention showing spades   would presume east west would have played in spades|pg||
nt|luffe12:  at least not a pretty result for EW, as 3@c is close|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to lead @hK|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @cA lead seems nornal, but fails|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|smoller:  Here EW can make a lot of hearts, but will they enter the bidding?|pg||
nt|dagold: E would if he can hear opps are limited with @c fit in time|pg||
nt|dagold: if he is in 4th seat with opps in 3@c for example, he would double I am sure|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|henryb:  2N by N, 3@c by S, P-P?|pg||
nt|smoller:  Then E will make TO|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dagold: 2@s is very agressive but the hand is good if a fit is found|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|smoller:  DA lead is not impossible|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dagold: specs suggesting double of 2@d (for takeout) but that would show diamonds for many people since 2@d is artificial|pg||
