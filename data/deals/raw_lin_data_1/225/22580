nt|pbmarstr: With semi support in spades?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|rodvenn: i think so, but this is a probloem if 1 @s might have been bid on meager values|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbz: this table much faster than closed....|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugraphzbz: contract is 3 d east...|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1NT might lead to 2sp -1|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: I have never seen them dance...|pg||

nt|snorre: here is the Butler-ranking after 9 matches, Fyrun-Høyland 4th (or 2nd among pairs played severe|pg||
