mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi:  due to the likelihood of having to lose the lead in diamonds. besides clubs was also a danger suit from the N perspective. A doubleton heart opposite would be enough to protect against a force in that suit. and if S has 3 hearts maybe still ok|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  i was wondering whether E would try 1N|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  usually when there is a double fit of 9 cards each and one slam makes but the other doesnt, it is because with one trump the discard comes in the wrong hand. here the reds are 54 the same way, and the difference has nothing to do with EW hands|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  with consiuderably more reason here than the last one|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  here W has a better hand for defense AND offense|pg||
nt|mamos:  but no more successful|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  and E has voluntarily bid 2N so he has some offense|pg||
nt|bobholl: will make an overtrick i fear :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but why does a vulnerable opp bid 4@s? short @c likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i think the double here is ok, in the context of the voluntary 2N bid by E|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: close match after the first set of 14 boards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|marlowepi:  all W had done up to that point was double 1S. he has a LOT of extra values. if he passes NS might be stealing them blind. i am not saying X is absolutely correct, i am saying that we have to have considerable sympathy for it'|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|weak !s +!c or 16+|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  right and if it doesnt have defence then E will take out the double. obviously the X is not pure penalty after this auction. it shows convertible values and is cooperative|pg||
