mb|p|mb|1D|an| |mb|d|nt|jlall: ish recently won the vanderbilt in USA, one of our two most important national knockout events in USA|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|vugrapha3: not correct auction... but we are caught up to the play (waiting for West to lead)|pg||
nt|serhat: an other 4s.. DF would make it again:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gambler3: But he only game 2nd in the big pairs event won by Justin and Bob Hamman|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gambler3: came 2nd|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4C|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jlall: 4S seems very aggressive|pg||
nt|serhat: yes and very hard to make|pg||
nt|jlall: I see on every board that Burgess is always aggressive so I am not surprised|pg||
nt|serhat: on a@C lead he has only one line trick by trick|pg||
nt|gambler3: taps will defeat this|pg||
nt|jlall: after club club you can play diamond diamond, now if they give you a ruff sluff you ruff in dummy and lead a spade to the ten|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|serhat: yes -lets see|pg||
nt|jlall: ish did well to pass, probably figured 5D was unlikely to make |pg||
pc|c4|nt|gambler3: all true-3/3 with J onside  18% but I have been in worse|pg||
nt|serhat: also it looked like 6-6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jlall: also 2-2 diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|serhat: and no C pro|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|gambler3: ok 7.2%|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jlall: but when you have 10 opp 6 and a 5-2 fit you probably need some luck :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jlall: they even had 3 wasted jacks|pg||
nt|serhat: going well so far|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is a good example of what to do when youre in a 5-2 or 4-3 fit facing taps, you set up your side suits first in order to keep control in trumps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
