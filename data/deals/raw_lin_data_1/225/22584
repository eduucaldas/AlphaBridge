nt|jfaria:  playing @h defense must open @s suit 4 just -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: The only real chance was to finesse the spades, ruff the D and exit with a @h hoping for 5-2 break. Better to have one chance than no chance :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: can we expect a partial contract here?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  a partial at last some 8-9 in @h ew perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jfaria:  i bet|pg||

nt|runnerup:  yes agreeded|pg||
nt|penseur9: many will lead 4th from best suit in NT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|jan_jansma: I think I would Cash @HAK and then go for the @C suit|pg||
nt|kingcur: if Lankveld-vd Bos play 15-17 NT, this might swing? Or would everyone bid to game with W hand?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|runnerup:  misfit .so no game |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: only way to make would have been a @D lead|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, probably did not expect such a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|kingcur: Board 13 initially not considered swingy, but there's 2 /3 imps between 4@H vul and the -500 save that was taken in the closed, so fasten your seatbelts!|pg||

pc|h5|nt|runnerup:  this time west had a clear @h lead but ofcause not every time|pg||
nt|penseur9: @C switch now for -1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  -2|pg||
