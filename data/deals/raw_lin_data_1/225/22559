nt|othered1: HI, Ole|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: Probably headed for a straightforward 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  Hi all: CC's here: http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=5654|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW play quite complicated system, so E opened with 1@c - better minor style, W jumped to 2nt|pg||
nt|luffe12:  2@h |pg||
nt|luffe12:  Asking for a stopper|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@D is multi, a "weak  weak 2 in a major"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  showing minors and up to 8 points|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|oleberg:  A "good weak 2" open two in the suit.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|luffe12:  if u reach 3nt the @h's is the lifeline - and the defence will find it diffcult to prevent W from the @c-suit|pg||
nt|pelu:  EW: relay-precision, NS: 5 card major|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  so EW finished in 3@c|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  and here EW got an opportunity to play the same suit 1 level lower, but doubled|pg||
nt|oleberg:  -1 is the "Par score" as 4@H is making (if you guess the clubs)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But if West leads a low spade, or east leads an honour against 4@H, it is cold.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  let's see the outcome|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to shift to @hJ now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to clarify the situation in the suit |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|luffe12:  11 tricks is not that difficult, the 1@h-bid taken into considerration|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Morning David|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB will take 9 tricks here (by seeing all cards).  May be tougher for a human declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and defence has to manage red suits carefully to execute full penalty|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oleberg:  1@H showed 20+|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Peculiar, looks like -2 now, if he plays for diamonds 3-3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oleberg:  1@S 0 0-4|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2NT strong|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: not straight forward |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|luffe12:  Dorte & Peter lead low from xx, @s 5 indicates odd number|pg||
nt|ady: if playing ace and another club   douth should play a 2nd spade|pg||
nt|othered1: actually east had  10 tricks double-dummy.  At least, this line will save time|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  @d to S and @h back|pg||
nt|luffe12:  11 straight forward tricks |pg||

pc|dT|nt|ady: south|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  4@h don't seem as overboard, but the lay of the card is extremely unlucky for declarer|pg||
nt|pelu:  21-23|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  not till the end, actually - @sA is onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|luffe12:  NS play Walsch|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Walsh|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if W applies drury, it comes to a push, probably|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C?  SA TExas?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|luffe12:  where u skip @d on a non gameforcing hand|pg||
nt|ady: west does best to duck |pg||
nt|pelu:  3@D = 1 0r 2 4 card major, 3@H I have @s|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like it (minor suits transfer to majors)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W can try 3NT now|pg||
nt|ady: if taking ace  needs to switch to a heart to hold to 0 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: i like 0 tricks better :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|oleberg:  6@S is odds-off (I think), but wil probably make is stumbled into|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Lightner double. well enough?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  to get 2 @h tricks, S has to duck now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  declarer can try his luck in @d - no success|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  and small @s for getting off lead|pg||
nt|luffe12:  still 9|pg||
nt|ady: might try low club|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: this lead makes things a lot nicer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|oleberg:  Quite entutiastic bidding by north, but he migth roll it home|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Leif W Thomsen|pg||
nt|oleberg:  welcome|pg||
nt|luffe12:  hi Ole|pg||
nt|oleberg:  An unenviable position for West. The club switch is understandable, but now declarer "only" needs to guess hearts. Which is vitually a toss-up|pg||
nt|oleberg:  the risk of playing diamonds is, that if declarer gets it right, the club-loser will disappear.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  a kibitzer points out (rigthly I think) that declarer will always have to run the @D10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  as he need to bring in @d it seems a bit akward|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: now the simplest line looks like ruffing two hearts in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sfoxa:  the matter or course seems obvious as for now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: just needs 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: heart ruff, club to king, heart ruff, @SK, spade to ace, claim|pg||
nt|athene: the @S9 does give you some theoretical chances of overcoming a 4-1 break but in practice you can't really, without seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|pelu:  wellcome to John Norris "pumpumpum"|pg||
nt|pelu:  hi John|pg||
pc|d4|nt|luffe12:  my guess is 1 down|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but Martin has a good table presence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good evening all |pg||
nt|oleberg:  On this board I'd rather say he is a sharp declarer, and is forced to do the rigth thing|pg||
nt|luffe12:  hi Marshall|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Martin likes it - so far|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The play of the @S10 indicates he will go right in hearts, or else it would have been postponed.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I meant the play of the @D10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but this time u will end up in declarers hand, so...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  let's see the continuation|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @sA may be fatal for defence|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or rather, @sQ was fatal already|pg||

pc|sK|pc|hJ|pc|s4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  but after N took @s with J and continued with the @sQ, S should know, partner hasn't @s10|pg||

nt|marlowepi: then 5D?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  obvious style with 5 spades and good @h fit is to bid @s first and jump in @h next|pg||
nt|pelu:  Hi John has just joined another table|pg||
nt|athene: east might double 1@S, if playing equal level conversion - or even if not|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sfoxa:  may be, this pair has different methods|pg||
nt|othered1: North's preempt is sound by today's standards.|pg||

nt|luffe12:  4nt?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: n/s are likely to get to game    but looks a struggle|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he goes quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  3@c was for 9-11 balanced with 4-cards fit|pg||
nt|luffe12:  the defence from S on  2 still wonders a bit - as he could count to 10 in with @c k|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ady: might have a cjance on a club lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you double with east's cards, opposite a passed hand?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes|pg||
nt|oleberg:  and feel lucky I didn't bid 3NT|pg||
mb|5D|nt|oleberg:  6@D/@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe they play 4D as forcing as otherwise either pass or 3N. not unreasonable at IMPs i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, one loser is gone|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  and it may be enough to win the contract|pg||

nt|luffe12:  2@d = checkback Stayman - gameforcing|pg||
nt|ady: club lead should make   set up long spade|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Bothersome board for NS. They have not acted unreasonable, but there is simply no way to win on the board, only to hope for a tie.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  for those who joined us - thank you for watching, today we are following Belarus National Teams final|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we started with semifinals this morning - and it was our first BBO appearance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4D doesnt tell N enough to envision enough winners|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: 9 tricks level    3 spades makes|pg||
nt|luffe12:  competitive however|pg||
nt|luffe12:  NS may go overboard however|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can only make 8 tricks with the 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice catch in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: dont think n/s will play the hand|pg||
nt|luffe12:  3@h = max support for @s|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hello Bob|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and for 3rd place match http://bridge-belarus.org/b1112/komandnik/fin/kom_fin_20111t2-1.htm|pg||
nt|bobholl: good thaT EAST found the hand too strong for 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: if they do they will be 2 tricks too high|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because 5C after 4S is probably just a cue|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: anyway clubs might be better|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  17 pc and 5-card-suit - definitely to strong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and one more point - this pair uses weak NT when non-vul|pg||
nt|athene: tricky lead problem|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: surprising S passed in third, even at these colors & if playing forcing club|pg||
mb|p|nt|luffe12:  wd|pg||
nt|luffe12:  top spot|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: declarer quite likely to have a weak 2@S with four hearts for this auction?|pg||
nt|pelu:  2@S = weak 6+ @s|pg||
nt|athene: but there are other possibilities, such as a weak spade suit, depending on NS's weak-two proclivities|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  wow!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is S brave enough to try @cA?|pg||
nt|bobholl: what else ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  spade, for instance )))|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  but after this bidding, S should reject any hope for @s trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bobholl: north can smell the misfit|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  next door, NS found their way to 6@h after S qualified his hand for 3@c bid - game forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west, having already shown a decent hand, doesn't feel obliged to double this, just because he has quite a few points|pg||
nt|pelu:  It spec for them - the normal use in DEN is that it show 5-5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  2@d is 4th-suit forcing|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  seems reasonable, yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even 3NT looks not so bad|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ady: 6@S  makes e/w     difficult to reach|pg||
nt|luffe12:  D = high /low unbid suits or just gameforce|pg||
nt|othered1: EW had some safety in @D, but 5-level is really pushy at these colors.  Assuming double was penalty-oriented, south will likely let the next action to partner. (at the risk of ...|pg||
nt|othered1: losing a great @S spot)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 6 diamonds fails to a spade lead  if giving a spade ruff|pg||
nt|ady: will east be confident of 5 card spade suit?|pg||

nt|athene: well 4@S shows a decent hand :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  they have special meaning for 2@h (4-4 minors and stopper in H with 11-12 pc)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, this auction, same well-stopped contract|pg||
nt|ady: very distributional hand    both diamond and spade slam at risk to bad brakes|pg||

nt|athene: obviously west can't continue hearts to any effect, but even if east had won the first trump and played a heart back, it would not have inconvenienced declarer that much|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  2-0-1 not GF, just 10+|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ady: seems  3NT can make e/w      unlikely contract|pg||
nt|luffe12:  3D! = sound raise to 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: yes it's cold if east leads a top heart|pg||
nt|athene: i guess because you can establish a heart trick by pinning the jack|pg||

pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  with passive lead, @c, for instance, it's very hard to play|pg||
nt|luffe12:  2 chances - only needed one :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  easy down on a @D-ruff, but there are only 11 trick on all leads|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: and unlucky that @D are 41|pg||
nt|athene: well, 12 if he doesn't lead the @DA, surely|pg||
nt|athene: ruff a spade, draw trumps, @CAk throwing diamond, and diamond up|pg||
nt|pelu:  the @h-slam - not 4@h|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: you have to take two rounds of trumps before the spade ruff|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  oh, yes, and thank you to all pointing it out |pg||
nt|othered1: West could have cnsidered a @D cue-bid, if it asked for choice of game and would imply good @S (unless west continues)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  4@S is also on with the fortunate lay in hearts, but 5@C is the right contract.|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a non-trivial hand to play.  |pg||

mb|1C|nt|ady: looks like a quiet 1NT passed out|pg||
nt|pelu:  dont count when @D = trumf|pg||
nt|othered1: Could south have inferred north had only a doubleton @D?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  1@C = 15+ bal or 16+ any|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  2@d is multi-like opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but has only weak variant (by this pair)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Pas = 0-7|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (Or penalty)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|sfoxa:  so, it means, weak two in major|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  3@h - pass or correct|pg||
nt|ady: should not have any problems on the lay with K@S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  1NT = 12-14 so E too strong - and he dont like 2 small @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt is showing clubs?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I recall correctly, 1Nt is artificial, showing clubs|pg||
nt|athene: EW are strong club and weak NT, so 1@D is always unbalanced?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  With longest diamonds or even length|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3NT will just make it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: so transfer rebids|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: should do well   around 9 tricks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  at this point very quite, but some interesting hand though|pg||
nt|othered1: your lead here?  Trying to find partner's long suit is possible, but partner doesn't have lots of entries.|pg||
nt|othered1: Can north duck this to keep communications?|pg||
nt|othered1: And might @SK have been considered.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, transfer rebids|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: getting diamonds right might make 10|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  next door, S denied @h start and lets E win 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just has to play spades for one loser to escape for one down here|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|pelu:  1@D = unballanced hand ofte more @c that @ds|pg||
nt|athene: maybe a small club now, playing partner for @CKJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oleberg:  Simply underleading the @SA would have worked much better|pg||
nt|oleberg:  as would a diamond switch|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But this defence is not easy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|luffe12:  and  11 the same for konow|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  welcome to rejoin us and thasnk you for watching today|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if there was some misunderstanding over the @C8 discard|pg||
nt|athene: or whether east simply felt the @SA opposite was the only chance to beat the contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oleberg:  No matter what, the han will not be able to enjoy the hearts|pg||

nt|luffe12:  finally some action - at least in OR|pg||
nt|pelu:  here 1NT would be 15-17|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The very fine duck with the @HA yielded two tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  sp prob 1@C by S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: now 3@D might end it|pg||
nt|othered1: some number of @S EW here, perhaps depending on west's opening|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: West is off-shape and a bit too strong for 12-14 NT opening.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  4@h is high|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|d|nt|ady: n/s should reach 3NT|pg||
nt|luffe12:  other match is 50-21 for Pharma incl. 12imps carryover|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Not really. @DQ onside, or a small miracle in hearts|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Notice East disregarded his 5-card heart suit|pg||
nt|oleberg:  seems reasonable to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@S looks puchy on 9-loser hand, even opposite a likely strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: pushy, that is|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oleberg:  On some leads playing on spades would also have some merit|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But as it is, the contract is doomed.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: If west was limited, even more pushy|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: can make this   which would gain 3 imps|pg||
nt|luffe12:  as lines between EW is almost non existing 9 tricks should be within sight|pg||
nt|luffe12:  even with a misguess in @h it should be possible|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He has a dimond fit, and if partner has a heart-fit, opponents are vitually sure to have a spade-club doublefit|pg||
nt|pelu:  that will make the play fast|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|luffe12:  OR: 3nt in  11, no swing|pg||
nt|luffe12:  and they duly got to 4@s in  12|pg||
nt|othered1: Even switching partner's major suit lengths wouldn't provide a cold game, on the auction.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|oleberg:  South has read the lead, and hopes to park his some losers on the spades|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cQ|pc|h3|nt|oleberg:  With spades 3-3 and the rest distributed as it is, the contract would have made|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|oleberg:  South simply take a heart finesse, to keep the danherous han off lead, and the tops the hearts and ruffs a club, only giving two hearts and a spade|pg||
