mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: by pasing now:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: s|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt in other room here looks a bit high -eventhought it has some chances ofcause|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  looks like in other table -exactly same bidding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: same bidding both rooms|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may consider that the Israelis will probably be very aggressive in the game zone on this set, so he cannot afford to miss a game, however thin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, that tactic can backfire|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup:  entryes are bad -so looks hopeless game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not easy to defend - two rounds of hearts by the defence and declarer is vey badly placed |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better not duck here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but W thinks 3 seconds and plays the logical take|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes no good fit but 10 point -and partner opens with other 10 -so atleast 20 -it means gf --nowadays --very hard actually :)|pg||

nt|lady007:  welcome to the final of the white house juniors|pg||
nt|lady007:  we saw 2 very close matches yesterday, lets hope it will be just as exciting today!|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: lose by 19, because they should lead by 20 :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lool|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|lady007:  on the first board EW can make 4@s, even with the bad breaks, but they shouldnt get any higher|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|Vugraphzbn: they play Capp (transfers)  over 1M  -  X  - |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: so 2@s is a weak  raise |pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @S guess i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials segment 2/4 from lahore.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: I missed the bidding but the contract is 2NT by South|pg||
mb|2D!|an|3rd suit forcing, inv+|nt|bebechira: they will bid 4s and will come down to find the trumps quuen|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  Fisher leads his nice heart sequence instead of his singleton, because he has good spades and is not looking for a ruff|pg||
mb|3D|an|nat, 4!d|nt|vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan Open teams National Trials from Lahore|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzbn: @cQ can be only vital card of the whole deal|pg||
nt|lady007:  now lets see how van den Bos should play. he is probably worried about spades 4-1, but the bidding makes it more likely its with north than with south|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyf: if you misguess can eliminate @c and @d and let them open the @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: queen even|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but won't work here|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: reverse flannery 2@S response would work on this hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lady007:  he pitches a diamond, because if diamonds are 32, he can always discard a club on the diamonds later|pg||
nt|lady007:  north might have made it more difficult for declarer here to duck his ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: hi marshall|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Mashall |pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi shirley:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in case both teams finish tied Netherlands Red wins the tournament as they were ranked higher in the Swiss|pg||
nt|bebechira: it will not happen twice Dennis|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  what if only one team finishes tied?:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we had it 3 or 4 years ago, tie-break in both semi-final and final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  do we know why the organizers use that tie-break method instead of extra boards?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if east ducks club queen can i see any hope for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: there was a reason, but can't remember it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobholl: n already place after the @D :)|pg||

nt|xenya:  an ambitious 3N -- 1@S showed both majors?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt to be sure the tournament finishes at a specific time|pg||

nt|bobholl: well done by joris (or just lucky ?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this final consists of 3 sessions of 14 boards|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|lady007:  declarer cant ruff his club anymore, but he can discard it on the diamonds. so 10 tricks it is|pg||

nt|bebechira: any imp important |pg||
nt|fabsayc: spectators see more than 2 down actually|pg||

nt|lady007:  2@d transfer, showing hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  EW can even make 6@h here on the very lucky layout of the cards, but most likely they will get to 4@h|pg||
mb|3H|an|5!h, GF|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lady007:  Fisher bid 4@s because of his 64 but he wont buy a very usefull dummy. this can get expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials FINAL segment 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: I DONT bid on west garbage|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the best reason for bidding on the W garbage is that doing so might assist you in your choice of lead against the final contract. feedback from E could be crucial|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well either 4@H or 5@D is better, but west has to find a club lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: that lead not bad for declarer |pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i find it a bit odd to lead a spade. why not attack the suit that can provide the most tricks when it is right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so van den Bos knows that they cannot cash 4 @ss now|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs suggesting 6 @D by S pretty good  |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|ady: e/w can make 12 tricks in hearts as they lay    but  this will be a poor result for Israel|pg||

nt|mdgraham: told 1@s=0-4 spades - ok, but in a yarborough?|pg||
nt|vugraphzye: 1 spades is 0-4 spades 3-11 points |pg||
nt|jaapfr: not 0-11:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzye: 2 h is spades and a minor|pg||

nt|grebrof: I guess they found the @dshift|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Lead increasing|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  NL lost an opportunity there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade lead required Qxxxx in east as well as a red card, so i tend to agree, Marshall|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi:  but then, so did Israel:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 7@S on  with 3 finesses |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  yes and low spade might well even  block suit when E does have Qxxxx|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!s + minor|nt|lady007:  a possible slam hand for NS coming up here|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 15 flat.. 4s bid and made at both tables|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  oh sorry, i thought W had led from KJ8x|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|qasim2003: nice bid given that they are trying to recover alot of imps this segment|pg||
nt|lady007:  they can make both 6@h and 6@s if they guess the spades (and possible the clubs, on a unlikely club lead if played by north)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to small slam   and make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @C wrong so 6|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  now i see it is the 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: i'd bid 4@h with the S hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a true yarborough in N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not even a 10 makes it a yarb)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  S would LIKE to bid 3D as a lead-director over 2H, byut that could work out poorly|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Fisher knows that he can save for a probable 500, but decides not to|pg||
mb|p|nt|qasim2003: but 3@h makes so a nice result for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess he 'll show a good "pudding"raise now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@c should show 4@s now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lady007:  hmmmm|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|grebrof: this reminds me of a friend -  has no dbl in my mind|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@s seems rather passive|pg||
nt|bobholl: joris inspired ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think he should pass now. 4@s shows a bad hand for slam (else 4@c)|pg||
nt|bebechira: tell him not to pass Dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: without @c lead it's one out of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 trupms and 12 points doubtfull|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with @c lead you need @dK onside (best chance)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: you don't finesse @c at trick 1 as you need at least another finesse, take @cA and finesse @d only 1 finesse needed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|grebrof: S has no|pg||
nt|ady: no   not even a try from North   maybe direct raise to 3 limited with their methods|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: pity but understandable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: although you need the 4th @d to be good as well...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobholl: he likes this :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  at different colors the risk of 3D might be less|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but at these colors it wouldnt take much for N to save at 5D with a fit. here for example:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  of course a save might be ok, but if he has a stiff heart you probably want to defend|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: though 12 tricks can be made    not a good contract|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|grebrof: 2@c will make some tricks thou - especially now - if @ds are played correctly|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  if S has stiff club not so good though|pg||

nt|bobholl: but the red kings position he didn't like :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Israel in 4 as well in the open room..so it will be flat|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: but he elected to show a good hand for NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  though a second sapde might find 22 spades in which case he could take the club finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well, S started it|pg||

nt|sybarra: I assume break after this set? |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lady007:  2@c is weak 2 in diamonds or strong|pg||
nt|lady007:  i have seen them open 2@c on a lot weaker hands than this one|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  3N mildly tricky here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT a fair contract e/w   but wrecked by the bad diamond split|pg||
nt|lady007:  3nt is a good contract but it is unlikely to make on this lay out (diamonds 41) and van Lankveld didnt believe in such a good hand from his partner and didnt try for game|pg||
nt|lady007:  will south get in with a double?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be in 7 on this hand |pg||
nt|bebechira: has to be...they had only 30 mins between set1 and set2|pg||
nt|sybarra: how pushy is N?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: south may balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  of course W likely to lead club K but if not then S still has a safety play|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: even 6 is on a finesse or j rd of @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: missing @H ace is likely to be cashed in 7 |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3rd|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi:  it doesnt matter since S will accept an invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  this probably puts W off the best lead of a spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club eight will be entry now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: e/w may well play this in 3 diamonds   and have to get diamond right to make that|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes though hearts always provide one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a spade lead, can set up fourth heart easily|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  he could, but would he?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  33 hearts much less likely than 32 clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you dont have time for clubs on spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  depends where the entries lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but point well taken|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: guess this is all relaying do you know the meanings dennis ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van den Bos relaying the hand here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 6 is always cold |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|ady: on that lead easy make|pg||
nt|lady007:  now declarer can even afford to misguess the diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: good @hJ trying to tell declarer  I m singleton @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Tahir taking time and planning the defence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: we need Al Holland,  maybe he would know |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|lady007:  he can draw 3 rounds of trumps and discard a club on the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: he it such an expert on systems|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is with the dropping @D J no @C finesse needed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mashall it that 3/2 comment that likely after club lead?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: no guess   bound to play from the top|pg||
nt|lady007:  north can ruff, but declarer can discard a losing club then|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all meant  6 @S is always cold imo |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|bobholl: what if @D J 4th than you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent you been in worse slams with that layout?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think most of us have|pg||
nt|bobholl: sure this is a 60% slam or so|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades for n/s|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|grebrof: say 1nt-2@c :3minor - then your P knows your @ds are not great and that your Hs are somewhere else|pg||

mb|3D|an|GF|nt|bebechira: welcome to Martin Johnson :)|pg||

mb|3N|nt|vugraphzbn: only @c J lead takes it off|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: but the player is capable of finding imaginative leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@s would have shown the hand yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ew have found their misfit, remains to find their fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: indeed never double with a void is a pretty good rule|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow i guess this goes 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am never good with 4/0 fits |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@d GF here, that's not surprising. But nowadays more pairs play this as INV 5-5 with a 2@c gadget|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: or forcing but always 55|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  why not just 2S from N ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me 2nt over 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results www.nbbportal.nl/1003|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  partner wont have 4 spades so 2S is safe and cheap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is forcing and often unbalanced but not 55|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  2S might also put them off a spade lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: sorry it is S playing,  skip that remark |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i want partner to know i have diamonds when i bid 3D, so he can make the bid that befits his hand without needing to worry if the 3D call was just an invention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree 2@S is ok if that is your understanding, either way the jump shift without rules is not effective|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i dont mind inventing suits, but not when the call that does so takes up a lot of space|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are in 4@H in open room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: not much to the play    needs to ruff a heart|pg||

nt|ady: could have ruffed a heart  rather than take a diamond finesse  on the assumption that west has A@C  could have then run the majors  and west would have been squeezed if holding K@D|pg||
