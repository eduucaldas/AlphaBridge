mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW play quite complicated system, so E opened with 1@c - better minor style, W jumped to 2nt|pg||
nt|luffe12:  2@h |pg||
nt|luffe12:  Asking for a stopper|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  showing minors and up to 8 points|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  if u reach 3nt the @h's is the lifeline - and the defence will find it diffcult to prevent W from the @c-suit|pg||

mb|p|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  so EW finished in 3@c|pg||

nt|ady: might try low club|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: just needs 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: heart ruff, club to king, heart ruff, @SK, spade to ace, claim|pg||
nt|athene: the @S9 does give you some theoretical chances of overcoming a 4-1 break but in practice you can't really, without seeing all the cards|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  carryover is gone|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  obvious style with 5 spades and good @h fit is to bid @s first and jump in @h next|pg||
nt|pelu:  Hi John has just joined another table|pg||
nt|athene: east might double 1@S, if playing equal level conversion - or even if not|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  may be, this pair has different methods|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: n/s are likely to get to game    but looks a struggle|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he goes quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  3@c was for 9-11 balanced with 4-cards fit|pg||
nt|luffe12:  the defence from S on  2 still wonders a bit - as he could count to 10 in with @c k|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|ady: might have a cjance on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, one loser is gone|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: even though (in theory) it looks as though the defence can get 6 tricks with two overruffs on spades|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c6|nt|luffe12:  based on the bidding the @H lead is not too far away|pg||
nt|athene: it just won't work because declarer throws a club |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: and if north had cashed his @CJ first, he would not have an entry for the second trump promotion lead|pg||
nt|athene: as so often, ONE ruff with a natural trump trick does not help - in fact costs a trick|pg||
nt|pelu:  not the best defense - N sh have taken @CJ first|pg||
nt|athene: you need to get two ruffs to be anywhere|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  so, 13 more imps for EW|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  we started with semifinals this morning - and it was our first BBO appearance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 9 tricks level    3 spades makes|pg||
nt|luffe12:  competitive however|pg||
nt|luffe12:  NS may go overboard however|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can only make 8 tricks with the 4-1 trump split|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ady: dont think n/s will play the hand|pg||
nt|luffe12:  3@h = max support for @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  even after S's intervention, EW should find their way to 6@h|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for those who is keen on Russian - welcome here http://bridge-belarus.org/|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bob Holl|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for running scores http://bridge-belarus.org/b1112/komandnik/fin/kom_fin_20111t2-1.htm|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Bob|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and for 3rd place match http://bridge-belarus.org/b1112/komandnik/fin/kom_fin_20111t2-1.htm|pg||
nt|bobholl: good thaT EAST found the hand too strong for 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: if they do they will be 2 tricks too high|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  17 pc and 5-card-suit - definitely to strong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and one more point - this pair uses weak NT when non-vul|pg||
nt|athene: tricky lead problem|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|luffe12:  wd|pg||
nt|luffe12:  top spot|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer quite likely to have a weak 2@S with four hearts for this auction?|pg||
nt|pelu:  2@S = weak 6+ @s|pg||
nt|athene: but there are other possibilities, such as a weak spade suit, depending on NS's weak-two proclivities|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  wow!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is S brave enough to try @cA?|pg||
nt|bobholl: what else ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  spade, for instance )))|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  but after this bidding, S should reject any hope for @s trick|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  great lead!!!|pg||

nt|luffe12:  or?|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|s5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pelu:  N could open 2@D (multi) but didnt like to do that with a 4 card @h|pg||
nt|athene: north a bit worried about east getting a trump promotion with @SQ86 here; that 8 is quite a big card|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: north can smell the misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: going overboard here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  next door, NS found their way to 6@h after S qualified his hand for 3@c bid - game forcing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: west, having already shown a decent hand, doesn't feel obliged to double this, just because he has quite a few points|pg||
nt|pelu:  It spec for them - the normal use in DEN is that it show 5-5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  2@d is 4th-suit forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S shows stronger hand with 6@h|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  seems reasonable, yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even 3NT looks not so bad|pg||

nt|bobholl: as west i would lead a @S :(|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  with @s start, it's makeable|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, only 1 down, it seems, and no double|pg||
nt|ady: west will know east has club length   so the defence should be easy|pg||
nt|luffe12:  avoided -500 on best defence|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|athene: only three obvious losers (@C@C@D) but you run out of trumps|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|sfoxa:  several imps for NS|pg||

nt|luffe12:  D = high /low unbid suits or just gameforce|pg||

nt|ady: will east be confident of 5 card spade suit?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|pelu:  I would have bid 4@H = a strong raise to 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: well 4@S shows a decent hand :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  they have special meaning for 2@h (4-4 minors and stopper in H with 11-12 pc)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, this auction, same well-stopped contract|pg||
nt|ady: very distributional hand    both diamond and spade slam at risk to bad brakes|pg||

nt|pelu:  2 way St|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ady: both waiting for a diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think no pair should be allowed to use fractional point-count in their system description|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: it makes life too hard for commentators who are qwertyily-challenged|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|luffe12:  2@s = 5-card, 6-9|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  6@c need to play @Cs no loser and no double fines in @S|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: restricted choice in clubs, maybe...|pg||
nt|pelu:  but is S solve the @c-problem, then he has no entry for 2x finess in SA- and he is forced to solve the @s-problem|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks  unless playing a diamond now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu:  if he play @H to A and @C10 ducked - then he can still go wrong in @S - he can now play @sQ|pg||
nt|athene: south may be considering playing for the drop in trumps, on the grounds that if that works, it gives him more options elsewhere|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|ady: wamted to keep good control in case 1 defender started with 5 trumps|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: (@HA, heart ruff, three rounds of diamonds, spade finesse; now if west has @HK he is endplayed)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe that is not enough of a reason for rejecting the restricted choice line in clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d5|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pelu:  and now he dont have entry to 2x finess in @s - so he is forced to make - only if he had played @c10|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: lucky that @C K comes in :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  but as I see - a very lucky slam :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: bad guesser (as usual)|pg||

mb|3D|nt|ady: 2@H?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Michaels cuebid revised = @s + longer minor|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make game in both majors   will they play spades now?|pg||
nt|athene: south might bid 4@C now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: with three small hearts facing partner's presumed singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  In principle 5 losers in a heart contract, bur NS cannot untangle their spades and get a ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: re-double looks as though says show the minor|pg||
nt|luffe12:  the pass from E is forcing, i assume|pg||

mb|p|pc|d9|nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So it looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oleberg:  A club switch is needed, but they will get two chances|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: without the 2@H intervention showing spades   would presume east west would have played in spades|pg||
