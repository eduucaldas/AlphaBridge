nt|agumperz:  the spade ten looked like top of a doubleton|pg||

nt|agumperz:  and he feared that friedland would duck the first spade to retain communications|pg||

mb|5N|nt|agumperz:  it would have been a nice play if the spades had been Tx opposite AKxxx|pg||

nt|agumperz:  bessis probably not all that happy right now looking at 3 defensive tricks, but 4@S was gin|pg||
pc|h2|nt|agumperz:  dahl a little nervous holding 6-5 shape and only 7 points|pg||
nt|agumperz:  wondering if 5@H might make|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: needs a crystalball at that point|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sbeatty:  The play should be fast to 11 tricks now...|pg||

nt|agumperz:  surprise. At the other table, Cheek failed to overcall 1@S and so their side didnt get into the auction|pg||
mb|1D|nt|agumperz:  NS were allowed to play 4@H and allowed to make it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|agumperz:  so 15 IMPs to Falk|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|swanson:  Any might be too many.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ritong: south has an interesting hand  remember her pard is supposed to be short in @hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|swanson:  3NT should be simple for North here.  2 spades, 3 hearts, two clubs and 2 diamonds.|pg||
nt|mouser:  This could be a swing|pg||
nt|agumperz:  looks like a two-way checkback auction in progress|pg||
nt|agumperz:  north has created a game force with his artificial 2@D call|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mouser:  But you are right, would have to mess this up|pg||
nt|swanson:  An unlikely diamond lead would have made the play interesting, but I think declarer still survives.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and then shown his long spades by rebidding them|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|swanson:  Putting up the @S10 looks normal.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|agumperz:  off an ace and queen of trump presumably they stop short in 5@S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|swanson:  Now ace and another heart.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Declarer might go for an endplay rather than taking the club finesse immediately.  That should work also.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|agumperz:  ish doesn't even ask about trump queen|pg||
nt|agumperz:  but now bessis bids 6@S?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: and likely has only 4@ss, since no double over 2@h|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|agumperz:  that is a strange auction|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|agumperz:  not now|pg||
nt|agumperz:  if ish guesses to hook east for the trump queen|pg||
nt|agumperz:  then he can draw three trumps|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and play 4 rounds of hearts pitching the diamond|pg||
nt|agumperz:  as east ruffs with his hi trump|pg||
nt|agumperz:  but now there is no chance. if ish wins the spade king and tries hearts east has a low spade to ruff with|pg||
nt|agumperz:  if ish ducks the spade|pg||
nt|agumperz:  then peter has to switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|agumperz:  dahl could and should have helped him out|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|swanson:  East continues spades with no entries because, from the high card count he knows a shift is futile.|pg||

I think he should have cashed the @CA befor lead to the @DK.  Guards against East having balnked the @CK.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Bad typing, but you can figure it out.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the other match is close -- 14 IMPs with 3 boards remaining|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: they play 1 @s, 5+|pg||
nt|ritong: all in all, +130 is fine|pg||
mb|2D|an|flanery|nt|agumperz:  Diamond leading|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  dahl is making another attempt to swing|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|agumperz:  5@D looks like the spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|swanson:  Should a double of the artificial heart response be takout or show hearts.  I vote takeout of spades.  And bid 1@S over hearts as showing better spades than your RHO.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  since a 5-3 heart break could doom 3NT|pg||
nt|agumperz:  friedland is not in on the joke|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  but white on red they do OK in 3@HX|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mouser:  I like take out way also, but I think most play this, with 1 spade being takeout|pg||
nt|swanson:  3@S seems an overbid to me.  But North would have bid over 2@S also.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  wow|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|agumperz:  4@H was in trouble, but vul against not, ish took the 600 in hand rather than trying for 800 in the bush|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|swanson:  E-W have to defend well to set 4@H here. Get the spades going before declarer can play a diamond towards the king.  |pg||
