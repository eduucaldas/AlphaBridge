mb|5C|nt|pelu:  Hi all: CC's here: http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=5654|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW play quite complicated system, so E opened with 1@c - better minor style, W jumped to 2nt|pg||
nt|luffe12:  2@h |pg||
nt|luffe12:  Asking for a stopper|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@D is multi, a "weak  weak 2 in a major"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  showing minors and up to 8 points|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|oleberg:  A "good weak 2" open two in the suit.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|luffe12:  if u reach 3nt the @h's is the lifeline - and the defence will find it diffcult to prevent W from the @c-suit|pg||
nt|pelu:  EW: relay-precision, NS: 5 card major|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  so EW finished in 3@c|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  and here EW got an opportunity to play the same suit 1 level lower, but doubled|pg||
nt|oleberg:  -1 is the "Par score" as 4@H is making (if you guess the clubs)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But if West leads a low spade, or east leads an honour against 4@H, it is cold.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see the outcome|pg||

nt|othered1: GIB will take 9 tricks here (by seeing all cards).  May be tougher for a human declarer|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  and defence has to manage red suits carefully to execute full penalty|pg||

pc|c8|nt|athene: this lead makes things a lot nicer|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|oleberg:  Quite entutiastic bidding by north, but he migth roll it home|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Leif W Thomsen|pg||
nt|oleberg:  welcome|pg||
nt|luffe12:  hi Ole|pg||
nt|oleberg:  An unenviable position for West. The club switch is understandable, but now declarer "only" needs to guess hearts. Which is vitually a toss-up|pg||
nt|oleberg:  the risk of playing diamonds is, that if declarer gets it right, the club-loser will disappear.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  a kibitzer points out (rigthly I think) that declarer will always have to run the @D10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  as he need to bring in @d it seems a bit akward|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: now the simplest line looks like ruffing two hearts in dummy|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  the matter or course seems obvious as for now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: just needs 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: heart ruff, club to king, heart ruff, @SK, spade to ace, claim|pg||
nt|athene: the @S9 does give you some theoretical chances of overcoming a 4-1 break but in practice you can't really, without seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|pelu:  wellcome to John Norris "pumpumpum"|pg||
nt|pelu:  hi John|pg||
nt|gsper:  @S tll knekten och sedan ducka @S Ã¤r ocksÃ¥ en mÃ¶jlighet|pg||

nt|luffe12:  but Martin has a good table presence|pg||

nt|luffe12:  hi Marshall|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Martin likes it - so far|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The play of the @S10 indicates he will go right in hearts, or else it would have been postponed.|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I meant the play of the @D10|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but this time u will end up in declarers hand, so...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see the continuation|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Likely will pick up an imp or two for EW (or more, perhaps, if played by east at other table)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then 5D?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  obvious style with 5 spades and good @h fit is to bid @s first and jump in @h next|pg||
nt|pelu:  Hi John has just joined another table|pg||
nt|athene: east might double 1@S, if playing equal level conversion - or even if not|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  may be, this pair has different methods|pg||
nt|othered1: North's preempt is sound by today's standards.|pg||

nt|athene: ok, he goes quietly|pg||
nt|gsper:  Bara mycket disciplinerade spelare passar hÃ¤r|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  3@c was for 9-11 balanced with 4-cards fit|pg||
nt|luffe12:  the defence from S on  2 still wonders a bit - as he could count to 10 in with @c k|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: might have a cjance on a club lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you double with east's cards, opposite a passed hand?|pg||

nt|gsper:  N kunde kanske ha dubblat fÃ¶r att visa styrka|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oleberg:  6@D/@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe they play 4D as forcing as otherwise either pass or 3N. not unreasonable at IMPs i guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, one loser is gone|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  and it may be enough to win the contract|pg||

nt|luffe12:  2@d = checkback Stayman - gameforcing|pg||
nt|ady: club lead should make   set up long spade|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Bothersome board for NS. They have not acted unreasonable, but there is simply no way to win on the board, only to hope for a tie.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|athene: even though (in theory) it looks as though the defence can get 6 tricks with two overruffs on spades|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|prinsib:  UF!|pg||
nt|gsper:  Jag uppfattade inte riktigt varfÃ¶r|pg||
pc|h6|nt|luffe12:  based on the bidding the @H lead is not too far away|pg||
nt|athene: it just won't work because declarer throws a club |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|athene: and if north had cashed his @CJ first, he would not have an entry for the second trump promotion lead|pg||
nt|athene: as so often, ONE ruff with a natural trump trick does not help - in fact costs a trick|pg||
nt|pelu:  not the best defense - N sh have taken @CJ first|pg||
nt|athene: you need to get two ruffs to be anywhere|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  so, 13 more imps for EW|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: NS a very experienced partnership but even they can't diagnose these low-level defence situations|pg||
nt|athene: just too tough|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu:  or played @SA!|pg||

nt|luffe12:  @s + minor |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 2@H?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  Michaels cuebid revised = @s + longer minor|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make game in both majors   will they play spades now?|pg||
nt|athene: south might bid 4@C now|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Dbl = gameforce, no 5-cardsuit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: with three small hearts facing partner's presumed singleton|pg||
nt|gsper:  Many would open 3@H nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  In principle 5 losers in a heart contract, bur NS cannot untangle their spades and get a ruff|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: re-double looks as though says show the minor|pg||
nt|luffe12:  the pass from E is forcing, i assume|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|luffe12:  :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So it looks like 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  A club switch is needed, but they will get two chances|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: without the 2@H intervention showing spades   would presume east west would have played in spades|pg||
nt|luffe12:  at least not a pretty result for EW, as 3@c is close|pg||
nt|athene: not sure where 4@H came from - west couldn't have a worse hand, could he?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to lead @hK|pg||

nt|nilsland:  I guess W will try 3 N rather than passing, having the clubs in surprise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  I was wrong - and so was West|pg||
pc|h8|nt|nilsland:  In 4 @S you can duck a diamond, in 3 S you can simply ruff a heart after taking AK of clubs, play for 9 tricks|pg||

pc|h8|nt|athene: 1nt is showing clubs?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If I recall correctly, 1Nt is artificial, showing clubs|pg||
nt|athene: EW are strong club and weak NT, so 1@D is always unbalanced?|pg||
nt|oleberg:  With longest diamonds or even length|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3NT will just make it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: so transfer rebids|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: should do well   around 9 tricks|pg||
nt|luffe12:  at this point very quite, but some interesting hand though|pg||
nt|othered1: your lead here?  Trying to find partner's long suit is possible, but partner doesn't have lots of entries.|pg||

nt|oleberg:  6@S is even better, if you can somehow rightside it, making south declarer|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|ady: last hand  of the session    thx all|pg||
nt|oleberg:  is it possible?|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@H nu fra N|pg||
mb|p!|nt|oleberg:  1NT = 8-11 ball or some heart hands|pg||
nt|pelu:  the -500 in board 10 against "5@c making 600" cost 7 IMP - in OR 3@hs x down 1|pg||
nt|luffe12:  will be hard to find 27 on the last ones|pg||
nt|gsper:  GÃ¥r 4@S hem med @D ut och @H i vÃ¤nda?|pg||
nt|friggi: det er langt bedre at være spilförer 4@S i Öst end Vest|pg||
mb|4S|nt|luffe12:  thx David & operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: for useful . . .|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|pelu:  hi all - next segment 16.30 local time|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, the missed 4@H on board 11 was bid and made in open room, and the imps just trickled in|pg||
nt|gsper:  Vid andra bordet fortsatte N med @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  2@s bid is exactly what W has - he didn't use drury with passed hand, so - no fit|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ady: 5 down in 4 spades seems a lot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  still 4 boards to be played in OR|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|luffe12:  game over - thx Ole & C U tomorrow|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|luffe12:  2nd session in half an hour = 2pm|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gsper:  Och inte ens en misstÃ¤nksam dubbling|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  NS team has carryover from round robin|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@S is forcing here, because 1@H-2@S is a wjs, thus making 1@H-1@S, 2X-2@S invitational|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|oleberg:  Freeing this sequence to be forcing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Thank you all for watching|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu:  coffee time :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|luffe12:  10 obvious tricks, but 10 imps for Schaltz, taking a small advantage so far|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
mc|9|nt|friggi: mange takk till alle, farvel|pg||
