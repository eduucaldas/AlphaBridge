nt|petergill: but if 4@s propels Ew into a making 5@D, then you're worse off, it's all a bit of a guess|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems strange that Europe is using 2@D as natural weak 2-bid rather than multi|pg||

pc|dA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: this 3@D is safer because the -1100 was when the preempt was in 1st seat, but here the preempter's partner cannot be strong, being a passed hand |pg||
nt|cc469: if declarer could have guessed that W opened a 5 card suit, the duck at trick 1 would have helped greatly giving her a chance to play on @Hs|pg||

mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|petergill: I think Europe is not using Multi because the responses to and continuations after  Multi 2D vary from one European to another e.g. Jan Jansma (not in thsi team) plays 2@D P 2@s as ...|pg||
nt|petergill: natural, most play 2S as pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|petergill: The systemic aim in an Individual is to be in one's comfort zone|pg||

pc|s3|nt|petergill: Bd a Match scoring, so 650 or 680 is vital|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 easy winners|pg||
nt|petergill: 12th trick not so clear, perhaps via a squeeze on South, if East picks it?|pg||
nt|petergill: 6 trump tricks (after drawing trumps) plus 1@h and 3@C and 1@D = 11 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the entries for any squeeze are impossible, but am not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: Looks like 650 to me, but I might be wrong |pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I'm told European Point-a-Board  needs 20 point difference [same as imp scale]|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@D now = GF @D raise with slam interest|pg||
nt|petergill: with such poor @D's , S needs to bid 3NT with N obviously passing that|pg||
nt|petergill: N felt he had to cue 3@S, as 3NT could well be wrong opposite hands like xx, AKxxx, KQxxx, x|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Jenny Wolpert had to follow Hamman's Rule - although originally Swedish, Jenny now is American|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Hamman's Rule - if 3NT is a possiible contract, bid it, do not bypass it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there have been a few times this year when there were 2 Wolpert's on vugraph at same time   |pg||
nt|petergill: I think Jenny intended 4@H as an offer to play, possibly not interpreted that way by Joe Grue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jenny is wife   we also see  mother and brother of better known [especially to bridgewinners.com followers] Gavin|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cc469: ...since nothing in her bidding suggested such a good @H suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: On OPk defence (i.e. not club - club), 4@H cannot quite make 12 tricks - the @CA cannot be cashed in time to set up a @D/@S squeeze on West - so 4@H would have been 450|pg||
nt|petergill: South should bid 3NTt over 3@S because that bare club king os great for 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D looks like -1, but I'm not sure|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: which of course is what Joe Grue does in the play - the best play is his forte|pg||

nt|petergill: Can East signal to West that he has @S10, so that a @S continuation is safe when @CA is won? |pg||
nt|petergill: @D9 then @D5 might have got that message across, giving count both times with the highest pip available|pg||
nt|petergill: but @D9 then @D3 - not so clear for West|pg||
nt|petergill: who might exit in @D, in case S has @S10x left|pg||
nt|petergill: i think the regualr Dutch partnership Ricco can Prooijen and Louk Verhees give suit preference like that, in situations where partner will need it.  |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
