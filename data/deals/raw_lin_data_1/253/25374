mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  that is the main gain of precision, the light openings|pg||
mb|1D|nt|djneill:  West will try 1@d, 2+@d 10-15|pg||
nt|djneill:  now East has to catch up|pg||
mb|2S|nt|djneill:  how to show both minors?|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@c is one option|pg||
nt|djneill:  9-10 HCP 5+@c|pg||
nt|djneill:  double would get  3 suits in, but lie about the 4th @h|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@d not possible since 1@d was short|pg||
nt|djneill:  meanwhile, South is readying the 4@s card|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|djneill:  makes 5@d but takes a @c guess, but should be guessable since North has 6@s-3@d (so fewer possible clubs)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|djneill:  so 3@d was competitive, thus West is not imagining game yet|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@s seems a bit low given partner's vulnerable 2@s jump|pg||
nt|djneill:  perhaps South was hoping to give E-W an option to not bid game|pg||
nt|djneill:  but 3@s allowed West a competitive 4@d which gave East clues|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  the vulnerability is bad for a 5@s sac|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|djneill:  North tries for a reasonable fast ruff, playing partner for signficant strength (E-W is limited to 25 HCP so South is marked for 15-7 = 8-10 HCP)|pg||

nt|djneill:  now North is in a bind, but 4@h seems a random game try|pg||

nt|djneill:  North has a lot of losers opposite no fit, maybe North can try a nonforcing bid, but likely 3@h is forcing |pg||

nt|djneill:  so here, 3@d was quite the winning call by East|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  there we go, @s finess off but @d break|pg||
nt|djneill:  on a @c lead, must try @d first (@s finesse may go down but @d may be 3-3)|pg||
nt|djneill:  on a non-@c lead, can finesse @s first, then play for either @s or @d to break|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|djneill:  aggressive lead, particularly since West did not double 2@c or 3@c, but generally against a suit slam you lead aggressively|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|djneill:  reason to lead aggressively is that one finesse is unlikely to make the difference, it is more likely them setting up a side suit and then running it|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|djneill:  one problem with 1@c is that, they play that 1@c-1@d-1@h is artificial, so it is hard to show 5@h with 1@c opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|djneill:  looks like they play weak NT at these colors, so 1@h...NT = 15-17|pg||
nt|djneill:  so 2NT was 15-17|pg||
