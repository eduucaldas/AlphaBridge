mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|petergill: No|pg||
nt|petergill: minus 100 is much better than minus 200 when EW can make 2@S, possibly even 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: At Bd a Match scoring, wild spec doubles by E or W (N and S both being passed hands) are worth making if EW are confident that 2@s will make|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table in our match, Jill Levin is in 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Jill opened 1@H, 1NT by Curtis Cheek, 2@D by Jill, 2@H by Curtis|pg||
mc|7|nt|petergill: At another table N opened 3@C and S bid 3Nt, confirming the theory that anyone who generally says they "know" what the other table will do is almost always wrong|pg||

nt|cc469: not the distribution declarer needed here|pg||
nt|petergill: 6-1 @d break will be a  big disappointment|pg||
mc|10|nt|petergill: No choice after the spade lead, simply has to hope for person with long hearts to also have 4+ @d's|pg||
nt|cc469: needed luck even with 4-3 @Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, so slam was poor on a spade lead. I'm not sure if it was a good or bad slam overall|pg||
nt|cc469: great slam on a @C lead only I think|pg||
nt|petergill: All 6 boards played here, next match has to wait for the other players to finish - they cannot be as fast as Sontag and Grue|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I agree, really the club lead was needed. On a red suit lead, if you try @CK early, they can always win @CA and lead back a club to remove dummy's entry|pg||
nt|petergill: Grue's overtrick 650 to Paul Hacket's 620 has put USA in the lead, with the last board about to be bid at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: If 6@H is bid and fails by 3 tricks, then Europe tie up the match.  |pg||
nt|petergill: The 2012 Buffett Cup is sponsored by Borsheims, SCA Promotions, Wells Fargo Advisory and Omaha Steaks in Nebraska. |pg||
nt|petergill: USA has stopped in 4@h so they will win the match|pg||
