mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  so you would expect them to do well|pg||

nt|pbundy: as we all know - moss is a BIG player!  (at the table; he is rather short in stature, actually)|pg||
nt|pbundy: will he get the diamonds right?|pg||
nt|jstokes: South overcalled 1NT in the "other room" which makes getting to game a lot easier on this one|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||

nt|pbundy: one of the top players in the world who is NOT playing here gave me a definite "maybe" that moss should get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|jstokes: better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pbundy: west didn't make a negative double - so should be 4-5 in majors|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Europe won board 2- as was very possible the USA stopped in 1NT, so Hanlon needed not have risked bidding game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  There had been some debate earlier about whether a 10 point swing would be enough for a win on a board|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we seem to have the answer from the score on board 3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the USA bid 6NT on 3, which was the safer contract in any event and scores 10 points more|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we think there are connection difficulties|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no not think the next play is so difficult as to take this long|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am reliably informed that in pre computer days Hanlon South was known to enter +625 for a well played 4@h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if there are connection problems, the table will probably close and then reopen|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: wasn't worried :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: all in the same room; screens the first day but they were taken down|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|pbundy: part of the purpose of the buffett cup is to foster camaraderie between players from around the world|pg||
nt|jstokes: Oh, I didn't realize the screens were there.  Were they slowing down play too much?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pbundy: it is working quite well; players having a wonderful time - along with being super competitive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbundy: for those who are inquiring, during the individual, players have a different partner each round from their team|pg||
nt|pbundy: 11 rounds so everyone can play with each of their teammates|pg||
nt|jstokes: and Europe and the USA each have a single convention card that all their players use, right?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pbundy: i think that the screens were taken down both because of slowness - and - because they'd never been used previously and felt were not in the "spirit" of this competition|pg||

nt|jstokes: I'm still a little confused about the scoring in this individual -- each player is matched with a player from the other side.  So I guess all four players here a scoring against ...|pg||
