nt|arvidsson: I imagine 3@H is playable for 140 but very hard to reach|pg||
nt|vugraphzeh: about the convention over 3@s X:   Pass shows half or 1 stopper, pass 2+ small, bid natural with singleton spade, 3Nt is 2 stoppers|pg||

nt|vugraphzeh: worked fine here|pg||
nt|arvidsson: it is a very creative lead, but with S showing 5-5 I would be worried for singelton @H in declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  S asleep during the auction?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or playing for stiff A@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeh: prob hoping singleton ace behind|pg||
