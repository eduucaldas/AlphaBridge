nt|athene: unblocked the 8 just in case he decides he wants to finesse the 7 later, for example if north had @DA10|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|athene: now i imagine he will lay down the @SA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: needing only three more tricks from spades, and wanting to keep Hamman off lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: i am assuming dummy really has @DQ7x left at this point, or something like that|pg||

nt|athene: but of course there were other decisions there; for example, suppose the other room is in 4@S in the 5-3 fit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: letting opps play 2major in a 9-card fit is rarely a good idea, especially at love-all, especially at this form of scoring|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: it's suggested that west might double 1@H; i suppose he thought that two flaws (only three spades, and only 11 HCP) are one too many|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: In Bulgarian 2/1 style, 2@S does not promise extra strength|pg||

nt|petergill: If declarer plays on @s, Jill Levin will probably duck two rounds |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

nt|petergill: Flannery is popular with some top Americans such as Steve Weinstein and Bob Hamman, but nobody in Europe plays Flannery|pg||

pc|hA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|h4|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: on the grounds that 3@S hardly ever gets doubled, we are not vul so the cost will be small, |pg||

nt|petergill: If West went for a forcing defence, leading H's at Trick 1, I'm not sure if EW can then beat 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: At Board a Match scoring, West has to double whenever she thinks 3@H will make, so that 100 becomes 300 - she was unlucky to find @SK in dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: Jill Levin might alternatively have tried 4@H, risking -200, over 3@S - seems anti-percentage to me - 4@H is close, might well scrape home|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps a direct 4@H over 3@D is best - that prevents all West's subsequent bidding problems|pg||

nt|petergill: Replace the word "perhaps" by "almost certainly"|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: the 2NT bid was vul, so a direct 4@H gains whenever (1) 4@h makes and (2) 3@s makes and 4@H is one off, almost certainly undoubled if bid directly over 3@D|pg||
nt|petergill: Possibly even 4@C pass or correct over 2NT was even better|pg||

nt|petergill: Just 10 boards in each match, I think, so the match is over. |pg||
nt|petergill: and Europe win this match to increase their narrow overall lead a bit|pg||
nt|petergill: West's series of bidding decisions on this hand had a vital role in the outcome of the match|pg||

nt|petergill: The new Amercian partnerships in this Buffett Cup are (mostly) new real partnerships e.g. Moss - Grue will play the San Francisco Nationals together, with Fred G taking a break - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: or so I am told|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't know much about the Indian website except that the guy is a bridge enthusiast who likes to gather on one page as much info as he can find on the internet about particular ...|pg||
nt|petergill: events - his Buffett Cup site is useful in my opinion|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the next Buffett Cup session is in about 30 minutes, but I'm not sure, just guessing|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the Indian website has the Teams results back to front - actually it is Europe not USA who won most of the Teams games - I think|pg||
