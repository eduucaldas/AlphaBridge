nt|chip: looks like a typical match point part score battle. NS have 5 top tricks, and should manage a ruff for down 2.|pg||
nt|chip: S has given suit preference in D and trumps, though his diamond play is hard to read.|pg||
nt|chip: N doesn't have to lead a club now, but must when she wins the next trump.|pg||
nt|chip: note that if declarer had the club ace and partner the KJ of diamonds, then wrong to play clubs.|pg||
