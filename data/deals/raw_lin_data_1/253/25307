mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|athene: i guess west expects his partner to have spades, and only four, so it really doesn't look right to compete at the 3-level|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: he could have bid 2@S over the double, if that was pass-or-correct for the major|pg||
nt|athene: or redouble if that was asking for major|pg||

nt|athene: it might look odd to finesse clubs there but declarer is worried about the third diamond, apart from anything else|pg||
nt|athene: since the defence will probably be able to stop a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: hmm, maybe he should have gone straight for the ruff|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, club ruff, diamond up|pg||

nt|athene: this is very tricky|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy of course you can just draw trumps then lead the @CK, to get to dummy |pg||
nt|athene: if west ducks you duck the next one to his bare ace|pg||
nt|athene: but that is only if you know he has @CAx|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: drawing trumps then leading the @CK, you would expect to be only 50%, i.e. basically needing east to have the @CA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|athene: because if the king holds you are going to just lead one to the queen next|pg||
nt|athene: of course at BAM it does get interesting|pg||
nt|athene: because if east does have the ace he can see that ducking twice might well concede the overtrick|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: but even so i don't think that is a strong enough indication to duck the second round and play west for @CAx|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|nt|athene: some game theory issues there|pg||
nt|athene: if it's right for you to play queen, it's right for him to rise, but if it's right for him to rise, it's right for you to duck :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: 6nt would be better|pg||
nt|athene: because you can happily cash diamonds using @HA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north is slightly rattled, after leading the wrong suit against that slightly silly 3nt|pg||
