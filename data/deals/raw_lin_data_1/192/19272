nt|gmarco24: they raised the bidding to 3rd level with just 9 hcp|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eugenio123: I don't agree 1NT by north, it seems to be a natural bid which doesn't have any sense|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to this broadcast from Albena-Bulgaria:)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hi Marion, welcome, glad to have you here|pg||
nt|frankbo: over 5H,then sp Q is the killing lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: shouth migth've overcall 1@s with jest KQxxx and they would be in a bind|pg||
nt|lady007: 2! was 5@h and 4+ minor, weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: Hi everyone |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  on this lead, 3NT is easy|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -ew has 5 @h/east !!  and 5 @d will come -for down 1 -but perhaps 5 @h makes in practise by west also|pg||
nt|frankbo: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eugenio123: no problem to respect 2 @h maybe one overtrick|pg||
nt|frankbo: probl will make|pg||

nt|ntmon: quiet 3NT for starter|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bmkl: Goodmorning everyone, wlcm to the 3rd round of Juniors Championships|pg||
nt|ybob: hard lead to S , only @H lead was Ok|pg||

nt|lady007: in the other room east foresaw that problem and raised the 1@s response over his 1@c opening to 2@s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||

nt|eleni: nicely done|pg||
nt|runnerup: in pther table west was more aggressive -6 @h |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kemperg: nice hand to start|pg||

nt|dkkello: another 4 @S |pg||
mb|r!|nt|eleni: @h@h Welcome everyone@h@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  bad start for Germany... 4@S in the other room was a bad contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS can make 4@S but may not find that suit|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room E-W tried 3NT|pg||
nt|liraren: anyone know anything about EW system please tell me|pg||
nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||
nt|lady007: N will open 1@s, and will east overcall then? and if he doesnt, will south respond 1N?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: lloks like a partscore battle with Clubs for once winning out|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3sp the highest contr here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Vladimir and Doga|pg||
nt|ntmon: par here is 4@CX |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: only partials here -even thought -4 @s doens seem so bad |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 4@h seems a great contract for B-S|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the bad break|pg||
nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably he will leadwith Q@h|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it is really lucky 4@h. i'd love to see it playing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with hearts 3-3 is ok for 10 it seems|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ntmon: hi to everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: Hello Basilis:):)|pg||
nt|lady007: NS also have some chances in 5@d played by north. but it wont make today|pg||
nt|dkkello: He will make i comfort witout a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|ybob: not necessary after this lead ...|pg||
nt|frankbo: now 4 might makes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eugenio123: bye the way the result will be -1 , it's impossible to find the 7th trick|pg||
nt|eleni: Thx operator of this transmission:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D start will kill 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: doubled  :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ntmon: as we don't exactly know what 3@S promises, it's not easy to tell who 'upgraded' - sure is 4@S has no play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree but still good save|pg||
nt|vasmar: hello|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 5 i think bill|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree with 1NT in 3:rd seat with 14 and a nice hand , harder for opps to deal with|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|possessed: open room East open this|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam w 2 po³owie meczu Polska - Niemcy dziewcz¹t|pg||
nt|vasmar: yes no way to reach dummy|pg||
nt|chrisky: 2@H S and a @C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: more ambitious 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: U wlc|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|helena sp:  5@d|pg||
nt|vasmar: so phantom sacrifice|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N is quite a bid. can be a disaster if partner doesnt bring anything|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lady007: i think i would have passed with north but i wouldnt be happy about it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Alon Amsel|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  hi all|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wynik jaki Pañstwo widz¹ na tablicy jest pochodn¹ zarówno dobrej gry naszych juniorek jak i nienajlepszej ich przeciwniczek|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Gerben42:  if you play any-strength 2-suiters, W should bid 3@H|pg||
pc|c7|nt|possessed: 3sp probably means invitation with 4 card|pg||
nt|possessed: and balanced|pg||
nt|lady007: but even the king of club return wont give declarer an overtrick as he cant untangle his tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: especially as 4@h going down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI folks, sorry about the delay|pg||
nt|liraren: NS plays 5542 with transfer after the 1@c opening .|pg||
nt|liraren: hi and welcome|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ntmon: good guess by declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lady007: maybe he could have tried to play another spade, in case partner has T9 of hearts|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, here comes one finesse|pg||
nt|lady007: oh no, wont help, he bid 3N so declarer will never play him for the stiff king|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|gmarco24: after A@d situation is pretty clear for declarer|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table east opened the bidding and then EW missed 4@h|pg||
pc|hK|nt|juan lukas: push board |pg||
pc|hA|nt|lady007: not that it is a contract you want to be in when you only see 26 cards..... but it makes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Subhash|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ntmon: unfortunately, a loss for Czech republic|pg||
nt|eleni: good safe|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|offthebend: this is the transfer bidding -- 1H to show Spades and 2S to show minimum variety with 4 trumps |pg||
nt|andyv:  assume 1@c is either polish or less than 3, and 1@h is @s|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  anyway, a skinny game is reached that should make|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|offthebend: doesn't need much except may be 4 cards in right places |pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec tells me that 1@C = balanced or natural; no artificial strong variants except for the strong NT. Since they play 14-16 vul, 1@C=11-13, 17-19 NT or clubs.|pg||
nt|offthebend: S could have played low to give his side a better chance to defeat this game |pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe he should have if he has to think this long about his 2nd move|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i am here on night leave|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3D - an exploring bid -- just in case S has bid 2S on a 4-card suit and values . 3NT may be better |pg||
nt|lady007: 1N did seem to go down, but i cant blame him for bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which suggests north has to x with that hand perhaps|pg||

nt|eleni: a helpful lead:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good lead|pg||
nt|frankbo: well all keycards nicely placed so|pg||
nt|runnerup: true -only club ruff treats and @s is 4-1 but should make|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tejjyid: I assume West's 4@S is fast arrival, showing his distaste for thesoft @C cards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|offthebend: Pass by S should show some interest in bidding ON -- with no interest he should have bid 3S immediately |pg||
nt|offthebend: and they have arrived in the right game contract |pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe 2@h could be brought home by EW|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, maybe. The Dutch EW are going to try that now :)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|Gerben42:  nice to have @H7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eugenio123: I guess they play 2@c as drury|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mamos: defence can lead trumps to defeat  easily in a  moment|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: They found the correct contract |pg||
nt|runnerup: first trap won|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: That lead simplifies matters, but North had no reason to lead a @C - given that Suth didn;t open|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi all!!:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eleni: well Chris:) we said helpful:) not Christmas yet for Santa to be here:)|pg||
nt|chrisky: last chance|pg||
nt|offthebend: with 9-10 points and a 4-card S suit , one has to bid more than 1Spade over a T/O double of 1D :)|pg||
nt|liraren: with the first pass u can bid 2 @d with that kind of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: site for results http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i agree with subhash, you don't bid 2@d with only 4@s and say 2@h; if LHO bids 3@D you have to guess, may miss a cold 4@s or bid a ridiculous final contract|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|eleni: now Q@s will give Stankovic  his discards|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course a @d ruff now, then a @cruff in hand and he is home|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS could not make much in spite of combined 23PC |pg||

nt|bmkl: open tbl is in 3@h|pg||
nt|bmkl: no he will ruff high a @c, draw @hs and claim|pg||
nt|bmkl: all he needs is a 3-2 split in trumps|pg||
nt|possessed: + 100 seems a decent score from this hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vasmar: declarer will make 1 more trick for 1 off|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: but cashing the heart risks losing control|pg||

nt|lady007: this contract might have made if he played a spade back to his hand instead of a diamond|pg||
mc|10|nt|lady007: east can force him once with a heart ruff then, but then he still has the king of diamonds|pg||
pg||

nt|andyv:  actually, he needed last trump to get back to dummy to repeat the @h finesse|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|offthebend: no he didn't - he was in the dummy with DA - draw the trumps and take the H finesse |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N terribly unhappy if S doesn't pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: well he will be happier if S doubles |pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|offthebend: I am not really in favour of opening 1NT with such good clubs -- many hands with working 7-8 points 3NT will make but partner may not respond |pg||

mb|1N|nt|tejjyid: he risked going down with @D KJ offside on this line, I think|pg||
nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but still, success is the cure for all evils|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Henri, hi|pg||
nt|liraren: natural weak 2@d|pg||
nt|ybob: X and over suit at low level, bids @D |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: most teams playing in 3N board 3 it seems|pg||
nt|runnerup: here nobody can make anything big -perhaps not even any little|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|eleni: even 5 with a correct @d play:)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes an easy raise to game maybe via some gadget|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@h for N-S here|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C some Bergen raise ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||
nt|dkkello: Bergen raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||
nt|eleni: Tis metadoseis tis imeras tis vlepoume sto http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Bulletins.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: Missing all TOP honours , I would definitely hesitate to Open a weak two in first seat  |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  yes, especially vul|pg||
nt|liraren: and vuln!|pg||
nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||
nt|ybob: p p X ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, south has to move|pg||
nt|ybob: pass works fine to collect 200|pg||
nt|ybob: and probably down 1 in 4m|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
pc|c2|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d played with 4-2 fit ew in other table --so both rooms in 2 @d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i bid X with S cards and go down|pg||
nt|dkkello: anyone for dbl  3 @C ?|pg||
nt|ybob: i pass|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||
nt|lady007: if they dont get a ruff, 1 heart, 1 spade and a diamond loser?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bmkl: 3@c seems to be puppet|pg||
nt|eleni: yes and then smolen|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d2|nt|gmarco24: well, lead a club  :)))|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|eleni: a lot depends on def.  as he has just 8 tricks, with correct guess in @s|pg||
nt|frankbo: thk he makes now|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 180 -so 3 for F|pg||
nt|frankbo: thk he should see that cl was not good there|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|runnerup: to play @c was like surrender here i think|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|h4|nt|ntmon: nice guess in @H suit|pg||

nt|offthebend: first hurdle gone in club suit |pg||

nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||

nt|eleni: Our open table is really taking its time:)|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c is GF relay|pg||
nt|lady007: wild board|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: an over-ambituous 3NT:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  west is quite aggressive and unpredictable. I know that best, he's my ex partner :)|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 minor nS|pg||
nt|liraren: double fit for both pairs now maybee some action|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
nt|lady007: I expect west to come in with 2@h|pg||
nt|dkkello: Denmark with a great oppertunity here|pg||

mb|2H|nt|possessed: 2d is- 20-22 with a five card suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: as Roland uses to say, @C suit died in 50-ties|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: probaly 21C Michael's or Ghestemish - both majors |pg||

nt|mamos: East  not wanting to be excluded lol|pg||

nt|chrisky: good bid by s|pg||

nt|tejjyid: perhaps 3NT has the same meaning in modern sytems|pg||
nt|lady007: he might bid 4C now, and if N doesnt support, bid 5@d later|pg||
nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, East hand strong after the 2 heart response|pg||
nt|ybob: on OR 2NT rebids showed 5/4 strong, 4@C was cue with @H fit from W and not clear to E |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||
nt|liraren: if right guess in @d they make 4@s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  not on @d lead|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  or switch|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N it is|pg||
nt|juan lukas: maybe 4@c then 5@h would have been clearer in the other room |pg||
mb|4H|nt|vasmar: defense can get 3 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass by south, it gives opps too much room to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@h pass or correct|pg||

nt|liraren: but i cant see why Tofte should guess right in @d|pg||
nt|lady007: 9 tricks are no problem on a heart lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
pc|d4|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 4@C its clear to @H fit, W could bid 3@S with @S fit over 3@H ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mamos: EW  have done their job   hopefully their teammates can do theirs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eleni: French courtesy to pd:) Lorenzini is a young gentleman:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: turkey reached the optimmal contract, well deserved IMPs|pg||
nt|lady007: it is actually bad news for gullberg that his partner had the jack of hearts, because it means they can set up the suit by playing it only once through declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this makes 4 @s seems good idea from ew -but  they were never inn bidding|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vasmar: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|dkkello: This wont take long , though Niclas Ege is a very carefull player ( slow) :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: yes and he would have bid his @c suit after 2NT ( probably by transfert ) |pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|_fonzie__:  after trick 1, i can imagine many cases where it is interesting to switch to clubs and many cases where you should play your singleton @d|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  but it shouldn't be a guess|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  with singleton heart in dummy, north should be able to indicate whether he holds something in clubs (Q or K) or not by playing his smallest or largest card|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|mamos: ok in 5@d  not so in 6@d|pg||
nt|liraren: but east didnt trust him|pg||
nt|lady007: if declarer has KJx you probably have to give him a heart trick anyway and then you have to hope partner gets the lead before he has 9|pg||
nt|timve:  good board for the Dutch|pg||
nt|lady007: the queen also caters for Jx in dummy and is unlikely to cost a trick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ntmon: making games, of course|pg||
nt|bmkl: it seems the 3nt bid worked fine for Croatia|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: Q was a nice card for the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table North didnt bid 3@d and now has to decide over 3N if he still wants to mention them|pg||
nt|lady007: think it was better to bid 3@d immediatly and get it off your chest, so you dont have to guess later|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ntmon: anybody bidding @H by W?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H would not be my choice|pg||

nt|ritong: ah|pg||

nt|timve:  definately better to show your 55|pg||
nt|timve:  immediately|pg||
nt|lady007: he now bid 4@d over 3N. looks a little inconsistent IMO|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|key1809: can make 4s ,here on a spade guess, but tough to reach|pg||

nt|cicus: with a fit jump, strengthis not particularly important|pg||
nt|ritong: well he lacks the fifth @h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to play fitjumps AND splinters, hard to organise|pg||
nt|ritong: which can make a considerable difference|pg||
nt|cicus: important is at what level you are willing to play|pg||
nt|timve:  I have to agree Marion|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 5@c is great, even 6@c makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: Mr.Grosset maybe never heard of 8 ever, 9 never:):) (too young for it:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: 1@h over X shows a good suit|pg||
nt|lady007: E trying to double NS out of slam :)|pg||
nt|lady007: not that they will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|lady007: i dont like that double so much|pg||
mb|3N|nt|key1809: South will most likely TRF, and leave it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W make 3@S and N-S 3@h|pg||
nt|offthebend: North had to bring in the D suit for S to even think of slam anywhere -- with his poorish opening bid |pg||
nt|lady007: you mainly have a lot of spade tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's harder to reach thatn to respect I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S to|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
nt|lady007: and west seems to think they are in a forcing situation?|pg||
nt|lady007: or maybe he thinks he hasnt showed his hand yet :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
nt|timve:  1NT with this hand is pretty agressive|pg||
nt|timve:  would you have bid it Marion?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @c tricks needed in this so small to QJxx-to avoid later quess in that suit here|pg||
nt|frankbo: need to find 9 in cl to makes this i thk|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south choses the best 3 card suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
nt|lady007: yes. i might have bid it as well, not wanting to miss a possible 4@h contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@d, @h to A@h, @d to K or...?|pg||
nt|runnerup: so handling as i sayed |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but a tough contract..|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C-1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vasmar: -50 instead -140|pg||
nt|gmarco24: make it simple|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ntmon: +130 available|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|cicus: so you can combine fitjumps with splinters by using cue as splinter and jump shifts as fit jumps|pg||
pc|cA|nt|liraren: more use of 4 @d that way than too use it as splinter in a competition bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||

nt|ahri:  i imagine french staying calm|pg||

nt|mamos: France gained 3 imps on Board 5 when not only did Greek NS not bid Slam  they defended 4@Sx and only scored 500|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'd like ot know how North worked out to exit that @S|pg||
nt|ritong: would you respond to 1@s with south hand?|pg||
nt|cicus: I may be unfair, maybe he thought he could still make if @HK lies wellla fter all|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I do with an Ace|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but typically my partnerships open 1@S very heavy|pg||

nt|lady007: he played in my team|pg||
nt|gmarco24: oh man, i am so old  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|key1809: 6h, a decent contract, needing 3-2 hearts, but not here with a bad break|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that LHO is a passed hand is a factor imo|pg||
nt|ritong: he is less likely to balance|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|gmarco24: i know, we beat in you in basketball, and (i really don't know how) tomorrow in bridge  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: heheheh|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -the question here is can you stay out off this nonvuln game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
nt|lady007: this dutch team might be difficult to beat in basketball as well, they are all very tall|pg||
mb|2N|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||
nt|dkkello: both of the french players were on the french team winning the worlds championship in Bejing |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 spades has chances it seems..|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
nt|ybob: no with good defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||
nt|liraren: north is too passive I would have overcalled 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||
nt|timve:  think its now always made|pg||
nt|lady007: they are in 4|pg||
nt|timve:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|timve:  also that|pg||
nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: suprice lead and 7 first -@d and ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: There was called TD about previous board |pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: 4@D was made with hesitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: bid 4@D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
nt|juan lukas: W can overruff the 3rd round in @h |pg||
nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
nt|dkkello: declarer duck?|pg||
nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
pc|dK|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h7|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eleni: Basilis has to split honors in @d anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h9|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|cicus: in effect, Gazzilli tries to translate the standard opening into a strong club|pg||

pc|d3|pc|c8|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like it a lot|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|key1809: didnt unblock the dmds, hence 2 down|pg||
nt|eugenio123: :(|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  by the way, this hands perfectly demonstrates why you shouldn't have bid|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||

pc|s3|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||

nt|mamos: double to start with foe North|pg||
nt|ntmon: ther was an accident for Italy on bd 8, arriving to 4@S on 6-1 fit with NT and @C game making|pg||
nt|ritong: wimp:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C stand out inmy view|pg||
nt|ritong: one more time, the fact that pard is a passed hand is a factor  way less chances to have 3 NT cold|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence had to be precise to beat it..|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|cicus: ah this must be an agreement I am seeing for the first time|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally the @h xxxx is not a huge bonus|pg||

nt|cicus: 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  well would you have bid 5@D with south?|pg||
nt|timve:  or would you have doublet|pg||
nt|timve:  doubled|pg||
nt|timve:  with A and K in the other suits|pg||
nt|lady007: i've seen Van Lankveld overcall on much weaker hands than this one, maybe the vulnerability scared him|pg||
nt|timve:  I think you can make a case for double|pg||
nt|lady007: yes i think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: i am told that 5 @h in open room was 3 down|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h looks makeable (2 hearts and a club loser)|pg||
nt|liraren: but then u have to start with the @c Q |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: turkish teams plays fien, steady game so far|pg||

nt|mamos: 6NT maybe even|pg||
nt|ritong: impatient to know what it is  a @c ask?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a @D transfer?|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt depence on lead -if @s -down but if you lead @h K-it makes -this has no future|pg||
nt|frankbo: new imps for sweden|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eugenio123: even if I don't agree with the jump 4@h, I would've bid just 2 @h|pg||
nt|mamos: oops wb|pg||
nt|cicus: I am told 3@D and 3@S are switched|pg||
pc|h9|nt|key1809: yes, it seemed 4H, was a stretch, but thats youth for u:)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahri:  first one of the match :(|pg||

pc|c4|nt|cicus: 3@D=spades, 3@S=diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks for specs clarifying that|pg||
pc|c8|nt|_fonzie__:  now this is definitely too high|pg||

nt|drkvas: dbl dummy 4@h can be beaten|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry|pg||
nt|liraren: i have learned the hard way that pd NEVER have the perfect cards :) so nowdays i dont hope for it |pg||
nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||
nt|liraren: y i mean Kx onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: You can try and PIN 109 of clubs offside and K75 onside |pg||

nt|Gerben42:  at the other table, trumps were led and it was an easy win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  wont happen here|pg||
nt|cicus: pretty good contract, only that @D lie will hurt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think 5@D goes down "zero dummy"|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: he will make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @D seems normal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: But I don't know how to stop in 4@H, except by passing it|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|cicus: all games can be defeated|pg||
nt|ritong: lazar is satisfied with the contract, and has no clear reason to check if they can find a runaway if doubled|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  so new leader|pg||
nt|ritong: an other borderline decision|pg||
nt|ritong: facing 1 NT|pg||
nt|liraren: no 5 @h was 3 down in open room|pg||
nt|timve:  25 points|pg||
nt|lady007: you counted that pretty fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|zlatan: Hi all from sunny Nicosia|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|eugenio123: 1nt I guess|pg||
nt|ntmon: OR is delay, we have lost immediate comparisons|pg||
nt|ritong: treating 5+@c and limit via stayman has a lot of charm|pg||
nt|ritong: @s*|pg||
nt|timve:  yeah I know its a lot|pg||
nt|lady007: NS have some thin chances in slam, but it wont make on this lay out|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: like all juniors would|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|key1809: yes, decent 5card suit, with 14, 1NT it is|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard on NS |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks normal here|pg||
nt|cicus: all of us would Stayman and invite, can't afford to lose a major suit game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eleni: welcome with us Konstantine:):)|pg||
nt|timve:  well if they lead a heart|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: *one|pg||
nt|offthebend: so 3 more imps to Denmark - in that case  |pg||
nt|liraren: y 12-22|pg||
nt|juan lukas: agressive 2@h and 4@h |pg||
nt|ybob: they are juniors :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Gerben42:  2@H apparently Kokish|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  showing @H or big NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: agressive bidding all round|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||
nt|timve:  you can pitch a club on the fourth diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it seems hard to respect|pg||
nt|lady007: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 7 tricks, but East will face problems on pithces when north cashes clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was ose 30HP.|pg||
nt|chrisky: it has some problems on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||
nt|timve:  but I guess they wont bid 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the point is you can use stayman as well with 5+@s, inviting values and any shape|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: south had extras so took one more|pg||
nt|ybob: agressive to bid not to punish !!|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is a bit too high|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42:  6@H is much better|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||
nt|cicus: little by little, Hungary is catching up|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lady007: you never know.... if there is no tomorrow ;-)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
pc|d4|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|juan lukas: not clear X by N over 4@s ? |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't really go alonf with all that...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahri:  hoping for partner's king to be black|pg||
nt|offthebend: undo |pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42:  5@H no, 6@H bugger|pg||
nt|offthebend: that H discard can be costly :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahri:  as he cannot have much more|pg||
nt|eleni: Konstantine is serving his military service in Cyprus:):) This is why he is not playing in this European Championship:)|pg||
nt|lady007: might make now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe pd was short in @S ...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: oh yes   you are right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats more like it|pg||

nt|timve:  transfer to spades not sleminvitational|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe that means something different for this EW pair|pg||
nt|timve:  dont want my opponents get the chance to intervene|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems enough by 3@D. Who knowes?|pg||
nt|ahri:  we started so well, with all boards providing some imps, let's hope we are done with pushes. It's junior bridge after all :)|pg||
nt|cicus: ok, I checked the movie|pg||
nt|ybob: good bid 3@S by E|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|eugenio123: 2nt is not enough!|pg||
nt|key1809: N-S can make 3nt here|pg||
nt|lady007: I'm sure he isnt planning not to bid game :)|pg||
nt|dkkello: 2@D=limit+ or better raise of clubs , 3 @S shows stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the auction in OR looks strange to me, what can the 3 spade bid have meant?|pg||
nt|ybob: and GF|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@S on OR maybe shows m´s and short in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello: or will maybe  be an advance cuebid in a second when he bid 4 @C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: hey boy! wait a few more years till you get middle aged:) Then years run fast:)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|zlatan: i played 3 times in this kind of championships, and as they say: "once a junior, always a junior"|pg||
nt|liraren: NS outbid again, |pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H making for NS  and not in the bidding at all |pg||
nt|liraren: but i am not sure i open with 1@h either in second seat vuln.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||
nt|dkkello: no :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely 3 spades in other room was a singleton heart as suggested by 2 specs|pg||
nt|ybob: and 9 + cards m´s |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if it does show clubs why not play in them?|pg||
nt|dkkello: what to lead? :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 10 @D|pg||
nt|juan lukas: any @d works |pg||
mb|5S|nt|eugenio123: but south should've bid 3nt, not north|pg||
nt|key1809: North shd accept, he's a passed hand, and has Max for his pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Celik have told his hand well.|pg||
nt|ahri:  east showing concern about clubs|pg||
nt|dkkello: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: H lead wd have given declarer some thought, now it will be a claimer |pg||
nt|timve:  well they succeed getting it in the easthand|pg||
mb|6H|nt|lady007: actually the best game is 3NT, but this will also make with the diamond finesse onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|eleni: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: generally, its not right to lead from an Ace, witha 4card suit, esp in 3NT|pg||
nt|ahri:  well bid. everything lies well on tihs board too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: indeed why not play in clubs here...6 clubs looks the same play as 3N on the non diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  hard to bid 3NT|pg||

pc|s6|nt|offthebend: I suppose N didn't expect D Ace to be in the dummy - would rather have some other helpful card/s |pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  5@d as reached in the other room is the normal contract, and it is normal to go down one by finessing the diamonds|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ahri:  unless west tries for 6@c :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is going to have to bid a suit soon|pg||

nt|eugenio123: never lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but looking for more, 5@S should be still OK |pg||
nt|ritong: according to a very reliable kibitzer, because can have longer @ds and also possibly 7+ hcp|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|key1809: 5nt wd have been a better choice|pg||
nt|ahri:  west admitted fit, showed extras, east was slightly conservative|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: West has 6-6  has had three rounds of bidding and hasnt managed to show one of his six card suits yet|pg||

nt|mamos: if this goes wrong it will be entirely East's fault|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  wow, nice stop|pg||

nt|offthebend: IF East had passed , did south really have enough to move over 4H ? I, personally , don't think so |pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the better suits for 2@d|pg||
