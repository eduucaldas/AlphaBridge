nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||

nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||

nt|ahri:  i imagine french staying calm|pg||

nt|mamos: France gained 3 imps on Board 5 when not only did Greek NS not bid Slam  they defended 4@Sx and only scored 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 6h, a decent contract, needing 3-2 hearts, but not here with a bad break|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
mb|1S|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahri:  this is 21:9 for croats now if i am not mistaken, being on the "good" side of the VP scale for croats.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 7@s doesn't make last hand,only 12 tricks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|key1809: oh ,clubs are not breaking|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other boring NT? Can miss it if @S lead from S|pg||
nt|ahri:  a regular 3NT hand here|pg||
nt|pinticus: 10 top tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  unless west tries for 6@c :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is going to have to bid a suit soon|pg||
nt|mamos: I think he should have started with @d   and then bid 6@c the next round|pg||
nt|mamos: poor West   he has no clue what hand his partner has|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|eugenio123: it's not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|key1809: north is not going to stop|pg||
nt|eugenio123: never lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but looking for more, 5@S should be still OK |pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|key1809: 5nt wd have been a better choice|pg||
nt|ahri:  west admitted fit, showed extras, east was slightly conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: West has 6-6  has had three rounds of bidding and hasnt managed to show one of his six card suits yet|pg||
nt|chrisky: i told ypu we play better they bid better...:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  because @H3-3|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|mamos: if this goes wrong it will be entirely East's fault|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: As weel as @H from same side.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chrisky: i think we will pass now|pg||
mb|4N|nt|eugenio123: n is looking for 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: running scores http://tiniyurl.com/6jn39hs for juniors|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, how will he figure out the spade K, |pg||
nt|key1809: maybe a 5nt ,now|pg||
nt|eugenio123: he knows nothing about K@H so it is difficult to place all his @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|key1809: yes, 7 shd be ruled out, even with the Sp K, cant count 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: and http://tinyurl.com/6leq5ej for girls|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eugenio123: and now what to lead?|pg||
nt|key1809: Trump?|pg||
nt|key1809: looks safe|pg||
nt|key1809: i presume, he will go for a trump lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it's hard, he would preserve his 10 @s |pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: West is on lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: ahhhhhhh ok lol|pg||
nt|eugenio123: so trump seemed so normal, @d is another way to lead|pg||
nt|key1809: that was not a good opton, |pg||
nt|rodal f: Karlson by a pzyke?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  must be careful playing this|pg||

pc|s2|nt|eugenio123: small @C ruff?|pg||
nt|key1809: ruff a club, and finesse spades, for 13, shdnt be that difficcult:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I would like to know what he's thinkig about lol|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahri:  austria made 6NT here|pg||

nt|chrisky: only 6-6 in minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: something like:)|pg||
nt|mamos: ansd a 17 count|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last board until the break |pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahri:  (and that partner's possible club strength is in shorter club hand... and ... and... :))|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW play transfers after 1-level overcall, but not after X ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
