mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H can be made if EW dont play @S...|pg||

pc|h3|nt|famus: great event this--and an opportunity for youngsters to learn|pg||

nt|andy_h: heart csahing @SA and playing on clubs, but when North was able to ruff the 3rd club with the @SK declarer had to guess the diamonds - had he guessed wrong it would have resulted ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: in 9 tricks but infact came out with one overtrick ;)|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|andy_h: Observe the disparity between the 2@C (weak diamond bids) in this board and on board 5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bagman: Then he has to decide if he plays clubs to run or diamonds to run|pg||
pc|s3|nt|spenny80: a psichic cue?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for Leo fo find best lead.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eleni: It all depends on his inspiration for the @d|pg||
nt|bagman: The odds probably favour the clubs to run (by a slight margin)|pg||
nt|bagman: My guess is that E plays a diamond to the ace now|pg||
nt|bagman: it is the best combination of possibilities|pg||
nt|bagman: clubs running or diamond queen doubleton|pg||

nt|runnerup: just my guess..here bidding in this|pg||
nt|blum1956: If East opens 1@d Weat will hardly pass|pg||
nt|blum1956: West|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok-west is not passsing so north has a teasing to bid 2 @d if possible|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: S for shure ment it as a good lift in @S, might there deal. Support X seems better by the long term.|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: A Spade game for EW |pg||
nt|bagman: Declearer might have had some table feel about the clubs (e.g. NS might be notorious signallers)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|eleni: 1NT is played now in the open room by N|pg||

nt|galois85: dbl I think shows 4 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s is 500 -so good in case 4 @h makes,but there is a lot of play there|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: on board 10|pg||
nt|roussol: difficult to bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: 5@d MAKING|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - 4@H doesn't I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in practice 4@H too|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a safe 4@s contract for E-W|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 4@S on 2 of three things: spade break and 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit new here. 2/1 by bought pairs?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sunsamvar: as East may not lead or switch to @C in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11 on NS so ....|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|spenny80: for italy a sort of 2/1 i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: now|pg||
nt|blum1956: some pairs have an agreement that bidding the responder's suit is natural but this is rarely applicable to the opener's suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: 1Nt will not make...|pg||
nt|runnerup: many nowadays -and ns now in problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Antway N are to reopen now.|pg||
nt|spenny80: but for germany i don't know. Could be also polish? (the meaning of 1@d is?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Anyway|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eleni: just if one of the 2 finesses work, they are home|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: If switch to @C will set up suit|pg||

nt|desinka: play|pg||
nt|famus: with a @H cue might go a notch higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: with spades breaking and @HK onside the contract makes (there are some additional chances in case 2 of the three things are not working)|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course if @s are not Jxxx in N's hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|spenny80: for me 2@c is a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: true Carl and the @S loser goes away|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C would have been better...but then, EW might have found their 2@H spot...|pg||

nt|runnerup: no double -but @c lead and some hundreds|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|raghavan: Oh must be careful|pg||

nt|rodal f: The polich club|pg||
nt|spenny80: but likely the final contract is ok for italy|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|famus: to b honest --50% slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wd |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  nicely bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
nt|runnerup: some possibilities to miss tricks in defence but very unlikely|pg||

nt|blum1956: a club lead restricts NS to 11 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: we see another case here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: very intresting board |pg||
nt|desinka: and hard bidding and defance|pg||
nt|famus: @h slam coming up for the Hungarian girls|pg||
nt|panja: S has a good long minor this time|pg||
nt|panja: and North has the missing honour in that..so 3Nt will be easy|pg||
nt|galois85: 4@s on ns... hand useful for a coffee!|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|roussol: close to 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: this might worth  an IMP if 4@s+1 are made in the open room|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rodal f: brb some kids.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot for Germany?|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 3@h|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again you see here a slam in Hearts possibly bid by NS |pg||
nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
nt|runnerup: a game -no slam -should be avoided -here|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|desinka: 4@H?|pg||
nt|eleni: den xero poios apo tous 2 milaei agglika|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||
nt|athene: aces and shape always beat a bunch of kings and queens and jacks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y.|pg||
nt|spenny80: do you open with north cards? me not|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, you are right =) I'd better take my coffee before! lol |pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: I think always 4@s-1... unless Rubino continues with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|runnerup: i down use coffee breaks when 4 optinal loosers|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now a slam has chances as the @h lead from West is tempting|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|desinka: so..]|pg||
nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||
nt|panja: let us say CJ goes to @CQ..|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Lina|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4@h is ok, but 5@c passed is excellent save  :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: major and club switch best |pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: S denies Club control |pg||
mb|3H|nt|desinka: they may beat the contract|pg||
nt|desinka: but it is not easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: N must simply cash his 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double on the strength of the singleton diamond|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||
nt|bagman: Makes life easier in 3@H but would have killed 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and his ace in the side suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: landed in slam|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EVERYONE--its boys here--thnks-Sisito--the VG operator corrected me--pardon me for this EVERYONE--thnks Sisito|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i wouldn't have thought of 6@D|pg||
nt|smirny: well it is hard to bid S hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Gerben42:  we cannot judge unless we know what exacly 3@S showed|pg||
nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 4@S rkc-5@hs showed 2+Q|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can take one diamond ruff and then set up the clubs losing one in each|pg||
nt|eleni: As you all know, John Oikonomopoulos is the son of Ghionis+Helena sp:) As we say in Greek "the apple falls under the apple tree" :)|pg||
nt|panja: on a bad day...@CJ could be from @CJx..|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lead direction, not invite to defence...|pg||
nt|rodal f: N will miss the @D after thid start|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes @c lead needed in slam -right |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: one problem is, he is not on lead, so if his partner has the unsupported @DA he might well not get his ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: no thriller for us but good bridge after all|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eleni: Now that Mama-Lina is here I hope Peter will have better guesses:)|pg||

nt|chrisky: ns make 2@D and ew 2@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|bagman: also with strip squeeze|pg||

nt|runnerup: guessing well here+ wellplaced cards lets 4 @h to be made |pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 heart is par contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes the pass was a bit timid... maybe the 1@D opening did not promise @Ds|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  hmm other table didnt make 4@S... |pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s aggressive but he makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -but 4 makes|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, I guess 4@s!-2 is a good defense...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||
nt|helena sp:  good mornig to you all, good luck to our kids|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 1nt?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, cut this and deal a goulash|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||

nt|athene: say, by returning a club now :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: E needs to keep the hearts and give up the clubs|pg||
nt|roussol: 2@d cannot be found so 2@s -1 doesn't seem a disaster|pg||

pc|h4|nt|famus: i think this was a forcing chk back--or nmf--dunno--if forcing then 3@ds shows 5 cards|pg||

pc|h7|nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5NT is a dangerous bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you arent even sure yourself, how can partner be|pg||
nt|henryb:  With @h 4-4 this is not a challenging hand; If @h were 5-3 declarer would have to find the @cQ|pg||

nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||
nt|galois85: I totally don't like opening 1nt with 5-4-2-2, but just my opinion|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: maybe south should have bid the boring 6@S and argued it out afterwards|pg||
nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||

nt|runnerup: this time both aces @h and @c right but you surely dont want to squese table by taking @d at once|pg||

nt|chmitty: cold with @h 22 and many options if not|pg||

nt|bagman: On board 16, Finns made 6NT on the showup squeeze, which I missed ; well done|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: Not sure what Gebrand's thinking was when he covered...|pg||
nt|runnerup: does east smell something here and bid?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@h is down one but it is difficult to bid it V vs NV|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: Not the greatest time for one of Ish Delmonte's slightly offbeat 1NT overcalls|pg||
nt|eleni: This will give time to the open room to get closer to board 18-19, as they still are playing 16|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2SA shows @h fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: 21 hard on's at EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: probably 4 cards ?|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid 3@S with south|pg||
nt|athene: that would let north cause some trouble with his extra distribution|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|Walddk2: Artur already played for Norway, in the Nordic Championships recently|pg||
nt|loe48: what is fasinating with bridge is that the cards can be twisted in so many directions..so many possibilities..so the players do constantly have choises|pg||
mb|p|nt|stamkreas: the last 2 boards shopuld be flat, but we made par so we can celebrate already, Denmark is always a strong opponent!|pg||
nt|roussol: y are right stam:)|pg||
nt|alati: o vasilis me to dino idi exoun vgalei 2 mans sti 2i stis teleftees ntones..|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  active NS give them a hard time though|pg||
mb|5H|nt|chmitty: I dislike showing a two-suiter @s and a minor with a 6 cards @s suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or did N help a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: @s partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sometimes you can rebid spades to show the extra length|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: nice stop by NS - Souths 4333 hand didnt appeal to him|pg||
nt|eleni: nice contract by Peter, as W can never return another @s|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but were is the K@c?|pg||
nt|eleni: true, but only 1 way to be played and cross his fingers that the K is with W|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course he doesnt know also the @hA|pg||
nt|chrisky: he knows the A@h is in w|pg||
nt|eugenio123: J@s would've been better|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Gerben42:  hard to find in this auction I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @CAx is golden|pg||
nt|andy_h: East, although the double fit is really good he is probably afraid of the lack of red-suit honours he had|pg||
nt|eleni: possible placing, yet not 100%|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @h was a good sacrifise vuln|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|alati: ara, den prokeitai na xasoume |pg||
nt|andy_h: If West had the same hand without the @HQ then slam is abysmal on a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S must be exclusion|pg||
nt|athene: so 5@H is two keys and the queen, and west will ask about @DK for seven maybe|pg||
nt|chmitty: would you stay silent with South's hand all the time ?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roussol: mortensen is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|alati: kai kleinoume tin 1i mera me 38 vps|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|sharkey: penultimate board here|pg||
nt|loe48: as we see this contract has no chanse..bu \t a fresh try|pg||
nt|chmitty: North to South : your lead partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess west decided that with @HAQ @CA @DK east was not just bidding 4@H over 3@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: Ish Delmonte preferred bidding 1Nt to bidding the very weak @h suit, which might be passed out in a 5-1 fit. I prefer @H myself, but I can see all 52 cards. |pg||
nt|runnerup: can they solve this -i doubt|pg||
nt|runnerup: so it was too diffcult in both tables|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|roussol: sure is good|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|hA|nt|roussol: nice bid|pg||

nt|galois85: no finesses now... |pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wonder what he's thinking about|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, he has the exact count of the hands... so spades discarding clubs, ace of club, ruff one club, one diamond, again one clubs king of hearts, and diamond...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|roussol: my blood pressure is :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bravo East (also for avoiding disastrous 5@c)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: With @C behind it became a auto|pg||
nt|runnerup: who says a sacrifise sorry -makes :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Did South in fact play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: sure|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roussol: 21|pg||
nt|athene: if south had bid 3@S over 2nt then EW might be trying to get a decent penalty out of 6@SX|pg||
pc|s6|nt|alati: nomizw oti i tixi mas girise tin plati |pg||
nt|chmitty: the save in 6@s would have cost what ? 800 ?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 1@C openers that are less than 4 cards about 20 to 30% of the time, the need for a club stopper is regarded by some (not me) as a quaint and archaic concept.   |pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
nt|athene: not sure, i guess something like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north could have doubled one of west's spade bids to emphasize his spade suit and try to wake his partner up|pg||
nt|chmitty: anyhow last hand now :) tx all and see you in a little more than 1 hour for the last match of the day @h:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I was thinking how to go down|pg||
nt|galois85: but luckily for declearer it was the same...|pg||
nt|blum1956: Very strange - if the declarer has @d J10x raising with the Ace still guarantees two diamond tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators, Peter Gill and William Frisby|pg||
nt|famus: and 2@s if bid will make for another 5/6 imps|pg||
nt|spenny80: yess see you all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: ty Fabio and Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Germany has improved a litte getting 12 imp on Bd 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the match - many thanks to our excellent operator in Albena, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and congrats to the Swedish team on this win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  although this hand...|pg||
nt|andy_h: he could bid 4NT a two suited takeout*|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with longer spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
nt|galois85: yes, but thanks to KF and AQ it seems an impossible leading... |pg||
nt|galois85: 2nt shows 6@h and 4 in another (minor?)|pg||
