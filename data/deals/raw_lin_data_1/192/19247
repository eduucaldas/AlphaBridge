mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: might make if @S's are 2/2 |pg||
mb|3D|nt|josj: difficultnow to avoid a loser in each suit; would need a lot of help from our friends...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|szalay:  personally I prefer straight shortsuit trials, and next bid with 5422/6322|pg||
nt|szalay:  if u open 1N with 5332 u nearly never have 5332 game try, close either weaker or stronger hand u have|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we do not have their system notes |pg||
pc|c3|nt|szalay:  but its not SST, for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: now @H loser can disappear|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|szalay:  his father and boss wd not give him food if he makes so big mistake|pg||
nt|josj: there goes the @H loser...but not now...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw elder Birman is the main reason imho for improving israeli teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: it was long suit try and 3@h showed the middle range|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|szalay:  I think it was bit pushy game, especially in NV|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|szalay:  some maths:|pg||
nt|szalay:  in VULN u can gain 10 IMPs, lose 6|pg||
nt|josj: it definitely was as there also is a @D problem to solve|pg||
nt|szalay:  in white u can gain 6, can lose 5-6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: I think better chance was to un the 6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzjm: run|pg||
nt|szalay:  so in first case u need 6/16=3/8 chance, sthg like 3-3 split|pg||

nt|sybarra: need to ruff the ht and give up the @D  |pg||
nt|josj: I think so too, let's hope Roudinesco agrees :)|pg||
nt|szalay:  of course its true for IMP|pg||
nt|szalay:  if u r playing  MP, imagine u r in NV (if u r in red yet)|pg||
nt|sybarra: he has the black suit count,  not sure if red suit count if clear  |pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzjm: but as some kibitzers pointed long @s more probably has shortness in @D so doubleton honour was also a kinfd of option|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: still there is a question, of course, how you will deal further with @ds with 4 trumps with east|pg||

nt|roussol: prepei na pei passo o petros|pg||
nt|eleni: O Dinos sto anoikto domatio protimise ta 6NT (+1)|pg||
nt|smirny: but 3nt is too much i think|pg||
nt|andy_h: assuming no club ruffs looming I think the best play is a small trump from W (dummy). Obviously North would have a hard time ducking with Kx so if North plays low you stick in the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||
nt|andy_h: (I was talking about the trump play on the previous board)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D shows singleton @D..I guess|pg||
nt|eleni: a feature|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: another part score hand, even for our agressive youth:)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|sharkey: 4 NT Blackwood?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: if 4nt blackwood, then strange 5@D response|pg||
nt|roussol: ola peftoun :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Desi @H|pg||
nt|desinka: may 2@D vs prec club is narural|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to start the clubs early|pg||
nt|bagman: with a trump lead there's no hope of ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might not turn out well...|pg||
nt|eleni: The Greek youngsters here, as they understand they are behind, they overbid, which is sad|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2nt usually means minors, looks like not for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: this doesnt look like ti will make  |pg||
nt|gmarco24: it is lowest + another, kibs say...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: East Passed - not risking 6@Hx being pulled to f.inst 6 NT whivh may make - doesnt know pd has @SAK|pg||
nt|panja: it will have to be played well....if N plays a @S to King early...4@S is likely to fail|pg||

nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome William|pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe -1 after good guess in first trick, let's see...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking was reasonable; even if west plays the nine you can still lead to the ten and try and make a club trick for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Grunke is still believing in this contract|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|sharkey: These kinds of bidding scenarios shud be discussed by serious partnerships|pg||
nt|chrisky: 4@C 2@H and 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: I suspect there was a misunderstanding about 3@D here...|pg||
nt|eleni: now Peter has to play @d and discard his @h loser and a @c|pg||
nt|chrisky: in 3nt|pg||
nt|panja: S must have thought it was feature...so @H suit was likely to be open|pg||
nt|panja: and therefore, bid 4@S, not 3Nt|pg||
pc|h8|nt|loe48: even 2nt down|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|frankbo: yes|pg||
nt|loe48: 2 down|pg||

pc|h4|nt|eleni: too late now|pg||
nt|bagman: Now it's the matter of the overttrick|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense needs to take the diamond; otherwise it goes away|pg||
nt|bagman: A club switch is probably ok, too; declarer ruffs high and loses a trick later|pg||

nt|eleni: and passive defense Peter:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  oh well we do not know|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S would have been the right spot in that case...|pg||
nt|eleni: and I suppose it will be another 5IMPs to the Israeli team|pg||
nt|panja: that is why, many prefer to play Ogust....rebid on 2Nt|pg||
nt|panja: that says something about the quality of the opened suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Me who was total blind.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good declarer play, nothing better could be done|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eleni: you are so right Panja:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  STOP|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 6@h here, but not easy at all|pg||
nt|athene: south's hand is a lot more useful for north than a 3@C bid would suggest|pg||
mb|3D|nt|frankbo: no, was terrible to not tak 4 H tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 4@s in the open room|pg||

nt|panja: 3@H vs 3@C here..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Scotland only need a 11-19 for be = at Denmark. 13-17 so fare.|pg||
nt|athene: @HA, @CA, @DJ :) rather than, say, @CKQJ and @SK|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H can be made if EW dont play @S...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: excellent 9/10 hcp :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south should bid 4@H over 3@D trying to show how good his hand is for hearts |pg||

nt|andy_h: in 9 tricks but infact came out with one overtrick ;)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  unlikely to find @C position due to "restricted choice"|pg||
nt|smirny: well expensive board...probably a 26IMPS guess|pg||
nt|smirny: but after weak in D (2@C)|pg||
nt|smirny: you can find it|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@H 6@D ... why not 3@C|pg||

nt|smirny: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andy_h: Observe the disparity between the 2@C (weak diamond bids) in this board and on board 5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: Then he has to decide if he plays clubs to run or diamonds to run|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eleni: It all depends on his inspiration for the @d|pg||
nt|bagman: The odds probably favour the clubs to run (by a slight margin)|pg||
nt|bagman: My guess is that E plays a diamond to the ace now|pg||
nt|bagman: it is the best combination of possibilities|pg||
nt|bagman: clubs running or diamond queen doubleton|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the diamond finesse he can go down with clubs 3-3|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  better :) thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 1NT is played now in the open room by N|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i agree|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|eleni: on board 10|pg||
nt|roussol: difficult to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 5@d MAKING|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - 4@H doesn't I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in practice 4@H too|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|eleni: a safe 4@s contract for E-W|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 4@S on 2 of three things: spade break and 2 finesses|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: as East may not lead or switch to @C in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11 on NS so ....|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panja: 1Nt will not make...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eleni: just if one of the 2 finesses work, they are home|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: If switch to @C will set up suit|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Q@d lead must be ducked|pg||
pc|h2|nt|desinka: intresting board|pg||
nt|desinka: not easy to get sigle K@C if u pkay 6@c|pg||
nt|desinka: play|pg||
nt|famus: with a @H cue might go a notch higher|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: with spades breaking and @HK onside the contract makes (there are some additional chances in case 2 of the three things are not working)|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course if @s are not Jxxx in N's hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sunsamvar: true Carl and the @S loser goes away|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C would have been better...but then, EW might have found their 2@H spot...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: Oh must be careful|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: brb|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bagman: On this lead, declarer cannot afford to duck a spade|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or now might only 8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|famus: to b honest --50% slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wd |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42:  nicely bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|raghavan: Nothing much to do here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|famus: on a good day it wud b bid and made|pg||
nt|frankbo: Danmark did make 4S on B), 11 imp|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eleni: they could afford a 3@c contract anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankbo: B9|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and there is the point that we dont know if N has successfully hidden his @S spots|pg||

nt|panja: in general, if you have a bad long suit, better to play in the suit..|pg||
nt|panja: but with a good long minor....Nt might be a good idea|pg||
pc|c3|nt|raghavan: yes hasan you said 50% - Spade K can be under SA and so makes|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: no need to lead to the @DK first round of the suit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chrisky: -3|pg||
nt|eleni: only it wasn't a "good" long minor:)|pg||
nt|panja: y...that is why 1Nt was a big risk|pg||
nt|eleni: indeed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|famus: a @s back can spell trouble|pg||
nt|athene: so this should be 11 tricks|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: very tight match here|pg||
nt|famus: check--losing @h on 4th @c|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|rodal f: EW was in for 800:) Swing it magistern.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: then 1@h bid would be real freestyler flight, but, as you say: just in case |pg||
mb|1D|nt|panja: we see another case here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: very intresting board |pg||
nt|desinka: and hard bidding and defance|pg||
nt|famus: @h slam coming up for the Hungarian girls|pg||
nt|panja: S has a good long minor this time|pg||
nt|panja: and North has the missing honour in that..so 3Nt will be easy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roussol: close to 6NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eleni: this might worth  an IMP if 4@s+1 are made in the open room|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: brb some kids.|pg||
mb|d|nt|famus: 3@h|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again you see here a slam in Hearts possibly bid by NS |pg||
nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|desinka: 4@H?|pg||
nt|eleni: den xero poios apo tous 2 milaei agglika|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||
nt|athene: aces and shape always beat a bunch of kings and queens and jacks|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|desinka: so..]|pg||
nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||
nt|panja: let us say CJ goes to @CQ..|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Lina|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4@h is ok, but 5@c passed is excellent save  :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raghavan: S denies Club control |pg||
pc|d3|nt|desinka: they may beat the contract|pg||
nt|desinka: but it is not easy |pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: N must simply cash his 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double on the strength of the singleton diamond|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||
nt|bagman: Makes life easier in 3@H but would have killed 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and his ace in the side suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: landed in slam|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EVERYONE--its boys here--thnks-Sisito--the VG operator corrected me--pardon me for this EVERYONE--thnks Sisito|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i wouldn't have thought of 6@D|pg||
nt|smirny: well it is hard to bid S hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42:  we cannot judge unless we know what exacly 3@S showed|pg||
nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|famus: 4@S rkc-5@hs showed 2+Q|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can take one diamond ruff and then set up the clubs losing one in each|pg||
nt|eleni: As you all know, John Oikonomopoulos is the son of Ghionis+Helena sp:) As we say in Greek "the apple falls under the apple tree" :)|pg||
nt|panja: on a bad day...@CJ could be from @CJx..|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: one problem is, he is not on lead, so if his partner has the unsupported @DA he might well not get his ruff|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|eleni: Now that Mama-Lina is here I hope Peter will have better guesses:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|famus: srtraight forward play--ought to be--check @hs--ending in dummy--then run the @c9--|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|raghavan: now problem|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: maybe @Ck at trick 2 to cater for singleton Queen|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: if A is singleton anyway 2 trick have to be given|pg||
nt|roussol: ty eleni i hope too:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: made 9 - well done|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes must be excl. since she denied @C control|pg||

nt|sharkey: a mundane 4@H....|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room 5@d were set by -1|pg||
nt|eleni: underbid by N-S so this must cost domr imps|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair it was hard for NS because they didn't really know how strong declarer was|pg||
nt|athene: so they don't know if they are trying to beat 1nt or just restrict overtricks|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: or - cud North's @H 8 come into play after @C lead?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says not @CQxx or better, and only 2 controls|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: yes carl|pg||
nt|famus: might get his !q or 10|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult hand for Peter, let us hope he counts it out really well, as he usually does|pg||
nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: North decided to defend|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but cant blame North for not competing|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  thought W was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT is nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: @s-@h-@d shud b the order|pg||
nt|roussol: ducking 2ice|pg||
nt|chrisky: -1 is ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||
nt|loe48: so im not surprised if hey bid 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||
nt|athene: yes sorry 2@D might be 0-3 controls, not specifically 2|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  if you arent even sure yourself, how can partner be|pg||
nt|henryb:  With @h 4-4 this is not a challenging hand; If @h were 5-3 declarer would have to find the @cQ|pg||

nt|loe48: will we hear 4s and 5d|pg||
nt|athene: that sort of gets some way to showing what he has - will partner bid 7 on the strength of @CA @HAK?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|frankbo: Ireland did bidd 6D against Noray|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: he must abandon @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hello all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Pierre|pg||
nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: maybe south should have bid the boring 6@S and argued it out afterwards|pg||
nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chmitty: true : you have to discuss in depth what would 5NT mean as compared to 6@d|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  slam again|pg||
nt|andy_h: This bid is usually employed with a mexican 2@C (or 2@D) opening showing 18-19balanced, do E/W do that?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  not so bad one either, either @D 2-2 or @H 3-2|pg||
nt|chmitty: seems to be a very good @h slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Someone told me that Malinowski is switching from playing for England to Norway. Do you know if that's true?|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|sharkey: Not sure what Gebrand's thinking was when he covered...|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|petergill: Not the greatest time for one of Ish Delmonte's slightly offbeat 1NT overcalls|pg||
nt|eleni: This will give time to the open room to get closer to board 18-19, as they still are playing 16|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2SA shows @h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: probably 4 cards ?|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid 3@S with south|pg||
nt|athene: that would let north cause some trouble with his extra distribution|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|Walddk2: Artur already played for Norway, in the Nordic Championships recently|pg||
nt|loe48: what is fasinating with bridge is that the cards can be twisted in so many directions..so many possibilities..so the players do constantly have choises|pg||
mb|p|nt|stamkreas: the last 2 boards shopuld be flat, but we made par so we can celebrate already, Denmark is always a strong opponent!|pg||

mb|4H|nt|chmitty: I dislike showing a two-suiter @s and a minor with a 6 cards @s suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: @s partial|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|athene: sometimes you can rebid spades to show the extra length|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: nice stop by NS - Souths 4333 hand didnt appeal to him|pg||
nt|eleni: nice contract by Peter, as W can never return another @s|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but were is the K@c?|pg||
nt|eleni: true, but only 1 way to be played and cross his fingers that the K is with W|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course he doesnt know also the @hA|pg||
nt|chrisky: he knows the A@h is in w|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|Gerben42:  hard to find in this auction I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @CAx is golden|pg||
nt|andy_h: East, although the double fit is really good he is probably afraid of the lack of red-suit honours he had|pg||
nt|eleni: possible placing, yet not 100%|pg||
mb|p|nt|alati: ara, den prokeitai na xasoume |pg||
nt|andy_h: If West had the same hand without the @HQ then slam is abysmal on a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S must be exclusion|pg||
nt|athene: so 5@H is two keys and the queen, and west will ask about @DK for seven maybe|pg||
nt|chmitty: would you stay silent with South's hand all the time ?|pg||

nt|chmitty: North to South : your lead partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess west decided that with @HAQ @CA @DK east was not just bidding 4@H over 3@S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: Ish Delmonte preferred bidding 1Nt to bidding the very weak @h suit, which might be passed out in a 5-1 fit. I prefer @H myself, but I can see all 52 cards. |pg||

nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
