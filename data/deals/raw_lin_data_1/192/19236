mc|9|nt|jr7: big play - bigger - biggest :)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Open yes - overbid: NO...!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes but not jump to 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think 4@H weaker than 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is not GF|pg||
nt|sharkey: Normal today I think - assuming they'll be in game with 5-3 after 2/1|pg||
nt|sharkey: at least many do play this way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Badly enough - I think, that 1430 will be a good score here - some pairs playing in @S and some not bidding slam|pg||
