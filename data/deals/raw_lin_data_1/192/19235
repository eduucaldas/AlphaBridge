nt|gioffi: now 10 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: I think Sigrid (Spangenberg) will now play @cAK, @c ruff, @s ruff, @hT and last @c either discarding her @d or ruffing|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||

nt|richie: partscore battle - 2@s for EW and 3@c NS, but Magdalena Ticha decides to put immediate pressure at the vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|richie: lol gioff|pg||
nt|richie: north and south simply don't have a bid anymore, 3@d will probably the final destination|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|richie: this will lead to a small disaster for Italy, north is forcing herself to bid 4@c which is apparently not forcing|pg||

nt|richie: it's true that you may still make something in the majors, but by preempting with 3@d you also put a lot of pressure on opponents |pg||

nt|oosb: to settle your nerves|pg||
nt|eleni: only she had no communication|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Dag:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to follow more than this board: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ntmon: i think the route declarer choose is the right one|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
mb|p!|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S makeable on a good trump guess|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
pc|cT|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||

nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||

mb|p|nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||

mb|p|nt|loe48: nettet mitt er litt ustabilt ennaa her|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well, I am not sure 2N says hearts...|pg||
nt|spenny80: ok correct|pg||
mb|3H|nt|murat e: also 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 3@d by north would be better (lead direction)|pg||
nt|galois85: 3nt e-w here?|pg||
nt|josj: easy make :)|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B11. Same open same X but S bidded 3@H where S passed here. 3@S came and pass around.|pg||
nt|spenny80: dou you rebid in W now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  12 or 13...|pg||
nt|murat e: no risk no fun|pg||
nt|timve:  wow|pg||
nt|timve:  this is excitement (and not only in the tour de France)|pg||
nt|timve:  this is two off with the good lead|pg||
nt|timve:  but 6@S has also a chance|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: can you bid 3nt that is the question here |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...well this is ok for EW, surely|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oosb: Well I've seen a variant where it's @D + Major?  But standard unusual 2NT is @D + @H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  Chicken - or?|pg||
nt|frankbo: da var de for høyt|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|asig: 5@c is also making|pg||

nt|timve:  now its-2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|timve:  and 300 is a reasonalbe result|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Flott press fra N. Ikke enkelt detta.|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|murat e: brave man|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|loe48: ikke enkelt..gaar mot 1 ned i denne|pg||
nt|frankbo: eneste sjansen er x sp fra bordet og at N bruker K|pg||
nt|rodal f: Info. CET13.00 Holland against, live as I'm told so fare. Not 100% shure.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norway.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit "Møllers Tran" from bough sides.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, must be|pg||
pc|h3|nt|asig: North can't prevent the fourth diamond from being ruffed - his clubs are too small|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 of @c makes a ruff j and 9 both in south true|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hawe45:  Looks better - who would lead the 2 from the Jack?|pg||
nt|loe48: korrekt spill her er liten spar mot J|pg||
nt|oosb: NS making LOTS of tricks in @C or @S|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|galois85: not at all... but as you said before, we are not juniores!|pg||
nt|josj: any more|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  One more round to-day|pg||
nt|murat e: 520 beats this one if any...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You might see the lead in board 14 this way: Chance for more than 1 trick = @C-lead|pg||
nt|oosb: North should not have passed.|pg||
nt|oosb: Stuck for a bid I wouldve chosen 3@C|pg||
nt|oosb: Or dbl.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|timve:  well defended|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@H was a good call, making EW to guess|pg||
nt|spenny80: you need 6@c and @s finess to make 3NT.... a lot|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|loe48: hvis N stikker med honoer dra J neste gang for a tippe K10 eller Q10 bak|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|oosb: And as one of the kibz points out, South couldve dbled 4@H|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: correct view for only -1|pg||
nt|oosb: 6@C cold|pg||
