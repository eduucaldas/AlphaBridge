nt|athene: it can be even more valuable to get your partner to play 3nt when there has been an overcall|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|shevek: another 3NT here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|shevek: 28 hcp but no fit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H must be 4th suit i suppose, and looks a slight overbid|pg||
nt|athene: assuming it's GF|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT looks like the normal action over 2@C|pg||
nt|shevek: agree|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|shevek: hard to keep east quiet now|pg||
nt|athene: not surprisingly, East has higher ambitions facing a game force|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D not at all what west wanted to hear|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: now she will be wondering if 4NT is natural and discouraging|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 5@c better than 5@d as the cards lie :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT over 2@C and east would just have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, that 2@h bid followed by 3!nt promissed the @hA (say)  as well |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: at least @cs are friendly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzjt: could make it|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the clubs couldn't be more friendly|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C does deserve to lose imps but they should make this - nothing to do but hope for @CKxx onside|pg||
nt|Walddk8: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=892   Poland European Champions with one match to go. Very ...|pg||
nt|Walddk8: impressive, and many congratulations!|pg||
nt|athene: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even that is not enough|pg||
nt|athene: you can't get to dummy twice to draw trumps AND cash the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so you can't make three hearts, three diamonds, three trumps and two spades|pg||
nt|shevek: good point |pg||
nt|athene: ruffing a diamond doesn't work as north can overruff|pg||
nt|athene: with the king if necessary|pg||
nt|athene: and then south has the @CJ anyway|pg||

mb|2C|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||

nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||

nt|frankaus: i'n my day no selfrespecting executive could type :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||

nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: celne otwarcie Overbeeke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N showed minimum and S hand is not that strong for the raise.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|z_lasu: na drugim stole ekspecki wist w 8@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: first blood for Netherland|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: we all know where it is:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: zamiast 2kier,lepiej opisze rekê inwityj¹ce 2NT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||

nt|loe48: very careful by N with 10 points, but as we see have no real s stopper so cant bid  1nt |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|athene: if north did double then south might bid 4@D - if you can make a partscore your way it's always just bad news to let opps get away with losing a 50 or two|pg||

nt|athene: the worst is you might play 2nt with a 5-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|athene: in france they tend not to raise with 3-card support|pg||
nt|athene: or they used not to|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so you might be worried about 3-1-5-4 minimum with east|pg||

nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like another 4@s hand|pg||

nt|eugenio123: 3nt senza storia|pg||
mb|2S|nt|possessed: will end up at 800|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is close, but 3nt is better than 4@H|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|frankbo: guess he bidd 6C now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Seems as someting can be of here,|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  No |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and why not?|pg||

mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: ie. bid 3nt over 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  this one may be less successful|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c8|nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||

nt|shevek: as I said before if north had @sK instead of @hK....|pg||
nt|athene: it would have been better if north could just ask her partner about her hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: or at least if one of the points in @C were anywere else |pg||
nt|athene: if north could bid, say, 2nt over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: and find her partner has a club void|pg||
nt|athene: now she knows she has a minimum hand because extras and a void bids more than 2@S|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, @dA instead of @cA|pg||
nt|athene: and weak trumps means you stop in four|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjt: 2@D multi here|pg||

nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||

pc|d6|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||

nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||

nt|pinticus: EW maybe push them to bid game|pg||
nt|eugenio123: finally they found their fit on 4th level|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: of course he might just cash four rounds of diamonds first to see what happens|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: he knows @h44 now if @h7 lead was 2/4|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  now declarer is in big danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 9 was the winning play |pg||

nt|henryb:  so much for my predictions|pg||
nt|eugenio123: let's hope a normal auction and a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the Girls series they play 16 X 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: as oppose to the Juniors where they play one set of 20 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: per match|pg||
nt|loe48: a 2 heart opener would have caused problems|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  pass on S was conservative|pg||
nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||

nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: right guess of @D and they can make 7.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
pc|d4|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||

nt|mareczek: hm... trzeba trafic do grona komentatorów, BBO ma taka grupê|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3@C was more descriptive.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has powerhouse and EW hands match nicely with no wasted value.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But 7 down is a good score for EW|pg||

nt|eugenio123: when your opp bids in this way it is sure he's got good stoppers in majors|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
nt|athene: but fortunately for declarer east can't get in again to cash that @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: E cold have taken 2@d ruffs, not 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: it is making now, there are 2 entries to establish and enjoy the @Hs|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer most likely will find the Q@d , after seeing AK @s A@c in South|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity for declarer that @S4 is so low|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|pc|c8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: pewnie jeszcze padnie 5 trefli - 5 karo i wreszcie 5 kier|pg||

mb|2C|nt|cicus: hmm, it does not sound like a strong NT now, does it?|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 2@H over 1@S with north hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4NT is asking for aces excluding the @d suit, so N knows to show only 1 ace|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it seems somethinh like -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 1nt??? why not 2 or 3@C?|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with the north hand|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|dzeronimo: brawo, na drugim stole doszli|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if he had @DK10 doubleton why would he lead the jack?|pg||

nt|dzeronimo: tym razem +6|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: that's why|pg||
nt|eugenio123: that's just another way to see this game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: found it :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  WD|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: otherwise declarer has time to develope 2 @d tricks and takes 10 tricks for a great score|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S a better contract here|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and think west should bid 4@S|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hand seems worthless in 3NT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bravo zazzà|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  but after a heartlead from north.....|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S is without chance|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mignon87: 2@d by north over south's 1NT would have shown 18-20 points with any shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|cicus: I think 5@S was a make with open cards even on a trump lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|psyck: some would chose to play in NT with 4333 shape with W I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are the new leaders , but only 2.5 points ahead of the Israeli pair Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Safety to finesse that way|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: can EW help their country-mare's cause?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cicus: it is suggested that this should be taken in dummy and a @H led - but what if N ducks smoothly?|pg||
nt|szalay:  call hr magican|pg||
nt|szalay:  her|pg||
nt|szalay:  and give her Hermione role in next chapter|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, the @HK is not easy to duck although what will W hold to justify jumping to 3@H?|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw better to play Q: not so easy to duck|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  I have a kibitzer who says you should only play the 5-3 when the short hand has a ruffing value|pg||
nt|athene: west might have considered leaving 3nt with 4333 but his weak hearts perhaps were a worry|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure how good 3NT is with the natural @h lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eugenio123: just a question of overtricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  another heart would give declarer problems|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gronkvist:  to late |pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: 3N would require dec to guess right which minor finesse to take|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9 tricks won't be a good success against 10 tricks in 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: 10 tricks not so easy in 4@s either|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|psyck: but he is on his way to it now|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @c prevent an overtrick,,,,if he plays @h declarer needs to jump with the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays @h then declarer is between top and bottom - K@h means 11 tricks and a top, low @h means 9 tricks and a bad score|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: but perhaps use extra diamond entry|pg||
