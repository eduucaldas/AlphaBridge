mb|3H!|nt|Gerben42:  why not 2@C then bid 2@S|pg||
nt|smirny: well for me x and 3c is stronger that this hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  when he has trumphs left in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: 2@S relay|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so a nice start for Croatia |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  promise support?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|smirny: yes i would bid 2C instead of DBL|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and 3@H instead of 2@D?|pg||
nt|smirny: and west thinks that his hand is too strong for 3H over DBL|pg||
nt|smirny: intresting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H maybe shows @Sxx @Hxxxx @Dxxxx @Cxxx|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d has some play ,but can you bid it?|pg||
nt|rensph: yes, somewhat surprised he underestimated the danger of drawing all trumps there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: no, not promising anything yet, just asking|pg||
nt|rensph: 3@H 5-5 without extras|pg||
nt|riccho:  E is trying to get overbord here|pg||
nt|riccho:  old hamman rule: If you have a choice of bids and 3NT is one of them: thatÂ´s it!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rodal f: Seems as an ok start for NS. X and 500?|pg||
nt|loe48: Hei|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Dag and welcome|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s is a little worse than a @s finesse which we see is off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Dag|pg||
nt|loe48: Thank you Frank..forgot about time here and joined a tm :)|pg||

nt|runnerup: this was 4 tricks to defence lead -good one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Michael|pg||
nt|riccho:  Dont know the system here, but: to bid first 3@d and than 4@c is not a choice I would have made. E will have a lot to explain afterwards... |pg||

nt|poohbear: Even if the @s finesse wins declarer still isnt out of the woods. Needs to take care of the 3rd @c . So he has to choose between trying to ruff it and losing to 4-1 trumps or just ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: drawing all the trumps and hoping that the defense cant hold off the @d ace or that the @c Q is an entry|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Shows (very) weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl by Schwartz aggressive opposite a passed partner. Would be better with xx in @ds and the AJ somewhere else. But now it has worked out fine|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 620/650 is on, so 500 is OK|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  West made an aggressive Dbl of 1NT and will be happy to get -1|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hi there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Jacka Ciechomskiego...po po³udniu polowanie na komentatorów jest bardziej wydajne:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West's signal is suit preference with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can stand either shift so he gave a middle card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As SouthÂ´s faher points out: 4 @D would have been a better bid - West might pick 4 @H then|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: 3@d was hardly FG |pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|smirny: is it better to lead 2nd/4th in trumps|pg||
nt|smirny: ?|pg||
nt|smirny: i think it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West would dbl takeout over 4@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42:  maybe better is small?|pg||
nt|loe48: agreed, the values of the hand is lowered now by club bid, so an understandable pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would East bid then - facing a passed partner?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Notice fisher won the @c king to induce partner to return a @H |pg||
nt|poohbear: and possibly fool declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass the TO dbl of 4@d since I have my points in @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would most of us|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even 4 !@D X might cost 500|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer trying to decide if he can afford to play King here|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @d ace onside and tripleton then the @h ace rates to be in East and he can ruff 3@s in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: but doesnt want to lose to singleton Ace in East|pg||
pc|sT|nt|frankbo: x H now?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|runnerup: some carefullness needed here because @C block -but should not make --for that 3 d --maybe ..i dont know their agreements|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|andy_h: The standard lead for a trump (opening) lead is usually small because you never know if any of your big trumps can be promoted (you never know!). But otherwise if they are actually ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: useless or of equals then you can use them as suit-preference signals|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad board for my poor DK anyway - they didÂ´nt make 4 @S in OR...?|pg||

pc|dT|nt|roussol: me koupa antam |pg||

nt|hawe45:  Board 4 - Denmark playing a @D-contract at both tables...|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  (+4)|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not sure I agree with the trump lead here - If declarer had removed 3NT to 5@D then there's a slight clue that declarer has clubs as the source of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also a clue that he was worried about a suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  maybe cashing @SAK and hope for 3rd trick|pg||
nt|eleni: wd Ron due to opps' misplay|pg||
nt|panja: the mistake of not playing high card in third seat...is not uncommon amongst novices...|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: a wydaje siê, ¿e zrzutka krakowska powinna byæ ceniona w kraju nad Wis³¹|pg||

nt|runnerup: and it came so vulnerable game won -but can you avoid that lead --hard to say|pg||
nt|blum1956: a lively set ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer lucky trumps were 2-2 so he has an entry but even if East has 3 he would ruff the @c and be endplayed . Declarer would have to guess the @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: after declarer draws only 2rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer is perhaps delighted, that this contract was still made|pg||
nt|eleni: so 1 more IMP for our Czech girls|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: edo iparhei mans travihti|pg||
nt|andy_h: she* Gerben!|pg||

nt|panja: the @HT lead.....could be from KT9, QT9, T9 etc...absolutely no reason to duck...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 key cards missing, so no slam.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: Press "Refresh" button|pg||
nt|panja: B6, once again, W has a poor hand and E opens..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  right|pg||
nt|panja: and now...if N passes, will E bid further?|pg||
nt|panja: N should not pass as he know EW have a good @H fit...|pg||
nt|eleni: another misfit though|pg||
nt|panja: and if E escapes to 1@H..and W raises..it will be difficult to get in later..|pg||
nt|panja: so bidding 2@D now..is the best option|pg||
nt|runnerup: a possible slam -down ofcause but ..|pg||
nt|runnerup: i would say only @h lead let it make|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  1@C can be 2 cards, 1@H transfer walsh|pg||

nt|eleni: I am not sure how Peter bids that 2@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes you're right but a @d lead looked most strange|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam in @c |pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes, 6@D on this placement can be made but tough to bid.|pg||
mb|4C|an|cue bid|mb|p|nt|bagman: His best shot is probaly to set up the spades and then continue spades|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is even better..showing 10+ HCP, exact desription of his hand|pg||

mb|4H|an|cue bid|nt|eleni: bad hour of the day for grown ups:)|pg||
nt|galois85: it's hard to go on with 3 small clubs in north...|pg||

nt|poohbear: We saw Fisher pass a 12 count in 2nd seat vul a few hands ago. Now Schwartz opens with 12 in first seat vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Mundane 2@S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S a lucky make.. but will not get there|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S either weak NT or 3-card supp|pg||
nt|andy_h: Are they playing some sort of a swedish-club system?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and oddly Fisher only invites |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - two different hands, you see...|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems inconsistent|pg||
nt|riccho:  3@s is a very aggressive bid. I hope that N realizes that some key card asking is still appropriate|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  no they are playing natural|pg||

nt|eleni: His parents play that 2@c for both majors in such cases:) not sure about Peter though|pg||
nt|panja: now. E will not lead @H..|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect slam missing, in my opinion North was too passive|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 @c looked very much like an under bit --if you have about 10 tricks in your own hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: lots of South hands make a slam near 100%|pg||
nt|riccho:  How aggressive 3@s is, can you see, if you imagine the S Hand without the @sQ. That would be not even an opener, at least in my book|pg||
nt|eleni: let us jope Megherita will keep the bidding low|pg||
nt|riccho:  at least S is not showing the void with 5NT or so|pg||
nt|riccho:  N will be wondering now, where are the values for 3@s...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: it should only be a cue, 10+ HCP...|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet N has to find the Q@d|pg||

nt|andy_h: haha and transfer walsh is starting to become mainstream yes :)|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bagman: E is trying to kill the discard on the @DQ|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|raghavan: well begun is half done - may go 3 down|pg||
nt|riccho:  12 tricks now due to the @s10 singleton|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|basu_4139: DKQ shold be tested first,if it behaves,fine,if it doesn't,a C to the Q,SA SQ,if still it doesn't behave declarer has his option for a H fin to work n 3-3 C |pg||
nt|poohbear: It is usually right to start with an ace against gambling 3NT and here we see why|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rensph: other room reached 4@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chrisky: good morning :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps +1 -if west doent take @c ace so ..can happen |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: Bulgaria gained 5 IMPs on Bd 6 as EW OR ended up in 2@S on 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: On Bd 6 appears your way of handling the trump suit - low to the 10 appears best|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: play for @S 3-3 or the J to come down on 2nd round |pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - We all see @S breaking 3-3; East of course doesn't know. |pg||
nt|poohbear: defense had 5 top tricks and will not take them|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eleni: Good morning Chris:) welcome|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|panja: well, both Major suit finesses fail...so 4@S wasn't on..|pg||
pc|s9|nt|riccho:  decl should have overtaken the @sK and scoring another ruff. then three round of @d|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sunsamvar: so @Hk,q and @Sk to be overtaken by @SA will give the addl chance of @S( dropping with N and a ruffing fin of the J|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But West was a nice guy - he dropped a couple of overtricks...|pg||
nt|poohbear: gamble?|pg||
nt|poohbear: its not Matchpoints :)|pg||

nt|blum1956: so France chose 5@c where Hungary made 3NT on the @h lead|pg||

nt|roussol: prepei na pei passo o petros|pg||
nt|eleni: O Dinos sto anoikto domatio protimise ta 6NT (+1)|pg||
nt|smirny: but 3nt is too much i think|pg||
nt|andy_h: assuming no club ruffs looming I think the best play is a small trump from W (dummy). Obviously North would have a hard time ducking with Kx so if North plays low you stick in the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||
nt|andy_h: (I was talking about the trump play on the previous board)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D shows singleton @D..I guess|pg||
nt|eleni: a feature|pg||
nt|spenny80: but after 3 round in @s north MUST play @d |pg||
nt|runnerup: ns ofcause|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eleni: another part score hand, even for our agressive youth:)|pg||
nt|spenny80: otherwise south go squeeze|pg||

pc|d3|nt|desinka: hello everyone|pg||

nt|roussol: ola peftoun :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Desi @H|pg||
nt|desinka: may 2@D vs prec club is narural|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to start the clubs early|pg||
nt|bagman: with a trump lead there's no hope of ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might not turn out well...|pg||
nt|eleni: The Greek youngsters here, as they understand they are behind, they overbid, which is sad|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2nt usually means minors, looks like not for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: this doesnt look like ti will make  |pg||
nt|gmarco24: it is lowest + another, kibs say...|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now comes the first Ned impson board 7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: East Passed - not risking 6@Hx being pulled to f.inst 6 NT whivh may make - doesnt know pd has @SAK|pg||
nt|panja: it will have to be played well....if N plays a @S to King early...4@S is likely to fail|pg||

nt|panja: not play to @SK...|pg||

nt|panja: but GIB suggests that will fail..|pg||
nt|rodal f: N endplayed again?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome William|pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe -1 after good guess in first trick, let's see...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking was reasonable; even if west plays the nine you can still lead to the ten and try and make a club trick for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Grunke is still believing in this contract|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup: north passed -many would double so ew in 2 @s without opponents bid anything -.1nt was ..something|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blum1956: The only chance for the defense was a trump switch in the second trick|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: Ege cashes the @d to get a signal from Tofte. But the signal was crossed up|pg||
nt|poohbear: wont matter though|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer prob takes the @h ace then crosses to dummy to try and pitch the @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be quite a defense if North had Kxx in @h :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: at least against me :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry . I thought 9 card fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer will just take @h finesse |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Boards 3-6 = 21-21|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: These kinds of bidding scenarios shud be discussed by serious partnerships|pg||
nt|chrisky: 4@C 2@H and 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: I suspect there was a misunderstanding about 3@D here...|pg||
nt|eleni: now Peter has to play @d and discard his @h loser and a @c|pg||
nt|chrisky: in 3nt|pg||
nt|panja: S must have thought it was feature...so @H suit was likely to be open|pg||
nt|panja: and therefore, bid 4@S, not 3Nt|pg||
pc|d2|nt|loe48: even 2nt down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @DQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankbo: yes|pg||
nt|loe48: 2 down|pg||
nt|poohbear: Denmark bids the vul game on board 6 and takes the lead|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankbo: 2 down|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|pelu: do u have commentating in english?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eleni: too late now|pg||
nt|bagman: Now it's the matter of the overttrick|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense needs to take the diamond; otherwise it goes away|pg||
nt|bagman: A club switch is probably ok, too; declarer ruffs high and loses a trick later|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@h will be a make now. = 9 imps or so for italy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||

nt|athene: maybe south should bid 4@H over 3@D trying to show how good his hand is for hearts |pg||
nt|athene: he must think 3@H is forcing|pg||
nt|gmarco24: follow results on: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s by E (like splinter in club i think)|pg||
nt|riccho:  Double ca 1@s is interesting (single @s!!)|pg||
nt|riccho:  single @h I meant...|pg||

nt|famus: great event this--and an opportunity for youngsters to learn|pg||
nt|andy_h: It seems like the Swede counterpart in the other room had a hard time on Board 7 with the trump play. Rather than guessing trumps the declarer tried to strip the hand by ruffing a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: heart csahing @SA and playing on clubs, but when North was able to ruff the 3rd club with the @SK declarer had to guess the diamonds - had he guessed wrong it would have resulted ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: in 9 tricks but infact came out with one overtrick ;)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  unlikely to find @C position due to "restricted choice"|pg||
nt|smirny: well expensive board...probably a 26IMPS guess|pg||
nt|smirny: but after weak in D (2@C)|pg||
nt|smirny: you can find it|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  1@H 6@D ... why not 3@C|pg||

pc|c3|nt|andy_h: Observe the disparity between the 2@C (weak diamond bids) in this board and on board 5|pg||

pc|c2|nt|spenny80: a psichic cue?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for Leo fo find best lead.|pg||
nt|poohbear: the J of @cs gave East a lot of information. Was better to play the King|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eleni: It all depends on his inspiration for the @d|pg||
nt|bagman: The odds probably favour the clubs to run (by a slight margin)|pg||
nt|bagman: My guess is that E plays a diamond to the ace now|pg||
nt|bagman: it is the best combination of possibilities|pg||
nt|bagman: clubs running or diamond queen doubleton|pg||

pc|d5|nt|Gerben42:  then Orth cn count the hand|pg||
nt|smirny: well maybe S would bid 5D with Stiff @C|pg||

nt|panja: but now, when E exits with a trump, N will be endplayed..so the guess is eliminated|pg||

nt|blum1956: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|runnerup: just my guess..here bidding in this|pg||
nt|blum1956: If East opens 1@d Weat will hardly pass|pg||
nt|blum1956: West|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok-west is not passsing so north has a teasing to bid 2 @d if possible|pg||
nt|rensph: welcome David :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx    hi all|pg||
nt|ady: looks a part score hand   |pg||
nt|rensph: declarer in the other room will be making 5@D on bd 9, by ruffing a heart and giving up on the double @D finesse. More imps to Croatia|pg||
nt|ady: good lay for n/s    but think only 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead was from S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: S for shure ment it as a good lift in @S, might there deal. Support X seems better by the long term.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see what Fisher does opposite a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|poohbear: ege might bid. I wouldnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: A Spade game for EW |pg||
nt|bagman: Declearer might have had some table feel about the clubs (e.g. NS might be notorious signallers)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  better :) thanks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ! 6 was led by N, W playing.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H 6|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eleni: 1NT is played now in the open room by N|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i agree|pg||
nt|spenny80: at board 6 south found killer lead but after he forgot to return trump to defeat|pg||
nt|galois85: dbl I think shows 4 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s is 500 -so good in case 4 @h makes,but there is a lot of play there|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: on board 10|pg||
nt|roussol: difficult to bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: 5@d MAKING|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - 4@H doesn't I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in practice 4@H too|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a safe 4@s contract for E-W|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 4@S on 2 of three things: spade break and 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit new here. 2/1 by bought pairs?|pg||
nt|rensph: Might make 10 if you manage to ruff 2 hearts in dummy and set up the club trick, but defense might force in @D|pg||
nt|eleni: You mean in open room:):) right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep, sorry.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: as East may not lead or switch to @C in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11 on NS so ....|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|spenny80: for italy a sort of 2/1 i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: now|pg||
nt|blum1956: some pairs have an agreement that bidding the responder's suit is natural but this is rarely applicable to the opener's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 1Nt will not make...|pg||
nt|runnerup: many nowadays -and ns now in problems|pg||
nt|riccho:  If thereÂ´s a hand where you shouls pass the 3@h bid: there it is :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: Antway N are to reopen now.|pg||
nt|spenny80: but for germany i don't know. Could be also polish? (the meaning of 1@d is?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Anyway|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eleni: just if one of the 2 finesses work, they are home|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: If switch to @C will set up suit|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Q@d lead must be ducked|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|desinka: intresting board|pg||
nt|desinka: not easy to get sigle K@C if u pkay 6@c|pg||
nt|desinka: play|pg||
nt|famus: with a @H cue might go a notch higher|pg||
nt|ady: meantime  e/w have bought the contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  modern approach is to bid 1NT even with subminimum hands. Goal is to silence the bidding for NS. |pg||
nt|riccho:  In this hand however it led only to an unsuccessful contract|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bagman: with spades breaking and @HK onside the contract makes (there are some additional chances in case 2 of the three things are not working)|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course if @s are not Jxxx in N's hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|spenny80: for me 2@c is a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: true Carl and the @S loser goes away|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C would have been better...but then, EW might have found their 2@H spot...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u there|pg||
nt|runnerup: no double -but @c lead and some hundreds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh must be careful|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a bad contract after all - near down one|pg||
nt|rensph: trumps breaking 4-1 means declarer isn't home yet|pg||
nt|rensph: other room has reached the same contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: brb|pg||
nt|rodal f: The polich club|pg||
nt|spenny80: but likely the final contract is ok for italy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bagman: On this lead, declarer cannot afford to duck a spade|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Or now might only 8|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|famus: to b honest --50% slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wd |pg||
pc|d3|nt|Gerben42:  nicely bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
nt|runnerup: some possibilities to miss tricks in defence but very unlikely|pg||
nt|runnerup: @c lead is orderd in these secvenses..but didnt came|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|raghavan: Nothing much to do here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|famus: on a good day it wud b bid and made|pg||
nt|frankbo: Danmark did make 4S on B), 11 imp|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eleni: they could afford a 3@c contract anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankbo: B9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Gerben42:  and there is the point that we dont know if N has successfully hidden his @S spots|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rensph: can now give S a @D ruff but that will give declarer more control over the trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: N a bit lucky|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzjk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: in general, if you have a bad long suit, better to play in the suit..|pg||
nt|panja: but with a good long minor....Nt might be a good idea|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes hasan you said 50% - Spade K can be under SA and so makes|pg||
nt|rensph: @H ruff I mean|pg||
nt|rensph: spade now?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|runnerup: spades and still 200 at least|pg||
nt|riccho:  In defense most of the time the problem is to decide whether you play an acitve or a passive defense. Here N chose the active one and would have better chosen the passive line|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|nt|athene: no need to lead to the @DK first round of the suit|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|chrisky: -3|pg||
nt|eleni: only it wasn't a "good" long minor:)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: , otherwise would make.|pg||
nt|riccho:  yepp|pg||

nt|riccho:  7@s or 7@d here are on. |pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam hand for EW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: we see another case here...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|desinka: very intresting board |pg||
nt|desinka: and hard bidding and defance|pg||
nt|famus: @h slam coming up for the Hungarian girls|pg||
nt|panja: S has a good long minor this time|pg||
nt|panja: and North has the missing honour in that..so 3Nt will be easy|pg||
nt|galois85: 4@s on ns... hand useful for a coffee!|pg||
nt|ady: hcp  20-20    best fit  hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: little can me made|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: close to 6NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eleni: this might worth  an IMP if 4@s+1 are made in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: brb some kids.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot for Germany?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|famus: 3@h|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again you see here a slam in Hearts possibly bid by NS |pg||
nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
nt|runnerup: a game -no slam -should be avoided -here|pg||
nt|rensph: 2@S in EW fails on a number of ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  I dont like the 2@h bid. shape misdescription is generally not a good idea in hands with slam potential|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had E bid 2@D and then @H, it was possible. Lets see.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|desinka: 4@H?|pg||
nt|eleni: den xero poios apo tous 2 milaei agglika|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||
nt|athene: aces and shape always beat a bunch of kings and queens and jacks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y.|pg||
nt|spenny80: do you open with north cards? me not|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, you are right =) I'd better take my coffee before! lol |pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess Ege didnt want to dbl 4@d in case that encouraged his partner to save|pg||
nt|eleni: depends on the system the Czech girls use|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: I think always 4@s-1... unless Rubino continues with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|runnerup: i down use coffee breaks when 4 optinal loosers|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now a slam has chances as the @h lead from West is tempting|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to have firm agreements in that spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: so..]|pg||
nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||
nt|ady: down 2 around 2  if they find the club ruffs|pg||
nt|rensph: @DQ overtaken, returning a club.... looks like down 2?|pg||
nt|riccho:  filigrane|pg||
pc|d7|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Whaever u say: THe bidding by E doesnt look like a describing auction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree.|pg||
nt|eleni: right Richard|pg||
nt|riccho:  Its sheer luck that 7@s is not an obvious contract |pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||
nt|panja: let us say CJ goes to @CQ..|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Lina|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4@h is ok, but 5@c passed is excellent save  :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: major and club switch best |pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: S denies Club control |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|desinka: they may beat the contract|pg||
nt|desinka: but it is not easy |pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR also.E bid 2@D and then @H but @S the contract.|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@s is a terribly contract and would have failed if the @s are not playable for zero loser. |pg||
nt|riccho:  swo its a 5 or 7 Hand in @s|pg||
nt|riccho:  so...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panja: N must simply cash his 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double on the strength of the singleton diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S 3/3, lucky contract.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||
nt|bagman: Makes life easier in 3@H but would have killed 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and his ace in the side suit|pg||
nt|ady: now making|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: landed in slam|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EVERYONE--its boys here--thnks-Sisito--the VG operator corrected me--pardon me for this EVERYONE--thnks Sisito|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i wouldn't have thought of 6@D|pg||
nt|smirny: well it is hard to bid S hand|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we cannot judge unless we know what exacly 3@S showed|pg||
nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|famus: 4@S rkc-5@hs showed 2+Q|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can take one diamond ruff and then set up the clubs losing one in each|pg||
nt|eleni: As you all know, John Oikonomopoulos is the son of Ghionis+Helena sp:) As we say in Greek "the apple falls under the apple tree" :)|pg||
nt|panja: on a bad day...@CJ could be from @CJx..|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lead direction, not invite to defence...|pg||
nt|rodal f: N will miss the @D after thid start|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes @c lead needed in slam -right |pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: one problem is, he is not on lead, so if his partner has the unsupported @DA he might well not get his ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blum1956: no thriller for us but good bridge after all|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|eleni: Now that Mama-Lina is here I hope Peter will have better guesses:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|famus: srtraight forward play--ought to be--check @hs--ending in dummy--then run the @c9--|pg||
nt|rodal f: *this|pg||
pc|s9|nt|raghavan: now problem|pg||
nt|blum1956: no lead problem against 4@s  - a heart is certainly right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sunsamvar: maybe @Ck at trick 2 to cater for singleton Queen|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|sunsamvar: if A is singleton anyway 2 trick have to be given|pg||
nt|roussol: ty eleni i hope too:)|pg||
nt|ady: welcome good fortune for Netherlands|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkey: made 9 - well done|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes must be excl. since she denied @C control|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roussol: claim|pg||
pc|d3|mc|13|nt|sunsamvar: wlc back Carl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or pd thinks it is @CQ|pg||
nt|smirny: other table: 1S - 2C - 2D - 4S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S is a bit sudden too|pg||

nt|eleni: Plus the general site for our Young Bridge players. An excellent organization by EBF and the Bulgarian Federation!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: max a partial for NS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: good morning Mama-Helena:) Same thing goes for you:) Giannakis might make correct guesses now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: On Bd 10 Netherlands picked up 13 IMPs - West bid 5@D after 3@H by N; in this room West Passed|pg||
nt|rensph: yes, perhaps N should've ducked but partner didn't go for a club ruff so singleton could seem unlikely|pg||
mb|1N|nt|smirny: well with xxx in @S and stiff @D i think i would bid 4S too; IF  2@C have already been GF|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think the other table is going off in 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think sudden jump to 4@S denies control in @H and @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  just @S and @C, partner|pg||
nt|chrisky: ns make 2@D and ew 2@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: lets see if they can bid it|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: also with strip squeeze|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@h must take the @s after 2rounds @d and @s by W|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h shows 4 card support and a weak hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: If Fisher bids 4@c and hears a 4@d Q bid he cn just bid slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how he handles it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|riccho:  good bidding would have been: 1@s - 2@d - 3@c - 3@h (natural) - 4@d (trump suit) - 4@h (cue) - 4@s  (cue) - 4NT (RKCB) - 5@d (1kc = @sA) - 7@d |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sunsamvar: The Dutch boys in the Open reached the good 5@D contract on bd 10|pg||
nt|neobas: Looks like a solid 6@C here|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@C  if seeing all the cards   meantime 5@C best|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: well played for 6H|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt the most save one but 4 @s comes|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|neobas: Though the fit will have to be found at the four-level|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting.|pg||
nt|runnerup: guessing well here+ wellplaced cards lets 4 @h to be made |pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 heart is par contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes the pass was a bit timid... maybe the 1@D opening did not promise @Ds|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  hmm other table didnt make 4@S... |pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s aggressive but he makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -but 4 makes|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, I guess 4@s!-2 is a good defense...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   shortage  agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: dont think west will do anything with such a poor opening  and over half the strength opposite the shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||
nt|helena sp:  good mornig to you all, good luck to our kids|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 1nt?|pg||
nt|rensph: given the EW hands 6@C seems like a reasonable contract, but unlikely to be made. Or reached.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: excellent and lets claim:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  if partner has only 1Kc but reverse values (3@c), 7@d should be a big contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, cut this and deal a goulash|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play J@S    playing north for 10X to make 12 tricks    unlikely play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rensph: With the @H finesse in reserve you can first see if the @SQ drops|pg||
nt|rensph: in this case both fail, but more than 50%|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont see why Schwartz didnt Q bid|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do u agree with the lead here Carl ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hasan tell me why Braun did not bid his 4 cd H?|pg||
nt|roussol: 1@h is made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H for NS is making, but outbid in both rooms.|pg||
nt|eleni: now a @h lead to the weakness of the dummy would be great|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sunsamvar: i wd try a @H|pg||
nt|bagman: in 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: so par looks like 4 @s x-2|pg||
nt|galois85: Actually I don't understand the first pass of di franco, maybe scared by a 2@d of his partner?|pg||
nt|raghavan: clubs are in good position for 4 H |pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: How could he assume 1D to be 5 cards|pg||

nt|famus: this cud b a swing only hope @s fin NOW|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|sharkey: the Vul bonus of 500 looming at IMPs - so he probably was at the 37% chance for success level :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lead has given the contract away|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the defence want to try to cut declarer's communications whilst the diamonds are blocked|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eleni: Amazing youngsters:):)|pg||
nt|roussol: íá êüøåé ìéá ðßêá êáé Ýâãáëå 5|pg||
nt|roussol: ruff one spade|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bagman: here declarer cashes his tricks and counts them in the end|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42:  otherwise 6@S 2@C 1 ruff and @DK|pg||
nt|galois85: would somebody bid dbl in E? (I do)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: there might be 12 or 13|pg||
nt|athene: say, by returning a club now :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: E needs to keep the hearts and give up the clubs|pg||
nt|roussol: 2@d cannot be found so 2@s -1 doesn't seem a disaster|pg||
nt|runnerup: after @s lead rest is easy--without that lead you have to quess later and that is more difficult -start card is normally uder Q -not from ace|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: Next.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so the rule is when vul dont balance.:)|pg||
nt|eleni: ooops|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|riccho:  better to play @h on to shorten the dummy|pg||
nt|eleni: well, balance, with some values:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: on a @H lead he had to locate the @Dj|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: maybe a shade worse with north in the bidding?|pg||
nt|eleni: too many losers|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud lead @H - dont like the @S lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or maybe he cud endplay East even on a @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D suit behaves as well|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W are in 1NT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|raghavan: yes he has done it |pg||
pc|sA|nt|famus: i think this was a forcing chk back--or nmf--dunno--if forcing then 3@ds shows 5 cards|pg||
nt|athene: south could have ducked that second spade too, so he has an entry to his fourth spade (declarer can't have four in hand as he didn't raise 1@S)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Ellerbeck is not following that idea|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: or - cud North's @H 8 come into play after @C lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW better not press by there sac.|pg||
nt|spenny80: here difficult don.t bid slam, defeat by ruff in @h|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    spades for e/w|pg||
nt|rensph: picked up a few imps on board 11|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 Spade loser in H contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: be|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has its merits over 4 @h but 5 must be too much|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5h |pg||
nt|raghavan: since voluntary bid of 4h shows min 3 cds|pg||
nt|ady: would not overcall|pg||
nt|rensph: 6-4 can lead to problems showing your hand with either bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says not @CQxx or better, and only 2 controls|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c I don.to know, maybe short|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3!X short or que SiSi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes carl|pg||
nt|famus: might get his !q or 10|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult hand for Peter, let us hope he counts it out really well, as he usually does|pg||
nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C sorry|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d clear splinter, but for me this isn't the hand to do a splinter in south|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT limit raise or better in @s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: North decided to defend|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but cant blame North for not competing|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  thought W was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT is nice|pg||
pc|h7|nt|famus: @s-@h-@d shud b the order|pg||
nt|roussol: ducking 2ice|pg||
nt|chrisky: -1 is ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not suit N to well|pg||
nt|runnerup: seaching for slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: wint pass 5D ???|pg||
nt|rensph: E showing minimum with spades.. Seems reasonable :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||
nt|loe48: so im not surprised if hey bid 4s|pg||
nt|raghavan: wont pass 5D|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 3@C = ask for void/singelton|pg||
nt|spenny80: if you bid splinter and after a negativ bid you ask aces, then you didn't do a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: has led to a good spot   with some excellent cards opposite  and still not getting to high|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||
nt|athene: yes sorry 2@D might be 0-3 controls, not specifically 2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Tks:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH???|pg||
nt|runnerup: now -do west have a @s cont..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: he can't he would've bid 4nt instead of 5@c|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gmarco24: and i ma sleeping  :) thought it's natural sequence  :D|pg||
nt|gmarco24: sry all|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 2@C is 15+ with clubs, polish club sequence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roussol: well done|pg||
nt|desinka: @D lead I guess|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to find the lead at E|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4 top tricks for denmark|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|spenny80: after sgl @c in north and sgl @d in south, @h lead is possible now|pg||
nt|spenny80: no easy|pg||
nt|spenny80: good 4@h in closed room, after 1@d open better minor (easier now)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gmarco24: how would you bid as natural William?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like to follow more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|galois85: but  1nt... difficult singl in spades...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|eleni: yes 12 are a lay down, inspirational L and J@h play gives the overtrick:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bagman: A good lead|pg||
nt|eleni: That was a safe lead by S|pg||
nt|bagman: (much better than @HA)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  he would if @SA would also be in N|pg||
nt|rensph: can play 3 rounds of clubs to avoid the @S guess|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|poohbear: declarer will strip the hand and hope for a singleton @h honor|pg||

nt|chrisky: 5 @H is better|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: ouch...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6@C requires @H break or honour doubleton and a trump break|pg||

nt|runnerup: contract in wrong hand so can go down if @s switch come soon ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@S by N now may ask for @S hold?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes hasn showing extra values|pg||
nt|alati: gia sas|pg||
nt|eleni: Welcome Alec:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting choice; I would be more inclined to bid 2N unless that has some conventional meaning|pg||
nt|loe48: also here we may get a swingboard as it is fight to get the final call|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -2 down in practice now|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 3@s|pg||
nt|smirny: not sure if 3C is for D in their system|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what is 1NT (2m majors) 4@S? :)|pg||
nt|smirny: rumpelsohl?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  okay to play say some kibs - boring |pg||
nt|ady: 6@C at best on a finesse   but could go down immediately with A@H and a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@d may fail by 1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sunsamvar: yes|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not now:)|pg||
nt|eleni: what a lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|famus: 4@cs??|pg||
nt|famus: difficult now--but has v good @cs|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would bid 4D |pg||
nt|famus: why?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|raghavan: showing unbalanced hand 1453|pg||
nt|bagman: Good stop here; in practice declarer would go down in 6  by taking the club finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: wlc Alex|pg||
nt|alati: me tin idia sintagi me ti dianomi 12 , prosdokw na paroume akoma 13 impakia |pg||
nt|loe48: Morrison has a support x to show 3h..and now a re x that often also show diamond or comp hps or distribution|pg||
nt|raghavan: now dropping DK alone matters - spade loser will go in Clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5NT is a dangerous bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you arent even sure yourself, how can partner be|pg||
nt|henryb:  With @h 4-4 this is not a challenging hand; If @h were 5-3 declarer would have to find the @cQ|pg||
nt|loe48: and it is was a good call as we see the lay of cards are kind with this lead|pg||
nt|loe48: this gives money in the bank|pg||
nt|eleni: Passive leads are usually made by Europeans..... and they give away so many tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: @c quess may be needed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42:  still avoided the grand|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i must leave now. thank you all and have a nice day|pg||
nt|athene: ok thanks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sunsamvar: if South had passed they might hv got the @S fit early and got to 6@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S suit lost...|pg||
nt|eleni: a helpful lead for W|pg||
nt|blum1956: even this may not help|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S was best lead. We have seen all cards.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 @h misslead easts defende|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Yes - not everone agrees South's hand is an opener - esp 1@D which may not even show @D...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roussol: club best lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: North decided to master mind this hand and drove to slam despite warnings|pg||
nt|roussol: bliahhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead would given declarer more to think about|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|alati: eftixws gia mas oi @s einai 4-2 kai i @cQ ektos|pg||
nt|rensph: Can hardly blame S for leading a diamond.... wouldn't give leading a spade into declarer's suit much thought|pg||
nt|eleni: now too late for mourning|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  @h 4-3 I meant|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|chrisky: for the overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: spade switch|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rensph: 6 imps to Netherlands.....  3@D by NS on board 13|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 or 5 imps.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eleni: J@c would be the best return from Peter now|pg||
nt|roussol: yes but no interest|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bagman: That probably means that Greece won 13 IMPs on 12 when the Finns went down on a good slam which was missed here|pg||
nt|eleni: oh dear what a discard!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|famus: has already shown @s shortage-whn he bid 3@cs--but Rusch knows that his pd's @c holding is Qhi at best--so he cant provoke and signed of in 3!NT|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|eleni: they can afford it Rachid, yet still it's sad:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  For those of you who count tricks, declarer had a simples route to 9 tricks: drive out the @sA|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|blum1956: This is another time when South bids NT holding a Axx guard in the opponent's suit. This time NS suffer the consequences. Double by South and 1NT by North would have put NS in a ...|pg||
nt|blum1956: much better position|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment or match. Thanks all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: NT|pg||
nt|roussol: NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  It may be hard for N-S to find their diamond suit after N opens 1@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u have balanced at last B Fabio?|pg||
nt|ady: 24 hcp w/w    thin 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: at different vulnerability east might get cute|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S, say|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: 6D top contrackt here|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S is the obvious bid, but of course 7 count be there very easily|pg||
nt|athene: 7 could be there sorry|pg||
nt|athene: he might try 6@D intending to correct the likely 6@H to 6@S|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|eleni: AND tournament of the Young girls Competition!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: tx Carl|pg||
nt|spenny80: probably not|pg||
nt|ady: looks as though they have 6 tricks in the minors   2 hearts and 1 spade|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chrisky: best lead for def|pg||
nt|roussol: :( yes|pg||
nt|roussol: but is he goes from @h he can make 2@h 2@s 2@c 1@d|pg||
nt|roussol: if|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and to the specs for watching|pg||
nt|henryb:  But if E opens, less so. I do not think East should open|pg||
nt|loe48: will we hear 4s and 5d|pg||
nt|athene: that sort of gets some way to showing what he has - will partner bid 7 on the strength of @CA @HAK?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Tofte has normal dbl and South is stuck. Prob should bid a fast 2@s :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankbo: Ireland did bidd 6D against Noray|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: he must abandon @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hello all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Pierre|pg||
nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||
nt|galois85: I totally don't like opening 1nt with 5-4-2-2, but just my opinion|pg||
nt|runnerup: this makes and also 3 @h -but better not bid more|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eleni: 2@s in the open room are been played now|pg||
nt|eleni: same as here|pg||
nt|frankbo: Norway|pg||
nt|raghavan: I am for bidding 1S in 1st position when partner is yet to bid|pg||
nt|rensph: first a problem for N.... what to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: whenever defense plays @h the contract falls|pg||
nt|ady: north spades  look good enough  with 2 outside entries|pg||
nt|rensph: spade doesn't seem attractive without intermediates|pg||
nt|ady: as they fall the 87 good enough|pg||
nt|poohbear: Schwartz likes that spot!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Might come to 7 tricks, good against 140/170|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: and to the organisers and BBO for bringing us this broadcast|pg||
nt|raghavan: Board 14 EW bid 4S and went down 1 so 3 more imps to Hungary youths|pg||
nt|athene: :(|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now u see the problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is the second hand in this match where one side has played with 6 trumps against a 6-1 break|pg||
nt|poohbear: board 4 in the other room|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sunsamvar: oops. Sry 20 boards..|pg||
nt|famus: 6@hs--as the cards lie|pg||
nt|raghavan: Othe room Bd 15 stopped in 4NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: difficult to bid 6H here|pg||
nt|famus: ya--not suggesting that at all|pg||
nt|roussol: he heard me:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of 1st half of the match, ty all|pg||
nt|eleni:  O@h°'¨@h¨'°@h O @h°'¨@h¨'°@hO  We thank you all for been with us on BBO. we are frategul for our super operators, EBL, Bulgarian Federation and most of all BBO and Roland Wald for ...|pg||
nt|eleni: the chance we had to watch our young boys and girls play!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: maybe south should have bid the boring 6@S and argued it out afterwards|pg||
nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||
nt|rodal f: It often use to be right when NS are vul and EW not|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead makes difficulties |pg||
nt|ady: now the Queen|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chmitty: true : you have to discuss in depth what would 5NT mean as compared to 6@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: They should  be playing 2S|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so thanks was a bit premature|pg||
nt|raghavan: between them NS have 14 losers |pg||
nt|famus: i think he was thinking right about the final entry for running @ds if the @D fin fails or even if it works--@Sa was the right play|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time both aces @h and @c right but you surely dont want to squese table by taking @d at once|pg||
nt|blum1956: well, dummy discards two spades, three clubs and one heart. Whatever declarer then leads he is home |pg||
nt|eleni: grateful|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|galois85: switch diamonds, then -1 |pg||
nt|ady: low spade lead would have failed in this case|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eleni: the maych is tight Pekka, so no prognosis there:) The kids are aggressive at times and scared also at times:) So things go up and down:)|pg||
nt|eleni: the match:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Risk a bit bit take in also|pg||
pc|s9|nt|runnerup: and q @h also rigth so in practice you make this|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|famus: he shud chk @d now|pg||
nt|athene: i think north is more to blame here|pg||
nt|athene: with no spade honour AND no @HK|pg||
nt|athene: bidding the grand was just a guess|pg||
nt|chmitty: @d stiff is also kind of a surprise. South may hold AKQxxx xx Ax Qxx|pg||
nt|chmitty: @d void sorry|pg||
nt|chmitty: but I agree with you William : North is more to blama|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roussol: spde now|pg||
nt|runnerup: this goes down with ruff now -and even without that looks too hard to make|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet still the 2nd segment for the girls on|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sharkey: :) - a good thing can't be said to often Sunil|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1S-1Nt-2 C -2S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: now wud b cursing himself for not playing the !10--which i cant understand why not?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rensph: heart returnsetting up declarer's tricks... could he still have made on a club return?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|poohbear: Fisher might suspect what is going on and not pitch any @hs|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|nt|spenny80: here there is a big error in south: how can you make 3Nt with south cards? what do you need by north?|pg||
