pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||

nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||

nt|ahri:  i imagine french staying calm|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: a little nervous in french team|pg||
nt|mamos: France gained 3 imps on Board 5 when not only did Greek NS not bid Slam  they defended 4@Sx and only scored 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 6h, a decent contract, needing 3-2 hearts, but not here with a bad break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||

nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
