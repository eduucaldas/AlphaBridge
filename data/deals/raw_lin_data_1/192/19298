nt|richie: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|raghavan: What  has happened?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4s in the open room as well...so quiet start to a decisive match :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||

nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||

nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we saw, NL use invitation jacoby.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here we see EW plays the new swedish club|pg||

nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
nt|bebechira: they are playing in 2d :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankbo: :)|pg||

nt|bebechira: Sweden in 3nt in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the closed W in 2nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier for our West in Diamonds..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Marion:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  Top on its ways to France (N/S)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gronkvist:  And now is the point of this deal made or not made|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eleni: but the contract is makeable, as the @h finess works:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  WAS on tiÂ´s way...|pg||
nt|mrdct: she has a beer card too|pg||
nt|richie: 3x@h now and exit a low club will work (double dummy) hard to see with closed cards|pg||
nt|richie: not low club but 7 or 8|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table I think Rosaline Barendregt had to escape from 1@sX, it's usually bloody when opps pass a TO dbl on the 1 level, but not sure if 2@hX is such a big party|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  But still -100 should be good for N/S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|richie: straight forward line will succeed here, taking 1 rounds of trump and ruff 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||

mb|d|nt|bebechira: 5d in the open room so flat brd to start with|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h for NS...and 5d save for 3 imps for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||

mb|p|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead. not sure i would have led the same but Axxx usually isnt so attractive to lead from either|pg||

pc|dK|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 2d=good raise|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
nt|raghavan: yES OTHER ROOM MADE ot TOO|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden need a 21-9 to capture the silver|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@C? strong2? seems unlikely|pg||
pc|d4|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Dbl here shows atleast same strengh as 1 NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With no chnace to reach the dummy this will go down|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mam ma³¹ satysfakcjê, ¿e pierwsze dwa rozdania w turnieju bryd¿a sportowego Asia rozegra³a przeciwko mnie przed 12 laty|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 loser Hand so upgraded to 2C|pg||
nt|doks: 3NT very good in closed room, only 9 triks in 4@H withot defencive help|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: I dislike this strong2 2@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome back|pg||
nt|richie: rehi everyone|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Ofc W could be stronger also :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: 5 D is likely to make |pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow...this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|iceblue: @S mb double it|pg||
nt|raghavan: IN THIS TABLE SWEDEN GIVES BACK WHAT IT GOT IN DEAL1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
nt|iceblue: S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||
nt|loe48: jepp|pg||

nt|bcmandal: 4h better no?|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|d6|nt|eleni: good play by Judith:)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, 5@h is only made when you have no heart loosers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ntmon: key play was a club to K in case E has less than 4 hearts |pg||
nt|eleni: she has to keep it up cross-ruffing though |pg||

nt|eleni: Minko?|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  So no misdefence  here|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||
nt|richie: depends if Magdalena Ticha decides to bid 2@c for majors, then it must be easy for east to bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 4 imps for the Dutch girls|pg||
nt|richie: 6@s here in south|pg||

nt|richie: enjoy your meal :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use it my self as well, but only with a single honor A or K. Never with the Q or less|pg||
mb|2C|nt|frankbo: fikk hjem 4S i åpent på første spillet|pg||
nt|uttam: guess he will play 4s|pg||
nt|eleni: those were their tricks, either way, with or without a ruff|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@D multi here, 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|bebechira: so the Dutch girls draw the first blood|pg||
nt|bebechira: just came home...from dinner|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S makeable on a good trump guess|pg||
nt|richie: 2@hX is also profitable :)|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
nt|richie: a very thin 2@d overcall here by east in these vulnerabilities|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
nt|doks: here probably NT partscore for NS, but can made game on perfect guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i can see the dutch girls lost 11 on 17|pg||
nt|iceblue: puppet 3@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3Nt better|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida thought for a while and passed 4d |pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood in the 2nd set goes to the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: N probably upgraded his hand to 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
nt|richie: Dutch a bit safer now for the silver medal and sweden has to watch out not to loose bronze to France, every IMP can make a different between medal / no medal or the colour of it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|doks: good passive lead|pg||
nt|bcmandal: can he makes it?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re:)|pg||
nt|richie: we are back- apparently some conn problems in Albena|pg||
pc|h5|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a normal lead  but @s lead would be the best |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
nt|bebechira: France 2 vps behind at the moment|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is great Youngsters are in Bridge in Europe|pg||
nt|bcmandal: now c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|richie: I am surprised a bit by the 4@s bid by Magdalena Ticha, 4@h would be more descriptive - she usually bids it with these hands|pg||
nt|doks: not easy, but @D are right suit to start|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||
nt|eleni: nowhere to discard the losing @h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Tony Wilkinson|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||

nt|oosb: Ah ! Hi |pg||
nt|gio 89: should make just 10 now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: most probably -2 if she is not going after the hearts|pg||
nt|bcmandal: had he played k?|pg||
nt|doks: @H are blocked now, can be hard|pg||
pc|h2|nt|richie: maybe she hoped that opps would dbl 4@s or overbid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Next|pg||
nt|ntmon: if doesn't work, result will be duplicated at other room|pg||

nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Mr Gronkvist is biased for obvious reasons, so you need to cheer for Israel, Andy :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bebechira: East in 2s in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes upto 3 Spades possible- |pg||
nt|richie: 2NT - 3@c // 3NT - 4NT // pass is my guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the destiny of this hand|pg||
mb|d!|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H and @S home so a nice sac at 5@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, rah rah|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||

nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||

mb|p|nt|richie: puppet stayman auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
nt|andyv:  with W on lead, this can't be touched as E has no entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an attractive suit to lead from|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will at least stop any chances for overtricks|pg||

pc|c3|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||

nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would not pass 3nt :(|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid taking the conservative approach with 11 and 4333 - 3NT won't cause inevitable problems|pg||
pc|c2|nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||

nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||

nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher was unable to read @S8|pg||
nt|bcmandal: dbl then jump raise should w pass?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess we are|pg||
pc|s5|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
pc|sK|nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He thought it was from shortage|pg||
nt|andyv:  who needs to read?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It looks silly to duck, but if West had 8x and @CA it was necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it is no error, just an unfortunate guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you congratulate W on a great lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Their lead is 1,3,5  and 2/4 through decl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andy, I think the 8 is more likely to be from 85 than from AQ85|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I honestly don't think that Fisher did anything wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may convince me Roland, but that would also assume that W had the A of @c and decided to lead a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now Mike is thinking could Lothan really duck from Kxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for the defense, W can actually shift here and have time to correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an unreasonable lead from a doubleton once dummy did not stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is a good chance that partner has long spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|doks: 1@S is free bid, so 3@S must be invitational, then W have minimum|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
nt|richie: both north players bid 4NT, taking the initiative|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||
nt|richie: south obviously is looking for the @d cue|pg||

nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||

nt|frankbo: det var et fix utspill men lars skl vel ofre kn der|pg||
nt|spenny80: after 2 double i this it is enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: great match here...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops in wrong room,   cu later |pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 dow is no down here -100 Open room+110 for making 2S evens out|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lead of @s would have gained 2 imps even if Fisher had played the K@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may look silly from a spectator's vantage point, but the players don't have the hand records|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a peculiar line of play, but Margherita is "home" with her contract:)|pg||
nt|richie: what's wrong about this room?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eleni: and no swingsin the last 3 boards|pg||
nt|marionmi:  3N by EW here the most likely contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need to be an expert to go down (if that makes sense)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol...I tell that to my partners all the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Privat, sry|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H i anmarsj?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forsiktig mann.|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT by west final contract?|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably scheduled by Roland in the open room|pg||
mb|1N!|an|!ss|nt|bebechira: South in 3nt in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hva melder man naa hvis 3d er krav|pg||
nt|rodal f: And what now?|pg||
nt|loe48: i expect to see nice numbers in red/white and blue colors soon|pg||
nt|uttam: 3nt has no chance|pg||
nt|ntmon: X might warn NS not to be over-optimistic|pg||
nt|josj: especially S...|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW might get to 4@h here - but should stop in partscore|pg||
nt|mrdct: agree|pg||
nt|bebechira: an she is helping there now :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d is 12-14 bal w 3@h|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!c3+|nt|frankbo: s sp eller 3 hj|pg||
nt|richie: maybe 1NTX |pg||
nt|bebechira: dbl=3 cards in hearts i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: noen bruker ikke krav paa meldinger som dette|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, cant say I much like the opening bid|pg||
nt|josj: XX is support|pg||
nt|ntmon: Judith is optimitic in general? :)|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board... NS will compete in diamonds, EW in @c, maybe even to 4th level|pg||
nt|rodal f: With -1 by a @H lead?|pg||
nt|doks: must be same outcome, 7card @S opposit opening bid|pg||
mb|2D!|an|fourth suit|nt|josj: she has such a nice hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: S will not pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: I may have competed to 2@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5c in the closed by W|pg||
nt|richie: or even 5, west has a strong hand (knowing partner is short in spades)|pg||
nt|richie: they play TO dbls... otherwise West could have X-ed, maybe east can X this?|pg||
mb|2S|an|!s2|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
nt|bebechira: clubs break nicely for Jamilla so she will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be a 1 imp swing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||
nt|josj: if 1@S already shows 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||
nt|richie: south needs to lead a heart, will she again find it?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  might lead a diamond |pg||
nt|bebechira: king of spades is nicely placed :)|pg||
mb|3S|an|forcing|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
nt|richie: horrible distribution for Claire (north), 3 down is the expected result|pg||
nt|marionmi:  JT9 looks attractive|pg||
nt|richie: I guess so, @d lead seems natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||
nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
nt|rodal f: A better color so natural lead.|pg||
nt|bebechira: and West bid 1spade|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s seems normal, needs some careful declarerplay|pg||
nt|richie: @s leads helps fortunately, now declarer has time to finesse twice in diamonds and also to ruff a @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is good that she is taking her time...important board|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Lothan is an expert|pg||
mb|4S|nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity East has not overtaken D|pg||
nt|bebechira: big mistake|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|richie: now Sigrid (east) has time to establish her clubs - won't take too long|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||
nt|richie: lol really? :) I was playing in Oz for one year but have a completely different experience :) :) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: if reversed vulnerability i will think harder :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: did you play in Sydney or Melbourne.... i will guess Sydney|pg||
nt|raghavan: now OTs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: now much easy|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we have a draw at the moment...6nt failed in the open room |pg||
pc|c5|pc|hQ|nt|richie: near Melbourne|pg||

nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||

pc|cK|nt|loe48: nettet mitt er litt ustabilt ennaa her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Marianne Harding kom med et input. Burde 3@D være stenberg/ jacoby? Avtalebasert tror jeg.|pg||
nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... where?|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier rather|pg||
pc|c3|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||
nt|josj: even|pg||
nt|eleni: had Rosaline passed after the 2@h by Flavia, things would have been easieer for N-S|pg||
nt|spenny80: last board 3Nt was down 4 because south has played x@s tu the 9! I don't know why...|pg||
nt|spenny80: hi Frank|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Might 8?|pg||
nt|richie: going for the @H ruff first, @c suit is protected now|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 7|pg||
nt|loe48: he will try|pg||
nt|timve:  nice switch by Ticha|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bebechira: Sweden 158 France 155 another mini-battle for bronze as well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ntmon: when you bid such 2@S you make life harder for opps, in case deal belongs to them|pg||
nt|gio 89: 110 for NS where EW can make 3@S|pg||
nt|richie: yarrawonga :) near albury/wodonga|pg||
nt|bebechira: VBA is the main club in Victoria...have you been there?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden can not afford a big loss here...they can loose cthe bronze medal|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a push board|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|richie: on her way to making the contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida in 4spades as well... 5 of hearts lead|pg||
nt|richie: I guess only the @c lead would put major pressure on the declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ntmon: though i don't know what 1@S exactly promised|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1OT so 1 imp gain|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland marching along... 15-1 after 4 vs. France|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Good defense to duck the @S... - without hesitaion, but...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|timve:  Ticha was 3rd in the open EC mixed just a few weeks ago|pg||
nt|timve:  a very talented player|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: rolling towards 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eleni: Let us hope that Rosaline can keep it to -2, for no swing|pg||
pc|cT|nt|loe48: he takes his 7|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bebechira: a double by E would've brought home one of the big swings :)|pg||

pc|s9|nt|richie: at the other table South (judith nab) overcalled 1@h and was raised by north, they may find the @h lead now|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|rodal f: OR still struggling with B3 2NTN|pg||

nt|mrdct: probably 1NT for EW here|pg||

nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=892|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  good not to ruff w your tiny hearts. On these level its routine|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: med hand som det der kan en x nu vaere rett..etter 3c fra makker meld 3d som er invitt?|pg||
nt|richie: nice result for the French pair in Open, after the 2NT opening it will be copied|pg||
mb|1N!|an|!h4+!s4|nt|timve:  normal 4@H by south|pg||
nt|ntmon: she might have excited with @DQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: exited *|pg||
nt|eleni: a really weak pre-empt, but then as they are not vul, it sure makes life difficult for E-W|pg||
nt|mrdct: disciplined 3rd seat pass by west|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 5c was a flat board...|pg||
nt|richie: firm preemptive action by Carole Puillet but very reasonable, only the 3-3 majors are against it |pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab only 3c in the closed and playing there|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s most likely spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: og ikke 3d krav til utgang|pg||
nt|spenny80: if someone open..|pg||
nt|mrdct: north may pass this out|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino count suggest 4th seat pass|pg||
mb|2H|nt|loe48: i og med de aapner lett|pg||
nt|oosb: This could get dbled|pg||
nt|ntmon: defence was soft but i can imagine EW were happy to set the contract|pg||
nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||
nt|richie: good suit and green vs red are favouring this pressure bid - it's difficult for opps to exchange information but as we can see it did not work here|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is invitational|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  At the club you often see people ruffs with their small trumphs that you need later :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  dbl is @s |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 14 imps to israel on board 4 for making 3NX+2|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut må våre krav|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@C vulnerable is better with 6cards|pg||
nt|richie: after a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|richie: or will North do some sacrificing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen from Ticha?|pg||
nt|richie: just natural|pg||
nt|richie: 8-11 6+@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: pass...|pg||
nt|murat e: 12 hcp and double fit on the bidding is too much for me to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D should be an easy winner here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope they do not go to slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: there 2-3 marginal boards per set///and they must be given special attention|pg||
nt|richie: 3@H or 4@H?|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h|pg||
nt|doks: 2@H is on, so going down in 3@C are not that bad|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes intreshing auction|pg||
mb|d!|nt|gio 89: E should know that W must have 4@D|pg||
nt|gio 89: since she didn't bid 3@s over her double|pg||
nt|gio 89: and opps should have 9card fit in @H|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1Cl was 12-14 / 18-19 Bal or Nat|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: 3d er krav, derfor sier jeg at x kanskje er mer korrekt melding..og etter 3c. meld 3d som er invitt hand nu|pg||
nt|timve:  east west can maybe make 5@C|pg||
nt|timve:  but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  lets sea if E/W can defeat this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
nt|richie: South surely won't :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|richie: 3@hX in the other room...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is perhaps a bit of a stretch but Cilla would have raised 3 anyway|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Remind that E just shows 6 points w the double :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Lebensohl|pg||
nt|murat e: though tehe right bid here...|pg||
nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||
nt|asig: Yes, taht was a rather lucky contract|pg||
nt|timve:  normally two spade losers|pg||
nt|timve:  but on 7x hearts....|pg||
nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
nt|richie: wow! south really doubled... now things become interesting...|pg||
nt|richie: on board 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... this will a swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|richie: I think 4@h is justifiable|pg||
nt|richie: but 3@h probably better in green, still need good values from partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will help the decl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@s should bid bye a nice 12-14 bal so |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Karlsson's @HQ at the other table was better|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  When you have KQx in trumphs you dont want ruff with them|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 OR ended 3@HSX|pg||
nt|doks: same contract here as well|pg||
pc|c4|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a spade discard by Ticha|pg||
nt|timve:  and I think she will pitch a spade|pg||
nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a @c in to W suit(often could be 18-19 bal) is not a good start|pg||
pc|c7|nt|raghavan: 2 tricks loss cannot be avoided|pg||
nt|bebechira: farnce 157 sweden 156 after 21 brds|pg||
nt|bebechira: france |pg||
nt|richie: yes, they overjumped them - poor swedes at the open room, they missed a few chances|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  that might get expensive|pg||
nt|richie: likely to be -500|pg||
nt|richie: they led a trump which solved one problem|pg||
nt|bebechira: Mikael from Sweden recomended 6d...and right he is|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|doks: by the way, Denmark take 3rd place now, by leading 22-0 vs Poland|pg||
pc|c2|nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
nt|richie: farce?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the it seems like 4@s should make even with a @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like an overtrick now that spades are 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about making with a heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, W tried to pull trump immediately which cause the loss of control on hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It seems normal to cash @CAK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h9|nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H King seems to come from right hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 500 enough Y|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: B3 ended 2NTN-1 and 11IMP to Norway|pg||
pc|c3|nt|richie: but lots of work to do, Sigrid (east) is probably happy to see @HK (I would :))|pg||
nt|raghavan: On hearing a 9 card fit in Spade, others are forgotten. But Open too in Spades only|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  now no problems|pg||
pc|h3|nt|murat e: draw trumps play a heart north takes and must exit with another heart|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bebechira: the swedish girls are my favourites for the bronze|pg||
pc|hT|nt|timve:  yeah always hard to see for east|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ok, then its not THAT expensive since 3N made here. but on the other hand, they surely would have found the killing lead so they lost a chance for a big pickup|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|richie: @d for 1 looser: you have to guess which of your opponents has Honour doubleton: either play small to JTx or play J|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  We have been told, that West can always make 4 ! S - I call it double-dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: Although theres always the possibility that pd has a bust hand, and you get dbled.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankbo: den var ikke bra|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I'm not sure, but would not mind an upgrade with 2 tens|pg||
nt|uttam: -2|pg||
nt|josj: -1, next|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ntmon: 4@S  a normal outcome of this deal|pg||
nt|gio 89: if E menages to hold it to -3/4 it could be a push since NS should make 4@H|pg||
nt|richie: still not easy to defend this, Magdalena will play @c now, west will have to play a spade at one point|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eleni: -1 is a good score for Italy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bebechira: welcome to Bas van Beijesterveld|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h and 3@h were a bit too much...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

pc|h8|nt|murat e: now ace and another club endplays him for the second time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|neobas: Hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|richie: west can count the hand now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|timve:  if west has QX or Q but knowing 7@H with south, I would guess my p has the second diamond|pg||
nt|gio 89: down 5 now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|richie: hi Bas :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mrdct: slam on for EW|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: but some work to do|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C from north over 2@D might have taken away just enough space|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|athene: it might then go 3@S - 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: and EW have a lot less room to do their little dance|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|an|14 30|nt|mrdct: the play in 6@d or 6@s will be guided by vacant spaces|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|an|Q?|nt|athene: north will be happy he has managed to ask for a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: (by not doubling diamonds or clubs)|pg||
mb|5S|an|no Q|mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS actually have a good save in @h but not looking likely to find it|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok will he change his mind and lightner?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ugis: et a heart lead now :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the lightner dbl not so smart here as it is likely with a natural trump trick and will make the hand a lot easier to play|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mrdct: can just about claim after this is ruffed|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will here come a new swing? E was near 2@C but agree his 1@S open.|pg||
nt|loe48: 2 stikk der i motspill om ikke 3|pg||
nt|ntmon: the preemt did not paid off, indicated !Q at N|pg||
nt|mrdct: usually right to pass it out in 4th seat if you don't have the @s suit|pg||
nt|spenny80: strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: P + number of @S = pass with <15|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 5/5 11count and a major...|pg||
nt|richie: the more conservative approach in the open room is paying off so far|pg||
nt|richie: hello Marleen :) excited to watch your team?|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Traian :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, 2H worked well in assuring a heart lead, but i wouldnt have bid it on a 4 count. And 3H..... well.... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: right Vladimir|pg||
nt|spenny80: I open|pg||
nt|richie: when France and Sweden both have the same number of VPs, France will probably become third, they won the match against sweden 18-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: But would you have dbled with South's hand?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden got a lead of 12 now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|loe48: its very fast to get out on thoose..but a cleat 1s opener imo|pg||
nt|loe48: clear|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: En interresant hand. |pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||
nt|neobas: due to the operator not having the file with the hand recrods, we will probably not be able to broadcast it on BBO, regretfully|pg||
nt|richie: these north hands are problematic in many systems: many points, no stopper, no 4+@S |pg||
nt|neobas: Not a good result for the Dutch in the OR|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  5 cl in other room here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: whenever i open those sorts of hands i write down -110 5 minutes later|pg||
nt|frankaus: no of @S is an important factor|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|spenny80: here 4@s could make|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the Dutch girls now to recover some imps?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: B4 2@HE as here.|pg||
nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|richie: Big score for the french again...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is easier|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h K lead (not the best )|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and makes even on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|doks: after quite partscore, doubled slam deal|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
nt|richie: I guess Magdalena (west) will lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
nt|marionmi:  now what will Ticha lead? ace of spades, trying to shorten declarer? a trump to prevent the ruffs?|pg||
nt|richie: it's often good with 4 small trumps to lead them|pg||
nt|marionmi:  you know her better than i do :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 2NTW and a swing to come.|pg||
nt|richie: we made it to some kind of rule :) 4 small trumps = trump lead|pg||
nt|marionmi:  a lot of bad breaks here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 slemmer står. @C - @D og NT.|pg||
nt|frankbo: tror han prøver med 6sp|pg||
nt|loe48: fordi ikke stoette fra 3 til 4d|pg||
nt|oosb: Meanwhile Hungary picked up 7 imps in the 2@D deal|pg||
nt|eleni: Margherita is right thinking |pg||
nt|frankaus: i willl see if they are short elsewhere as there are 3 comment. here cu |pg||
nt|neobas: Surely W has a hand to get into the auction here|pg||
nt|richie: depends on your perspective|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@C=trans to me |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: this is a typical need to cash tricks contract..a slip and it makes|pg||
nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||
nt|frankbo: kommer nok kl ess|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
nt|marionmi:  how should she play? win in hand and play a spade?|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board, declarer has to be careful, and NOT finesse in @hs|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d is puppet to 3@h with supp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: support for what?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So a dangerous board for sweden|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, 93 is not what I call support :)|pg||
nt|doks: other room Lightner double discover @S suit and @DQ as well|pg||
mb|4N|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
nt|richie: 3rd5th lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h went 2 down in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 22|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  something is being lost in the translation|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like we are heading to 5@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And 4 cl Short @c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So we may ending very wrong here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that East meant 3@D as stopper ask after South's interference|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes she mean that|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6 kloever , 6d og 6nt staar..vil de lande paa fotene her?|pg||
nt|frankbo: sorry han melder jo self 6 kl|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or draw trumps and take the double club hook?|pg||
nt|richie: 2 more imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 2 more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: @S are not in picture this deal here. Goes for @D slam probably|pg||
mb|7D|nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
nt|richie: I guess you could better try to ruff 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or take in dummy and start playing clubs right away?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes same in Open too|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W continue to Que|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: I would try for that, and establish diamonds as we go|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but then you have to win a high heart in dummy right away and you may have to ruff 1 or 2 spades with your high trumps in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HK lead was what declarer needed in the other room|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so i think he pass now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which seems a strange lead after West had shown hearts. Then the other red king looks more attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ruff one seems to be enough for =|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am wrong it seems:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes so both swedish pair should remember board 7 |pg||
pc|hK|nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
nt|richie: that's also true- maybe @sJ9 stops the spades a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately, Johan was right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-2 fits at the 4-level usually don't play well|pg||
nt|doks: E expected more from W 3@D bid, so both Q must be found|pg||
nt|doks: very big swing on air|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes either way|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
pc|h5|nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems u was right.|pg||
nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... you were saying about finessing richard????|pg||
nt|richie: 4@h will go down here, @druff coming |pg||
nt|richie: I don't remember :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: why is Magdalena thinking....is this worring you?|pg||
nt|richie: not at all worrying|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: just contemplating, only problem is that @d8 can also be played from 832|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes|pg||
nt|richie: and 2nd problem is that partner encouraged in spades|pg||
nt|richie: and third...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we have seen examples of a 4-2 fit being the only makeable game|pg||
nt|doks: imagine You play vs Zia siting on S and DBL 7@D. Where You place @DQ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bebechira: defeating or making is a 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|richie: @s2 is disappointing... another trump would have worked better|pg||
nt|marionmi:  would easts diamonds be count? should be lavinthal maybe|pg||
nt|richie: they show count|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR the NT ended -1|pg||
nt|richie: small swing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|josj: difficult to imagine for defence that E has such a bad hand...|pg||
nt|ntmon: exactly .. there danger comes from|pg||
nt|josj: and any mistake now will be fatal immediately|pg||
nt|spenny80: hi all|pg||
nt|eleni: hi Fabio|pg||

nt|josj: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|spenny80: thanks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|loe48: there the slip came..he didnt want to listen to his pd's signal of switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C10 should have been a nice warning.|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I meant|pg||
nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: need @c back to beat|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think thier rule is to playing their ordinary system when W could bid nat 2@h but if Opps bid after the answer they play more natural like that Cilla thought|pg||
nt|doks: E was completely sure about @DQ on W, he dont even ask|pg||
nt|bcmandal: my way|pg||
nt|doks: or 6th @D|pg||
nt|bcmandal: another hurdlt|pg||
nt|bcmandal: hurdle|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: of course, we know .. she should take it and play @DA  .. but ..|pg||
nt|eleni: probably never heard of the rule "3rd high" and never rescue your partner either:)|pg||
nt|richie: big swing at stake here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well 5 here and 5 there make 10 for me:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Just looks like a totally normal auction|pg||
nt|loe48: det staar paa at en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|richie: it seems they did not have this tool of 1@s so rosaline Barendregt decided for 2@c|pg||
nt|richie: now the problem is solved|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...8 tricks for the taking... and 1 imp for France|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankbo: der håkon og lars spillte 3N minus fire meldte det 7kl dbl med 800|pg||
nt|loe48: det kan sies at det er en liten forskjell i meldestil paa det spillet ja :)|pg||
nt|loe48: kan fort skje med missfortaaelse av melding|pg||
nt|spenny80: wd|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at that dummy - getting rid of an entry to the @d suit looks stand-out|pg||
nt|mrdct: good defence|pg||
nt|richie: 2nd problem was the biggest problem it seems|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|doks: if He founds @DQ, then more probably founds @SQ as well|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wilkinsona: well, 3N can perhaps get home on 6|pg||
nt|bebechira: the damage was the 730 lol|pg||
nt|richie: yes:) :(|pg||

pc|dA|nt|mrdct: all that remains for the defence now is to duck one round of @d|pg||
nt|richie: no overcall in spades at the other table, so the contract is played in north, it could make a difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A board to forget for Sweden in both rooms. Happens to all of us|pg||
pc|h8|nt|richie: must be a relief to make this contract|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gronkvist:  luckily that is that north w 4@h|pg||

nt|athene: you might still make the slam on a heart or club lead but of course it's harder|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think you'll still make as once you learn how @s break you will know how to play @d and vice verse|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: north was looking at decent holdings in hearts and clubs so clearly to bid so strongly the opps had to have a lot of shape and a big spade diamond double fit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: so the only chance the slam might go down is if they lose to the @SQ and @DQ|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: double is 4 or 5 spades, i guess?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: using 1@S as t/o without spades|pg||
nt|athene: necessary when 1@C can be any old thing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: common expert treatment these days|pg||
nt|athene: he might have to finesse against the @C9 to make this?|pg||
nt|athene: aim for four clubs, two hearts, and a diamond|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|athene: as oscar wilde said - a little sincerity is dangeourous and too much is absolutely fatal|pg||
nt|athene: hard for the defence to realise they should play diamonds right back at declarer|pg||
nt|athene: a spec comments that the @DJ should make it obvious|pg||
nt|ugis: well, after S discarded the d J....|pg||
nt|athene: @Dj can't be short really, so has to show a solid sequence|pg||
nt|athene: and if north counts the points he can see his partner has the @SK as an entry|pg||
nt|athene: with that card as well as everything else, west would have opened 1nt, surely|pg||

nt|richie: each other|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think i would like 2@s here better by east than 2n, then you make partner aware of your spade shortness |pg||
nt|marionmi:  she doesnt need to have a very good spade stopper for a 1 level nt bid|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, usually 1nt is more like 8-10 in this situation|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Your son must learn to count then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: getting @s right will be helpful and if you can get east to open-up the @d suit you are in good shape|pg||

nt|richie: pass over 1@d by west looks strange but her philosophy is that an overcall should be useful for the lead, @sA9xxx is worse than @sKT9xx, then she would surely overcall|pg||

nt|loe48: then 3c-3d|pg||
nt|richie: yes, look at the other matches: Poland will play Italy, Netherlands, France and Netherlands will play France, Poland Sweden |pg||
nt|bebechira: i play some sort of multi|pg||
nt|richie: you can say whatever you want, but it's not boring|pg||
nt|bebechira: lucky not doubled|pg||
nt|doks: so we have allmost level at this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: scotland has opened their a/c|pg||
nt|richie: I prefer 3@h|pg||
nt|bebechira: we integrated in precision|pg||
nt|richie: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N makes here and 4@s didn't in CR|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|doks: 2@H Muiderberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: I think they looked at the results two years ago and scheduled accordingly: in the last match no 1 and 2 meet (Poland and France), no 3 and 4 (Netherlands and Sweden) etc|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...Friday and Saturday will be a feast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good news for Danish supporters. Denmark were 0-25 down after 4 boards, now the scoreline reads 33-25|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|murat e: 4 of a major too high for both|pg||
nt|asig: NS may bid 4@h on this one|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice 5 @d but because ew om board -cards well placed and makes :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: can may 6@c or 6@s here if you are good at dropping Qs offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I say that North should nt take bidding to shes hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: against Italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: and go 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. 6@S-1 i OR og 17IMP til Belgia.|pg||
nt|loe48: med 2 langfarver so i den 6nt de meldte her er beste kontrakt alltid  6nt..for det er nok en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as def slipped at 1!NX made 7 and Netherland back in the lead.|pg||
nt|ntmon: large gain for Italy, now match almost close|pg||
nt|spenny80: they don't play polish club?|pg||
nt|mrdct: assuming the dbl promises 4@s (i have no idea if it does)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure|pg||
nt|doks: if I remember correctly, this is of city in NED|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i heard polish club is out of favour with a lot of the juniors these days|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danes had the same horrible start against Israel yesterday but went on to win the match by 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deja vu perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for N to insist on @s contract?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Tell their captain to wake them earlier|pg||
pc|s9|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile Hungary has a small margin (40- 11 imps) over Sweden, no 3 at this moment|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|murat e: east must avoid spade lead though|pg||
nt|oosb: Is everyone bidding 3@H here?|pg||
nt|uttam: 4h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure after the x..|pg||
nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||
nt|oosb: So I might lose imps in this deal, but I pass as West|pg||
nt|spenny80: really?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i meant by south|pg||
nt|richie: straightforward 3NT, @hK is protected so it should  not be very problematic|pg||
nt|antoniz: Witam serdecznie|pg||

nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|richie: in 1NT you count 7 tricks when you manage to make 3 spade tricks, best line would be to attack them a.s.a.p. and leave the heart suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: you want to help here?|pg||
nt|bebechira: sorry.....private|pg||

pc|sK|nt|loe48: 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's better not to test partner here, being a passed hand |pg||
nt|josj: defence can take 4 tricks at most on this layout|pg||
nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
nt|richie: good question by one of the kibs, where should EW have entered the auction on board 25? I have no idea... maybe 3@d overcall by east when you play it as preemptive|pg||
nt|richie: honestly I have no idea - I am not in Albena|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith rebid 1nt on the same auction|pg||
pc|s5|nt|timve:  good contract, but normally going off|pg||

nt|bebechira: yes ... :)|pg||

nt|richie: makes more sense|pg||
nt|richie: this can go 3 down with maximum defence|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|timve:  it does|pg||
nt|spenny80: the will play 5 without Qtrump|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: well it seems this may make, but its not laydown|pg||
nt|richie: but I can imagine some disappointment, they had just one goal: GOLD|pg||

pc|s2|nt|timve:  aj|pg||

pc|d8|nt|timve:  to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|timve:  a small one|pg||
nt|marionmi:  rehi, got kicked out|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|doks: In Poland they play very similar version of these bids, except 2@H can contain spades as well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  in CR, a relay auction found the 5-3 @s fit...it can be made if you play W to have all the @ss|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: better to test @D first, I would say|pg||
nt|richie: for me Wednesday will be a feast :)|pg||
nt|richie: would everyone pass  1NT with the east hand?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|spenny80: yes|pg||
nt|richie: rehi marion|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|josj: goo defence...|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but it seems like i havent missed that muhc|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gronkvist:  At the other table N made a slamtry|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bebechira: i think for the girls the head to head match will be the one|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N much easier|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|runnerup: no real chance if @s ace not well placed -so that make or sunks this|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: water break|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H, 6@D, 6NT...|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: all back|pg||
nt|athene: kokish might get in the way here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C 2@D 2@H 2@S 3@H now south can't show the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but of course NS probably don't play kokish :)|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mrdct: with AKQ 7th - who cares about the @d fit?|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 6@d is a significantly superior contract as it can deal with 4-1 @h|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes hearts can be trumps but north would be happy to know his partner has a diamond suit as it's a pitch for the spade|pg||
nt|mrdct: on a @s lead 4-1 @h would put 6@d in trouble|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: on a spade lead you have to decide which red suit is 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: if hearts, you ruff a heart high and draw trumps ending in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds, you draw trumps and hope to run the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: of course as the cards lie he can't go down but he might agonize for a while first|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'd be agonising a long while here|pg||
nt|athene: one very small factor is that west might have led a singleton heart|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps you play to guard against 4-1 diamonds rather than 4-1 hearts|pg||

nt|richie: could be a swing board here, 6@s is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|richie: very difficult board to bid... both have a 2 suiter, you miss one ace (fortunately opposite void) and it's hard to really establish the fit|pg||
nt|richie: 1@s - 2@d // 3@c - 3@d // 4@d or 4@h may have done the job|pg||
nt|iceblue: agree|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With AK@h and a normal @c shift |pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: i understand|pg||
nt|timve:  it seems E-W dont have good agreements after 2NT|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT is now played in the wrong hand, defence can take their diamond tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That does not beat it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|doks: N still looking for 7 if 2@D dont deny 4controls|pg||
mb|5C|an| |nt|timve:  cause with 6HCP I would get ideas|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table Judith Nab actually opened the door for 7@d but Rosaline Barendregt firmly closed it again|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ville ikke 3@S vert gratis. Spørsmål etter hold eller advanced que bid?|pg||
nt|uttam: no power|pg||
nt|josj: @H finesse seems best option as @C might be 5-3...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will have problems here|pg||
nt|bebechira: still 2 vps in front|pg||
nt|doks: 4@H must be cue, with shortness, as he deny @H support|pg||
nt|doks: but they must know better their aggreements|pg||
mb|6D|nt|richie: sweden 155, france 153, italy 149 (maybe they are the 3rd dog coming for the bone?)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No u right |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He then set up the spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for N,, he wants to lead @d and @c at same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: ja er muligheter her|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3s-4d now|pg||
nt|spenny80: last board 6@s for italy and same defence|pg||
nt|richie: seems to be a push, same contract reached|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5d is closing the door as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: enjoy your coffee gentlemen anyway:)|pg||
nt|richie: here it is west who is shutting the door, in open room it was east (surprisingly)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Så etter 3@S fra N kommer 4@H fra S som sier at 3@S var et advanced que.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 now i think with the non-@c lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: ah yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: the italian girls in the other room would've been better to play count on the opening @DK lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|richie: incredibly difficult board, she had to develop @h first (@h2 to J) but who can find that?|pg||
nt|richie: you have to play hearts to take north's entry for the 4th spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: club lead in the open room by Nab and Jack played|pg||
nt|richie: I was just going to say that I think south will lead @c6 :) but wrong guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 3-3 @s will see this one home|pg||
nt|doks: specs suggest 4@H kick-back RKC|pg||
pc|cK|nt|loe48: naar trump er avtalt er det bare aa starte quebids lavest mulig|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr. 3NT fra N|pg||

nt|rodal f: Etter revers fra N? Da kutte eg 4th color.|pg||
nt|frankbo: N vet ikke om H tilpassningen enda|pg||
nt|loe48: er helt greit med 3h-4h mener jeg|pg||
nt|richie: 2 VPs is nothing|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Pass always at team then Frank.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid in east showed an invitational hand with 3+@s or a mild game forcing hand, maybe with 13 and a side suit she is too strong, on the other hand Magie in west could have bid ...|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d shortness|pg||
nt|rodal f: So some national Polich players have left the Polich club it seems.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke did not see the danger|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bebechira: Rosaline in 5d dbled in the closed|pg||
nt|doks: and A ask more frequently use strong hand rather than weak|pg||
pc|dK|nt|richie: 500 and 1 imp to france I guess|pg||
nt|richie: 2 imps|pg||
nt|richie: might be a swing to france again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't ruff 2 diamonds if they play another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he should have realised that and played on spades|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ouch to fast play here from his side|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bebechira: may be 2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: unblock the @dA and then keep drawing trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have electricity, but it is not working too well..|pg||
nt|bcmandal: if rkc 5c means?|pg||
nt|doks: another suggestion from speecs, Optional kick-back, with 4@S min, than its ok with answers|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|asig: Now declarer "just" needs to get the spades right|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|timve:  if you find your 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|richie: good attempt, but won't succeed as north has the @hT with the free @sQ|pg||
mc|12|nt|doks: optional kick-back, quite popular now in NED as I know|pg||
pg||

nt|athene: but if west showed out on the second trump, wasn't he just down?|pg||
nt|athene: ah, no, he can run the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: as substitute trumps through east|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Here the top-spot is 460...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: sorry for this situation|pg||
nt|murat e: this type of hand difficult to evaluate make souths spade one more club one less and slam is on with a normal 3-2 trump break|pg||
nt|MarekW: sorry we got wrong boards 11 and 12 from 13 will be correct|pg||
nt|murat e: i think we have to wait since next round begins|pg||

nt|ntmon: such a splendid outcome ..|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c are 4/4 or Aces is in north (with Axx in south probably she takes on 1st round)|pg||
nt|josj: and another imp for Italy...|pg||
nt|josj: Judith?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark defeated Israel in the juniors .. 19-11 so Israel lead is now 'only'14 VPS|pg||
nt|richie: partscore in @h probably|pg||
nt|doks: optional or not, next board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Netherland picked up a new 6 IMPer at B8|pg||

mb|p|nt|richie: 5@s 5m|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|loe48: we need some action here now|pg||

nt|richie: crazy hands this session :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Enig Frank, etter reversen fra N. Stil og avtaler i makkerparet, men...|pg||
nt|oosb: that was quick :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I can see it though|pg||
nt|antoniz: z³apa³a przeciwniczki za gard³o|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Asia Krawczyk Taczewska: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=29688|pg||
nt|richie: aha, no, east can open 1NT first - will be playing 2@s|pg||
nt|doks: normal 2@H, must be duplicated here as well|pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup: 3nt with @d guess or lead here|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c = gazzilli|pg||
nt|richie: south has a lot of trumps, but that's all, I guess she will pass in these vulnerabilities, north may dbl?|pg||
nt|richie: everyone passing? maybe 1@s - 2@c pass|pg||
mb|1N|nt|spenny80: 2@d positive|pg||
nt|richie: no, passing wisely|pg||
nt|bebechira: n will double|pg||
nt|bebechira: oops...she didn't|pg||
nt|richie: just made, good result for the French girls Carole and  Claire, they avoided any tragedies|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bebechira: incredibil.... N is playing in 4s in the closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: som GEO sier, 4 rut må være cue med hj, kanskje beste varianten|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c in east and 3NT by west is my guess - but 2@s is also possible of course|pg||
mb|3H|nt|timve:  hmm with north you would like to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  double as t/o is the way to do it|pg||
nt|timve:  also 2NT cannot be natural in this situation|pg||
nt|timve:  north is thinking about it|pg||
nt|timve:  3@D is down one|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c = 5/4 (not 6/4 not 5/5)|pg||
nt|spenny80: strong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 1Nt is better the dbl|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be expecting 4@h from west|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|richie: you need some tricks to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we have Israel 275-Italy 261-Denmark 235 the medals at the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  at the other table a very nice lead from Barendregt on board 10 |pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2@h will play OK|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|richie: south in open room has GREAT courage!!! she bids 2@c for majors|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT! that's again modest|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Puppet on so 5@Ss|pg||
nt|timve:  defeating the contract instantly|pg||
nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: west does have a hand better for playing in a suit contract|pg||
nt|richie: can Italy still challenge Israel, you think?|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: probably with 3@c denies 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: but i'm not sure|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she will make some tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope.. I think the israelis are very strong...they will not give it away after such a start|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Kanskje GEO vil hjelpe oss litt? Velkommen.|pg||
nt|loe48: 4h and 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|frankbo: will bidd 6 now|pg||
nt|frankbo: 1 down|pg||
nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
nt|richie: small @c to K and 3 rounds of clubs, then @dA and diamond? maybe north is tempted to jump by Q|pg||
nt|marionmi:  around 8 is my guess|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes but even that isnt enough if north keeps her spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, south has 3|pg||
nt|jkotor: strefa szlemowa na drugim stole pozostawia trochê do ¿yczenia|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the right plan was to ruff 2 @d and 2@s before pulling the trumphs and then palyed a@hJ and N was endplayed (from Johan Upmark)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||
nt|richie: are you kidding me?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  what should she discard on the 3 clubs? a diamond, a heart and a spade?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|loe48: if he raise club ace it makes|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 5@c i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: little try|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... big misunderstanding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dagold: he had to decide how likely it is pard has a good hand with clubs when holding Qxx himself. not so unreasonable to pass imo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ikke tid. Synd.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y or H|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|frankbo: well|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even not by raising @CA u have a squize endplay.|pg||
nt|frankbo: could still endplay E|pg||
nt|loe48: still possibilities id say|pg||
nt|loe48: draw 9 cards in spade and dia..so whats left|pg||
nt|ntmon: still tempting for W|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult for W not accept|pg||
nt|richie: yes, probably - even 2 hearts is OK|pg||
nt|richie: you can see that dummy is inaccessible|pg||
nt|doks: Must leave right now. Big thanks for excellent company and valuable contribution from specs, was pleasure|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: can W be sure of 2 aces opposite?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|ntmon: italian girls are well prepared concerning bidding system - my conclusion|pg||
nt|richie: I don't know the leads well enough, could @sT be from AJT? I guess not... |pg||
nt|richie: NS now need to establish the @h trick before it disappears... easier for North to see it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: ok thats for that game nice peaceful a couple off down like 2 ..|pg||
nt|loe48: east need to blank club ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Welcome back from space:)|pg||
nt|eleni: well stopped by W|pg||
nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am not kidding you...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here 2@h was 8-11|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||
nt|richie: this will make now, courage has been rewarded and 6 imps to Sweden|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: 3NT probably plays quite well though with the @d suit sitting nicely|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|richie: problems are solved now, 9 tricks in the pocket|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|richie: maybe if she manages to make 6 tricks they will win 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: weired bidding as well|pg||

nt|loe48: you get valuable info|pg||

nt|loe48: saa johansen..dra ned en trump til du|pg||

nt|richie: dbl probably and then 5@d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but south will bid something, wont she?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, and then its up to north|pg||
nt|marionmi:  who hasnt shown any suit yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I can only agree :)|pg||
nt|richie: north will just do 5@s, solid enough|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ticha trying to trap the opponents?|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably not the contract here|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|richie: 3@c now and then 3NT would work well and is likely  to happen|pg||
nt|marionmi:  into doubling them?|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: in other room netherlands girl think as me|pg||
nt|ntmon: may die out at 5@S|pg||
nt|richie: well bid |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 tricks :(|pg||
nt|richie: 6 or even 7@d is making, you need to rebid @ds for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: hehe|pg||
nt|oosb: But then again, I'm never opening this 1@C|pg||
nt|josj: should not be too difficult to locate @CQ|pg||

nt|spenny80: with 2 suiter in est and seeing 2@s in E, Q@c can't pay|pg||
nt|josj: but 6@D is still OK|pg||
nt|spenny80: 6@d?|pg||
nt|josj: -2 I think|pg||
nt|richie: maybe:)|pg||
nt|richie: then you should pass again|pg||
nt|marionmi:  north didnt take this opportunity to bid her spades|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ryskiel_: spade lead?|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well, hold on, this 4 have just passed a hand out|pg||
nt|spenny80: better 4@s in west else 5@d....|pg||
nt|richie: declarer has to take care of her communication - she can pick up 4@h tricks but needs to be careful with her @d entry|pg||
nt|richie: 4@d is again a bit modest, the void in @h doesn't encourage her I think|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yeah but still|pg||
nt|antoniz: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: 3 dia is the best spot but how to get there|pg||
nt|spenny80: but here is the same|pg||
nt|spenny80: normal|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably the same outcome if south did open|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  1N somehow showed hearts?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@dX is my guess, bidding went slow enough |pg||
nt|richie: north never showed her extra values, 3NT will be the end|pg||
pc|c6|nt|murat e: not possible w standart bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: good play|pg||
nt|murat e: covering costs a trick|pg||
nt|murat e: some spec suggests 2 dia instead of 2 sp but matchpoint bidding is not that way|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @S is best |pg||

nt|bebechira: good lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looks like there is a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|richie: 5@s is down on a @h lead, bridge can be a funny game|pg||

pc|h2|nt|henryb:  and 3@c would have been down a bunch|pg||
nt|bebechira: you went quiet Richard ?|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT in the meanwhile makes comfortably|pg||

nt|richie: @dQ on the K :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c pitch seems automatic, whether W can ruff or not|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|richie: Q is an alarming card, 9 still too vague|pg||
nt|marionmi:  spangenberg wont think her partner has 5 diamonds, so i think she should play the queen to show something weird is going on|pg||
nt|marionmi:  9 might also be neutral from Q9x|pg||
nt|richie: unlucky @c break dooms the contract|pg||

nt|richie: 3@h is a challenge - you will have to take @d in north and play a club towars KT9 and allow east to keep it when she puts her figure|pg||
nt|richie: only way to discard your loosing @s|pg||
nt|richie: some alternative (playing low @H first or 2x@d) is possible|pg||

mb|d|nt|rodal f: Pappa Bogen bekrefte at den kommer live CET13.00 Vi gleder oss.|pg||

nt|rodal f: En re på spillet? 6@C.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6c er protokollfoert her allerede|pg||
nt|richie: lol:)|pg||
nt|richie: this dbl will take NS out of their @H fit |pg||
nt|bebechira: -3 now so 3 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @D-ruff brings nothing here - defense needs the @S 9 also|pg||
nt|asig: 6@s a good contract here|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may get to 3N here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wilkinsona: ..sorry thought you meant this hand..|pg||
nt|oosb: I Like 3@D here as barrage|pg||
nt|oosb: Tony I havent had that much to drink... yet :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 12 imps on brd 13... |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No @D-lead now...|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c is showing a shortness, not exactly the hand she has, but what to do when you have doubt about 4@s?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Undo again?:) Pass and 3@S E|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No way to the 11th trick here, I hink|pg||
nt|rodal f: Likevel var det en kontrakt de fleste ville vert i.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like only 2 losers in 5@d but the 4-1 trump break is hard to manage|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c like gazzilli|pg||
nt|rensph: off-shape X with little strength...|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 2@d minimum w/o 4@h|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@h relay|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Ser det. 6@C=|pg||
nt|loe48: replay here|pg||
nt|timve:  an easy 4@S |pg||
nt|spenny80: I bid 3Nt not 2@c|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s 4+@d|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3imps are 3 imps... it is a gain :)|pg||
nt|richie: west has a small powerhouse, but in green no need to risk for a game|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d by E now?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|spenny80: It's a bors for NT, 2 or 3 is little difference|pg||
nt|josj: hoping all the tens will come in, Fabio?|pg||
nt|spenny80: and with 3 10 i prefer more 3nt|pg||
nt|richie: normal 4h but no chance after the excellent diamond lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep|pg||
nt|richie: 3@cX = I want to lead this suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level here |pg||
nt|richie: funny thing is that every VP has double the value|pg||
pc|c4|nt|asig: But may be hard to find|pg||
nt|loe48: ja, systemet er ikke saa godt at de faar vist trumf 10|pg||
nt|loe48: som ville vaert et noekkelkort her|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west has opened only 1 club, perhaps because of his spade holding...|pg||
nt|josj: but I agree in a way: 2nt makes no sense here...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2nt relay|pg||
nt|bebechira: french girls in 2s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. Right end.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W has shown 17 + and with E 2@d is FG|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|asig: Well, QED|pg||
nt|runnerup: should make also inspite off 4-1 distibution -10 nicely sing -but carefull you must be|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the dutch girls to grab the lead|pg||
nt|richie: how? :)|pg||
nt|richie: easy board|pg||
nt|marionmi:  pretty risky 3@s bid by north :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead, still Ticha will make at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Häxan in Sweden I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2h 1d and 1c ...|pg||
nt|bebechira: can not do anything about it|pg||
nt|richie: VERY comfortable!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: but after this good lead, you may need it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gronkvist:  yes |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ntmon: same start as in OR|pg||
nt|spenny80: you have not indication, have you?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: many flat boards though...|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
nt|dagold: Israel playing in 1@c on 14 after east didn't respond|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s it is|pg||
nt|richie: french will grab extend their lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But they played not the normal one. 2@c is either any strong or 14-16 w 6+@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 7 tricks and has to decide between @s and @d were the 8th and 9th are coming from|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@s in open room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't see a route to nine tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|loe48: helt grei 4s. med muligheter|pg||
nt|mrdct: runs into similar problems to 5@d but at least you only need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: revoke 4 clubs?|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
pc|dT|nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lucky|pg||
nt|mrdct: holding natural trumps tricks, not a good idea to lead a shortage|pg||
nt|spenny80: but better than 5@d|pg||
nt|spenny80: at 26 cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bebechira: bad news are coming now|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  In the open room Swe takes the first @s|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he ducks the defence has 3 spade and 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|rensph: defense shouldn't let declarer score any of his small trumps.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  S can get 2@d tricks before giving up the 2nd @d trick to defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you play the hand if East switches to a club?|pg||
nt|rensph: we're taught to lead trumps against doubled partscores, as specs point out. No different here.|pg||

nt|mrdct: 2@h is about all NS can make - but with a 10 card fit they will bid on|pg||
nt|athene: north might worry it just shows six or seven solid clubs and out|pg||
nt|athene: and pass it|pg||
