nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||

nt|arigun: @s mecuber 1 tur daha boslayacak 10 love olacak|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bmkl: however not the same lead|pg||
nt|lady007: in the other room east foresaw that problem and raised the 1@s response over his 1@c opening to 2@s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||

nt|pinticus: strange,they've changed something,usually they play another convention over 1nt|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|key1809: West bidding 2NT, showing a STR Landy|pg||
nt|key1809: but east has nothing to show |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Qx  Qx   should be downgraded|pg||
nt|pinticus: probably they finish in 3@h|pg||

nt|key1809: cant see ne one thinking so long for this, i suspect we are stuck here|pg||

nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||

nt|eleni: in spite of the bad break|pg||
nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
nt|liujing: this must be an important match|pg||
nt|liujing: 2nd(ITA) against 3rd(DEN)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably he will leadwith Q@h|pg||

nt|dkkello: He will make i comfort witout a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|ybob: not necessary after this lead ...|pg||
nt|frankbo: now 4 might makes|pg||
nt|famus: the current standings are such that it can go to the wire in the final rounds:srael -275. Italy -261, Denmark -235, France -230. Norway -225, Croatia-221|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way the result will be -1 , it's impossible to find the 7th trick|pg||

nt|gmarco24: doubled  :)|pg||
nt|liujing: while Israel leads Italy by 14VP|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ntmon: as we don't exactly know what 3@S promises, it's not easy to tell who 'upgraded' - sure is 4@S has no play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree but still good save|pg||
nt|vasmar: hello|pg||

nt|frankbo: yes makes easy now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lady007: i think i would have passed with north but i wouldnt be happy about it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||

nt|ahri:  i imagine french staying calm|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: a little nervous in french team|pg||
nt|mamos: France gained 3 imps on Board 5 when not only did Greek NS not bid Slam  they defended 4@Sx and only scored 500|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'd like ot know how North worked out to exit that @S|pg||
nt|ritong: would you respond to 1@s with south hand?|pg||
nt|cicus: I may be unfair, maybe he thought he could still make if @HK lies wellla fter all|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I do with an Ace|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but typically my partnerships open 1@S very heavy|pg||
nt|vasmar: unlucky 4@S for N-S|pg||

mb|1D|nt|key1809: 6h, a decent contract, needing 3-2 hearts, but not here with a bad break|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that LHO is a passed hand is a factor imo|pg||
nt|ritong: he is less likely to balance|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|gmarco24: i know, we beat in you in basketball, and (i really don't know how) tomorrow in bridge  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: heheheh|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -the question here is can you stay out off this nonvuln game|pg||
nt|tez: her an 4@h yaptýrýlabilir|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
nt|lady007: this dutch team might be difficult to beat in basketball as well, they are all very tall|pg||

mb|d|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||
nt|dkkello: both of the french players were on the french team winning the worlds championship in Bejing |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 spades has chances it seems..|pg||
nt|yusufb: cok tehlikeli X bunlar|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
nt|ybob: no with good defence|pg||
nt|yusufb: fazla anlaþmalarý yok olanlar bile buralarda fire verirken|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||
nt|liraren: north is too passive I would have overcalled 2@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
nt|arigun: bakalim 3@h yapabilecek mi .9|pg||
nt|famus: first sign of  cheer for Danish fans with Italy going down in 4@S-- the declarer there lost trump control on a @H lead--he played !A and back-Danish yougster--took both @S and ...|pg||
nt|famus: forced a @h ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||
nt|timve:  think its now always made|pg||

nt|timve:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|timve:  also that|pg||
nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: suprice lead and 7 first -@d and ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: There was called TD about previous board |pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: 4@D was made with hesitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: bid 4@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
nt|famus: cards well placed for an over trick|pg||
nt|liujing: I wonder whether the best line is to draw only 1 trump with A|pg||
nt|liujing: and play @C AK|pg||
nt|liujing: can afford any 4-1 break in black suits|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
nt|yusufb: koz oynarsa|pg||

nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
nt|liujing: can this line be improved in bd6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
nt|dkkello: declarer duck?|pg||
nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
nt|tez: diðer masa da sarýgozun 3@h e nasýl battýðýna inanmak zor|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
nt|tez: @s çaktýrmayý düþünüyorsa  büyük @s oynayarak|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
nt|tez: artýk 3@h tehlikeli|pg||
nt|famus: i think play a small trum and then revert to @C--but have to retain @SA-play a @C and fin a @C shud b a winning line|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eleni: Basilis has to split honors in @d anyway|pg||

pc|d4|nt|tez: ortaðýnýn ne dönmesi gerektiðini söylemeli|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|timve:  yep, but can you bid 3NT with the northhand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||
nt|tez: hala @c kaybý duruyor..batacak|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like it a lot|pg||
pc|cT|nt|key1809: didnt unblock the dmds, hence 2 down|pg||
nt|eugenio123: :(|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  by the way, this hands perfectly demonstrates why you shouldn't have bid|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahri:  6 tricks, just like other table|pg||

nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||

nt|cicus: 4@C stand out inmy view|pg||
nt|ritong: one more time, the fact that pard is a passed hand is a factor  way less chances to have 3 NT cold|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence had to be precise to beat it..|pg||
nt|famus: so the Danes have managed to recover from the earlier shock|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cicus: ah this must be an agreement I am seeing for the first time|pg||

mb|p|nt|liraren: i am told that 5 @h in open room was 3 down|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|ntmon: turkish teams plays fien, steady game so far|pg||

nt|mamos: 6NT maybe even|pg||
nt|ritong: impatient to know what it is  a @c ask?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a @D transfer?|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt depence on lead -if @s -down but if you lead @h K-it makes -this has no future|pg||

nt|liraren: i have learned the hard way that pd NEVER have the perfect cards :) so nowdays i dont hope for it |pg||
nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||

nt|Gerben42:  wont happen here|pg||
nt|cicus: pretty good contract, only that @D lie will hurt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think 5@D goes down "zero dummy"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: he will make a lot of tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|zlatan: Hi all from sunny Nicosia|pg||
mb|1C|nt|eugenio123: 1nt I guess|pg||
nt|ntmon: OR is delay, we have lost immediate comparisons|pg||
nt|ritong: treating 5+@c and limit via stayman has a lot of charm|pg||
nt|ritong: @s*|pg||
nt|timve:  yeah I know its a lot|pg||
nt|lady007: NS have some thin chances in slam, but it wont make on this lay out|pg||
nt|arigun: 7@s e de raziyiz |pg||
nt|yusufb: seviye olarak 6 oynarlar|pg||
nt|arigun: 6@h ? o da olur :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eugenio123: like all juniors would|pg||
mb|1S|nt|key1809: yes, decent 5card suit, with 14, 1NT it is|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard on NS |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks normal here|pg||
nt|cicus: all of us would Stayman and invite, can't afford to lose a major suit game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eleni: welcome with us Konstantine:):)|pg||

nt|yusufb: south stil olarak 2 konuþmasýnda 2@s diyo|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT on a @H lead!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  2@H apparently Kokish|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  showing @H or big NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: agressive bidding all round|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||
nt|timve:  you can pitch a club on the fourth diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it seems hard to respect|pg||
nt|lady007: true|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d baþlamasý dogru|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 7 tricks, but East will face problems on pithces when north cashes clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was ose 30HP.|pg||
nt|chrisky: it has some problems on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||
nt|timve:  but I guess they wont bid 6|pg||
nt|yusufb: bence|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the point is you can use stayman as well with 5+@s, inviting values and any shape|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d baþlamasý gerekiyordu bence|pg||
nt|tez: ben ayrýlmak zorundayým..hoþçakalýn|pg||
nt|yusufb: byeee tezcan|pg||
nt|famus: but shud land in a @s partial--ah-uh--some imps back|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: south had extras so took one more|pg||

pc|hK|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||

pc|hA|nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
nt|arigun: dikkatli bir oyuna butun 6lar olabilir @c dahil|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu kadar boþa giden @c puanýyla 7 diyemez|pg||

nt|tez: yoruldum oluyor mu diye bakmaktan:)|pg||
nt|arigun: @c 8'li olsa garanti idi ama oyle deme :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 2@d 3@c 3@d 4@d...|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||

pc|d5|nt|juan lukas: not clear X by N over 4@s ? |pg||
nt|tez: perdeli oynanýyor maçlar..dolayýsýyla direktörler çok prim vermiyor ona|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't really go alonf with all that...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||

nt|offthebend: that H discard can be costly :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahri:  as he cannot have much more|pg||
nt|eleni: Konstantine is serving his military service in Cyprus:):) This is why he is not playing in this European Championship:)|pg||
nt|lady007: might make now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe pd was short in @S ...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: oh yes   you are right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats more like it|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|key1809: 4@H is a lucky make here, only a @H ace and back will defeat , very unlikely|pg||

mb|4H|nt|loe48: they lucky to get out of it.. i wouldnt like to play 3c x here|pg||
nt|key1809: good game reached, with @d finesse working, and 4th @d not getting over ruffed, he will be through|pg||
nt|key1809: unless afcourse north finds an inspiring lead of @h A and back|pg||
nt|pelu: @S lead - W has to duck|pg||

nt|key1809: yes, @S lead he has to duck and hope for ne continuation apart from @H|pg||
nt|loe48: spade lead make it rough yes|pg||
nt|key1809: and duck will be very unlikely, esp after the X|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|key1809: actually possible, as only 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|loe48: yes duck must be correct|pg||

nt|loe48: he may fast be on 4-1-4-4|pg||

nt|pelu: @S lead - and duck in CR|pg||
nt|galois85: but what about leading A@h and @h?|pg||
nt|key1809: West shd get a clue, that North if leads a @S,is not a ston, as South might have overcalled 2@S with 5c S|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|pinticus: A@h and @h was my lead,after 2@h constructive raise|pg||

nt|ybob: stiff Q@D was OK to X of 4@S|pg||
nt|juan lukas: with X  KJxx  AJxxxx  Ax   i think S would have bid 3@s splinter instead of 4@h |pg||
nt|dkkello: another great chance for Denmark coming up|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: further chance for Denmark here|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe a little poor hand, X KXXX AJXXXX KX|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello: an even 6 @C is worth 2 imps!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: East's Diamond exit was deadly accurate here|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: 6 on a hook....or a pin|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Gerben42:  2@H in the other room at this point was a bit wet|pg||

nt|key1809: N-S can make 3nt here|pg||
nt|lady007: I'm sure he isnt planning not to bid game :)|pg||
nt|dkkello: 2@D=limit+ or better raise of clubs , 3 @S shows stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the auction in OR looks strange to me, what can the 3 spade bid have meant?|pg||
nt|ybob: and GF|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@S on OR maybe shows m´s and short in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello: or will maybe  be an advance cuebid in a second when he bid 4 @C ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: hey boy! wait a few more years till you get middle aged:) Then years run fast:)|pg||
nt|famus: was this 2NT alerted|pg||

pc|s8|nt|zlatan: i played 3 times in this kind of championships, and as they say: "once a junior, always a junior"|pg||
nt|liraren: NS outbid again, |pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H making for NS  and not in the bidding at all |pg||
nt|liraren: but i am not sure i open with 1@h either in second seat vuln.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||
nt|dkkello: no :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely 3 spades in other room was a singleton heart as suggested by 2 specs|pg||
nt|ybob: and 9 + cards m´s |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if it does show clubs why not play in them?|pg||

pc|sT|nt|eugenio123: but south should've bid 3nt, not north|pg||
nt|key1809: North shd accept, he's a passed hand, and has Max for his pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Celik have told his hand well.|pg||
nt|ahri:  east showing concern about clubs|pg||
nt|dkkello: oops|pg||

nt|famus: now a @H is best|pg||
nt|famus: which Madala I'm sure wud work out|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lady007: actually the best game is 3NT, but this will also make with the diamond finesse onside|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|eleni: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|key1809: generally, its not right to lead from an Ace, witha 4card suit, esp in 3NT|pg||
nt|ahri:  well bid. everything lies well on tihs board too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: indeed why not play in clubs here...6 clubs looks the same play as 3N on the non diamond lead|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|key1809: yes, how will he figure out the spade K, |pg||
nt|key1809: maybe a 5nt ,now|pg||
nt|eugenio123: he knows nothing about K@H so it is difficult to place all his @h|pg||

nt|key1809: looks safe|pg||
nt|key1809: i presume, he will go for a trump lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it's hard, he would preserve his 10 @s |pg||

pc|cJ|nt|key1809: West is on lead|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  last board until the break |pg||
nt|cicus: 8 IMPs for us!|pg||
nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: gabor, behave!|pg||
nt|lady007: i think EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, also from honours so maybe east thought his partner had the queen|pg||
nt|timve:  thats a good explanation|pg||

nt|eleni: Let us hope Finos choses 5@s:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Dinos|pg||
nt|zlatan: after double 7@s looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|zlatan: not 5 :)|pg||
nt|eleni: right Konstantine|pg||
nt|eleni: 6 maybe due to K@h?|pg||
nt|zlatan: 5nt i think he choose now|pg||

mb|1N|nt|yusufb: 30 imp geriyiz fakat yetiþebiliriz |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW play transfers after 1-level overcall, but not after X ?|pg||
nt|cicus: no 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|eleni: there we go:)|pg||
nt|timve:  I played 2nd/4th, but this disadvantage is the reason I stopped playing it|pg||
nt|timve:  also its in more situations hard to read|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen@h@h Bonjour a Toutes et Tous@h@h|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt batýyo ama yaptýrýlabilir|pg||
mb|2C|nt|timve:  Im back to good old attitude switch|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, don't speake too soon...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
nt|eleni: now Basilis can not fail the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT defeat 10 @S anyway, declarer can duck or win but short by 1|pg||
nt|dkkello: hmm , sorry I was to soon :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice multi opening:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
nt|famus: if they land in 4@Hs--might get it o make it too--wud b a great board|pg||
nt|famus: *to|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
nt|yusufb: yaptýrcaklar inþallah yanýlýrým|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
nt|famus: bingo--trump lead best for defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: and this may be the right contract whatever the OR result|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 off @d save this home even with @h lead-also @s 3-3 -and overtrick makeable now|pg||
nt|eleni: Now Pierre needs to attack @s and ruff twice, while he still has entry to his hand with @dA|pg||
nt|ni hao: a pretty bloody match-lots of imps:)|pg||
nt|famus: there u go|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: with this lie, has to continue to have a chance to take a trump trick|pg||
nt|yusufb: ernin eli 2@h pas demezdi|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|zlatan: thats why i said 5nt as a try|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|famus: there wud b a final black suit squeeze and throw in perhaps|pg||
nt|famus: big swing to italy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: a spot-on remark from a kib: maybe W should have overtaken?|pg||

nt|tejjyid: What's your preference? 2NT unconditional force?|pg||
nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|ritong: too acid for my stomach|pg||
nt|lady007: its a nice contract but both club honours offside, as well as the queen of spades, might creat some difficulties|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards seems to be nicely for 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: in the open room, they bid 7s, and declarer finessed the 10!!!|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: he mithg 've playd J at least...|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@S if forcing is unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pinticus: some misunderstanding here,3@s is looking for slam|pg||
nt|ntmon: if 3@S forcing, how they invite?|pg||
nt|pinticus: on 15,Turkey in 3@c|pg||
nt|pinticus: they bid 4@s to invite :)|pg||
nt|ritong: because it s so funny when pard leaves it in, opponents think " these suckers forgot" and it is the only making spot|pg||
nt|timve:  more then some problems|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|chrisky: good pass for s|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C for a balanced raise is a good choice, the bid is idle anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like 3NT for the "Acol 2" type rebid; but I admit it's rare|pg||
nt|ritong: philo issue|pg||
nt|dkkello: No @H lead now , France closing in |pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|timve:  maybe south can read the points|pg||
nt|timve:  KQ of hearts, KQ of clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, heart ruff is a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  playing heart and another can sound good but it will help declarer with drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: whatever their methods are, they did not prove efficient|pg||
nt|dkkello: no way to lead @H K now|pg||
nt|ybob: if S play @C at trick 2  its easy to W ( after @D lead) A @C and K@H ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: cards lie badly for NS|pg||
nt|eleni: As announced: Israel and Poland are now tied in 1st place with 101 VP, 2 ahead of Italy and 9 ahead of France|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think the only contract that makes|pg||
nt|chrisky: only j@H beat -1|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C used to be good 6-4 but those types can be handled other in ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I've also seen 3 OM, but that's giving up another useful bid|pg||
nt|timve:  with @SA he would have doubled 2@S|pg||

nt|ntmon: 7 IMPS for Italy on  15 - getting few medium swings, Italy almost evened the match, but  17 might be costly|pg||

nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, trasnfers open's up a whole new range of possibilities|pg||
nt|eleni: a flat board that should be|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They have one good board each from here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is good for Denmark, 20 will be good for Sweden|pg||
nt|lady007: this hand looks more interesting|pg||
nt|timve:  wild board again|pg||
nt|lady007: 5@c by EW looks like it has some chances, and 3N as well maybe|pg||
nt|timve:  they both seem to make with all the finesses on|pg||
nt|dkkello: On running score board 14 is wrong |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  (although he was belgian)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and Hi|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes it does... almost too many options|pg||
nt|cicus: hi|pg||
nt|dkkello: and that defense didnt look right either|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C!|nt|eugenio123: nice auction right now|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a 4 imp gain for Greece|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly a good tool  needs a decade to get operational, perhaps|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's extraordinary what a huge impact such a small change has with transfer responses|pg||
nt|lady007: but difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|lady007: might end in 2@s here|pg||
mb|d|mb|r!|nt|famus: sry -1--forgot they were in 5 only|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tejjyid: and somewhat surprising it took so long to happen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Second time this set E-W in the open room bid a slam off two cashing tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 13 was the other one|pg||
nt|lady007: will east rebid 2@c or 2@d? and do they play some type of gazilli here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are we to see a easy major or an NT end EW?|pg||
nt|baardolav: It open one extra bidding round |pg||
nt|lady007: and now what. he might well pass|pg||
nt|lady007: it might depend on the meaning of a direct 2@s response over 1@h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eugenio123: bad now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Que with @H normaly|pg||
nt|ahri:  2@d is "weak weak two in major"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  2@h and 2@s are constructive ones, so west knows how to compite (and not to lead heart :D)|pg||
nt|ahri:  *compete|pg||
nt|lady007: I think 2@d is alerted because it shows less than 16|pg||
nt|lady007: but thats just a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: East shd jump to 3nt , showing  a max, 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|ntmon: this will end up with @H game, although NS have 4@S sacrifice available |pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the margin will be around 20 IMPs for Denmark when the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: but was right|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eugenio123: should be 15 16 points |pg||
nt|rodal f: E is finned|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Win 10, flat, lose 10 most likely|pg||
nt|famus: that wud set it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: there was a french "scientist" named gesthem who advocated this long ago  only got sneering in his own time|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lady007: IF a 2@s response to 1@h was weak, and IF 2@h showed less than 16, east might have tried 3@c here as west should either have a stronger hand than a weak 2@s jump, or only a 5crd ...|pg||
nt|lady007: suit and maybe a club fit|pg||
nt|lady007: but now lets see what happens to 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks like declarer will lose 2 clubs and 3 spades|pg||
nt|lady007: so probably just made|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wasn't W free to bid 4@D at the road?. My way always.|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: bridge is for fun, kjeld|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: transfer? 1@C-1@H was natural a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|ritong: a real visionary  created a system called " monaco" who still looks supermodern 40 years later|pg||
nt|baardolav: Ahh... sorry some kind of 4-6 hands, bidding @d first|pg||
nt|cicus: 1 diamonds is 0-7 points, natural or relay - is what I am told|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: this maybe expensive -they should have run to 2 @c -but perhaps no sats convension|pg||

nt|cicus: 1ha shows nt hand or hearts and clubs, 1sp asks, 1 nt shows balanced hand - same spec|pg||

nt|juan lukas: 3NT by N ? |pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahri:  most probably 3NT hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cicus: they must steer away from the rather poor slam|pg||
nt|ritong: just needs a @d jack to produce a cold slam|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|cicus: if the bid slam with @DJ and stay in 5@D without it we say well done|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if 2@s describes this handtype, the @s K is not wasted|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal 4 @s but bad sits -down 1 is the destany|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: this looks like 4 @s but can you make it -you have to be careful -@d ruff beats|pg||
pc|c5|nt|key1809: i like to play it as SFG|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back in 1½ hours with 4 more matches|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bmkl: Q@c?|pg||
nt|pinticus: so,last board of this set|pg||
nt|ybob: as 2@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think west should have bid 4 spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
nt|dkkello: I think 2 @H is more an overbid than 3 @S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks all for a nice segment. TKs specialy to the exelent vug. opperator. Tks aso to the specs for there nice input's. See u later.|pg||
nt|lady007: east not bothering to show his minor|pg||
nt|timve:  seems like an easy contract with both red kings onside|pg||
nt|runnerup: the other table made it i am told|pg||
nt|famus: this has been an eventful contest--both teams played well--But i give my vote to the Danes as winner in todays contest--they displayed great resilience--well done--Thanks alll|pg||
nt|liujing: last board|pg||
nt|liujing: a lot of swings in this segment|pg||
nt|spenny80: buffon|pg||
nt|spenny80: sorry it was my pw|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lady007: vd Bos might lead a club, which wont exactly be the killing lead, setting up 2 clubs for declarer|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4@s is a good contract : 1 down because of the @h stiff |pg||
nt|ybob: maybe win 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it seems declarer can be kept out of dummy|pg||
nt|ybob: because S has to play both red suits|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|timve:  the 6 and 7 of clubs should be reversed|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||
nt|timve:  would make the lead a lot better|pg||
nt|lady007: true. nice try by van Lankveld to play the 9|pg||
nt|timve:  the second round south can take the king|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
nt|lady007: then they can set up the suit next if partner would have A7x left|pg||
pc|c6|nt|key1809: west has to cash dmds, and play clubs for mini-tel no|pg||
pc|c8|nt|key1809: north knows, he's is sunk, as both suits are open, does he sttle for 6 tricks by finessing hearts, and cashing SA|pg||
nt|timve:  and finesse Q6 in west with A7 in north|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|cicus: and no rebid problem either|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ybob: and declarer can ruff the third @H trick to push trumps ( not play A@H ) later discard on A the @D looser|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzjn: bye|pg||
mc|9|nt|liujing: thx all|pg||
nt|famus: I was going to respond--since I praised the Danish boys more--maybe the Italian in you got aroused and called me a buffoon--haha:))))np Fabio|pg||
nt|liujing: 4@S is played in open room|pg||
