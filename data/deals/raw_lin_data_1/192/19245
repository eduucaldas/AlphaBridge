nt|tejjyid: Henri, hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|eleni: even 5 with a correct @d play:)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes an easy raise to game maybe via some gadget|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@h for N-S here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||
nt|eleni: Tis metadoseis tis imeras tis vlepoume sto http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Bulletins.htm|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|eleni: a lot depends on def.  as he has just 8 tricks, with correct guess in @s|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||

nt|cicus: with a fit jump, strengthis not particularly important|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I like to play fitjumps AND splinters, hard to organise|pg||
nt|ritong: which can make a considerable difference|pg||

mb|2H|nt|eleni: Mr.Grosset maybe never heard of 8 ever, 9 never:):) (too young for it:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: 1@h over X shows a good suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's harder to reach thatn to respect I guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: 4@S to|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ntmon: +130 available|pg||

nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|eleni: Basilis has to split honors in @d anyway|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cicus: in effect, Gazzilli tries to translate the standard opening into a strong club|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like it a lot|pg||

nt|ntmon: E could have passed with his collection|pg||
pc|h3|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 9tricks playing nt|pg||

nt|ntmon: i would recommend 4@S - natural |pg||
nt|ritong: drijver: "sigh"|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: N should pass, if he doubles, S will remove and he does not want that|pg||

mb|p|nt|key1809: 2nt, starts of Leb,weak hands i presume|pg||

nt|pinticus: X over 2nt could be penalty for one suit?|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  11 from the top in @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  trump lead required to beat the 12th even|pg||

pc|hA|nt|key1809: he might be planning to s/o in 3c|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or @D|pg||

nt|eleni: Dinos|pg||
nt|zlatan: after double 7@s looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|zlatan: not 5 :)|pg||
nt|eleni: right Konstantine|pg||
nt|eleni: 6 maybe due to K@h?|pg||
nt|zlatan: 5nt i think he choose now|pg||
nt|zlatan: and then 6@s|pg||
nt|eleni: he may chose a 6@d bid though promising both|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW play transfers after 1-level overcall, but not after X ?|pg||
nt|cicus: no 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|eleni: there we go:)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
nt|eleni: now Basilis can not fail the 6@s bid|pg||
mb|7H|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
