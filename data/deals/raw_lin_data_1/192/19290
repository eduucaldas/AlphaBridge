nt|ntmon: quiet 3NT for starter|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||
nt|arigun: 6 icin|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bmkl: Goodmorning everyone, wlcm to the 3rd round of Juniors Championships|pg||

nt|arigun: @s mecuber 1 tur daha boslayacak 10 love olacak|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bmkl: however not the same lead|pg||
nt|lady007: in the other room east foresaw that problem and raised the 1@s response over his 1@c opening to 2@s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  bad start for Germany... 4@S in the other room was a bad contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS can make 4@S but may not find that suit|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room E-W tried 3NT|pg||
nt|liraren: anyone know anything about EW system please tell me|pg||
nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||
nt|lady007: N will open 1@s, and will east overcall then? and if he doesnt, will south respond 1N?|pg||
nt|drserhan: 3 kategoride takým gönderen sadece 9 ülke var ve birisi de Türkiye|pg||

nt|ntmon: par here is 4@CX |pg||
nt|liujing: hi all|pg||
nt|famus: I noticed Bocchi appearing on the screen--I suppose to root for his juniors as well as his partner Madala|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Frank Bogen and Liu Jing|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: only partials here -even thought -4 @s doens seem so bad |pg||
nt|famus: Hi Liu Frank|pg||
nt|frankbo: hi there|pg||
nt|liujing: hi|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: 4@h seems a great contract for B-S|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the bad break|pg||
nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
nt|liujing: this must be an important match|pg||
nt|liujing: 2nd(ITA) against 3rd(DEN)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably he will leadwith Q@h|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it is really lucky 4@h. i'd love to see it playing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with hearts 3-3 is ok for 10 it seems|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 in sp might...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: hi to everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: Hello Basilis:):)|pg||
nt|lady007: NS also have some chances in 5@d played by north. but it wont make today|pg||
nt|dkkello: He will make i comfort witout a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|ybob: not necessary after this lead ...|pg||
nt|frankbo: now 4 might makes|pg||
nt|famus: the current standings are such that it can go to the wire in the final rounds:srael -275. Italy -261, Denmark -235, France -230. Norway -225, Croatia-221|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way the result will be -1 , it's impossible to find the 7th trick|pg||
nt|eleni: Thx operator of this transmission:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D start will kill 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: doubled  :)|pg||
nt|liujing: while Israel leads Italy by 14VP|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ntmon: as we don't exactly know what 3@S promises, it's not easy to tell who 'upgraded' - sure is 4@S has no play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree but still good save|pg||
nt|vasmar: hello|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 5 i think bill|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree with 1NT in 3:rd seat with 14 and a nice hand , harder for opps to deal with|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt yada 4 nt uygun yer..fazlasý tehlikeli|pg||

nt|ntmon: more ambitious 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: U wlc|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|helena sp:  5@d|pg||
nt|vasmar: so phantom sacrifice|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N is quite a bid. can be a disaster if partner doesnt bring anything|pg||
nt|arigun: tek sorun zeynep durabilecekmi|pg||
nt|tez: 4 nt derse þimdi 4@d ya|pg||
nt|tez: oynamak için olur..as sorusu deðil|pg||
nt|arigun: begenmedim oynamaya olmasi lazim|pg||
nt|frankbo: yes makes easy now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lady007: i think i would have passed with north but i wouldnt be happy about it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Alon Amsel|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  hi all|pg||

nt|drserhan: Diðer masada kýzlarýmýz 6 @C yapmýþlar ilk board|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ryskiel_: wynik jaki Pañstwo widz¹ na tablicy jest pochodn¹ zarówno dobrej gry naszych juniorek jak i nienajlepszej ich przeciwniczek|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Gerben42:  if you play any-strength 2-suiters, W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|tez: 27 puanla þlem..zor benim için|pg||
pc|h7|nt|possessed: 3sp probably means invitation with 4 card|pg||
nt|possessed: and balanced|pg||
nt|lady007: but even the king of club return wont give declarer an overtrick as he cant untangle his tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: especially as 4@h going down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI folks, sorry about the delay|pg||
nt|liraren: NS plays 5542 with transfer after the 1@c opening .|pg||
nt|liraren: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|famus: This will cost Imps to Denmark|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|ntmon: good guess by declarer|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lady007: maybe he could have tried to play another spade, in case partner has T9 of hearts|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, here comes one finesse|pg||
nt|lady007: oh no, wont help, he bid 3N so declarer will never play him for the stiff king|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|arigun: zeynep'in eli zor, bu eli 1@d-1@s-3@c baslamak lazim belki, simdi gucunu anlatamamis olmanin heyecaniyla 3nt'ye birakamadi|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gmarco24: after A@d situation is pretty clear for declarer|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table east opened the bidding and then EW missed 4@h|pg||
pc|d9|nt|juan lukas: push board |pg||
pc|dA|nt|lady007: not that it is a contract you want to be in when you only see 26 cards..... but it makes|pg||

nt|tez: kötü haber tez geldi|pg||
nt|arigun: hernekadar 2! benim de hosuma giden bir deklerasyon olsa da, ortakta iyi el varken bu olumsuzluga maruz kalabiliyoruz|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c bence de uygun|pg||
nt|famus: will be a BIG swing if Madala lays down @CK--which he will but for safety|pg||
nt|frankbo: great start for Italy|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|tejjyid: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||

nt|frankbo: well probl 800 in 2 D so|pg||
nt|famus: In their stride to 3rd place Denmark boys were very impressive--This pass of 1NTx wud certainly be discussed in the debrief|pg||
nt|famus: I think it wud go to 2@Hx mayb|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: this board can be interesting, they've lots of point but they just do 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: in OR, N repeated @H and drove EW to 3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: the bidding on this hand  seems to reflect the cards the players hold :)|pg||

nt|lady007: 1N did seem to go down, but i cant blame him for bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which suggests north has to x with that hand perhaps|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: well they were wise enough|pg||
nt|eleni: a helpful lead:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good lead|pg||
nt|frankbo: well all keycards nicely placed so|pg||
nt|runnerup: true -only club ruff treats and @s is 4-1 but should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I assume West's 4@S is fast arrival, showing his distaste for thesoft @C cards|pg||

nt|arigun: 1@h|pg||
nt|yusufb: atak sayýsý biraz garip|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Pass by S should show some interest in bidding ON -- with no interest he should have bid 3S immediately |pg||
nt|offthebend: and they have arrived in the right game contract |pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe 2@h could be brought home by EW|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, maybe. The Dutch EW are going to try that now :)|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|eleni: well Chris:) we said helpful:) not Christmas yet for Santa to be here:)|pg||
nt|chrisky: last chance|pg||
nt|offthebend: with 9-10 points and a 4-card S suit , one has to bid more than 1Spade over a T/O double of 1D :)|pg||
nt|liraren: with the first pass u can bid 2 @d with that kind of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: site for results http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i agree with subhash, you don't bid 2@d with only 4@s and say 2@h; if LHO bids 3@D you have to guess, may miss a cold 4@s or bid a ridiculous final contract|pg||

mb|1N|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||

nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
nt|famus: i think there surely was a case for @D red suit fin after @s have been cleared--cany make without that|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
nt|liujing: a rountine 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||

nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
pc|sT|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||

nt|ybob: on OR 2NT rebids showed 5/4 strong, 4@C was cue with @H fit from W and not clear to E |pg||

mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||

pc|dK|nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
pc|d5|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
