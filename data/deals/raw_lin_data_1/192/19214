nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW play transfers after 1-level overcall, but not after X ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
