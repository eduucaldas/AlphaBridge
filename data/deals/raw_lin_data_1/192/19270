mb|4S|nt|ritong: 2@d followed with 2 NT shows 22/23 more or less balaced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has to be played well -3nt easyer |pg||

pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  With 28-29 or more, 3 NT is often the best spot - like here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|ritong: a good idea for lhuissier would be to check the number of @c losers, in order to determine if he can afford to lose one trump|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|runnerup: but evem there clubs can be dead -if @h lead so difficult that also|pg||
nt|ritong: so, my move here qould be low @c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I see no reason to find the winning line here - looks like double-dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: not quite  but a little dangerous, yes|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  bad start for Germany... 4@S in the other room was a bad contract|pg||

nt|eleni: In the open room E-W tried 3NT|pg||
nt|liraren: anyone know anything about EW system please tell me|pg||
nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||
nt|lady007: N will open 1@s, and will east overcall then? and if he doesnt, will south respond 1N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: lloks like a partscore battle with Clubs for once winning out|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Vladimir and Doga|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|eleni: 4@h seems a great contract for B-S|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the bad break|pg||
nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably he will leadwith Q@h|pg||

nt|ybob: not necessary after this lead ...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: bye the way the result will be -1 , it's impossible to find the 7th trick|pg||
nt|eleni: Thx operator of this transmission:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D start will kill 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: doubled  :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ntmon: as we don't exactly know what 3@S promises, it's not easy to tell who 'upgraded' - sure is 4@S has no play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree but still good save|pg||
nt|vasmar: hello|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 5 i think bill|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree with 1NT in 3:rd seat with 14 and a nice hand , harder for opps to deal with|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: witam w 2 po³owie meczu Polska - Niemcy dziewcz¹t|pg||

nt|vugraphzjn: U wlc|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|helena sp:  5@d|pg||
nt|vasmar: so phantom sacrifice|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N is quite a bid. can be a disaster if partner doesnt bring anything|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lady007: i think i would have passed with north but i wouldnt be happy about it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  if you play any-strength 2-suiters, W should bid 3@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|possessed: 3sp probably means invitation with 4 card|pg||
nt|possessed: and balanced|pg||
nt|lady007: but even the king of club return wont give declarer an overtrick as he cant untangle his tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: especially as 4@h going down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI folks, sorry about the delay|pg||
nt|liraren: NS plays 5542 with transfer after the 1@c opening .|pg||
nt|liraren: hi and welcome|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ntmon: good guess by declarer|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lady007: maybe he could have tried to play another spade, in case partner has T9 of hearts|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, here comes one finesse|pg||
nt|lady007: oh no, wont help, he bid 3N so declarer will never play him for the stiff king|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|gmarco24: after A@d situation is pretty clear for declarer|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table east opened the bidding and then EW missed 4@h|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|juan lukas: push board |pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pass by S should show some interest in bidding ON -- with no interest he should have bid 3S immediately |pg||
nt|offthebend: and they have arrived in the right game contract |pg||

nt|chrisky: last chance|pg||
nt|offthebend: with 9-10 points and a 4-card S suit , one has to bid more than 1Spade over a T/O double of 1D :)|pg||
nt|liraren: with the first pass u can bid 2 @d with that kind of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: site for results http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i agree with subhash, you don't bid 2@d with only 4@s and say 2@h; if LHO bids 3@D you have to guess, may miss a cold 4@s or bid a ridiculous final contract|pg||

nt|mamos: yes an easy raise to game maybe via some gadget|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@h for N-S here|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C some Bergen raise ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||
nt|dkkello: Bergen raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||

nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||

nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||
nt|ybob: p p X ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, south has to move|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
pc|dA|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i bid X with S cards and go down|pg||

nt|ybob: i pass|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||
nt|lady007: if they dont get a ruff, 1 heart, 1 spade and a diamond loser?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bmkl: 3@c seems to be puppet|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|gmarco24: well, lead a club  :)))|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eleni: a lot depends on def.  as he has just 8 tricks, with correct guess in @s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|h9|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
nt|lady007: I expect west to come in with 2@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|possessed: 2d is- 20-22 with a five card suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: as Roland uses to say, @C suit died in 50-ties|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: probaly 21C Michael's or Ghestemish - both majors |pg||

nt|timve:  I think so|pg||

nt|chrisky: good bid by s|pg||

nt|eleni: it's simply indicative:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps 3NT has the same meaning in modern sytems|pg||
nt|lady007: he might bid 4C now, and if N doesnt support, bid 5@d later|pg||
nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, East hand strong after the 2 heart response|pg||
nt|ybob: on OR 2NT rebids showed 5/4 strong, 4@C was cue with @H fit from W and not clear to E |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||
nt|liraren: if right guess in @d they make 4@s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  not on @d lead|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  or switch|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N it is|pg||
nt|juan lukas: maybe 4@c then 5@h would have been clearer in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: defense can get 3 tricks|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass by south, it gives opps too much room to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@h pass or correct|pg||
mb|6H|nt|eleni: promising 1st or 2nd round control in @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: all in one..|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt 21-23 bal|pg||
nt|liraren: but i cant see why Tofte should guess right in @d|pg||
nt|lady007: 9 tricks are no problem on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 4@C its clear to @H fit, W could bid 3@S with @S fit over 3@H ...|pg||

nt|mamos: ok in 5@d  not so in 6@d|pg||
nt|liraren: but east didnt trust him|pg||
nt|lady007: if declarer has KJx you probably have to give him a heart trick anyway and then you have to hope partner gets the lead before he has 9|pg||
nt|timve:  good board for the Dutch|pg||
nt|lady007: the queen also caters for Jx in dummy and is unlikely to cost a trick|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ntmon: making games, of course|pg||
nt|bmkl: it seems the 3nt bid worked fine for Croatia|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: Q was a nice card for the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table North didnt bid 3@d and now has to decide over 3N if he still wants to mention them|pg||
nt|lady007: think it was better to bid 3@d immediatly and get it off your chest, so you dont have to guess later|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ntmon: anybody bidding @H by W?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H would not be my choice|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  partner would expect ... well... less|pg||
nt|ritong: i wouold like to play fitjumps with north hand|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit thin, but slam can be on very easily|pg||
nt|cicus: me too, although I was told they did not exist|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: problem, then:)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  east probably just thought that if they could have defeated the contract, they would have|pg||
nt|liraren: rather good 6@s here but the @d Q|pg||
nt|timve:  definately better to show your 55|pg||
nt|timve:  immediately|pg||
nt|lady007: he now bid 4@d over 3N. looks a little inconsistent IMO|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|key1809: can make 4s ,here on a spade guess, but tough to reach|pg||
nt|ahri:  we saw how 3NT ends on the other table though.|pg||
nt|ntmon: (i do)|pg||
nt|cicus: with a fit jump, strengthis not particularly important|pg||
nt|ritong: well he lacks the fifth @h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to play fitjumps AND splinters, hard to organise|pg||
nt|ritong: which can make a considerable difference|pg||
nt|cicus: important is at what level you are willing to play|pg||
nt|timve:  I have to agree Marion|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 5@c is great, even 6@c makes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eleni: Mr.Grosset maybe never heard of 8 ever, 9 never:):) (too young for it:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: 1@h over X shows a good suit|pg||
nt|lady007: E trying to double NS out of slam :)|pg||
nt|lady007: not that they will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|lady007: i dont like that double so much|pg||
mb|2D|nt|key1809: South will most likely TRF, and leave it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W make 3@S and N-S 3@h|pg||
nt|offthebend: North had to bring in the D suit for S to even think of slam anywhere -- with his poorish opening bid |pg||
nt|lady007: you mainly have a lot of spade tricks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eugenio123: it's harder to reach thatn to respect I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S to|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
nt|lady007: and west seems to think they are in a forcing situation?|pg||
nt|lady007: or maybe he thinks he hasnt showed his hand yet :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
nt|timve:  1NT with this hand is pretty agressive|pg||
nt|timve:  would you have bid it Marion?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south choses the best 3 card suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
nt|lady007: yes. i might have bid it as well, not wanting to miss a possible 4@h contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@d, @h to A@h, @d to K or...?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but a tough contract..|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C-1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vasmar: -50 instead -140|pg||
nt|gmarco24: make it simple|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ntmon: +130 available|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cicus: so you can combine fitjumps with splinters by using cue as splinter and jump shifts as fit jumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|liraren: more use of 4 @d that way than too use it as splinter in a competition bidding|pg||
pc|h6|nt|possessed: 1d was a huge underbid at open room to dbl|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vasmar: difficult to double 4@C for 1off|pg||

nt|lady007: true juniors playing here, 6 boards and 3 doubled contracts so far|pg||
nt|juan lukas: fine result for france in open room |pg||
mb|1C|nt|chrisky: a @S contract for ew|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42:  is similar to the prev. hand by her (probably) sister|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h doesnt look like a very good contract|pg||
nt|offthebend: North does not really have any convenient bid over the T/O dbl -- so pass will be ok but stretched to a RDBL  |pg||
nt|liraren: when i bid TO with west hand my pd always bid 3@c |pg||
nt|lady007: this looks like 4@s by NS|pg||

mb|1H|nt|eugenio123: both @h/@s|pg||

nt|ritong: difficult decision|pg||
nt|cicus: on a spade, we would go down quickly|pg||
nt|liraren: south must have  thougt that pass was forcing |pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: ahaha|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = strong hand supp 3° ...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahri:  sky being 12.|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes , Dennis BIlde shifted to a @C in open room in trick 2 , made it "easy" , but 3x @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||
nt|offthebend: basically HQ on side is needed for 4H to make and 3-2 split -- failing which some minor suit squeeze may develop against W who has made a T/O double |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: right, but a @c has to be given early to opps|pg||
nt|pinticus: seem 2@s=|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: 4@H is a better contract but no way to reach it|pg||
nt|ybob: no if it, declares play AK @S and run @D ...|pg||
nt|ybob: and win too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eugenio123: probably 2@d is a relay|pg||

pc|h7|nt|key1809: 2D=looked like a TRF,and accepting the TRF meant as 4, i guess, as we play the same:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||

nt|eugenio123: north doesn't have an easy lead, he doesn't know it would change nothing|pg||

nt|lady007: heheheh|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
nt|lady007: this dutch team might be difficult to beat in basketball as well, they are all very tall|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||
nt|dkkello: both of the french players were on the french team winning the worlds championship in Bejing |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 spades has chances it seems..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
nt|ybob: no with good defence|pg||
pc|hA|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||
nt|liraren: north is too passive I would have overcalled 2@c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
pc|h5|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||
nt|timve:  think its now always made|pg||
nt|lady007: they are in 4|pg||
nt|timve:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|timve:  also that|pg||
nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
nt|juan lukas: W can overruff the 3rd round in @h |pg||
nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
nt|dkkello: declarer duck?|pg||
nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
pc|cK|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eleni: Basilis has to split honors in @d anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|mc|8|nt|cicus: in effect, Gazzilli tries to translate the standard opening into a strong club|pg||
nt|timve:  yep, but can you bid 3NT with the northhand|pg||
pg||
qx|o9|st||md|3S82HQJ542DK73C964,SAJ543HKDA52CAQJT,SKQ976H9863DQCK72,STHAT7DJT9864C853|sv|e|nt|runnerup: then you dont have chances to finess -nicely Q of spades from North|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|ritong: they might land in 3NT here|pg||
nt|ritong: but north will disagree|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: i have been in worse 6 @d -but odds favor 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a good rule of thumb is " when preempted, keep low profile"|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|ritong: an other consideration is, perhaps the par belongs to NS in some doubled @hs, although here the start of the auction does not sound like it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: anyways, when you have a tough decision between slam or not at unfavorable vulnerability, take into consideration that, if opponents sacrifice, they might lose less than game bonus|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poussin: West also took into consideration than east is an aggressive bidder|pg||
nt|ritong: oui:)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|poussin: east's 5@d would not be everyone's choice|pg||

nt|tejjyid: There's a few problems with strong @C Gabor; Gazili sems like a nice compromise|pg||
nt|eleni: the @d9 was the key card:(|pg||
nt|vasmar: freak hand by North|pg||
nt|offthebend: hand for 6C |pg||
nt|offthebend: hope they at least get to some game |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  9 tables already played this hand, nobody (understandably) in 6@c|pg||
nt|liraren: i can´t imagine any bidding too 6@c so hope for game|pg||
nt|lady007: over 2@s, north will surely bid 2N and he might raise to 3 then|pg||
nt|timve:  well you can bid 2@S, but will you pass 2NT by partner? knowing you probably have a heartfit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well thats good defence...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahri:  quite distributive set this is|pg||
nt|pinticus: only 1 round today for juniors|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, certainly the best option for standard players|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C is much better than 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: a slam in @H or @C for ew|pg||
nt|vasmar: 6@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eugenio123: very unlucky 4@h|pg||
nt|tez: 4@s normal|pg||
nt|eleni: eaasy 6@hs|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1 @H looks sharp to me|pg||
nt|eleni: lucky break of @hs|pg||
nt|timve:  and is it invitational in your system?|pg||
nt|dkkello: the dane open 2 @H in open room |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: sonunda tabiki|pg||
nt|mamos: i think they will play 4@h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahri:  east must feel alone being balanced here :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's also becoming the standard option for the best players|pg||
nt|cicus: nice shift  of word order :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|liraren: what about light overcall , count the hcp in east :)|pg||
nt|lady007: no you will have to force to game then, but 3@h sounds more like a 5+card suit and less HCP|pg||
nt|lady007: partscore battle here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: aggressive 1@h|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D even more|pg||
nt|cicus: unfriendly lie of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|lady007: EW make 2@H (3 without the spade ruff) and NS can make 3D (4 without the club ruff)|pg||
nt|timve:  but the spadelead seems normal, the clublead doesnt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|key1809: bit can make, if spade is not led|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did u know that Franch have there national day today?|pg||
nt|mamos: wrong again  forgot to allow for NS lol|pg||
nt|eleni: nah Mike! Michaels coid in @d asks for a slam|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s bid made the bidding even easier|pg||
nt|eleni: void I meant:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@H much, much more :)|pg||
nt|pinticus: X by E shows strong hand,3@d shows limit 5@h4@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  two keycards missing here|pg||
nt|vasmar: double is dangerous|pg||
nt|offthebend: but does he gain anything out of it ?:)|pg||
nt|liraren: south X is transfer to @s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  tough call for north now, it's probably not clear that 3@c would be forcing|pg||
nt|dkkello: not my style |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|eleni: (sorry everyone for my typing:) I never qualified as a secretary:):))|pg||
nt|mamos: well done fellow commentators and Greek EW  (though I think French NS helped a bit :))|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ponaglaj¹ mnie do komentarza...co tu gadaæ - wszystko jasne|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  +50 was still worth 5 imps for Germany|pg||

nt|tez: tam olacak 3@s ..@h dam ataðýýndan sonra|pg||
nt|ahri:  diamonds behaving, heart ten dropping early|pg||
nt|eleni: a save to 7@d would win, as E-W have no 7@hs with a @s lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: 5@h4@d*|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czego siê czepiacie jednej lewki...to tak jak ze stowy wydawaæ grosza reszty|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  good call, he knows @c king onside and just hopes for an entry in dummy|pg||
nt|offthebend: but he may need two entries if Kxx of Club is with W and S has to have at least 2 cards in Clubs |pg||
nt|gmarco24: this guys are bidding like there's no tomorrow|pg||
nt|juan lukas: the 2@h opening helps EW to bid 5@d |pg||
nt|dkkello: 2 C!  maybe artificiel? dont know|pg||
nt|ybob: probably Gazzilli|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D alerted ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|eleni: Basil's hand can never pass:) sbl or no dbl:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjn: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: down 2 i d guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Quite a hard one. Let's see|pg||
nt|tez: @h kesiyorum diye 3nt demek þaþýrtýcý..9 kozu biliyor|pg||
nt|mamos: Im not sure N should be even thinking of bidding after South thought for so long|pg||
nt|offthebend: sigh of relief -- he didn't get a Heart lead |pg||
nt|lady007: worst thing that can happen in junior bridge is when you miss game|pg||
nt|ybob: was natural :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: brave x for spade lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahri:  well... this makes.|pg||
nt|ntmon: E could have passed with his collection|pg||
nt|juan lukas: X for the @s lead |pg||
nt|dkkello: i was told from reliabel sources 2 @C is natural |pg||
pc|s3|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, the defence may cash  a couple of @Hs first|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|key1809: still cant make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ntmon: raise to game is moot action even expecting partner a king stronger|pg||
nt|pinticus: yes,maybe W hoping for better @h suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: W could not be sure about the value of @SK at all |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so also 5@H here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: can see only S and W,the tray isnt here now|pg||
nt|cicus: where couple = 1 :) not allowing a club ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet still that @s bid deprived N-S from finding their slam|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eleni: well, up to tournament director that:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: Director is here|pg||
nt|lady007: interesting board for the defense|pg||

nt|pinticus: but he have a good @h support|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eleni: did TD accept the delay?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eugenio123: he needs a gift|pg||
nt|cicus: I am asked if 2@S was a 2-suiter, any ideas?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would think in that case an alert would appear|pg||
nt|ritong: ( a small foot tap for our operator  please indicate alerts):)|pg||
nt|cicus: confirmed, it was only spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like leaping Michaels when major is unknown|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: no problem, it cannot hurt to know your bias|pg||
nt|lady007: and also for declarer|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|gmarco24: mmmmm, great|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vasmar: commentating|pg||
nt|lady007: east knows declarer wont have any more hearts (partner wont jump to 4@h on a doubleton) so only chance now is to lead a club. but which one?|pg||
nt|timve:  @CQ seems pretty obvious|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, so "i am in trick, what now? what now?"  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: is there a chance declarer will misguess if he has the jack? i guess not|pg||
nt|timve:  but indeed maybe you have to trick declarar|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or partner  :)|pg||
nt|timve:  he knows declarer has K J AK, probably he has @CJ|pg||
nt|lady007: declarer will think long enough to make it clear that west has to play the jack :)|pg||

nt|mamos: double to start with foe North|pg||
nt|ntmon: ther was an accident for Italy on bd 8, arriving to 4@S on 6-1 fit with NT and @C game making|pg||
nt|ritong: wimp:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C stand out inmy view|pg||
nt|ritong: one more time, the fact that pard is a passed hand is a factor  way less chances to have 3 NT cold|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence had to be precise to beat it..|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d!|nt|cicus: ah this must be an agreement I am seeing for the first time|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally the @h xxxx is not a huge bonus|pg||
nt|cicus: 3+S, that is|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|timve:  well would you have bid 5@D with south?|pg||
nt|timve:  or would you have doublet|pg||
nt|timve:  doubled|pg||
nt|timve:  with A and K in the other suits|pg||
nt|lady007: i've seen Van Lankveld overcall on much weaker hands than this one, maybe the vulnerability scared him|pg||
nt|timve:  I think you can make a case for double|pg||
nt|lady007: yes i think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: i am told that 5 @h in open room was 3 down|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h looks makeable (2 hearts and a club loser)|pg||
nt|liraren: but then u have to start with the @c Q |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: turkish teams plays fien, steady game so far|pg||
nt|ntmon: fine*|pg||
nt|pinticus: yes,very regular pairs|pg||
nt|timve:  2 off |pg||
nt|timve:  it seems|pg||
mb|d|nt|key1809: E-W can make 5D, as i see it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt makes|pg||
nt|mamos: 6NT maybe even|pg||
nt|ritong: impatient to know what it is  a @c ask?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a @D transfer?|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: even if I don't agree with the jump 4@h, I would've bid just 2 @h|pg||
nt|mamos: oops wb|pg||
nt|cicus: I am told 3@D and 3@S are switched|pg||
mb|3D|nt|key1809: yes, it seemed 4H, was a stretch, but thats youth for u:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  first one of the match :(|pg||
nt|ritong: when south " raises" @ds, it becomes clearer|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 3@D=spades, 3@S=diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks for specs clarifying that|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  now this is definitely too high|pg||
nt|offthebend: I think East has decided that partner will have perfect cards :)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  quite surprised that they went overboard at both tables|pg||
nt|dkkello: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Denmark seem ok here as NS do ok in spades|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S was cold so 3@D is good spot|pg||
nt|dkkello: N-S conventionscard :  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010YouthPhiladelphia/Ortiz%20Patino/France/Grosset-Lorenzini.pdf|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Helgemo use to say to his pard: U did not have any 4 card color?|pg||
nt|drkvas: dbl dummy 4@h can be beaten|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry|pg||
nt|liraren: i have learned the hard way that pd NEVER have the perfect cards :) so nowdays i dont hope for it |pg||
nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||
nt|liraren: y i mean Kx onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: You can try and PIN 109 of clubs offside and K75 onside |pg||
nt|ybob: good lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eugenio123: I'm a junior too, I'm there just due of health :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I'm not there just due of health|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table, trumps were led and it was an easy win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  wont happen here|pg||
nt|cicus: pretty good contract, only that @D lie will hurt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think 5@D goes down "zero dummy"|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: he will make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @D seems normal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: But I don't know how to stop in 4@H, except by passing it|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: all games can be defeated|pg||
nt|ritong: lazar is satisfied with the contract, and has no clear reason to check if they can find a runaway if doubled|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, not easy to find a successful line|pg||
nt|dkkello: no|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||

nt|eugenio123: it doesn't matter , health first of all|pg||
nt|key1809: 500 it will be then|pg||
nt|eugenio123: if he plays @c just -1|pg||
nt|key1809: sry 200|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now needs xray glasses to win|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|key1809: ping -pong, back to 500|pg||
nt|dkkello: very aggresive dbl. from the danish North in open room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|liraren: maybee south should have found a double on 5@d, then its easier for north too double 5@h|pg||
pc|c7|nt|key1809: he ducked!! lol|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  so new leader|pg||
nt|ritong: an other borderline decision|pg||
nt|ritong: facing 1 NT|pg||
nt|liraren: no 5 @h was 3 down in open room|pg||
nt|timve:  25 points|pg||
nt|lady007: you counted that pretty fast|pg||
mb|1D|nt|zlatan: Hi all from sunny Nicosia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eugenio123: 1nt I guess|pg||
nt|ntmon: OR is delay, we have lost immediate comparisons|pg||
nt|ritong: treating 5+@c and limit via stayman has a lot of charm|pg||
nt|ritong: @s*|pg||
nt|timve:  yeah I know its a lot|pg||
nt|lady007: NS have some thin chances in slam, but it wont make on this lay out|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eugenio123: like all juniors would|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: yes, decent 5card suit, with 14, 1NT it is|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard on NS |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks normal here|pg||
nt|cicus: all of us would Stayman and invite, can't afford to lose a major suit game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eleni: welcome with us Konstantine:):)|pg||
nt|timve:  well if they lead a heart|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: *one|pg||
nt|offthebend: so 3 more imps to Denmark - in that case  |pg||
nt|liraren: y 12-22|pg||
nt|juan lukas: agressive 2@h and 4@h |pg||
nt|ybob: they are juniors :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  2@H apparently Kokish|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  showing @H or big NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: agressive bidding all round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||
nt|timve:  you can pitch a club on the fourth diamond|pg||
mb|5H|nt|eugenio123: it seems hard to respect|pg||
nt|lady007: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 7 tricks, but East will face problems on pithces when north cashes clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was ose 30HP.|pg||
nt|chrisky: it has some problems on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||
nt|timve:  but I guess they wont bid 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the point is you can use stayman as well with 5+@s, inviting values and any shape|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: south had extras so took one more|pg||
nt|ybob: agressive to bid not to punish !!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Gerben42:  6@H is much better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||
nt|cicus: little by little, Hungary is catching up|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lady007: you never know.... if there is no tomorrow ;-)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not clear X by N over 4@s ? |pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't really go alonf with all that...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahri:  hoping for partner's king to be black|pg||
nt|offthebend: undo |pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42:  5@H no, 6@H bugger|pg||
nt|offthebend: that H discard can be costly :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|ahri:  as he cannot have much more|pg||
nt|eleni: Konstantine is serving his military service in Cyprus:):) This is why he is not playing in this European Championship:)|pg||
nt|lady007: might make now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe pd was short in @S ...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: oh yes   you are right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats more like it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|key1809: North shd have hopped up, with the Ace and cleared clubs, |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: a little break now|pg||

nt|lady007: sorry, have to say: will make now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|Gerben42:  so lucky for Sweden that @HQ is doubleton|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  otherwise would be 14 out|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now only 1|pg||
nt|timve:  this is the second match these two pairs play|pg||
nt|timve:  Helmich Hop seem out|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|offthebend: throw West in with last D and get last two clubs after cashin S and Heart to the K |pg||

nt|lady007: maybe only for the moment|pg||
nt|lady007: no|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't see that west can x 4 hearts, and for all E knows west may be just spades..|pg||
nt|ybob: X  KJXX  AJXXXX  AX, W X 4@H too shows good hand with @S not penalty|pg||

nt|ritong: like 1@d 1@s 2@h pass 2@s|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ritong: an option is to play that " dustbin", meaning " i have not a particularly good hand, but i don t know what to bid"|pg||

nt|ybob: stiff Q@D was OK to X of 4@S|pg||
nt|juan lukas: with X  KJxx  AJxxxx  Ax   i think S would have bid 3@s splinter instead of 4@h |pg||
nt|dkkello: another great chance for Denmark coming up|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: further chance for Denmark here|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe a little poor hand, X KXXX AJXXXX KX|pg||
nt|ybob: cold 5@C|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Gerben42:  after being demolished by the two huge favorites, Eggeling - Brinck have a strong performance here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dkkello: an even 6 @C is worth 2 imps!|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mamos: East's Diamond exit was deadly accurate here|pg||
nt|mamos: It was a flat board 4@s -2 v 6@s -2|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: 6 on a hook....or a pin|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Wich partscore to see?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Gerben42:  2@H in the other room at this point was a bit wet|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Gerben42:  so another chance for Germany|pg||
nt|timve:  transfer to spades not sleminvitational|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe that means something different for this EW pair|pg||
nt|timve:  dont want my opponents get the chance to intervene|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems enough by 3@D. Who knowes?|pg||
nt|ahri:  we started so well, with all boards providing some imps, let's hope we are done with pushes. It's junior bridge after all :)|pg||
nt|cicus: ok, I checked the movie|pg||
nt|ybob: good bid 3@S by E|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eugenio123: 2nt is not enough!|pg||
nt|key1809: N-S can make 3nt here|pg||
nt|lady007: I'm sure he isnt planning not to bid game :)|pg||
nt|dkkello: 2@D=limit+ or better raise of clubs , 3 @S shows stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the auction in OR looks strange to me, what can the 3 spade bid have meant?|pg||
nt|ybob: and GF|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@S on OR maybe shows m´s and short in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello: or will maybe  be an advance cuebid in a second when he bid 4 @C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: hey boy! wait a few more years till you get middle aged:) Then years run fast:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zlatan: i played 3 times in this kind of championships, and as they say: "once a junior, always a junior"|pg||
nt|liraren: NS outbid again, |pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H making for NS  and not in the bidding at all |pg||
nt|liraren: but i am not sure i open with 1@h either in second seat vuln.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||
nt|dkkello: no :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely 3 spades in other room was a singleton heart as suggested by 2 specs|pg||
nt|ybob: and 9 + cards m´s |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if it does show clubs why not play in them?|pg||
nt|dkkello: what to lead? :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 10 @D|pg||
nt|juan lukas: any @d works |pg||

pc|s3|nt|key1809: generally, its not right to lead from an Ace, witha 4card suit, esp in 3NT|pg||
nt|ahri:  well bid. everything lies well on tihs board too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: indeed why not play in clubs here...6 clubs looks the same play as 3N on the non diamond lead|pg||

nt|cicus: 8 IMPs for us!|pg||
nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: gabor, behave!|pg||
nt|lady007: i think EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, also from honours so maybe east thought his partner had the queen|pg||
nt|timve:  thats a good explanation|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahri:  (and that partner's possible club strength is in shorter club hand... and ... and... :))|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: oops, was private :))|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2N!|nt|zlatan: i wont be surprised if they reach 7 of a major|pg||
nt|eleni: Let us hope Finos choses 5@s:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Dinos|pg||
nt|zlatan: after double 7@s looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|zlatan: not 5 :)|pg||
nt|eleni: right Konstantine|pg||
nt|eleni: 6 maybe due to K@h?|pg||
nt|zlatan: 5nt i think he choose now|pg||
nt|zlatan: and then 6@s|pg||
nt|eleni: he may chose a 6@d bid though promising both|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW play transfers after 1-level overcall, but not after X ?|pg||
nt|cicus: no 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|eleni: there we go:)|pg||
nt|timve:  I played 2nd/4th, but this disadvantage is the reason I stopped playing it|pg||
nt|timve:  also its in more situations hard to read|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  Im back to good old attitude switch|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, don't speake too soon...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
nt|eleni: now Basilis can not fail the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT defeat 10 @S anyway, declarer can duck or win but short by 1|pg||
nt|dkkello: hmm , sorry I was to soon :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and this may be the right contract whatever the OR result|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cicus: with this lie, has to continue to have a chance to take a trump trick|pg||
pc|dT|nt|zlatan: thats why i said 5nt as a try|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|cicus: a spot-on remark from a kib: maybe W should have overtaken?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  if it's showing @s +@c in swedish style (thanks ukdorj) then it makes more sense to me|pg||

nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|ritong: too acid for my stomach|pg||
nt|lady007: its a nice contract but both club honours offside, as well as the queen of spades, might creat some difficulties|pg||

nt|eugenio123: nooooooooo|pg||

nt|ntmon: 3@S if forcing is unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pinticus: some misunderstanding here,3@s is looking for slam|pg||
nt|ntmon: if 3@S forcing, how they invite?|pg||
nt|pinticus: on 15,Turkey in 3@c|pg||
nt|pinticus: they bid 4@s to invite :)|pg||
nt|ritong: because it s so funny when pard leaves it in, opponents think " these suckers forgot" and it is the only making spot|pg||
nt|timve:  more then some problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: good pass for s|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C for a balanced raise is a good choice, the bid is idle anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like 3NT for the "Acol 2" type rebid; but I admit it's rare|pg||
nt|ritong: philo issue|pg||
nt|dkkello: No @H lead now , France closing in |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|timve:  maybe south can read the points|pg||
nt|timve:  KQ of hearts, KQ of clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, heart ruff is a chance|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahri:  playing heart and another can sound good but it will help declarer with drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: whatever their methods are, they did not prove efficient|pg||
nt|dkkello: no way to lead @H K now|pg||
nt|ybob: if S play @C at trick 2  its easy to W ( after @D lead) A @C and K@H ...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: cards lie badly for NS|pg||
nt|eleni: As announced: Israel and Poland are now tied in 1st place with 101 VP, 2 ahead of Italy and 9 ahead of France|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think the only contract that makes|pg||
nt|chrisky: only j@H beat -1|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C used to be good 6-4 but those types can be handled other in ways|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: I've also seen 3 OM, but that's giving up another useful bid|pg||

nt|lady007: will east rebid 2@c or 2@d? and do they play some type of gazilli here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are we to see a easy major or an NT end EW?|pg||
nt|baardolav: It open one extra bidding round |pg||
nt|lady007: and now what. he might well pass|pg||
nt|lady007: it might depend on the meaning of a direct 2@s response over 1@h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eugenio123: bad now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Que with @H normaly|pg||
nt|ahri:  2@d is "weak weak two in major"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  2@h and 2@s are constructive ones, so west knows how to compite (and not to lead heart :D)|pg||
nt|ahri:  *compete|pg||
nt|lady007: I think 2@d is alerted because it shows less than 16|pg||
nt|lady007: but thats just a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: East shd jump to 3nt , showing  a max, 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|ntmon: this will end up with @H game, although NS have 4@S sacrifice available |pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the margin will be around 20 IMPs for Denmark when the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: but was right|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eugenio123: should be 15 16 points |pg||
nt|rodal f: E is finned|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Win 10, flat, lose 10 most likely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: there was a french "scientist" named gesthem who advocated this long ago  only got sneering in his own time|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lady007: IF a 2@s response to 1@h was weak, and IF 2@h showed less than 16, east might have tried 3@c here as west should either have a stronger hand than a weak 2@s jump, or only a 5crd ...|pg||
nt|lady007: suit and maybe a club fit|pg||
nt|lady007: but now lets see what happens to 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks like declarer will lose 2 clubs and 3 spades|pg||
nt|lady007: so probably just made|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: bridge is for fun, kjeld|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cicus: transfer? 1@C-1@H was natural a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|ritong: a real visionary  created a system called " monaco" who still looks supermodern 40 years later|pg||
nt|baardolav: Ahh... sorry some kind of 4-6 hands, bidding @d first|pg||
nt|cicus: 1 diamonds is 0-7 points, natural or relay - is what I am told|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|chrisky: no quess is neded|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|baardolav: a good game 5@d, a little bit unlucky|pg||

nt|eleni: now things look a lot brighter:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 19-11 VPs is my guess|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: A new @H are normaly the best def. Don't matter here.|pg||

pc|s9|nt|cicus: I can't tell how N knew S had not much wasted value inclubs|pg||

nt|lady007: lets see if they will compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 3NT by N ? |pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahri:  most probably 3NT hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: they must steer away from the rather poor slam|pg||

nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|cicus: if the bid slam with @DJ and stay in 5@D without it we say well done|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if 2@s describes this handtype, the @s K is not wasted|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: GF made|pg||

nt|lady007: yes but west has an aceless hand|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|rodal f: que by @S|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahri:  french kib (thanks) claims it's 4+@h 4+@s|pg||

nt|chrisky: 6@H -1 6@D =|pg||
nt|eleni: E-W as they are behind they are playing a catenaccio:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|key1809: he had 8 tricks in the bag, trying for overtrciks, and rightly paying the price|pg||
nt|rodal f: Switch a @C    @S NS and EW have a nice major|pg||
nt|ntmon: this is really strange development|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he didnt have the lead dbl would be nice|pg||
nt|ybob: J @D looks @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but surely NS have underbid, after all 5 diamonds a good contract|pg||
nt|juan lukas: if S has a @h honnor, then he can hardly have a @c honnor  for his bid |pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: and declarer may take the @c correctly |pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|nt|mamos: what was 3@c some gadget shame if you cant bid suit like AKQJx|pg||
nt|eleni: and how can they find those Cris, as none bid them?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW with combined 15 HCP X their opps in a partscore for penalty|pg||

pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
nt|dkkello: I think 2 @H is more an overbid than 3 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||

nt|lady007: east not bothering to show his minor|pg||
nt|timve:  seems like an easy contract with both red kings onside|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lady007: vd Bos might lead a club, which wont exactly be the killing lead, setting up 2 clubs for declarer|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4@s is a good contract : 1 down because of the @h stiff |pg||
nt|ybob: maybe win 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it seems declarer can be kept out of dummy|pg||
nt|ybob: because S has to play both red suits|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|timve:  the 6 and 7 of clubs should be reversed|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||

nt|lady007: true. nice try by van Lankveld to play the 9|pg||
nt|timve:  the second round south can take the king|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
nt|lady007: then they can set up the suit next if partner would have A7x left|pg||
pc|s5|nt|key1809: west has to cash dmds, and play clubs for mini-tel no|pg||
pc|s2|nt|key1809: north knows, he's is sunk, as both suits are open, does he sttle for 6 tricks by finessing hearts, and cashing SA|pg||
nt|timve:  and finesse Q6 in west with A7 in north|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cicus: and no rebid problem either|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ybob: and declarer can ruff the third @H trick to push trumps ( not play A@H ) later discard on A the @D looser|pg||
