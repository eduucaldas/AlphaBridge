nt|andyv:  since you've forced yourself to game via the dbl of 4@h, vul vs non, it should create an automatic force|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|andy_h: Not sure if leading the Q is right - if you rest in 4@S and assuming 2 diamond losers you just need to cater for 1 spade loser|pg||
nt|smirny: but after we had some bad boards as we could find S fit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|basu_4139: probably asks cue somewhere|pg||
nt|basu_4139: a 3H cue takes N into the perfect position.I believe a 3N shows a mild H.Any one suggests otherwise?|pg||

nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||

nt|chrisky: -1 is ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||
nt|loe48: so im not surprised if hey bid 4s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators, Peter Gill and William Frisby|pg||
nt|famus: and 2@s if bid will make for another 5/6 imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Germany has improved a litte getting 12 imp on Bd 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the match - many thanks to our excellent operator in Albena, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and congrats to the Swedish team on this win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  although this hand...|pg||
nt|andy_h: he could bid 4NT a two suited takeout*|pg||
nt|loe48: it didnt look like he tried to win it|pg||

nt|bagman: Thank you all|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with longer spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@s due to the extra spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: Braun is very conservative|pg||
nt|alati: einai afto pou legame ta palia xronia...|pg||
