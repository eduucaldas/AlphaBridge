nt|oosb: to settle your nerves|pg||
nt|eleni: only she had no communication|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Dag:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to follow more than this board: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ntmon: i think the route declarer choose is the right one|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
pc|h5|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||
nt|loe48: jepp|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: ER  missing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|loe48: auto 12|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|d3|nt|dagold: and easts is robertson|pg||
nt|ntmon: declar can to ruff two @H in hand an make the contract|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h3|nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||

nt|gio 89: (you will excuse me if i won't be 100% impartial :) )|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|frankbo: fikk hjem 4S i åpent på første spillet|pg||
nt|uttam: guess he will play 4s|pg||
nt|eleni: those were their tricks, either way, with or without a ruff|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@D multi here, 2@H pass or correct|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S makeable on a good trump guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||

nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Frank Bogen:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: i admit i would probably lead a @C|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||

nt|spenny80: sometimes you can make 3NT (xxxxxx@c or like) but bidding a new double you don't arrive at 3NT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dagold: Some players would overcall 1@s with the south hand but these Israeli players are very sound|pg||

nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||

pc|h5|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||

nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||

pc|d5|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||

nt|mrdct: can may 6@c or 6@s here if you are good at dropping Qs offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I say that North should nt take bidding to shes hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: and go 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. 6@S-1 i OR og 17IMP til Belgia.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems as def slipped at 1!NX made 7 and Netherland back in the lead.|pg||
nt|ntmon: large gain for Italy, now match almost close|pg||
nt|spenny80: they don't play polish club?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|murat e: east must avoid spade lead though|pg||
nt|oosb: Is everyone bidding 3@H here?|pg||
nt|uttam: 4h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure after the x..|pg||
nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||

nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|timve:  good contract, but normally going off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  No more comments to-day - this is too much|pg||

nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||

nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ntmon: same start as in OR|pg||
nt|spenny80: you have not indication, have you?|pg||

nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lucky|pg||
