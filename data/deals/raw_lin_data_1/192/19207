mb|p|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hi all:) I will comment, but in Polish - I m Ryszard Kielczewski|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ryskiel who will be commenting in Polish|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

pc|hT|nt|henryb:  A general word to kibitzers: I get about 10 comments from you a minute. I can't respond to all, in fact to very few, but I do appreciate them|pg||
nt|loe48: very careful by N with 10 points, but as we see have no real s stopper so cant bid  1nt |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: if north did double then south might bid 4@D - if you can make a partscore your way it's always just bad news to let opps get away with losing a 50 or two|pg||

mb|2S|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: przychylne uk³ady dla WE - nawet 10 lew mo¿liwe|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Sr2@D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  S has shown 5+@h also|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||

nt|athene: east might have dropped the @SJ at trick 1|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
