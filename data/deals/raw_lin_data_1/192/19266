nt|Walddk2: aus Østerbro|pg||
nt|hawe45:  God aften - pÃ¥ dansk formoder jeg...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 16.30 is hardly 'aften'|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Her har vi "beviset" - med 28-29 HP tilsammen og mere, skal man ofte vÃ¦lge 3 NT og ikke 4 i major...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: 2@d followed with 2 NT shows 22/23 more or less balaced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has to be played well -3nt easyer |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right Hans, but we have English commentary in this room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Jeg troede afternoon betÃ¸d aften - lyder sÃ¥dan..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK, english|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ænglis|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  With 28-29 or more, 3 NT is often the best spot - like here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|ritong: a good idea for lhuissier would be to check the number of @c losers, in order to determine if he can afford to lose one trump|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|runnerup: but evem there clubs can be dead -if @h lead so difficult that also|pg||
nt|ritong: so, my move here qould be low @c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I see no reason to find the winning line here - looks like double-dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: not quite  but a little dangerous, yes|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ritong: very often, the way to handle trumps is related to the number of allowed losers|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: this is, by the way, one of the main differences between IMPs and MPs|pg||
nt|runnerup: but if you take @s ace and a small -to see the sits -you have to enter @c Q -to make this|pg||

nt|lady007: hi all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they raised the bidding to 3rd level with just 9 hcp|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|eugenio123: I don't agree 1NT by north, it seems to be a natural bid which doesn't have any sense|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to this broadcast from Albena-Bulgaria:)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hi Marion, welcome, glad to have you here|pg||

nt|ntmon: quiet 3NT for starter|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bmkl: Goodmorning everyone, wlcm to the 3rd round of Juniors Championships|pg||
nt|ybob: hard lead to S , only @H lead was Ok|pg||

nt|lady007: in the other room east foresaw that problem and raised the 1@s response over his 1@c opening to 2@s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|poussin: 2@s = 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Special french - 2 @S showing @H|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, suits break more friendly than previous board|pg||
nt|poussin: they inverted the meaning of 2@s and 2@h, 2@s shows 4+@h and 2@h denies @h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what makes bridge so entertaining|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|ritong: here, south is not super happy to lead a @c, but other choices look even worse|pg||
