nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hi all:) I will comment, but in Polish - I m Ryszard Kielczewski|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: celne otwarcie Overbeeke|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: first blood for Netherland|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c3|pc|s8|nt|gronkvist:  But W could always make it but it would be harder|pg||

nt|loe48: very careful by N with 10 points, but as we see have no real s stopper so cant bid  1nt |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|athene: if north did double then south might bid 4@D - if you can make a partscore your way it's always just bad news to let opps get away with losing a 50 or two|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi johan, spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ryskiel_: przychylne uk³ady dla WE - nawet 10 lew mo¿liwe|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c6|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  Normaly she would bid first round|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: she decided to trhow 7 @c |pg||

nt|athene: if he thinks they are 5-3 he might just take the club finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
mb|3N|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||

nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||

nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||

nt|henryb:  The road to bad boards is paved with greed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  east is lucky north had a bid |pg||

mb|3C|nt|eugenio123: 1nt??? why not 2 or 3@C?|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with the north hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||

nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
