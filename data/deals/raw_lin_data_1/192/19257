mb|p|pc|d9|nt|key1809: Declarer cant afford to duck,and later on has entry problems to play @D from Dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can make if he risesn and take the spade finesse|pg||

nt|key1809: but i guess west may be endplayed into opening a suit and allow the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If West ducks you get out with a club to the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and West is endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is makeable, at least for me|pg||
nt|key1809: If he plays a @C to the 10, win the J, cash 2 @H ending in east, and push a club, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: How about a diamond to the 8 then?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 10 is marked after the lead|pg||

nt|vasmar: hello|pg||

nt|vasmar: so phantom sacrifice|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  NS here played with the U20's in Brasov 2009|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|eleni: welcome Chris:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|eugenio123: this board can be interesting, they've lots of point but they just do 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: in OR, N repeated @H and drove EW to 3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: the bidding on this hand  seems to reflect the cards the players hold :)|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure declarer can come to nine tricks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: punkty zdobywa³y te¿ dobrymi rozgrywkami Kazmucha i ¯muda|pg||

nt|vasmar: diamond swich is bad for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i am here on night leave|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3D - an exploring bid -- just in case S has bid 2S on a 4-card suit and values . 3NT may be better |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: well they were wise enough|pg||
nt|eleni: a helpful lead:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I assume West's 4@S is fast arrival, showing his distaste for thesoft @C cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Pass by S should show some interest in bidding ON -- with no interest he should have bid 3S immediately |pg||
nt|offthebend: and they have arrived in the right game contract |pg||
pc|dA|nt|bmkl: 2 boards, 2 overtricks for France|pg||
nt|chrisky: no a @D is....|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Kazmucha nb. zosta³a w biuletynie przedstawiona jako Bu³garka|pg||
nt|garden2005: z racji|pg||
nt|liraren: i think that 2@s promise 5 card , if u only have 4 card @s u can bid 1@s and if pd pass u dont do any game and if pd have 4 card @s pd raise to 2@s with 14p or moore|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|Gerben42:  nice to have @H7|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I guess they play 2@c as drury|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: defence can lead trumps to defeat  easily in a  moment|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eleni: They found the correct contract |pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: That lead simplifies matters, but North had no reason to lead a @C - given that Suth didn;t open|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi all!!:)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|eleni: well Chris:) we said helpful:) not Christmas yet for Santa to be here:)|pg||
nt|chrisky: last chance|pg||
nt|offthebend: with 9-10 points and a 4-card S suit , one has to bid more than 1Spade over a T/O double of 1D :)|pg||
nt|liraren: with the first pass u can bid 2 @d with that kind of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: site for results http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i agree with subhash, you don't bid 2@d with only 4@s and say 2@h; if LHO bids 3@D you have to guess, may miss a cold 4@s or bid a ridiculous final contract|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  yes, especially vul|pg||
nt|liraren: and vuln!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||

nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ntmon: rise with @DA, @C, and ruff a @C |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|eleni: a lot depends on def.  as he has just 8 tricks, with correct guess in @s|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|s3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ntmon: nice guess in @H suit|pg||

pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|ntmon: dec could not err|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pinticus: easy now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|offthebend: and he will now go down in 2D also -- despite partner having such a good support in other high cards |pg||
pc|c6|nt|Gerben42:  after -80 probably equal again|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i think Ege made a mistake here. He got greedy trying to win an extra trick by finessing in spades|pg||

nt|tejjyid: "6 decent cards in a pleasant hand" is a good description (probably not acceptable in the ACBL)|pg||
nt|ritong: no comment|pg||
nt|offthebend: only 3 imps tho - deserve more than that |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  only 3 imps, but it should have been 5 for denmark|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d by south I guess|pg||
nt|ahri:  (almost) misfit distributive hands, this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  East was squeezed on  3 - nice play by Giampetro on that one|pg||
nt|ritong: south has to invite|pg||
nt|ritong: a natural 2NT seems to match his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it'sa whole lot of losers, but too many points to do less|pg||
nt|tejjyid: great bid,the natural 2NT|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  it all depends on how do you agree what 3@h is here. some play it forcing, some play it constructive NF, I don't find any of those "wrong" :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our open table is really taking its time:)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|eleni: an over-ambituous 3NT:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  west is quite aggressive and unpredictable. I know that best, he's my ex partner :)|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 minor nS|pg||
nt|liraren: double fit for both pairs now maybee some action|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: 2d is- 20-22 with a five card suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: as Roland uses to say, @C suit died in 50-ties|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: probaly 21C Michael's or Ghestemish - both majors |pg||
nt|eleni: a tricky lead of small !g can keep them off slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East  not wanting to be excluded lol|pg||
nt|eleni: !g|pg||
nt|eleni: THX Todor dear for the explanations:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but east should have taken @DA earlier|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: everyone cuebidding :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: good bid by s|pg||
nt|chrisky: it promisses fit in @D|pg||
nt|eleni: it's simply indicative:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps 3NT has the same meaning in modern sytems|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||
nt|liraren: if right guess in @d they make 4@s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  not on @d lead|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  or switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: defense can get 3 tricks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass by south, it gives opps too much room to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@h pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: promising 1st or 2nd round control in @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: all in one..|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt 21-23 bal|pg||
nt|liraren: but i cant see why Tofte should guess right in @d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  after trick 1, i can imagine many cases where it is interesting to switch to clubs and many cases where you should play your singleton @d|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  but it shouldn't be a guess|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  with singleton heart in dummy, north should be able to indicate whether he holds something in clubs (Q or K) or not by playing his smallest or largest card|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|liraren: now south have been carding too honest |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahri:  just one club for defenders |pg||
nt|ahri:  of course, but not two clubs :)|pg||
nt|ahri:  there wasn't a chance for two, just saying that east will either have to give spade to king or return clubs himself|pg||
nt|ahri:  unless south tries spade now|pg||

mb|p|nt|ntmon: making games, of course|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|ntmon: anybody bidding @H by W?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H would not be my choice|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  partner would expect ... well... less|pg||
nt|ritong: i wouold like to play fitjumps with north hand|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit thin, but slam can be on very easily|pg||
nt|cicus: me too, although I was told they did not exist|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: problem, then:)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  east probably just thought that if they could have defeated the contract, they would have|pg||
nt|liraren: rather good 6@s here but the @d Q|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|3H|nt|key1809: can make 4s ,here on a spade guess, but tough to reach|pg||
nt|ahri:  we saw how 3NT ends on the other table though.|pg||
nt|ntmon: (i do)|pg||
nt|cicus: with a fit jump, strengthis not particularly important|pg||
nt|ritong: well he lacks the fifth @h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to play fitjumps AND splinters, hard to organise|pg||
nt|ritong: which can make a considerable difference|pg||
nt|cicus: important is at what level you are willing to play|pg||
mb|p!|nt|eleni: Mr.Grosset maybe never heard of 8 ever, 9 never:):) (too young for it:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: 1@h over X shows a good suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|key1809: South will most likely TRF, and leave it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W make 3@S and N-S 3@h|pg||
nt|offthebend: North had to bring in the D suit for S to even think of slam anywhere -- with his poorish opening bid |pg||
mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: it's harder to reach thatn to respect I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S to|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
pc|d6|nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C-1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vasmar: -50 instead -140|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ntmon: +130 available|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: so you can combine fitjumps with splinters by using cue as splinter and jump shifts as fit jumps|pg||
mc|11|nt|liraren: more use of 4 @d that way than too use it as splinter in a competition bidding|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|key1809: 2D=looked like a TRF,and accepting the TRF meant as 4, i guess, as we play the same:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||
nt|key1809: ok, might be 2D as FG relay as a spec suggested|pg||
nt|eugenio123: north doesn't have an easy lead, he doesn't know it would change nothing|pg||

nt|ahri:  i imagine french staying calm|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: a little nervous in french team|pg||
nt|mamos: France gained 3 imps on Board 5 when not only did Greek NS not bid Slam  they defended 4@Sx and only scored 500|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'd like ot know how North worked out to exit that @S|pg||
nt|ritong: would you respond to 1@s with south hand?|pg||
nt|cicus: I may be unfair, maybe he thought he could still make if @HK lies wellla fter all|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I do with an Ace|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but typically my partnerships open 1@S very heavy|pg||
nt|vasmar: unlucky 4@S for N-S|pg||
nt|offthebend: after the RDBL , the player always owes a bid to his partner |pg||
mb|1S|nt|key1809: 6h, a decent contract, needing 3-2 hearts, but not here with a bad break|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that LHO is a passed hand is a factor imo|pg||
nt|ritong: he is less likely to balance|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
mb|2D|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||
nt|liraren: north is too passive I would have overcalled 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
pc|s5|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
pc|sK|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|eleni: Basilis has to split honors in @d anyway|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cicus: in effect, Gazzilli tries to translate the standard opening into a strong club|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like it a lot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|key1809: didnt unblock the dmds, hence 2 down|pg||
nt|eugenio123: :(|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  by the way, this hands perfectly demonstrates why you shouldn't have bid|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ntmon: then 3NT is right|pg||

pc|d4|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||

nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||

nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||

nt|bmkl: flat board it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: double to start with foe North|pg||
nt|ntmon: ther was an accident for Italy on bd 8, arriving to 4@S on 6-1 fit with NT and @C game making|pg||
nt|ritong: wimp:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C stand out inmy view|pg||
nt|ritong: one more time, the fact that pard is a passed hand is a factor  way less chances to have 3 NT cold|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|cicus: ah this must be an agreement I am seeing for the first time|pg||

nt|cicus: 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|liraren: i am told that 5 @h in open room was 3 down|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h looks makeable (2 hearts and a club loser)|pg||
nt|liraren: but then u have to start with the @c Q |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ntmon: turkish teams plays fien, steady game so far|pg||

nt|mamos: 6NT maybe even|pg||
nt|ritong: impatient to know what it is  a @c ask?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a @D transfer?|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: even if I don't agree with the jump 4@h, I would've bid just 2 @h|pg||
nt|mamos: oops wb|pg||
nt|cicus: I am told 3@D and 3@S are switched|pg||
mb|5H|nt|key1809: yes, it seemed 4H, was a stretch, but thats youth for u:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  first one of the match :(|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: 3@D=spades, 3@S=diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks for specs clarifying that|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  now this is definitely too high|pg||
nt|offthebend: I think East has decided that partner will have perfect cards :)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  quite surprised that they went overboard at both tables|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Helgemo use to say to his pard: U did not have any 4 card color?|pg||
nt|drkvas: dbl dummy 4@h can be beaten|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry|pg||
nt|liraren: i have learned the hard way that pd NEVER have the perfect cards :) so nowdays i dont hope for it |pg||
nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||
nt|liraren: y i mean Kx onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: You can try and PIN 109 of clubs offside and K75 onside |pg||
pc|s4|nt|eugenio123: I'm a junior too, I'm there just due of health :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I'm not there just due of health|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  wont happen here|pg||
nt|cicus: pretty good contract, only that @D lie will hurt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think 5@D goes down "zero dummy"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: he will make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @D seems normal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: But I don't know how to stop in 4@H, except by passing it|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Gerben42:  2@H apparently Kokish|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  showing @H or big NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it seems hard to respect|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 7 tricks, but East will face problems on pithces when north cashes clubs|pg||

nt|key1809: declarer not committing, and waiting to get the point coint to determine what to do|pg||
