pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|eleni: nice return by Giannis|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andy_h: The standard lead for a trump (opening) lead is usually small because you never know if any of your big trumps can be promoted (you never know!). But otherwise if they are actually ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: useless or of equals then you can use them as suit-preference signals|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|sharkey: This match consists of 20 Boards - round-robin format so a lot of bridge will be played henceforth |pg||

pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|eleni: It all depends on his inspiration for the @d|pg||

nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|famus: 4@cs??|pg||
nt|famus: difficult now--but has v good @cs|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would bid 4D |pg||
nt|famus: why?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: showing unbalanced hand 1453|pg||
nt|bagman: Good stop here; in practice declarer would go down in 6  by taking the club finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: wlc Alex|pg||
nt|alati: me tin idia sintagi me ti dianomi 12 , prosdokw na paroume akoma 13 impakia |pg||
pc|hK|nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5NT is a dangerous bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you arent even sure yourself, how can partner be|pg||
nt|henryb:  With @h 4-4 this is not a challenging hand; If @h were 5-3 declarer would have to find the @cQ|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Gerben42:  still avoided the grand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sunsamvar: if South had passed they might hv got the @S fit early and got to 6@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S suit lost...|pg||
nt|eleni: a helpful lead for W|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - not everone agrees South's hand is an opener - esp 1@D which may not even show @D...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roussol: club best lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkey: North decided to master mind this hand and drove to slam despite warnings|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|chrisky: for the overtrick|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eleni: J@c would be the best return from Peter now|pg||
nt|roussol: yes but no interest|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: That probably means that Greece won 13 IMPs on 12 when the Finns went down on a good slam which was missed here|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|famus: has already shown @s shortage-whn he bid 3@cs--but Rusch knows that his pd's @c holding is Qhi at best--so he cant provoke and signed of in 3!NT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||

mb|p|nt|chrisky: best lead for def|pg||

nt|roussol: if|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|sharkey: 3 NT here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and to the specs for watching|pg||
nt|henryb:  But if E opens, less so. I do not think East should open|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roussol: he must abandon @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 2@s in the open room are been played now|pg||
