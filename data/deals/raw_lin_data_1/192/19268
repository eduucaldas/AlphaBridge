nt|mug: good afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: not a very appealing lead choice for south|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: lead away from a tenace into a strong balanced hand, or lead a singleton trump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: hello all from Albena resort - the host of 23rd Euro Youth Championship|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the diamond would be most people's choice - is it asking too much for partner to have the @DJ?|pg||
nt|mug: I think the diamond lead was pretty normal, if you blow a trick in diamonds it may well be it was going on something else anyway|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|lady007: have to lead something|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mug: I'd have probably thought there's a danger of losing two clubs and a heart, so I need to try and drop the trump queen|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he felt that this was a safety play against 4-1 trumps and also picks up 109 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't necessarily afford any safety plays|pg||
nt|mug: could even be @SQ109x|pg||
nt|athene: also it might be Q109x!|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|mug: snap, both read The Expert Game|pg||

nt|athene: so J from J9, etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: he could, of course lead small trump from his hand on the second round of trumps...now he needed both dummy's honours to be well placed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: maybe he could consider leading a club first|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: another 4@s coming up here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: to see how many spade losers he can afford|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: it's possible but opens up other cans of worms|pg||

nt|mug: good technique here, starting on the side-suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mug: if he's watching the pips he'll note that @H6 has become good|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if north could have dropped the @S10 on the first round, sort of following from last hand's theme|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|Gerben42:  why not 2@C then bid 2@S|pg||
nt|smirny: well for me x and 3c is stronger that this hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  when he has trumphs left in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: 2@S relay|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so a nice start for Croatia |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  promise support?|pg||
mb|3H!|an|5-5 min.|nt|smirny: yes i would bid 2C instead of DBL|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and 3@H instead of 2@D?|pg||
nt|smirny: and west thinks that his hand is too strong for 3H over DBL|pg||
nt|smirny: intresting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H maybe shows @Sxx @Hxxxx @Dxxxx @Cxxx|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d has some play ,but can you bid it?|pg||
nt|rensph: yes, somewhat surprised he underestimated the danger of drawing all trumps there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: no, not promising anything yet, just asking|pg||
nt|rensph: 3@H 5-5 without extras|pg||

nt|lady007: what will drijver bid now? dbl?|pg||
nt|mug: too strong for 2@D so start with a double?|pg||
nt|athene: not the hand you enjoy having if you play forcing notrump|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H!|mb|2S|nt|athene: 2@D would be a real 2@H bid, i assume, so 2@H just says "i know about the Law and all that"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|mug: gone a bit astray here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: South looking for heart guard, North showing his 3-card spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: these interrupts are intentional ... we have to prove that the Internet provider is bulgarian|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mug: but 5@D is cold and perhaps you can make 4@S too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|lady007: difficult hand, i can understand that drijver was a little worried about 3N but maybe south would have bid 3S with 5S?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mug: looks like two spades and a heart to lose but will need careful handling |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: everyone can make 5@d|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|mug: he might have done, or he might have doubled 2@H with his actual hand if permitted by system|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N will also have some chances if partner has the ace of spades and queen of clubs, even with the spade finesse offside as west might be squeezed and endplayed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: 4@s requires more precautions|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, if north will usually respond 2@s if he has 4, then double will work better|pg||
nt|mug: naturally West started the force from trick one, South couldn't have @HK on the bidding|pg||

nt|panja: and now...if N passes, will E bid further?|pg||
nt|panja: N should not pass as he know EW have a good @H fit...|pg||
nt|eleni: another misfit though|pg||
nt|panja: and if E escapes to 1@H..and W raises..it will be difficult to get in later..|pg||
nt|panja: so bidding 2@D now..is the best option|pg||
nt|runnerup: a possible slam -down ofcause but ..|pg||
nt|runnerup: i would say only @h lead let it make|pg||

nt|blum1956: yes you're right but a @d lead looked most strange|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam in @c |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|an|t/o|nt|bagman: His best shot is probaly to set up the spades and then continue spades|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is even better..showing 10+ HCP, exact desription of his hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: good|pg||

nt|eleni: His parents play that 2@c for both majors in such cases:) not sure about Peter though|pg||
nt|panja: now. E will not lead @H..|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect slam missing, in my opinion North was too passive|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 @c looked very much like an under bit --if you have about 10 tricks in your own hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: lots of South hands make a slam near 100%|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: it should only be a cue, 10+ HCP...|pg||

pc|c4|nt|rensph: defense can cross in @H twice to cash 3 @S tricks for down 1 now, S has to avoid playing spades from his side|pg||

nt|gmarco24: maybe -1 after good guess in first trick, let's see...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 3rd seat at favourable it can be anything can't it?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The 5th and last diamond|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|Walddk4: Not yet|pg||

mb|d|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lady007: will need a singleton spade with partner to give slam a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but partner is also a passed hand and he didn't bid 5@D over the second double...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: it is, but if South's bid really showed hearts and a minor, he may regard the club finesse as better than the usual 50%|pg||

nt|blum1956: Is this 2NT natural? Than it looks too optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|smirny: 2c can help to find clubs in 6h|pg||

mb|d|nt|sharkey: 4@H can be made if EW dont play @S...|pg||

nt|andy_h: in 9 tricks but infact came out with one overtrick ;)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|andy_h: Observe the disparity between the 2@C (weak diamond bids) in this board and on board 5|pg||

pc|sT|nt|spenny80: a psichic cue?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for Leo fo find best lead.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|eleni: It all depends on his inspiration for the @d|pg||
nt|bagman: The odds probably favour the clubs to run (by a slight margin)|pg||
nt|bagman: My guess is that E plays a diamond to the ace now|pg||
nt|bagman: it is the best combination of possibilities|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - 4@H doesn't I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in practice 4@H too|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a safe 4@s contract for E-W|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 4@S on 2 of three things: spade break and 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit new here. 2/1 by bought pairs?|pg||
nt|rensph: Might make 10 if you manage to ruff 2 hearts in dummy and set up the club trick, but defense might force in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: as East may not lead or switch to @C in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11 on NS so ....|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|spenny80: for italy a sort of 2/1 i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: now|pg||
nt|blum1956: some pairs have an agreement that bidding the responder's suit is natural but this is rarely applicable to the opener's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 1Nt will not make...|pg||
nt|runnerup: many nowadays -and ns now in problems|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Antway N are to reopen now.|pg||
nt|spenny80: but for germany i don't know. Could be also polish? (the meaning of 1@d is?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eleni: just if one of the 2 finesses work, they are home|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: If switch to @C will set up suit|pg||

nt|famus: with a @H cue might go a notch higher|pg||
nt|ady: meantime  e/w have bought the contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: with spades breaking and @HK onside the contract makes (there are some additional chances in case 2 of the three things are not working)|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course if @s are not Jxxx in N's hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|spenny80: for me 2@c is a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: true Carl and the @S loser goes away|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C would have been better...but then, EW might have found their 2@H spot...|pg||

nt|runnerup: no double -but @c lead and some hundreds|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh must be careful|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a bad contract after all - near down one|pg||

nt|rensph: other room has reached the same contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: brb|pg||
nt|rodal f: The polich club|pg||
nt|spenny80: but likely the final contract is ok for italy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: On this lead, declarer cannot afford to duck a spade|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Or now might only 8|pg||

nt|raghavan: Wd |pg||
pc|s8|nt|Gerben42:  nicely bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
nt|runnerup: some possibilities to miss tricks in defence but very unlikely|pg||
nt|runnerup: @c lead is orderd in these secvenses..but didnt came|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|raghavan: Nothing much to do here|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|eleni: they could afford a 3@c contract anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankbo: B9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Gerben42:  and there is the point that we dont know if N has successfully hidden his @S spots|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|raghavan: yes hasan you said 50% - Spade K can be under SA and so makes|pg||

nt|lady007: he has a minimum regarding point count, but a nice side suit and a singleton|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps he'll decide 2@H is enough as he's opened so light|pg||
nt|athene: or is west debating between double and 2@S?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|famus: 3@h|pg||

nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
nt|runnerup: a game -no slam -should be avoided -here|pg||

nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||

nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||

pc|d3|nt|desinka: so..]|pg||
nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||
nt|ady: down 2 around 2  if they find the club ruffs|pg||
nt|rensph: @DQ overtaken, returning a club.... looks like down 2?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||

pc|h9|nt|desinka: they may beat the contract|pg||
nt|desinka: but it is not easy |pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: N must simply cash his 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double on the strength of the singleton diamond|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Gerben42:  we cannot judge unless we know what exacly 3@S showed|pg||
nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|famus: 4@S rkc-5@hs showed 2+Q|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can take one diamond ruff and then set up the clubs losing one in each|pg||

nt|panja: on a bad day...@CJ could be from @CJx..|pg||

nt|runnerup: guessing well here+ wellplaced cards lets 4 @h to be made |pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 heart is par contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes the pass was a bit timid... maybe the 1@D opening did not promise @Ds|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  hmm other table didnt make 4@S... |pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s aggressive but he makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -but 4 makes|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, I guess 4@s!-2 is a good defense...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   shortage  agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: dont think west will do anything with such a poor opening  and over half the strength opposite the shortage|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||
nt|helena sp:  good mornig to you all, good luck to our kids|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 1nt?|pg||
nt|rensph: given the EW hands 6@C seems like a reasonable contract, but unlikely to be made. Or reached.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, cut this and deal a goulash|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play J@S    playing north for 10X to make 12 tricks    unlikely play|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rensph: With the @H finesse in reserve you can first see if the @SQ drops|pg||
nt|rensph: in this case both fail, but more than 50%|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: do u agree with the lead here Carl ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hasan tell me why Braun did not bid his 4 cd H?|pg||
nt|roussol: 1@h is made|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sunsamvar: i wd try a @H|pg||
nt|bagman: in 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: so par looks like 4 @s x-2|pg||
nt|galois85: Actually I don't understand the first pass of di franco, maybe scared by a 2@d of his partner?|pg||
nt|raghavan: clubs are in good position for 4 H |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|famus: this cud b a swing only hope @s fin NOW|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharkey: the Vul bonus of 500 looming at IMPs - so he probably was at the 37% chance for success level :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lead has given the contract away|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the defence want to try to cut declarer's communications whilst the diamonds are blocked|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eleni: Amazing youngsters:):)|pg||
nt|roussol: íá êüøåé ìéá ðßêá êáé Ýâãáëå 5|pg||
nt|roussol: ruff one spade|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bagman: here declarer cashes his tricks and counts them in the end|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42:  otherwise 6@S 2@C 1 ruff and @DK|pg||
nt|galois85: would somebody bid dbl in E? (I do)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bagman: there might be 12 or 13|pg||
nt|athene: say, by returning a club now :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: E needs to keep the hearts and give up the clubs|pg||
nt|roussol: 2@d cannot be found so 2@s -1 doesn't seem a disaster|pg||
nt|runnerup: after @s lead rest is easy--without that lead you have to quess later and that is more difficult -start card is normally uder Q -not from ace|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Next.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: on a @H lead he had to locate the @Dj|pg||

nt|mug: there Roland, declarer just pinned @S10 for the overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sure, he was in 5, and on vugraph|pg||
nt|athene: but in 6@C he would have taken the finesse :)|pg||
nt|ahri: good score for EW in closed room|pg||
nt|ahri: would everyone here overcall over 1NT?|pg||

nt|ahri: same here. worked well for dutch|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mug: perhaps he'll bid when NS settled in 3@D?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: depends how they do it - if South transfers and North bids diamonds, the auction is still live at East's second turn|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|mug: tempoed out of it|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps they can beat 3@D instead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe - some sort of restricted choice position in diamonds will arise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can get away with overcalling on nothing, because no-one can double for penalty any more|pg||
nt|mug: was thinking in terms of three rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: or would arise, if West had played a third club|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: 6 IMPs stolen by the brave East in the CR|pg||
nt|dburn: but the odds there are not the normal ones - with clubs 5-2, the chance that East also has a singleton diamond is higher than it would normally be|pg||
nt|mug: the opponents can't punish you, but partner can|pg||

nt|sharkey: a mundane 4@H....|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room 5@d were set by -1|pg||
nt|eleni: underbid by N-S so this must cost domr imps|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair it was hard for NS because they didn't really know how strong declarer was|pg||
nt|athene: so they don't know if they are trying to beat 1nt or just restrict overtricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: so is it right to bid 3nt= 100% -but no overtricks anytime or 4@s -makes some 90 % -even+1 many cases -just think about it -i dont know..-but it is difficult to bid 3nt so nothing ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: to think here |pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D!|an|1 major|nt|sharkey: or - cud North's @H 8 come into play after @C lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW better not press by there sac.|pg||
nt|spenny80: here difficult don.t bid slam, defeat by ruff in @h|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    spades for e/w|pg||
nt|rensph: picked up a few imps on board 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 Spade loser in H contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has its merits over 4 @h but 5 must be too much|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5h |pg||
nt|raghavan: since voluntary bid of 4h shows min 3 cds|pg||
nt|ady: would not overcall|pg||
nt|rensph: 6-4 can lead to problems showing your hand with either bid|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says not @CQxx or better, and only 2 controls|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c I don.to know, maybe short|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3!X short or que SiSi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes carl|pg||
nt|famus: might get his !q or 10|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult hand for Peter, let us hope he counts it out really well, as he usually does|pg||
nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C sorry|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d clear splinter, but for me this isn't the hand to do a splinter in south|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: North decided to defend|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but cant blame North for not competing|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  thought W was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT is nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: @s-@h-@d shud b the order|pg||
nt|roussol: ducking 2ice|pg||
nt|chrisky: -1 is ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not suit N to well|pg||
nt|runnerup: seaching for slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: wint pass 5D ???|pg||
nt|rensph: E showing minimum with spades.. Seems reasonable :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||
nt|loe48: so im not surprised if hey bid 4s|pg||
nt|raghavan: wont pass 5D|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 3@C = ask for void/singelton|pg||
nt|spenny80: if you bid splinter and after a negativ bid you ask aces, then you didn't do a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: has led to a good spot   with some excellent cards opposite  and still not getting to high|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||
nt|athene: yes sorry 2@D might be 0-3 controls, not specifically 2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||

nt|desinka: @D lead I guess|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to find the lead at E|pg||
pc|c2|nt|spenny80: after sgl @c in north and sgl @d in south, @h lead is possible now|pg||
nt|spenny80: no easy|pg||

nt|athene: because if south has @HA and @DJ why would he throw a winner?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he saved himself troubles thinking through that by discarding wrong suit, so...  :)|pg||

nt|loe48: Morgan had a heavy hand as he choosed to pass with..but they have 2h N-S..so lets see what happens in open|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sunsamvar: how o find @S fit ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bulgaria started well but their play has deteriorated as the match progresses|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sharkey: 2@S by S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with Alex 1N p 2NT would be minors, good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 3@c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I've always wondered what 1NT-(2x)-4NT means. But of course if it's the minors it would be a bit premature on this strong of a hand so Zimmermann is trying to apply some science to ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: his 0-1-6-6 hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 4@S maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup: contract in wrong hand so can go down if @s switch come soon ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@S by N now may ask for @S hold?|pg||

nt|henryb:  Interesting choice; I would be more inclined to bid 2N unless that has some conventional meaning|pg||

nt|runnerup: ok -2 down in practice now|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 3@s|pg||

nt|smirny: rumpelsohl?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  okay to play say some kibs - boring |pg||

nt|famus: why?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|raghavan: showing unbalanced hand 1453|pg||

nt|raghavan: now dropping DK alone matters - spade loser will go in Clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5NT is a dangerous bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you arent even sure yourself, how can partner be|pg||
nt|henryb:  With @h 4-4 this is not a challenging hand; If @h were 5-3 declarer would have to find the @cQ|pg||
nt|loe48: and it is was a good call as we see the lay of cards are kind with this lead|pg||

nt|loe48: will we hear 4s and 5d|pg||
nt|athene: that sort of gets some way to showing what he has - will partner bid 7 on the strength of @CA @HAK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: Ireland did bidd 6D against Noray|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: he must abandon @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hello all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Pierre|pg||
nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||
nt|galois85: I totally don't like opening 1nt with 5-4-2-2, but just my opinion|pg||
nt|runnerup: this makes and also 3 @h -but better not bid more|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 2@s in the open room are been played now|pg||

nt|rensph: first a problem for N.... what to lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roussol: whenever defense plays @h the contract falls|pg||

nt|raghavan: difficult to bid 6H here|pg||
nt|famus: ya--not suggesting that at all|pg||
nt|roussol: he heard me:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: maybe south should have bid the boring 6@S and argued it out afterwards|pg||
nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||
nt|rodal f: It often use to be right when NS are vul and EW not|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead makes difficulties |pg||
nt|ady: now the Queen|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chmitty: true : you have to discuss in depth what would 5NT mean as compared to 6@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: They should  be playing 2S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sunsamvar: so thanks was a bit premature|pg||
nt|raghavan: between them NS have 14 losers |pg||
nt|famus: i think he was thinking right about the final entry for running @ds if the @D fin fails or even if it works--@Sa was the right play|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time both aces @h and @c right but you surely dont want to squese table by taking @d at once|pg||
nt|blum1956: well, dummy discards two spades, three clubs and one heart. Whatever declarer then leads he is home |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Non-vulnerable is not the same as *in*vulnerable|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and you also cant bid 4@h over 4@s so where do you want to go....|pg||
nt|ahri: i guess he hoped for lead directing bid and not to get punished|pg||

mb|2H|nt|sunsamvar: earlier was 2 suitor|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: thats why you clean side suits before play heart|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is 420 comes from north playing four rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT n/s|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Perhaps @C suit - Dbl 7+?|pg||

nt|eleni: nice contract by Peter, as W can never return another @s|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but were is the K@c?|pg||
nt|eleni: true, but only 1 way to be played and cross his fingers that the K is with W|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course he doesnt know also the @hA|pg||
nt|chrisky: he knows the A@h is in w|pg||
nt|eugenio123: J@s would've been better|pg||
nt|rensph: lots of defense|pg||
nt|ady: my guess is down1   as long as south does not discard clubs|pg||
nt|rensph: other room played @SAK in 4@S, down 1 and 10 imps to Croatia again|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Gerben42:  hard to find in this auction I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @CAx is golden|pg||
nt|andy_h: East, although the double fit is really good he is probably afraid of the lack of red-suit honours he had|pg||
nt|eleni: possible placing, yet not 100%|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @h was a good sacrifise vuln|pg||
pc|d5|nt|alati: ara, den prokeitai na xasoume |pg||
nt|andy_h: If West had the same hand without the @HQ then slam is abysmal on a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S must be exclusion|pg||
nt|athene: so 5@H is two keys and the queen, and west will ask about @DK for seven maybe|pg||
nt|chmitty: would you stay silent with South's hand all the time ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roussol: mortensen is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|alati: kai kleinoume tin 1i mera me 38 vps|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on hand 16 was played by east   on 10@S lead   and club was immediately finesse  so hence down|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|sharkey: penultimate board here|pg||
nt|loe48: as we see this contract has no chanse..bu \t a fresh try|pg||
nt|chmitty: North to South : your lead partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess west decided that with @HAQ @CA @DK east was not just bidding 4@H over 3@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: Ish Delmonte preferred bidding 1Nt to bidding the very weak @h suit, which might be passed out in a 5-1 fit. I prefer @H myself, but I can see all 52 cards. |pg||
nt|runnerup: can they solve this -i doubt|pg||
nt|runnerup: so it was too diffcult in both tables|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roussol: sure is good|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d2|pc|h3|nt|roussol: nice bid|pg||

nt|raghavan: I am fond  a Flannery 2D bid for both majors. a 2D bid for pre empt in diamond does not serve pirpose|pg||
nt|raghavan: purpose|pg||
pc|d8|nt|alati: afti i adam tou mikrou, evale idi ipopsifiotita gia vraveio tou prwta8limatos|pg||
pc|h4|nt|runnerup: looks that east can get 2,ruff anywaay -sorry -so this makes always ;)|pg||
nt|galois85: no finesses now... |pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wonder what he's thinking about|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, he has the exact count of the hands... so spades discarding clubs, ace of club, ruff one club, one diamond, again one clubs king of hearts, and diamond...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roussol: my blood pressure is :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bravo East (also for avoiding disastrous 5@c)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: With @C behind it became a auto|pg||
nt|runnerup: who says a sacrifise sorry -makes :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Did South in fact play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: sure|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roussol: 21|pg||
nt|athene: if south had bid 3@S over 2nt then EW might be trying to get a decent penalty out of 6@SX|pg||
pc|h5|nt|alati: nomizw oti i tixi mas girise tin plati |pg||
nt|chmitty: the save in 6@s would have cost what ? 800 ?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 1@C openers that are less than 4 cards about 20 to 30% of the time, the need for a club stopper is regarded by some (not me) as a quaint and archaic concept.   |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the session coming up shortly. Many thanks again to Monika, great concentration!|pg||
nt|alati: alla fainetai oti o danos tou vlepei ta filla|pg||

pc|sT|nt|famus: last 2 bds might fetch a handful for the german boys|pg||
nt|loe48: brighter|pg||
nt|galois85: wow... trying to go -1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andy_h: Dare I say, maybe the solution is for West to open his hand 2@C even though it's generally not good to open 2 or 3-suiter hands with 2@C in fear of interference|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|loe48: now only chanse to play on is to find Ax on one side|pg||

nt|andy_h: On the contrary if West had opened 1@H it may be very hard to catch-up in the auction with his good hand (as it happened here)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and how do you know this hand is not "generally"|pg||

nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
nt|athene: not sure, i guess something like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north could have doubled one of west's spade bids to emphasize his spade suit and try to wake his partner up|pg||

nt|galois85: but luckily for declearer it was the same...|pg||
nt|blum1956: Very strange - if the declarer has @d J10x raising with the Ace still guarantees two diamond tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Germany has improved a litte getting 12 imp on Bd 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the match - many thanks to our excellent operator in Albena, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and congrats to the Swedish team on this win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  although this hand...|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with longer spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
nt|galois85: yes, but thanks to KF and AQ it seems an impossible leading... |pg||
nt|galois85: 2nt shows 6@h and 4 in another (minor?)|pg||
