nt|smirny: and west thinks that his hand is too strong for 3H over DBL|pg||
nt|smirny: intresting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H maybe shows @Sxx @Hxxxx @Dxxxx @Cxxx|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d has some play ,but can you bid it?|pg||
nt|rensph: yes, somewhat surprised he underestimated the danger of drawing all trumps there|pg||

pc|c2|pg||

nt|rensph: 3@H 5-5 without extras|pg||

nt|riccho:  the czech bid a lousy 5@d instead of 3NT and should have lost 11 imps. and the italian defender revoked the declarer into a successful game. S should stand up and go to the toilet for 5 minutes.|pg||
nt|riccho:  we all made revokes. THe difference is in handling the situation afterwards|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  hmm i wonder what 2@C was|pg||
nt|eleni: Stesso contrato che la camera aperta|pg||
nt|mancio89:  and italy is now fifth, 10 points to france|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Gerben42:  probably @C or not @C|pg||

nt|smirny: yeah|pg||
nt|loe48: white colors..3c okay ...but 5c from partner now...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very friendly layout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: South shows game inviting values - some of us elders may have considered this a 2@H raise |pg||
nt|sharkey: View S initial pass North's not looking for slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  A sporty 1 Nt bid here ;)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Shows (very) weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl by Schwartz aggressive opposite a passed partner. Would be better with xx in @ds and the AJ somewhere else. But now it has worked out fine|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 620/650 is on, so 500 is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: look like 500, 3 down with a fast view|pg||
nt|frankbo: yes|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Gerben42:  1NTx was not going to be so bad|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  please welcome Andy Hung|pg||
nt|smirny: welcome Andy|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  West made an aggressive Dbl of 1NT and will be happy to get -1|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hi there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Jacka Ciechomskiego...po po¬≥udniu polowanie na komentator√≥w jest bardziej wydajne:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West's signal is suit preference with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can stand either shift so he gave a middle card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As South√Ç¬¥s faher points out: 4 @D would have been a better bid - West might pick 4 @H then|pg||
pc|h5|nt|blum1956: 3@d was hardly FG |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Zimmermann will be surprised dummy has everything|pg||
nt|smoller: 4 down unless defence helps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  father|pg||
nt|eleni: ducked?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andy_h: E-W lead 3rd-5th in trumps too? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Andy|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  guess so|pg||
nt|smirny: is it better to lead 2nd/4th in trumps|pg||
nt|smirny: ?|pg||
nt|smirny: i think it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West would dbl takeout over 4@d|pg||
nt|vasmar: so 1 imp back to Czech Republik|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42:  maybe better is small?|pg||
nt|loe48: agreed, the values of the hand is lowered now by club bid, so an understandable pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would East bid then - facing a passed partner?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Notice fisher won the @c king to induce partner to return a @H |pg||
nt|poohbear: and possibly fool declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass the TO dbl of 4@d since I have my points in @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would most of us|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even 4 !@D X might cost 500|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer trying to decide if he can afford to play King here|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @d ace onside and tripleton then the @h ace rates to be in East and he can ruff 3@s in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: but doesnt want to lose to singleton Ace in East|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankbo: x H now?|pg||
nt|loe48: small heart up now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: sure|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: some carefullness needed here because @C block -but should not make --for that 3 d --maybe ..i dont know their agreements|pg||
nt|poohbear: then the defense might be able to draw a lot of trumps |pg||

nt|runnerup: predicting results|pg||
nt|raghavan: If D not taken make 6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankbo: then 800|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|eleni: nice return by Giannis|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|andy_h: The standard lead for a trump (opening) lead is usually small because you never know if any of your big trumps can be promoted (you never know!). But otherwise if they are actually ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: useless or of equals then you can use them as suit-preference signals|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad board for my poor DK anyway - they did√Ç¬¥nt make 4 @S in OR...?|pg||
nt|poohbear: interesting that Schwartz plays a @c now. Cant be right unless partner falsecarded|pg||
pc|h6|nt|loe48: then it start to look like bigger numbers yes|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|loe48: and i think it is 800 whatever he tries on|pg||

nt|runnerup: no if south lead a small ! out ot QJx -butcan he|pg||
nt|poohbear: I was sure Fisher would open 1NT |pg||
nt|vasmar: there is a slight risk of overbidding to an unmekeable slam|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|smirny: how strong was 1nt btw?|pg||

nt|poohbear: I lose that bet with myself :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|isp: Let's see first if 3NT is on and in which direction :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: should end to 2@d /1nt -ew -and cards not well so some chance to go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@s was a little bit better than double I suppose|pg||
nt|riccho:  all bids are looking natural here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW use some varying NT ranges|pg||
nt|frankbo: the way i play yes|pg||
nt|riccho:  W should bid 2@s|pg||
nt|riccho:  5-2 or 6-2 fits are regularly easier to play than 43 fits|pg||
pc|h6|nt|basu_4139: puppet stayma|pg||
nt|bagman: 1@H was alerted because EW skip diamonds unless they have a game forcing hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: wlc Pekka|pg||
nt|andy_h: That's certainly a common run-out structure to 1NT-X in which pass is forcing partner to redouble - not  one of my favourite conventions because you can't play in 1NTX|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|runnerup: club ruff needed so @c lead needed for 4 @s |pg||

nt|riccho:  probable|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: Vul may be 15-17 as opened 1 NT previously on 14 being NV. If kibs know pls let me know|pg||

nt|pinticus: 3@s texas to 3nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: EW may make 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this should go down |pg||

nt|vasmar: it needs double finesse in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: me koupa antam |pg||
nt|basu_4139: a massacre|pg||
nt|panja: as I suspected the high 2@D opening, instead of preempting opponents, has preempted own side..|pg||
nt|raghavan: Both teams seem balance not much exchange of IMP let us see whether this trend continues|pg||
nt|raghavan: Even if DQ not played where will D loser go |pg||
nt|vasmar: and a heart ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|vasmar: club lead is bad for declarer|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|vasmar: but nobody can blame N since she has doubleton heart|pg||
nt|vasmar: declarer must cover and duck West's @CQ i think|pg||
nt|chrisky: second good lead by Vlachova|pg||
nt|eleni: Margherita who really knows how to count the had, she feels that maybe the leaed is a sngl|pg||
mb|6H|nt|eleni: as things are, a small @h lead kills the game|pg||

nt|frankbo: only 8|pg||
nt|bebechira: world|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Board 4 - Denmark playing a @D-contract at both tables...|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  (+4)|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not sure I agree with the trump lead here - If declarer had removed 3NT to 5@D then there's a slight clue that declarer has clubs as the source of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also a clue that he was worried about a suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  maybe cashing @SAK and hope for 3rd trick|pg||
nt|eleni: wd Ron due to opps' misplay|pg||
nt|panja: the mistake of not playing high card in third seat...is not uncommon amongst novices...|pg||
nt|panja: that is why Third Hand Highest is an important rule...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a wydaje si√™, ¬øe zrzutka krakowska powinna by√¶ ceniona w kraju nad Wis¬≥¬π|pg||

nt|runnerup: and it came so vulnerable game won -but can you avoid that lead --hard to say|pg||
nt|blum1956: a lively set ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer lucky trumps were 2-2 so he has an entry but even if East has 3 he would ruff the @c and be endplayed . Declarer would have to guess the @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: after declarer draws only 2rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer is perhaps delighted, that this contract was still made|pg||
nt|eleni: so 1 more IMP for our Czech girls|pg||
nt|mancio89:  both poland and french declarer were not as good as she was|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roussol: edo iparhei mans travihti|pg||
nt|andy_h: she* Gerben!|pg||
nt|smirny: i would lead ace of S probably|pg||
nt|panja: the @HT lead.....could be from KT9, QT9, T9 etc...absolutely no reason to duck...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 key cards missing, so no slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Press "Refresh" button|pg||
nt|panja: B6, once again, W has a poor hand and E opens..|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Gerben42:  right|pg||
nt|panja: and now...if N passes, will E bid further?|pg||
nt|panja: N should not pass as he know EW have a good @H fit...|pg||
nt|eleni: another misfit though|pg||
nt|panja: and if E escapes to 1@H..and W raises..it will be difficult to get in later..|pg||
nt|panja: so bidding 2@D now..is the best option|pg||
nt|runnerup: a possible slam -down ofcause but ..|pg||
nt|runnerup: i would say only @h lead let it make|pg||

nt|eleni: I am not sure how Peter bids that 2@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes you're right but a @d lead looked most strange|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam in @c |pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes, 6@D on this placement can be made but tough to bid.|pg||
nt|mancio89:  and now it happens that sweden is just 7 Vps ahead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: His best shot is probaly to set up the spades and then continue spades|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is even better..showing 10+ HCP, exact desription of his hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: good|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  sry private ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: bad hour of the day for grown ups:)|pg||
nt|galois85: it's hard to go on with 3 small clubs in north...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 3 NT easy - and lucky|pg||
nt|poohbear: We saw Fisher pass a 12 count in 2nd seat vul a few hands ago. Now Schwartz opens with 12 in first seat vul|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Mundane 2@S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S a lucky make.. but will not get there|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S either weak NT or 3-card supp|pg||
nt|andy_h: Are they playing some sort of a swedish-club system?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and oddly Fisher only invites |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - two different hands, you see...|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems inconsistent|pg||
nt|riccho:  3@s is a very aggressive bid. I hope that N realizes that some key card asking is still appropriate|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|Gerben42:  no they are playing natural|pg||
nt|andy_h: Ok|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roussol: evnoiki antam|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sunsamvar: the @H loser can be parked on the 4th @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  cant you see, only first 4 bids alerted, natural sys|pg||
nt|eleni: His parents play that 2@c for both majors in such cases:) not sure about Peter though|pg||
nt|panja: now. E will not lead @H..|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect slam missing, in my opinion North was too passive|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 @c looked very much like an under bit --if you have about 10 tricks in your own hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: lots of South hands make a slam near 100%|pg||
nt|riccho:  How aggressive 3@s is, can you see, if you imagine the S Hand without the @sQ. That would be not even an opener, at least in my book|pg||
nt|eleni: let us jope Megherita will keep the bidding low|pg||
nt|riccho:  at least S is not showing the void with 5NT or so|pg||
nt|riccho:  N will be wondering now, where are the values for 3@s...|pg||
nt|vasmar: unlucky trump split for 1 off|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: it should only be a cue, 10+ HCP...|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet N has to find the Q@d|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|basu_4139: The D ld produce no result to the defence,a loss rather|pg||
nt|andy_h: haha and transfer walsh is starting to become mainstream yes :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this strong Rdbl shows more trouble then it gain|pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract unless if Flavia fell in love with her 17p and pd opened:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bagman: E is trying to kill the discard on the @DQ|pg||
nt|eleni: They may play weak jump overcalls|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C cue wasted value for S.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42:  2@D = 2-way checkback / XYZ, whatever you call it, GF anyway|pg||

pc|sK|nt|gronkvist:  Esp in V ag NV i think|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@s bye N in open room|pg||

nt|riccho:  A declarer speed up lead...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rensph: defense can cross in @H twice to cash 3 @S tricks for down 1 now, S has to avoid playing spades from his side|pg||

nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||

nt|gmarco24: Grunke is still believing in this contract|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|runnerup: north passed -many would double so ew in 2 @s without opponents bid anything -.1nt was ..something|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|blum1956: The only chance for the defense was a trump switch in the second trick|pg||

nt|panja: that is why, many prefer to play Ogust....rebid on 2Nt|pg||
nt|panja: that says something about the quality of the opened suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Me who was total blind.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good declarer play, nothing better could be done|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is an unusual position for Israel. Up til now they havent lost a match. they tied Croatia but other than that they have gotten near max against everyone else|pg||
nt|poohbear: are we on break?|pg||
nt|eleni: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C/@D for EW.|pg||
nt|pinticus: only 3 VP from France :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Photographs and commentating on those bulletins are just GREAT|pg||
nt|eleni: Sylvia our sweet operator, you really are making a great job!|pg||
nt|atalok: 1 nt a√ß√Ω√æ√Ωndan sonra 4 H e gelirler|pg||
nt|atalok: 8 noul eli a √ß√Ωkda 4 H demi√æler bizimkiler:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eleni: you are so right Panja:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  2@C weak two in @D|pg||
nt|smirny: 2C is not my style|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or perhaps just shows the 2 of @D?|pg||
nt|smirny: or the 2 of C|pg||
nt|smirny: and pd always has AKxxx in D|pg||
nt|galois85: conservative 1nt in south, I think I would bid something like 2nt or even 3... 2 aces 1 king and 2 tens... =)|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @H seems the limit |pg||
nt|blum1956: very aggressive!|pg||
nt|poohbear: If Denmark have an invitational seq 5-5 majors now is the time to use it :)|pg||
nt|eleni: and just 3@h for N-S|pg||
nt|vasmar: Italy top is +2VPs since they already get 23-7 win|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: ty, dear @H|pg||
nt|vasmar: so Italy needs help from Poland and/or Netherlands|pg||
mb|2C|nt|smirny: wow|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  wrong hand operator!|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky 6 @c -but @c should be played anyway -so either 5 or ..|pg||
nt|raghavan: Markku will they reack 6C here?|pg||
nt|vasmar: little more help i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  STOP|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 6@h here, but not easy at all|pg||
nt|athene: south's hand is a lot more useful for north than a 3@C bid would suggest|pg||
nt|spenny80: a slam w/o @d lead, but will be a normal 4@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankbo: no, was terrible to not tak 4 H tricks|pg||
nt|riccho:  3NT from E... even 3NT from W there is only one card to defeat 3NT: @hQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 4@s in the open room|pg||
nt|smirny: 5D yes|pg||
nt|panja: 3@H vs 3@C here..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Scotland only need a 11-19 for be = at Denmark. 13-17 so fare.|pg||
nt|athene: @HA, @CA, @DJ :) rather than, say, @CKQJ and @SK|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bulgaria playing Precision |pg||
nt|runnerup: poor west good hand and everyone bids -so|pg||
nt|blum1956: Is this 2NT natural? Than it looks too optimistic|pg||
nt|vasmar: what happens in case of tie? the match between tied teams count or total imps?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|smirny: 2c can help to find clubs in 6h|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 4@c splinter maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup: no i think 5 is enought |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H can be made if EW dont play @S...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: excellent 9/10 hcp :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south should bid 4@H over 3@D trying to show how good his hand is for hearts |pg||
nt|athene: he must think 3@H is forcing|pg||
nt|gmarco24: follow results on: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s by E (like splinter in club i think)|pg||
nt|riccho:  Double ca 1@s is interesting (single @s!!)|pg||
nt|riccho:  single @h I meant...|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: without a @s lead, it's tough|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i doubt it...|pg||
nt|spenny80: w good support and max|pg||
nt|spenny80: w/o @d cue|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder if 4@d was pick a major or a transfer to @s. If I was going to transfer to one suit I would choose @Hs|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer needs hand records to make this!|pg||
nt|poohbear: will prob win and start @cs|pg||
nt|poohbear: hoping to take 5@s tricks 4@c and the @d ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: √§√Ω√≥√™√Ø√´√ß √¨√°√≠√≤|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer wins this and then cashes two top clubs|pg||

pc|s3|nt|famus: great event this--and an opportunity for youngsters to learn|pg||
nt|andy_h: It seems like the Swede counterpart in the other room had a hard time on Board 7 with the trump play. Rather than guessing trumps the declarer tried to strip the hand by ruffing a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: heart csahing @SA and playing on clubs, but when North was able to ruff the 3rd club with the @SK declarer had to guess the diamonds - had he guessed wrong it would have resulted ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: in 9 tricks but infact came out with one overtrick ;)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  unlikely to find @C position due to "restricted choice"|pg||
nt|smirny: well expensive board...probably a 26IMPS guess|pg||
nt|smirny: but after weak in D (2@C)|pg||
nt|smirny: you can find it|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@H 6@D ... why not 3@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Fabio|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: West must switch to @S when in with the @CK|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ...but they got tired  :)|pg||
nt|spenny80: ciaoo|pg||
nt|spenny80: Do you prefer italy o germany?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: cue bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: and it is marked|pg||

nt|smirny: maybe 7D |pg||
nt|smirny: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andy_h: Observe the disparity between the 2@C (weak diamond bids) in this board and on board 5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bagman: Then he has to decide if he plays clubs to run or diamonds to run|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|spenny80: a psichic cue?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for Leo fo find best lead.|pg||
nt|poohbear: the J of @cs gave East a lot of information. Was better to play the King|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eleni: It all depends on his inspiration for the @d|pg||
nt|bagman: The odds probably favour the clubs to run (by a slight margin)|pg||
nt|bagman: My guess is that E plays a diamond to the ace now|pg||
nt|bagman: it is the best combination of possibilities|pg||
nt|bagman: clubs running or diamond queen doubleton|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the diamond finesse he can go down with clubs 3-3|pg||

nt|rodal f: Support X after 2@D?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42:  if Fryklund forgets to play @S9 ...|pg||
nt|rensph: declarer not aware of spades breaking this badly|pg||
pc|d9|nt|isp: 11|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42:  then Orth cn count the hand|pg||
nt|smirny: well maybe S would bid 5D with Stiff @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  :)|pg||
nt|panja: but now, when E exits with a trump, N will be endplayed..so the guess is eliminated|pg||
nt|vasmar: maybe a better lead was trump since E controls clubs|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rensph: spade return would've made his life difficult|pg||

nt|smirny: well without any information you will guess the clubs wrong, so i just hope there is chance to get it right after this 0HCP weak D bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gotta know your customers ;)|pg||

nt|blum1956: If East opens 1@d Weat will hardly pass|pg||
nt|blum1956: West|pg||

nt|rensph: welcome David :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 5@d MAKING|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - 4@H doesn't I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in practice 4@H too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eleni: a safe 4@s contract for E-W|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 4@S on 2 of three things: spade break and 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit new here. 2/1 by bought pairs?|pg||
nt|rensph: Might make 10 if you manage to ruff 2 hearts in dummy and set up the club trick, but defense might force in @D|pg||
nt|eleni: You mean in open room:):) right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep, sorry.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: as East may not lead or switch to @C in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11 on NS so ....|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|spenny80: for italy a sort of 2/1 i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: now|pg||
nt|blum1956: some pairs have an agreement that bidding the responder's suit is natural but this is rarely applicable to the opener's suit|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|panja: 1Nt will not make...|pg||
nt|runnerup: many nowadays -and ns now in problems|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Antway N are to reopen now.|pg||
nt|spenny80: but for germany i don't know. Could be also polish? (the meaning of 1@d is?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Anyway|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eleni: just if one of the 2 finesses work, they are home|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: If switch to @C will set up suit|pg||

mb|3S|nt|desinka: intresting board|pg||
nt|desinka: not easy to get sigle K@C if u pkay 6@c|pg||
nt|desinka: play|pg||
nt|famus: with a @H cue might go a notch higher|pg||
nt|ady: meantime  e/w have bought the contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  modern approach is to bid 1NT even with subminimum hands. Goal is to silence the bidding for NS. |pg||
nt|riccho:  In this hand however it led only to an unsuccessful contract|pg||
nt|vasmar: previous board was a disaster for Italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: with spades breaking and @HK onside the contract makes (there are some additional chances in case 2 of the three things are not working)|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course if @s are not Jxxx in N's hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|spenny80: for me 2@c is a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|arigun: dikkatli oynamasi lazim :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sunsamvar: true Carl and the @S loser goes away|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C would have been better...but then, EW might have found their 2@H spot...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u there|pg||
nt|runnerup: no double -but @c lead and some hundreds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|raghavan: Oh must be careful|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a bad contract after all - near down one|pg||

nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
nt|runnerup: some possibilities to miss tricks in defence but very unlikely|pg||

nt|runnerup: spades and still 200 at least|pg||
nt|riccho:  In defense most of the time the problem is to decide whether you play an acitve or a passive defense. Here N chose the active one and would have better chosen the passive line|pg||

nt|gmarco24: then 1@h bid would be real freestyler flight, but, as you say: just in case |pg||
nt|blum1956: a club lead restricts NS to 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|riccho:  5 Imps gained by italy|pg||
nt|eleni: but Flavia was counting:) we know her already, for counting the hands:)|pg||
nt|eleni: and discards are mastered by the Italian girls (players in general actually)|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: we see another case here...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|desinka: very intresting board |pg||

nt|famus: @h slam coming up for the Hungarian girls|pg||
nt|panja: S has a good long minor this time|pg||
nt|panja: and North has the missing honour in that..so 3Nt will be easy|pg||
nt|galois85: 4@s on ns... hand useful for a coffee!|pg||

mb|4C|nt|famus: 3@h|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again you see here a slam in Hearts possibly bid by NS |pg||
nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
nt|runnerup: a game -no slam -should be avoided -here|pg||
nt|rensph: 2@S in EW fails on a number of ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  I dont like the 2@h bid. shape misdescription is generally not a good idea in hands with slam potential|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had E bid 2@D and then @H, it was possible. Lets see.|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet hollandal√Ωlar genelde transfer oynuyorlar ac√Ω√ætan sonra|pg||
mb|5C|nt|desinka: 4@H?|pg||
nt|eleni: den xero poios apo tous 2 milaei agglika|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||
nt|athene: aces and shape always beat a bunch of kings and queens and jacks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y.|pg||
nt|spenny80: do you open with north cards? me not|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, you are right =) I'd better take my coffee before! lol |pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess Ege didnt want to dbl 4@d in case that encouraged his partner to save|pg||
nt|eleni: depends on the system the Czech girls use|pg||
nt|atalok: 5 cl sorunsuz|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: I think always 4@s-1... unless Rubino continues with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|runnerup: i down use coffee breaks when 4 optinal loosers|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now a slam has chances as the @h lead from West is tempting|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to have firm agreements in that spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: so..]|pg||
nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||
nt|ady: down 2 around 2  if they find the club ruffs|pg||
nt|rensph: @DQ overtaken, returning a club.... looks like down 2?|pg||
nt|riccho:  filigrane|pg||
pc|hA|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Whaever u say: THe bidding by E doesnt look like a describing auction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree.|pg||
nt|eleni: right Richard|pg||
nt|riccho:  Its sheer luck that 7@s is not an obvious contract |pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||
nt|panja: let us say CJ goes to @CQ..|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Lina|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4@h is ok, but 5@c passed is excellent save  :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: major and club switch best |pg||
nt|vasmar: she can finesse @DJ and reach hand later by spade|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: S denies Club control |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|desinka: they may beat the contract|pg||
nt|desinka: but it is not easy |pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR also.E bid 2@D and then @H but @S the contract.|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@s is a terribly contract and would have failed if the @s are not playable for zero loser. |pg||
nt|riccho:  swo its a 5 or 7 Hand in @s|pg||
nt|riccho:  so...|pg||
nt|atalok: cl atag√Ωna veya d√∂n√º√æ√ºne batabilir|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: N must simply cash his 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double on the strength of the singleton diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S 3/3, lucky contract.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||
nt|bagman: Makes life easier in 3@H but would have killed 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and his ace in the side suit|pg||
nt|ady: now making|pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: landed in slam|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EVERYONE--its boys here--thnks-Sisito--the VG operator corrected me--pardon me for this EVERYONE--thnks Sisito|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i wouldn't have thought of 6@D|pg||
nt|smirny: well it is hard to bid S hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we cannot judge unless we know what exacly 3@S showed|pg||
nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||
nt|atalok: ama?|pg||
nt|atalok: √æekil 1 sayfa 32 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|famus: 4@S rkc-5@hs showed 2+Q|pg||

nt|eleni: As you all know, John Oikonomopoulos is the son of Ghionis+Helena sp:) As we say in Greek "the apple falls under the apple tree" :)|pg||
nt|panja: on a bad day...@CJ could be from @CJx..|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lead direction, not invite to defence...|pg||
nt|rodal f: N will miss the @D after thid start|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes @c lead needed in slam -right |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: one problem is, he is not on lead, so if his partner has the unsupported @DA he might well not get his ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|blum1956: no thriller for us but good bridge after all|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||
nt|helena sp:  good mornig to you all, good luck to our kids|pg||
nt|vasmar: nice stop|pg||
nt|vasmar: on 22 HCP|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chrisky: 1nt?|pg||
nt|rensph: given the EW hands 6@C seems like a reasonable contract, but unlikely to be made. Or reached.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: excellent and lets claim:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  if partner has only 1Kc but reverse values (3@c), 7@d should be a big contract|pg||
nt|yusufb: celik 2nt demesi laz√Ωmd√Ω|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, cut this and deal a goulash|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play J@S    playing north for 10X to make 12 tricks    unlikely play|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rensph: With the @H finesse in reserve you can first see if the @SQ drops|pg||
nt|rensph: in this case both fail, but more than 50%|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont see why Schwartz didnt Q bid|pg||
nt|yusufb: naturel degil|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sunsamvar: do u agree with the lead here Carl ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hasan tell me why Braun did not bid his 4 cd H?|pg||
nt|roussol: 1@h is made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H for NS is making, but outbid in both rooms.|pg||
nt|eleni: now a @h lead to the weakness of the dummy would be great|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: i wd try a @H|pg||
nt|bagman: in 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: so par looks like 4 @s x-2|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|d4|nt|sharkey: the Vul bonus of 500 looming at IMPs - so he probably was at the 37% chance for success level :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lead has given the contract away|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the defence want to try to cut declarer's communications whilst the diamonds are blocked|pg||

pc|h8|nt|bagman: here declarer cashes his tricks and counts them in the end|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Gerben42:  otherwise 6@S 2@C 1 ruff and @DK|pg||
nt|galois85: would somebody bid dbl in E? (I do)|pg||
nt|chrisky: -1 on a @H return|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bagman: there might be 12 or 13|pg||
nt|athene: say, by returning a club now :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bagman: E needs to keep the hearts and give up the clubs|pg||
nt|roussol: 2@d cannot be found so 2@s -1 doesn't seem a disaster|pg||
nt|runnerup: after @s lead rest is easy--without that lead you have to quess later and that is more difficult -start card is normally uder Q -not from ace|pg||

pc|h9|nt|riccho:  better to play @h on to shorten the dummy|pg||
nt|eleni: well, balance, with some values:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sunsamvar: on a @H lead he had to locate the @Dj|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: maybe a shade worse with north in the bidding?|pg||
nt|eleni: too many losers|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: I wud lead @H - dont like the @S lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or maybe he cud endplay East even on a @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D suit behaves as well|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W are in 1NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|raghavan: yes he has done it |pg||
pc|dA|nt|famus: i think this was a forcing chk back--or nmf--dunno--if forcing then 3@ds shows 5 cards|pg||
nt|athene: south could have ducked that second spade too, so he has an entry to his fourth spade (declarer can't have four in hand as he didn't raise 1@S)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gmarco24: Ellerbeck is not following that idea|pg||
pc|d5|nt|spenny80: it was better play before @c but with this layout is same|pg||
nt|riccho:  still enough @h to shorten the dummy|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|desinka: great play, but not 4@S contract :):)|pg||

nt|sharkey: a mundane 4@H....|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room 5@d were set by -1|pg||
nt|eleni: underbid by N-S so this must cost domr imps|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair it was hard for NS because they didn't really know how strong declarer was|pg||
nt|athene: so they don't know if they are trying to beat 1nt or just restrict overtricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: so is it right to bid 3nt= 100% -but no overtricks anytime or 4@s -makes some 90 % -even+1 many cases -just think about it -i dont know..-but it is difficult to bid 3nt so nothing ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: to think here |pg||
nt|eleni: good defense by the Italian girls|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@d|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rnmalik: indeed.|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes. But I dont understand the trump lead in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: except for the revoke part, they have played well. May that was an eye opener.|pg||
nt|vasmar: 7@D maybe|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: or - cud North's @H 8 come into play after @C lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW better not press by there sac.|pg||
nt|spenny80: here difficult don.t bid slam, defeat by ruff in @h|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    spades for e/w|pg||
nt|rensph: picked up a few imps on board 11|pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 Spade loser in H contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: be|pg||
nt|vasmar: this can be a crucial board|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult bidding though|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
nt|pinticus: 6@d seems cold|pg||
nt|vasmar: and 7 if you ruff 2 clubs or make 3@S tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has its merits over 4 @h but 5 must be too much|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5h |pg||
nt|raghavan: since voluntary bid of 4h shows min 3 cds|pg||
nt|ady: would not overcall|pg||
nt|rensph: 6-4 can lead to problems showing your hand with either bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says not @CQxx or better, and only 2 controls|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c I don.to know, maybe short|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3!X short or que SiSi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes carl|pg||
nt|famus: might get his !q or 10|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult hand for Peter, let us hope he counts it out really well, as he usually does|pg||
nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C sorry|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d clear splinter, but for me this isn't the hand to do a splinter in south|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT limit raise or better in @s|pg||
nt|eleni: oooooooooooops a passive bid|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think 4NT by N should be more accurate|pg||
nt|eleni: Let us hope Flavia keepos it on|pg||
nt|chrisky: if u ruff 2 @C no need 3@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: North decided to defend|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but cant blame North for not competing|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  thought W was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT is nice|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: @s-@h-@d shud b the order|pg||
nt|roussol: ducking 2ice|pg||
nt|chrisky: -1 is ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not suit N to well|pg||
nt|runnerup: seaching for slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: wint pass 5D ???|pg||
nt|rensph: E showing minimum with spades.. Seems reasonable :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: N never decribed her 17 count|pg||
pc|d8|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||
nt|loe48: so im not surprised if hey bid 4s|pg||
nt|raghavan: wont pass 5D|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 3@C = ask for void/singelton|pg||
nt|spenny80: if you bid splinter and after a negativ bid you ask aces, then you didn't do a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: has led to a good spot   with some excellent cards opposite  and still not getting to high|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||
nt|athene: yes sorry 2@D might be 0-3 controls, not specifically 2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|atalok: hala olmuyor ama oynay√Ωp batmak normal|pg||

nt|raghavan: OH???|pg||

nt|eugenio123: he can't he would've bid 4nt instead of 5@c|pg||

nt|gmarco24: and i ma sleeping  :) thought it's natural sequence  :D|pg||
nt|gmarco24: sry all|pg||

nt|yusufb: evet bunu oynay√Ωp batmak normali|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roussol: well done|pg||
nt|desinka: @D lead I guess|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to find the lead at E|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4 top tricks for denmark|pg||
pc|d3|nt|spenny80: after sgl @c in north and sgl @d in south, @h lead is possible now|pg||
nt|spenny80: no easy|pg||
nt|spenny80: good 4@h in closed room, after 1@d open better minor (easier now)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gmarco24: how would you bid as natural William?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like to follow more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|galois85: but  1nt... difficult singl in spades...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|eleni: yes 12 are a lay down, inspirational L and J@h play gives the overtrick:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: A good lead|pg||
nt|eleni: That was a safe lead by S|pg||
nt|bagman: (much better than @HA)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  he would if @SA would also be in N|pg||
nt|rensph: can play 3 rounds of clubs to avoid the @S guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|spenny80: good and likely lead|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|poohbear: declarer will strip the hand and hope for a singleton @h honor|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  slam time|pg||
nt|athene: of course south could throw the @DJ and keep two hearts to give him a guess, but that would just be a grosvenor|pg||
nt|athene: because if south has @HA and @DJ why would he throw a winner?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he saved himself troubles thinking through that by discarding wrong suit, so...  :)|pg||
nt|athene: would be a good grosvenor tho|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Italy-Austria 25:5 for now, so only 6VP bellow Israel now|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nope|pg||
nt|eleni: minor suits contract for E-W:)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sunsamvar: how o find @S fit ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bulgaria started well but their play has deteriorated as the match progresses|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: South has to view his @cs as a source of tricks to bid 6|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sharkey: 2@S by S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with Alex 1N p 2NT would be minors, good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 3@c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I've always wondered what 1NT-(2x)-4NT means. But of course if it's the minors it would be a bit premature on this strong of a hand so Zimmermann is trying to apply some science to ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: his 0-1-6-6 hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 4@S maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup: contract in wrong hand so can go down if @s switch come soon ..|pg||

nt|eleni: Welcome Alec:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting choice; I would be more inclined to bid 2N unless that has some conventional meaning|pg||

nt|runnerup: ok -2 down in practice now|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think it makes|pg||

mb|p|nt|famus: 3@s|pg||

nt|smirny: rumpelsohl?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  okay to play say some kibs - boring |pg||
nt|ady: 6@C at best on a finesse   but could go down immediately with A@H and a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@d may fail by 1|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: yes|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: difficult hand to bid|pg||

nt|famus: difficult now--but has v good @cs|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would bid 4D |pg||
nt|famus: why?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: showing unbalanced hand 1453|pg||

nt|raghavan: now dropping DK alone matters - spade loser will go in Clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5NT is a dangerous bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you arent even sure yourself, how can partner be|pg||
nt|henryb:  With @h 4-4 this is not a challenging hand; If @h were 5-3 declarer would have to find the @cQ|pg||
nt|loe48: and it is was a good call as we see the lay of cards are kind with this lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Pierre|pg||
nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||

nt|athene: :(|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now u see the problem|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is the second hand in this match where one side has played with 6 trumps against a 6-1 break|pg||
nt|poohbear: board 4 in the other room|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sunsamvar: oops. Sry 20 boards..|pg||
nt|famus: 6@hs--as the cards lie|pg||
nt|raghavan: Othe room Bd 15 stopped in 4NT|pg||

nt|eleni: the chance we had to watch our young boys and girls play!|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south should have bid the boring 6@S and argued it out afterwards|pg||
nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||
nt|rodal f: It often use to be right when NS are vul and EW not|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead makes difficulties |pg||
nt|ady: now the Queen|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chmitty: true : you have to discuss in depth what would 5NT mean as compared to 6@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: They should  be playing 2S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sunsamvar: so thanks was a bit premature|pg||
nt|raghavan: between them NS have 14 losers |pg||
nt|famus: i think he was thinking right about the final entry for running @ds if the @D fin fails or even if it works--@Sa was the right play|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time both aces @h and @c right but you surely dont want to squese table by taking @d at once|pg||
nt|blum1956: well, dummy discards two spades, three clubs and one heart. Whatever declarer then leads he is home |pg||
nt|eleni: grateful|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|galois85: switch diamonds, then -1 |pg||
nt|ady: low spade lead would have failed in this case|pg||

nt|chmitty: but I agree with you William : North is more to blama|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roussol: spde now|pg||

pc|s6|nt|blum1956: West knows that the defense kept all the spades so leading a spade now cannot in practice help to avoid a guess|pg||

nt|andy_h: This bid is usually employed with a mexican 2@C (or 2@D) opening showing 18-19balanced, do E/W do that?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  not so bad one either, either @D 2-2 or @H 3-2|pg||

nt|runnerup: some ruffs coming here so only 3nt seems to make -but that cant be bidden|pg||

nt|runnerup: does east smell something here and bid?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@h is down one but it is difficult to bid it V vs NV|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: Not the greatest time for one of Ish Delmonte's slightly offbeat 1NT overcalls|pg||
nt|eleni: This will give time to the open room to get closer to board 18-19, as they still are playing 16|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2SA shows @h fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: 21 hard on's at EW?|pg||
nt|poohbear: interesting choice for South here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: probably 4 cards ?|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid 3@S with south|pg||
nt|athene: that would let north cause some trouble with his extra distribution|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like raising @cs preemptively|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Artur already played for Norway, in the Nordic Championships recently|pg||
nt|loe48: what is fasinating with bridge is that the cards can be twisted in so many directions..so many possibilities..so the players do constantly have choises|pg||
nt|rensph: 5@D is an excellent save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|stamkreas: the last 2 boards shopuld be flat, but we made par so we can celebrate already, Denmark is always a strong opponent!|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or did N help a bit|pg||

nt|poohbear: 2@h shows a decent raise to 2@s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: @s partial|pg||
nt|poohbear: now South doesnt know whether to save|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: sometimes you can rebid spades to show the extra length|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sharkey: nice stop by NS - Souths 4333 hand didnt appeal to him|pg||
nt|eleni: nice contract by Peter, as W can never return another @s|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but were is the K@c?|pg||
nt|eleni: true, but only 1 way to be played and cross his fingers that the K is with W|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course he doesnt know also the @hA|pg||
nt|chrisky: he knows the A@h is in w|pg||
nt|eugenio123: J@s would've been better|pg||
nt|rensph: lots of defense|pg||
nt|ady: my guess is down1   as long as south does not discard clubs|pg||
nt|rensph: other room played @SAK in 4@S, down 1 and 10 imps to Croatia again|pg||
nt|poohbear: had he raised @cs first his partner would know what to do|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42:  hard to find in this auction I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @CAx is golden|pg||
nt|andy_h: East, although the double fit is really good he is probably afraid of the lack of red-suit honours he had|pg||
nt|eleni: possible placing, yet not 100%|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @h was a good sacrifise vuln|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|alati: ara, den prokeitai na xasoume |pg||
nt|andy_h: If West had the same hand without the @HQ then slam is abysmal on a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S must be exclusion|pg||
nt|athene: so 5@H is two keys and the queen, and west will ask about @DK for seven maybe|pg||
nt|chmitty: would you stay silent with South's hand all the time ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roussol: mortensen is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|alati: kai kleinoume tin 1i mera me 38 vps|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on hand 16 was played by east   on 10@S lead   and club was immediately finesse  so hence down|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|poohbear: Schwartz electing to go for @c ruffs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: penultimate board here|pg||
nt|loe48: as we see this contract has no chanse..bu \t a fresh try|pg||
nt|chmitty: North to South : your lead partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess west decided that with @HAQ @CA @DK east was not just bidding 4@H over 3@S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Ish Delmonte preferred bidding 1Nt to bidding the very weak @h suit, which might be passed out in a 5-1 fit. I prefer @H myself, but I can see all 52 cards. |pg||
nt|runnerup: can they solve this -i doubt|pg||

nt|blum1956: Did South in fact play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: sure|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roussol: 21|pg||
nt|athene: if south had bid 3@S over 2nt then EW might be trying to get a decent penalty out of 6@SX|pg||

pc|h6|nt|alati: nomizw oti i tixi mas girise tin plati |pg||
nt|chmitty: the save in 6@s would have cost what ? 800 ?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 1@C openers that are less than 4 cards about 20 to 30% of the time, the need for a club stopper is regarded by some (not me) as a quaint and archaic concept.   |pg||
