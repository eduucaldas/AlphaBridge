pc|sK|nt|ntmon: as we don't exactly know what 3@S promises, it's not easy to tell who 'upgraded' - sure is 4@S has no play|pg||

nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ryskiel_: wynik jaki Pañstwo widz¹ na tablicy jest pochodn¹ zarówno dobrej gry naszych juniorek jak i nienajlepszej ich przeciwniczek|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Gerben42:  if you play any-strength 2-suiters, W should bid 3@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|szalay:  so 3@D, hands offense/defence ratio is very high, thats why not 1@D|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw I think to lead away LONG king is the worst lead, longrun|pg||

mb|3D|nt|eugenio123: this board can be interesting, they've lots of point but they just do 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: in OR, N repeated @H and drove EW to 3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: the bidding on this hand  seems to reflect the cards the players hold :)|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure declarer can come to nine tricks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: punkty zdobywa³y te¿ dobrymi rozgrywkami Kazmucha i ¯muda|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I assume West's 4@S is fast arrival, showing his distaste for thesoft @C cards|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|bmkl: 2 boards, 2 overtricks for France|pg||
nt|chrisky: no a @D is....|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  nice to have @H7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eugenio123: I guess they play 2@c as drury|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: defence can lead trumps to defeat  easily in a  moment|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eleni: They found the correct contract |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: That lead simplifies matters, but North had no reason to lead a @C - given that Suth didn;t open|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: well Chris:) we said helpful:) not Christmas yet for Santa to be here:)|pg||
nt|chrisky: last chance|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|eleni: now Q@s will give Stankovic  his discards|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course a @d ruff now, then a @cruff in hand and he is home|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS could not make much in spite of combined 23PC |pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|eleni: I suppose he chose to cross ruff it all for his contract|pg||
nt|bmkl: open tbl is in 3@h|pg||
nt|bmkl: no he will ruff high a @c, draw @hs and claim|pg||
nt|bmkl: all he needs is a 3-2 split in trumps|pg||
nt|possessed: + 100 seems a decent score from this hand|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but cashing the heart risks losing control|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not sure if a doublefinesse is correct now... just play one finesse ant @d 3-2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|possessed: for N-S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tejjyid: finessieng @D a bit risky with trumps out|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|szalay:  hope bridge is not icehockey, where anthem is for the winner only:)|pg||

nt|szalay:  I wd force us to game|pg||
nt|szalay:  my next move will be 4@S, except for 4@C|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even bidding a small slam would be a big achievement here I think|pg||
nt|szalay:  these are the most difficult slams to bid, when u have 2 running suit and nothing to spare|pg||
nt|szalay:  I think 3@S is a big underbid now|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@H is clear, the continuation is not|pg||
nt|szalay:  but to honest, from our front 4 Mr. Torma is the least experienced player|pg||
nt|szalay:  I never bid cue when I didnt decide follow-up|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay:  4@S is the close 2nd|pg||

pc|dK|nt|szalay:  3@S is standout by South|pg||
nt|szalay:  he denied 3card @S, anyway|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|cicus: I'd probably bid 4@H as a choice of denomination|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: he risked going down with @D KJ offside on this line, I think|pg||

nt|tejjyid: but still, success is the cure for all evils|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Henri, hi|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|eleni: even 5 with a correct @d play:)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes an easy raise to game maybe via some gadget|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||

nt|ntmon: rise with @DA, @C, and ruff a @C |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|sQ|nt|eleni: a lot depends on def.  as he has just 8 tricks, with correct guess in @s|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||

nt|ritong: i wouold like to play fitjumps with north hand|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit thin, but slam can be on very easily|pg||
nt|cicus: me too, although I was told they did not exist|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: problem, then:)|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|3S|nt|key1809: can make 4s ,here on a spade guess, but tough to reach|pg||
nt|ahri:  we saw how 3NT ends on the other table though.|pg||
nt|ntmon: (i do)|pg||
nt|cicus: with a fit jump, strengthis not particularly important|pg||
nt|ritong: well he lacks the fifth @h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to play fitjumps AND splinters, hard to organise|pg||
nt|ritong: which can make a considerable difference|pg||
nt|cicus: important is at what level you are willing to play|pg||
mb|4C|an|cue|nt|eleni: Mr.Grosset maybe never heard of 8 ever, 9 never:):) (too young for it:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: 1@h over X shows a good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: South will most likely TRF, and leave it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eugenio123: it's harder to reach thatn to respect I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S to|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ntmon: +130 available|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cicus: so you can combine fitjumps with splinters by using cue as splinter and jump shifts as fit jumps|pg||

nt|ahri:  i imagine french staying calm|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: a little nervous in french team|pg||
nt|mamos: France gained 3 imps on Board 5 when not only did Greek NS not bid Slam  they defended 4@Sx and only scored 500|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'd like ot know how North worked out to exit that @S|pg||
nt|ritong: would you respond to 1@s with south hand?|pg||
nt|cicus: I may be unfair, maybe he thought he could still make if @HK lies wellla fter all|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I do with an Ace|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but typically my partnerships open 1@S very heavy|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 6h, a decent contract, needing 3-2 hearts, but not here with a bad break|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that LHO is a passed hand is a factor imo|pg||
nt|ritong: he is less likely to balance|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||

mb|p|nt|key1809: yes, i remember, i played with a pd, when he thought he was going down, he used to claim:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: previous 2 hands rather sleepy, now more action? |pg||
nt|ritong: drijver should pass 1 NT|pg||

mb|1S|nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||

nt|possessed: actually last 4 boards|pg||
nt|pinticus: we hope for some action|pg||
nt|ntmon: W 2NT with red suits specifically i think|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good result for Sweden here|pg||
nt|ritong: clearcut double|pg||
nt|cicus: (you do not pass a minor suit opening with an ace and out)|pg||
nt|ritong: prolly east tanking|pg||

nt|rodal f: Passed. WD|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 9tricks playing nt|pg||
nt|ahri:  north being tricky, east failing to get seduced by 1@s bid|pg||
nt|ntmon: i would recommend 4@S - natural |pg||
nt|ritong: drijver: "sigh"|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: N should pass, if he doubles, S will remove and he does not want that|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahri:  wow|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  double game swing looming|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 2nt, starts of Leb,weak hands i presume|pg||
nt|eleni: interesting bid|pg||
nt|pinticus: X over 2nt could be penalty for one suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 6@C has the merit - it makes|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  11 from the top in @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  trump lead required to beat the 12th even|pg||
nt|cicus: E wit the axe|pg||
nt|ritong: again east tanking|pg||
nt|cicus: goes to my unbiased liking|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|key1809: 5nt wd have been a better choice|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||

nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
mb|3H|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||

nt|key1809: thx eugenio, |pg||
nt|ahri:  and some more 6carders |pg||
nt|ntmon: difficult to comment this one|pg||
nt|pinticus: really hard|pg||
nt|ntmon: let's go to final board, hope for more normal development|pg||
nt|ritong: last bullet now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|cicus: a tough 4@H - I think going downona @S lead|pg||
nt|ritong: this rather offtrack opening might get them out of game|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eleni: Last board for this round:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: we are back|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I'll be back at 16:20 cet to comment italian girl... who knows what my eyes will see lol|pg||
nt|key1809: :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: the lower you stop in @S the better|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: next room could not avoid the 6@d snag|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate that 1NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: so well done|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eugenio123: it seems they play forcing nt, another terrible convention I would never play|pg||
nt|ahri:  would be fun to see club lead with diamond underlead on 4@s. just for sake of entering bulletin.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahri:  sweating time for east|pg||
nt|ahri:  and a great lead for south|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think he is in control|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|key1809: i like to play it as SFG|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bmkl: Q@c?|pg||
nt|pinticus: so,last board of this set|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks all for a nice segment. TKs specialy to the exelent vug. opperator. Tks aso to the specs for there nice input's. See u later.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|key1809: west has to cash dmds, and play clubs for mini-tel no|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|key1809: north knows, he's is sunk, as both suits are open, does he sttle for 6 tricks by finessing hearts, and cashing SA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cicus: and no rebid problem either|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahri:  a prophet, i say.|pg||
nt|baardolav: I do not agree with that:) 1@d 1nt... is a problem... you need to pass, there is no rebid problems in nt either|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: merci a tous, was great fun for this sunday morning|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|cicus: 1@D-1NT is an  easy pass for me|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|mamos: the match has seemed quite close but too many silly mistakes from Greek team |pg||
nt|chrisky: specialy in the other room|pg||
