nt|mug: good afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: not a very appealing lead choice for south|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: lead away from a tenace into a strong balanced hand, or lead a singleton trump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: hello all from Albena resort - the host of 23rd Euro Youth Championship|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the diamond would be most people's choice - is it asking too much for partner to have the @DJ?|pg||
nt|mug: I think the diamond lead was pretty normal, if you blow a trick in diamonds it may well be it was going on something else anyway|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|lady007: have to lead something|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mug: that's a hell of a view |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mug: I'd have probably thought there's a danger of losing two clubs and a heart, so I need to try and drop the trump queen|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|mug: @S9 could have been @S109x or anything|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he felt that this was a safety play against 4-1 trumps and also picks up 109 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't necessarily afford any safety plays|pg||
nt|mug: could even be @SQ109x|pg||
nt|athene: also it might be Q109x!|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|mug: snap, both read The Expert Game|pg||
mc|10|nt|mug: well done Andrea Stankovic|pg||

nt|athene: so J from J9, etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: he could, of course lead small trump from his hand on the second round of trumps...now he needed both dummy's honours to be well placed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: maybe he could consider leading a club first|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: another 4@s coming up here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: to see how many spade losers he can afford|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: it's possible but opens up other cans of worms|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lady007: no attractive lead again for south|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|lady007: it looks like this 4@s will make with all the good breaks in the major suits. will lose a spade, heart and diamond|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mug: good technique here, starting on the side-suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mug: if he's watching the pips he'll note that @H6 has become good|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if north could have dropped the @S10 on the first round, sort of following from last hand's theme|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer might consider a trump to the nine sometimes and north might get a bit more control|pg||
