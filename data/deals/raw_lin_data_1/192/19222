mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: I am sure you know the e/w players |pg||

nt|sybarra: is this some funky multi?|pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay:  yes|pg||
mb|p!|an|Shows !D|nt|szalay:  I dont like multi, as u know|pg||

nt|sybarra: I do not mind multi when it is disciplined,  this one is NOT |pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: Thizy has her Multi defence sheet on her lap|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: so does S bid clubs now?  that would show a bigger hand imo |pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|an|p/c|nt|sybarra: as undisciplined as E was, I am surprised she didnt bid 3 @D |pg||
nt|szalay:  cause she liked 2@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  2@c puppet to 2@d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||

nt|vugraphzjt: Not so much the Multi as the 3N bid. 3@D looked like a maker|pg||

nt|Walddk4: welcome to Martin Johnson|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: hi johan, spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ryskiel_: przychylne uk³ady dla WE - nawet 10 lew mo¿liwe|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Sr2@D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  S has shown 5+@h also|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gronkvist:  Even after a friendly lead, so has W much to do|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Hi Tim|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|gronkvist:  S shows less then 7 HCP and 6+@h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: double of 1@S is alertable?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W loves to open 1 Nt on many hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||

nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||

nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
nt|athene: but fortunately for declarer east can't get in again to cash that @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: E cold have taken 2@d ruffs, not 9 tricks|pg||

pc|c8|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||

nt|eugenio123: so now our last ping pong board :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: playable 4@s|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw not only overruff is the danger: 2nd @C as well, she cant pull trumps and enjoy @Ds|pg||
nt|szalay:  (thats why I dont like to play for @Ds instead of @H)|pg||
nt|cicus: then she had a blind spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: she put a spade at the table and claimed|pg||
mb|1D|nt|eugenio123: but unlucky|pg||
nt|garden2005: Justyna wietnie zagra³a o 12 lew bo Stasiu ze Starachowic na ni¹ patrzy ...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nastêpna runda o 12:30|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: something like that |pg||
mb|2S|nt|yuval10: this looks rather interesting now... will South sacrifice over 4@s ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|gronkvist:  2@c again nat or any strong hand(17+)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  2@s is weak |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  again passive bidding by souht|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with 4crd support and such a good hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  I would bid 5@H |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  maybe 5@H is right, maybe 4@S is made|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yuval10: 4@s is of course a good bid when 4@h seem to be making for EW|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@S|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  only when its not 5@H and not 4@S its good to be in 5@H|pg||
nt|szalay:  why not 3@D by East 1stM|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|szalay:  khm...pass first, but bidding strong after?|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  just got the comment that the name of east is wrongly spelled|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  Its Puillet|pg||
mb|4D|nt|eugenio123: in my opinion 3@S is not enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: incomprehensible bidding by East|pg||
nt|szalay:  its doesnt sound realistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: easy now|pg||
nt|chrisky: lets see how good fisher guesses|pg||
