pc|dJ|nt|vasmar: yes and club finesse can sav declarer|pg||
nt|jcwla: well...|pg||
nt|mich-b: a 3rd @D by the defence will be fatal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: S has to pitch his 10 of trumps over the Ace to give the declarer chance to go wrong|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eleni: nice return by Giannis|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|andy_h: The standard lead for a trump (opening) lead is usually small because you never know if any of your big trumps can be promoted (you never know!). But otherwise if they are actually ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: useless or of equals then you can use them as suit-preference signals|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

nt|andy_h: Not sure I agree with the trump lead here - If declarer had removed 3NT to 5@D then there's a slight clue that declarer has clubs as the source of tricks|pg||

nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||

nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||

nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||

nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||

nt|mich-b: North's hand is very good in context|pg||
nt|mich-b: his @CKQxx are gold|pg||
nt|yuval10: he should pass forcing|pg||
nt|poohbear: and over 5@s ?|pg||

nt|poohbear: i agree michael|pg||
nt|mich-b: even if thats wrong (rarely) , EW might often save|pg||
nt|mich-b: also , by passing now , North might miss the chance to offer playing a better slam|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6H!|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mich-b: 6@S from North , is less good than from South|pg||

nt|vugraphzjm: no 12 only...|pg||
nt|poohbear: might be right to take the @d finesse. Dont see how it hurts|pg||
nt|mich-b: I think declarer will try the @D finesse |pg||
nt|mich-b: and when it fails will try to get the trumps right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: tes and if it fails, then to make another one in @ss|pg||
nt|yuval10: yet still, declarer doesn't want to finesse @d and go down immediately with a @c ruff|pg||

mb|d|nt|sharkey: Not sure what Gebrand's thinking was when he covered...|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|petergill: Not the greatest time for one of Ish Delmonte's slightly offbeat 1NT overcalls|pg||
nt|eleni: This will give time to the open room to get closer to board 18-19, as they still are playing 16|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Artur already played for Norway, in the Nordic Championships recently|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stamkreas: the last 2 boards shopuld be flat, but we made par so we can celebrate already, Denmark is always a strong opponent!|pg||

mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: nice stop by NS - Souths 4333 hand didnt appeal to him|pg||
nt|eleni: nice contract by Peter, as W can never return another @s|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but were is the K@c?|pg||
nt|eleni: true, but only 1 way to be played and cross his fingers that the K is with W|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course he doesnt know also the @hA|pg||
nt|chrisky: he knows the A@h is in w|pg||
mc|10|nt|Gerben42:  hard to find in this auction I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @CAx is golden|pg||
nt|andy_h: East, although the double fit is really good he is probably afraid of the lack of red-suit honours he had|pg||
nt|eleni: possible placing, yet not 100%|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators, Peter Gill and William Frisby|pg||
nt|famus: and 2@s if bid will make for another 5/6 imps|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Germany has improved a litte getting 12 imp on Bd 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the match - many thanks to our excellent operator in Albena, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and congrats to the Swedish team on this win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  although this hand...|pg||
nt|andy_h: he could bid 4NT a two suited takeout*|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with longer spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@s due to the extra spade|pg||
nt|raghavan: Braun is very conservative|pg||

nt|chrisky: very good lead..|pg||
