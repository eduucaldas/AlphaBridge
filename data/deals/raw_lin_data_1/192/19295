nt|rodal f: *specs|pg||
nt|iceblue: Hi,|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: 2@h should make in comfort, so an easy start to the championships|pg||
nt|rodal f: A invitation? Positive or negative trail? Nope.|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably ew will play in diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi|pg||
nt|bebechira: last match for the girls|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Trianin|pg||
nt|iceblue: Do they play Netherlands club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  9 lucky tricks E/! in a @S-contract|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@h in the other room|pg||

nt|eleni: Good morning Vladimir, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W|pg||
nt|dagold: In the other room north didn't sell out to 2@h|pg||
nt|richie: two strong pairs facing each other in this match, it will be interesting to watch I expect|pg||
nt|richie: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|raghavan: What  has happened?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4s in the open room as well...so quiet start to a decisive match :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 ver - nine...?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Frank:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our teams this morning: The Netherlands are 1st and Italy 3rd, so it will be a thrilling match|pg||
nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we saw, NL use invitation jacoby.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here we see EW plays the new swedish club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ntmon: EW showed semi-forcing-to-game, NT range, E transferred to @H, W accepted|pg||
nt|josj: good morning eleni|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Vladimir|pg||
nt|ntmon: gm Eleni and Jos|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h good morning Jos:) welcome|pg||
nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
nt|bebechira: they are playing in 2d :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankbo: :)|pg||
nt|richie: probably @s7, @sK and @dQ will be the best you can do as declarer and hope for something good|pg||

nt|oosb: 11?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|uttam: y 11 becos of @c lay out|pg||
nt|josj: 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  very important match here between the nr 1 and 2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jest to przedostania runda, druga po³owa meczy pomiêdzy dwiema pierwszymi dru¿ynami w tabeli|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|richie: great result for the french in the open room, +500|pg||
nt|iceblue: misunderstood, i guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Hei alle. Sorry for at eg e litt sein.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gronkvist:  1@c is 12-14 ntor 18-19 Nt or Natural with transfer respones|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|bebechira: may be special sequence|pg||
nt|raghavan: PARTNER OPENS BEUGER HAS good hand why stop in 2D|pg||
nt|iceblue: S must play this 2@D as XYZ, game forcing.|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden in 3nt in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the closed W in 2nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier for our West in Diamonds..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Marion:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  Top on its ways to France (N/S)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gronkvist:  And now is the point of this deal made or not made|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eleni: but the contract is makeable, as the @h finess works:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  WAS on tiÂ´s way...|pg||
nt|mrdct: she has a beer card too|pg||
nt|richie: 3x@h now and exit a low club will work (double dummy) hard to see with closed cards|pg||
nt|richie: not low club but 7 or 8|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table I think Rosaline Barendregt had to escape from 1@sX, it's usually bloody when opps pass a TO dbl on the 1 level, but not sure if 2@hX is such a big party|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  But still -100 should be good for N/S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|richie: straight forward line will succeed here, taking 1 rounds of trump and ruff 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|josj: what will happen to that 3rd spade?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|nt|loe48: ja var jo en god runde forrige..gutta e rvarme i troeya naa|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Sometimes better to go for 100 a trick then to try and make your partial|pg||
nt|zebutin: not sure but think Padon told both majors|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: I dont think so|pg||

nt|oosb: to settle your nerves|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bebechira: 5d in the open room so flat brd to start with|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h for NS...and 5d save for 3 imps for EW|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Har d for S to find the @H lead?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead. not sure i would have led the same but Axxx usually isnt so attractive to lead from either|pg||

mb|p|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
nt|raghavan: yES OTHER ROOM MADE ot TOO|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden need a 21-9 to capture the silver|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@C? strong2? seems unlikely|pg||
pc|s4|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Dbl here shows atleast same strengh as 1 NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With no chnace to reach the dummy this will go down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mam ma³¹ satysfakcjê, ¿e pierwsze dwa rozdania w turnieju bryd¿a sportowego Asia rozegra³a przeciwko mnie przed 12 laty|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 loser Hand so upgraded to 2C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: I dislike this strong2 2@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome back|pg||
nt|richie: rehi everyone|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Ofc W could be stronger also :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|raghavan: 5 D is likely to make |pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow...this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|iceblue: @S mb double it|pg||
nt|raghavan: IN THIS TABLE SWEDEN GIVES BACK WHAT IT GOT IN DEAL1|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
nt|iceblue: S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||

nt|Walddk4: ER  missing|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|bebechira: 3off for 500?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dagold: and easts is robertson|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 8 tricks|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|richie: probably she did not play the K|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|eleni: good play by Judith:)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, 5@h is only made when you have no heart loosers|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: key play was a club to K in case E has less than 4 hearts |pg||
nt|eleni: she has to keep it up cross-ruffing though |pg||
nt|josj: what is (not) happening?|pg||
nt|eleni: Minko?|pg||
nt|eleni: what is happening pls?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|richie: also a nice lead, maybe it will be a push then|pg||

nt|bebechira: just came home ...dinner time in Oz|pg||
nt|richie: only chance is @cQx then playing J from dummy is not helping|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might not. OR at 3NT and @H lead as well|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So no misdefence  here|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||
nt|richie: depends if Magdalena Ticha decides to bid 2@c for majors, then it must be easy for east to bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 4 imps for the Dutch girls|pg||
nt|richie: 6@s here in south|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Fish got his  ER       time for Robert to get his   SON|pg||

nt|bebechira: just came home...from dinner|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S makeable on a good trump guess|pg||

mb|2N|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||

nt|raghavan: 3Nt better|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida thought for a while and passed 4d |pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||

nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
nt|richie: Dutch a bit safer now for the silver medal and sweden has to watch out not to loose bronze to France, every IMP can make a different between medal / no medal or the colour of it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 extra trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a normal lead  but @s lead would be the best |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
nt|bebechira: France 2 vps behind at the moment|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is great Youngsters are in Bridge in Europe|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|richie: I am surprised a bit by the 4@s bid by Magdalena Ticha, 4@h would be more descriptive - she usually bids it with these hands|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||
nt|eleni: nowhere to discard the losing @h|pg||

nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He thought it was from shortage|pg||
nt|andyv:  who needs to read?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It looks silly to duck, but if West had 8x and @CA it was necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it is no error, just an unfortunate guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you congratulate W on a great lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Their lead is 1,3,5  and 2/4 through decl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andy, I think the 8 is more likely to be from 85 than from AQ85|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I honestly don't think that Fisher did anything wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may convince me Roland, but that would also assume that W had the A of @c and decided to lead a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now Mike is thinking could Lothan really duck from Kxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for the defense, W can actually shift here and have time to correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an unreasonable lead from a doubleton once dummy did not stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is a good chance that partner has long spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: she has such a nice hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: S will not pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: I may have competed to 2@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5c in the closed by W|pg||
nt|richie: or even 5, west has a strong hand (knowing partner is short in spades)|pg||
nt|richie: they play TO dbls... otherwise West could have X-ed, maybe east can X this?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
nt|bebechira: clubs break nicely for Jamilla so she will bring the contract home|pg||

nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||
nt|richie: south needs to lead a heart, will she again find it?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  might lead a diamond |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
nt|richie: horrible distribution for Claire (north), 3 down is the expected result|pg||
nt|marionmi:  JT9 looks attractive|pg||

nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
nt|rodal f: A better color so natural lead.|pg||
nt|bebechira: and West bid 1spade|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s seems normal, needs some careful declarerplay|pg||
nt|richie: @s leads helps fortunately, now declarer has time to finesse twice in diamonds and also to ruff a @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is good that she is taking her time...important board|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Lothan is an expert|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity East has not overtaken D|pg||
nt|bebechira: big mistake|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|richie: now Sigrid (east) has time to establish her clubs - won't take too long|pg||
pc|d7|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||

nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||

nt|richie: 3@d is invitational|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  At the club you often see people ruffs with their small trumphs that you need later :)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|murat e: pass...|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hope they do not go to slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: there 2-3 marginal boards per set///and they must be given special attention|pg||
nt|richie: 3@H or 4@H?|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: E should know that W must have 4@D|pg||

nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
nt|richie: South surely won't :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: 3@hX in the other room...|pg||

nt|richie: on board 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... this will a swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|richie: I think 4@h is justifiable|pg||
nt|richie: but 3@h probably better in green, still need good values from partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will help the decl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@s should bid bye a nice 12-14 bal so |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Karlsson's @HQ at the other table was better|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  When you have KQx in trumphs you dont want ruff with them|pg||
pc|c4|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||

nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a @c in to W suit(often could be 18-19 bal) is not a good start|pg||
pc|cK|nt|raghavan: 2 tricks loss cannot be avoided|pg||
nt|bebechira: farnce 157 sweden 156 after 21 brds|pg||
nt|bebechira: france |pg||

pc|s5|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  that might get expensive|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Looks like an overtrick now that spades are 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about making with a heart lead|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Padon obv thinks partner has either more for his 3@c bid or a singleton in @hs or @ds . I agree . Seems that Birman should just try 3NT . 5@c is a stretch with 5-4-2-2 9 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: so nothing routine for Israel and 3NT today|pg||

nt|loe48: 2 stikk der i motspill om ikke 3|pg||
nt|ntmon: the preemt did not paid off, indicated !Q at N|pg||
nt|mrdct: usually right to pass it out in 4th seat if you don't have the @s suit|pg||
nt|spenny80: strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: P + number of @S = pass with <15|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 5/5 11count and a major...|pg||
nt|richie: the more conservative approach in the open room is paying off so far|pg||
nt|richie: hello Marleen :) excited to watch your team?|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Traian :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, 2H worked well in assuring a heart lead, but i wouldnt have bid it on a 4 count. And 3H..... well.... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: right Vladimir|pg||
nt|spenny80: I open|pg||
nt|richie: when France and Sweden both have the same number of VPs, France will probably become third, they won the match against sweden 18-12|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oosb: But would you have dbled with South's hand?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden got a lead of 12 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: its very fast to get out on thoose..but a cleat 1s opener imo|pg||
nt|loe48: clear|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rodal f: En interresant hand. |pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||
nt|neobas: due to the operator not having the file with the hand recrods, we will probably not be able to broadcast it on BBO, regretfully|pg||
nt|richie: these north hands are problematic in many systems: many points, no stopper, no 4+@S |pg||
nt|neobas: Not a good result for the Dutch in the OR|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  5 cl in other room here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: whenever i open those sorts of hands i write down -110 5 minutes later|pg||
nt|frankaus: no of @S is an important factor|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|spenny80: here 4@s could make|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the Dutch girls now to recover some imps?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: B4 2@HE as here.|pg||
nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|richie: Big score for the french again...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is easier|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h K lead (not the best )|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and makes even on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
nt|richie: I guess Magdalena (west) will lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
nt|marionmi:  now what will Ticha lead? ace of spades, trying to shorten declarer? a trump to prevent the ruffs?|pg||
nt|richie: it's often good with 4 small trumps to lead them|pg||
nt|marionmi:  you know her better than i do :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 2NTW and a swing to come.|pg||
nt|richie: we made it to some kind of rule :) 4 small trumps = trump lead|pg||
nt|marionmi:  a lot of bad breaks here|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 slemmer står. @C - @D og NT.|pg||
nt|frankbo: tror han prøver med 6sp|pg||
nt|loe48: fordi ikke stoette fra 3 til 4d|pg||
nt|oosb: Meanwhile Hungary picked up 7 imps in the 2@D deal|pg||
nt|eleni: Margherita is right thinking |pg||
nt|frankaus: i willl see if they are short elsewhere as there are 3 comment. here cu |pg||
nt|neobas: Surely W has a hand to get into the auction here|pg||
nt|richie: depends on your perspective|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@C=trans to me |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: this is a typical need to cash tricks contract..a slip and it makes|pg||
nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||
nt|frankbo: kommer nok kl ess|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
nt|marionmi:  how should she play? win in hand and play a spade?|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board, declarer has to be careful, and NOT finesse in @hs|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d is puppet to 3@h with supp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: support for what?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So a dangerous board for sweden|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, 93 is not what I call support :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
nt|richie: 3rd5th lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h went 2 down in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 22|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  something is being lost in the translation|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like we are heading to 5@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And 4 cl Short @c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So we may ending very wrong here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that East meant 3@D as stopper ask after South's interference|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes she mean that|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6 kloever , 6d og 6nt staar..vil de lande paa fotene her?|pg||
nt|frankbo: sorry han melder jo self 6 kl|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or draw trumps and take the double club hook?|pg||
nt|richie: 2 more imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 2 more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
mb|4H|nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
nt|richie: I guess you could better try to ruff 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or take in dummy and start playing clubs right away?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes same in Open too|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W continue to Que|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: I would try for that, and establish diamonds as we go|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but then you have to win a high heart in dummy right away and you may have to ruff 1 or 2 spades with your high trumps in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HK lead was what declarer needed in the other room|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so i think he pass now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which seems a strange lead after West had shown hearts. Then the other red king looks more attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ruff one seems to be enough for =|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am wrong it seems:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes so both swedish pair should remember board 7 |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
nt|richie: that's also true- maybe @sJ9 stops the spades a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately, Johan was right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-2 fits at the 4-level usually don't play well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
pc|d2|nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems u was right.|pg||
nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... you were saying about finessing richard????|pg||
nt|richie: 4@h will go down here, @druff coming |pg||
nt|richie: I don't remember :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: why is Magdalena thinking....is this worring you?|pg||
nt|richie: not at all worrying|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: just contemplating, only problem is that @d8 can also be played from 832|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes|pg||
nt|richie: and 2nd problem is that partner encouraged in spades|pg||
nt|richie: and third...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we have seen examples of a 4-2 fit being the only makeable game|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bebechira: defeating or making is a 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|richie: @s2 is disappointing... another trump would have worked better|pg||
nt|marionmi:  would easts diamonds be count? should be lavinthal maybe|pg||
nt|richie: they show count|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR the NT ended -1|pg||
nt|richie: small swing|pg||
pc|d8|nt|josj: difficult to imagine for defence that E has such a bad hand...|pg||
nt|ntmon: exactly .. there danger comes from|pg||
nt|josj: and any mistake now will be fatal immediately|pg||
nt|spenny80: hi all|pg||

nt|josj: hi Fabio|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|loe48: there the slip came..he didnt want to listen to his pd's signal of switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C10 should have been a nice warning.|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I meant|pg||
nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: need @c back to beat|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think thier rule is to playing their ordinary system when W could bid nat 2@h but if Opps bid after the answer they play more natural like that Cilla thought|pg||
pc|d6|nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: of course, we know .. she should take it and play @DA  .. but ..|pg||
nt|eleni: probably never heard of the rule "3rd high" and never rescue your partner either:)|pg||
nt|richie: big swing at stake here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well 5 here and 5 there make 10 for me:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: Just looks like a totally normal auction|pg||
nt|loe48: det staar paa at en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|richie: it seems they did not have this tool of 1@s so rosaline Barendregt decided for 2@c|pg||
nt|richie: now the problem is solved|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...8 tricks for the taking... and 1 imp for France|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankbo: der håkon og lars spillte 3N minus fire meldte det 7kl dbl med 800|pg||

nt|mrdct: looking at that dummy - getting rid of an entry to the @d suit looks stand-out|pg||
nt|mrdct: good defence|pg||

pc|d5|pg||

pc|s9|nt|mrdct: all that remains for the defence now is to duck one round of @d|pg||
nt|richie: no overcall in spades at the other table, so the contract is played in north, it could make a difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A board to forget for Sweden in both rooms. Happens to all of us|pg||
pc|s6|nt|richie: must be a relief to make this contract|pg||

nt|marionmi:  she doesnt need to have a very good spade stopper for a 1 level nt bid|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, usually 1nt is more like 8-10 in this situation|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 @D from East, even vulnerable, NOT everybodyÂ´s taste, and absolutely not mine! Actually it helps N/S to stay out of a hopeless 6 @S|pg||

nt|eleni: For results pls go to : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||

nt|spenny80: I prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  this contract will make, but 2@s might make as well|pg||
nt|richie: pass over 1@d by west looks strange but her philosophy is that an overcall should be useful for the lead, @sA9xxx is worse than @sKT9xx, then she would surely overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: I think I would have upgraded the South hand|pg||

nt|richie: Hungary plays well, agressive style and putting lots of pressure - they made a pretty tough already for some top teams|pg||
nt|marionmi:  NS can also make 3@d but it wil be difficult to get there after the 1@c opening from north|pg||

nt|asig: Killing led from Jones|pg||
nt|timve:  that is surprising|pg||
nt|spenny80: now i was better to bid 2@h not 3@c, to show raise @c (pass before) and long @h|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good play by Cilla not to win her @HK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Same goes for Axxx|pg||

nt|ntmon: large gain for Italy, now match almost close|pg||
nt|spenny80: they don't play polish club?|pg||
nt|mrdct: assuming the dbl promises 4@s (i have no idea if it does)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i heard polish club is out of favour with a lot of the juniors these days|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danes had the same horrible start against Israel yesterday but went on to win the match by 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deja vu perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for N to insist on @s contract?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Tell their captain to wake them earlier|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile Hungary has a small margin (40- 11 imps) over Sweden, no 3 at this moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: east must avoid spade lead though|pg||
nt|oosb: Is everyone bidding 3@H here?|pg||
nt|uttam: 4h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure after the x..|pg||
nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||
nt|oosb: So I might lose imps in this deal, but I pass as West|pg||
nt|spenny80: really?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i meant by south|pg||
nt|richie: straightforward 3NT, @hK is protected so it should  not be very problematic|pg||
nt|antoniz: Witam serdecznie|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: no, well done|pg||
nt|loe48: saa 6 spar er prosentmessig mye daarligere|pg||
nt|bebechira: easy 4s here.... |pg||
nt|richie: Friday and Sat?|pg||
nt|richie: time to claim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 3@d i think is forcing...|pg||
nt|richie: what happened here? doesn't west have a normal 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|richie: in 1NT you count 7 tricks when you manage to make 3 spade tricks, best line would be to attack them a.s.a.p. and leave the heart suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: you want to help here?|pg||
nt|bebechira: sorry.....private|pg||
nt|richie: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Richard|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|murat e: oh|pg||
nt|spenny80: lol|pg||
pc|dK|nt|loe48: 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's better not to test partner here, being a passed hand |pg||
nt|josj: defence can take 4 tricks at most on this layout|pg||
nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
nt|richie: good question by one of the kibs, where should EW have entered the auction on board 25? I have no idea... maybe 3@d overcall by east when you play it as preemptive|pg||
nt|richie: honestly I have no idea - I am not in Albena|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith rebid 1nt on the same auction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|timve:  good contract, but normally going off|pg||

nt|bebechira: yes ... :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  No more comments to-day - this is too much|pg||

nt|timve:  two finesses off and missing @CAK|pg||
nt|timve:  this lead doesnt change a lot|pg||
nt|timve:  srr|pg||
nt|richie: makes more sense|pg||
nt|richie: this can go 3 down with maximum defence|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|timve:  it does|pg||
nt|spenny80: the will play 5 without Qtrump|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: well it seems this may make, but its not laydown|pg||
nt|richie: but I can imagine some disappointment, they had just one goal: GOLD|pg||
pc|d5|nt|murat e: five level belongs to opponents someone said...|pg||

pc|d9|nt|frankbo: tror simonsen hadde et uheldig motspill mot 1hj X|pg||

pc|cK|nt|bebechira: that's for sure... very good team|pg||
pc|c2|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a club switch|pg||
nt|richie: @cT is more deceptive|pg||
pc|c9|nt|timve:  to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|timve:  a small one|pg||
nt|marionmi:  rehi, got kicked out|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  in CR, a relay auction found the 5-3 @s fit...it can be made if you play W to have all the @ss|pg||
pc|c7|nt|josj: better to test @D first, I would say|pg||
nt|richie: for me Wednesday will be a feast :)|pg||
nt|richie: would everyone pass  1NT with the east hand?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|spenny80: yes|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|josj: goo defence...|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but it seems like i havent missed that muhc|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gronkvist:  At the other table N made a slamtry|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bebechira: i think for the girls the head to head match will be the one|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N much easier|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|runnerup: no real chance if @s ace not well placed -so that make or sunks this|pg||
nt|antoniz: piêkne zagranie|pg||
nt|richie: @cT and another club, south will finally get 3 more diamond tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|richie: chalking up 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|timve:  its surprising how quick the play is|pg||
nt|spenny80: but she has good cards in @c |pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosb: @D guess now |pg||
nt|oosb: doesnt know A@S vs A@D|pg||
nt|oosb: so this is tough|pg||
nt|uttam: but did not require @d guess, dec could find out about @s ace 1st|pg||
nt|richie: just 17 imps for poland|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a llady?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oosb: I think he needs to play small anyway|pg||
nt|josj: and another deserved imp to the Azzurre|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And S tought w ruffing walues to play  @s|pg||
mc|10|nt|rodal f: Y. @SKQ and a @H shift.|pg||

nt|bebechira: Poland is the second last match|pg||

nt|bebechira: the open room settled in 6|pg||
nt|iceblue: its hard after 3@H|pg||
nt|richie: sweden is still 3rd but cannot afford too many bad boards|pg||

nt|frankbo: hadde blitt vanskelig for Ø med 3 hj fra S|pg||
nt|timve:  this pair has a better solution|pg||
nt|timve:  they use Kokish|pg||
nt|timve:  2@H is natural or very strong NT|pg||
nt|spenny80: no, She can play @h finess or @s expass|pg||
nt|richie: could be a swing board here, 6@s is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|richie: very difficult board to bid... both have a 2 suiter, you miss one ace (fortunately opposite void) and it's hard to really establish the fit|pg||
nt|richie: 1@s - 2@d // 3@c - 3@d // 4@d or 4@h may have done the job|pg||
nt|iceblue: agree|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With AK@h and a normal @c shift |pg||
pc|hK|nt|uttam: i understand|pg||
nt|timve:  it seems E-W dont have good agreements after 2NT|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT is now played in the wrong hand, defence can take their diamond tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That does not beat it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|timve:  cause with 6HCP I would get ideas|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table Judith Nab actually opened the door for 7@d but Rosaline Barendregt firmly closed it again|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: Ville ikke 3@S vert gratis. Spørsmål etter hold eller advanced que bid?|pg||
nt|uttam: no power|pg||
nt|josj: @H finesse seems best option as @C might be 5-3...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will have problems here|pg||
nt|bebechira: still 2 vps in front|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|richie: sweden 155, france 153, italy 149 (maybe they are the 3rd dog coming for the bone?)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No u right |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He then set up the spades|pg||

pc|c9|nt|loe48: ja er muligheter her|pg||

nt|spenny80: last board 6@s for italy and same defence|pg||

nt|bebechira: 5d is closing the door as well?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ntmon: enjoy your coffee gentlemen anyway:)|pg||
nt|richie: here it is west who is shutting the door, in open room it was east (surprisingly)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Så etter 3@S fra N kommer 4@H fra S som sier at 3@S var et advanced que.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 now i think with the non-@c lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: ah yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: the italian girls in the other room would've been better to play count on the opening @DK lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|richie: incredibly difficult board, she had to develop @h first (@h2 to J) but who can find that?|pg||
nt|richie: you have to play hearts to take north's entry for the 4th spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: club lead in the open room by Nab and Jack played|pg||
nt|richie: I was just going to say that I think south will lead @c6 :) but wrong guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 3-3 @s will see this one home|pg||

nt|frankbo: y|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid in east showed an invitational hand with 3+@s or a mild game forcing hand, maybe with 13 and a side suit she is too strong, on the other hand Magie in west could have bid ...|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d shortness|pg||

nt|murat e: slammish hand but duplication in spades only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here the top-spot is 460...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: sorry for this situation|pg||
nt|murat e: this type of hand difficult to evaluate make souths spade one more club one less and slam is on with a normal 3-2 trump break|pg||
nt|MarekW: sorry we got wrong boards 11 and 12 from 13 will be correct|pg||
nt|murat e: i think we have to wait since next round begins|pg||
nt|murat e: south opens say 2 nt 3 cl puppet from north|pg||
nt|murat e: 3 dia no 5 card major but at least one 4 card major|pg||
nt|murat e: 3sp i have 4 hearts|pg||
nt|murat e: 4cl agreeing trump suit and cue-bid|pg||
nt|murat e: 4 dia cue bid....|pg||
nt|murat e: and the moment of truth|pg||
nt|timve:  I would like 2NT-3@C//3@D-3@S (4@H)// 4@C (4@H and max), etc...|pg||
nt|ntmon: such a splendid outcome ..|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c are 4/4 or Aces is in north (with Axx in south probably she takes on 1st round)|pg||
nt|josj: and another imp for Italy...|pg||
nt|josj: Judith?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark defeated Israel in the juniors .. 19-11 so Israel lead is now 'only'14 VPS|pg||
nt|richie: partscore in @h probably|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Netherland picked up a new 6 IMPer at B8|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: 5@s 5m|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|loe48: we need some action here now|pg||
nt|richie: it's a very low scoring match - usually I need a calculator when the dutch were playing :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: action here for sure lol|pg||
nt|richie: crazy hands this session :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Enig Frank, etter reversen fra N. Stil og avtaler i makkerparet, men...|pg||
nt|oosb: that was quick :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I can see it though|pg||
nt|antoniz: z³apa³a przeciwniczki za gard³o|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Asia Krawczyk Taczewska: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=29688|pg||
nt|richie: aha, no, east can open 1NT first - will be playing 2@s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|runnerup: 3nt with @d guess or lead here|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c = gazzilli|pg||
nt|richie: south has a lot of trumps, but that's all, I guess she will pass in these vulnerabilities, north may dbl?|pg||
nt|richie: everyone passing? maybe 1@s - 2@c pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 2@d positive|pg||
nt|richie: no, passing wisely|pg||
nt|bebechira: n will double|pg||
nt|bebechira: oops...she didn't|pg||
nt|richie: just made, good result for the French girls Carole and  Claire, they avoided any tragedies|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bebechira: incredibil.... N is playing in 4s in the closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: som GEO sier, 4 rut må være cue med hj, kanskje beste varianten|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c in east and 3NT by west is my guess - but 2@s is also possible of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  hmm with north you would like to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  double as t/o is the way to do it|pg||
nt|timve:  also 2NT cannot be natural in this situation|pg||
nt|timve:  north is thinking about it|pg||
nt|timve:  3@D is down one|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c = 5/4 (not 6/4 not 5/5)|pg||
nt|spenny80: strong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 1Nt is better the dbl|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be expecting 4@h from west|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|richie: you need some tricks to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we have Israel 275-Italy 261-Denmark 235 the medals at the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  at the other table a very nice lead from Barendregt on board 10 |pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2@h will play OK|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|richie: south in open room has GREAT courage!!! she bids 2@c for majors|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT! that's again modest|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Puppet on so 5@Ss|pg||
nt|timve:  defeating the contract instantly|pg||
nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: west does have a hand better for playing in a suit contract|pg||
nt|richie: can Italy still challenge Israel, you think?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|spenny80: probably with 3@c denies 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: but i'm not sure|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she will make some tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope.. I think the israelis are very strong...they will not give it away after such a start|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Kanskje GEO vil hjelpe oss litt? Velkommen.|pg||
nt|loe48: 4h and 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|frankbo: will bidd 6 now|pg||
nt|frankbo: 1 down|pg||
nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
nt|richie: small @c to K and 3 rounds of clubs, then @dA and diamond? maybe north is tempted to jump by Q|pg||
nt|marionmi:  around 8 is my guess|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marionmi:  yes but even that isnt enough if north keeps her spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, south has 3|pg||
nt|jkotor: strefa szlemowa na drugim stole pozostawia trochê do ¿yczenia|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the right plan was to ruff 2 @d and 2@s before pulling the trumphs and then palyed a@hJ and N was endplayed (from Johan Upmark)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||
nt|richie: are you kidding me?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  what should she discard on the 3 clubs? a diamond, a heart and a spade?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|loe48: if he raise club ace it makes|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 5@c i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: little try|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... big misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dagold: he had to decide how likely it is pard has a good hand with clubs when holding Qxx himself. not so unreasonable to pass imo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ikke tid. Synd.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y or H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankbo: well|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even not by raising @CA u have a squize endplay.|pg||
nt|frankbo: could still endplay E|pg||
nt|loe48: still possibilities id say|pg||
nt|loe48: draw 9 cards in spade and dia..so whats left|pg||
nt|ntmon: still tempting for W|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult for W not accept|pg||
nt|richie: yes, probably - even 2 hearts is OK|pg||
nt|richie: you can see that dummy is inaccessible|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: can W be sure of 2 aces opposite?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|ntmon: italian girls are well prepared concerning bidding system - my conclusion|pg||
nt|richie: I don't know the leads well enough, could @sT be from AJT? I guess not... |pg||
nt|richie: NS now need to establish the @h trick before it disappears... easier for North to see it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|runnerup: ok thats for that game nice peaceful a couple off down like 2 ..|pg||
nt|loe48: east need to blank club ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Welcome back from space:)|pg||
nt|eleni: well stopped by W|pg||
nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am not kidding you...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here 2@h was 8-11|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||
nt|richie: this will make now, courage has been rewarded and 6 imps to Sweden|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: 3NT probably plays quite well though with the @d suit sitting nicely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|richie: problems are solved now, 9 tricks in the pocket|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|richie: maybe if she manages to make 6 tricks they will win 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: weired bidding as well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  One should ask for unblock or count, the other for attitude|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|frankbo: det tror jeg lars fikk en gavepakke|pg||
nt|rodal f: GEO sin melding på B11 ville vert 4@D=2 nøkkelkort+trumfQ. @H|pg||
nt|frankbo: kl så er han vel trumfmatt|pg||
nt|loe48: har vi noe sluttkontrakt i spill 9?|pg||
nt|frankbo: nei|pg||
nt|josj: is 6@C such a bad proposition if @H are 4-3?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|loe48: draw spades and dia..look for an opening|pg||
nt|rodal f: I fired up my lungh torpedo at wait for a paper play.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Snart|pg||
nt|richie: good result for NS|pg||
pc|c9|nt|frankbo: den kl 3 kan lure begge spillerne|pg||
nt|rodal f: The normal anyway is a hook in @H. No special signals.|pg||
nt|loe48: i mean draw spades and dias..look for possibilities..a hook is often to simple to just do|pg||
nt|loe48: you get valuable info|pg||
nt|loe48: that might make you change foot|pg||
nt|frankbo: drar han alle korta til bunns kan Ø kaste kl ess for ikke å bli innspillt|pg||
nt|loe48: da har han 12|pg||
nt|loe48: saa johansen..dra ned en trump til du|pg||
nt|spenny80: but with @h 4-3 is good slam...|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe pitch @dQ here to put some doubt in declarer's mind|pg||
pc|c7|nt|josj: well, maybe not if @C 4-1|pg||
nt|spenny80: not sure...|pg||
nt|spenny80: could be the same|pg||
pc|h5|nt|timve:  well no problems in 2@H|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes but you usually dont like to creat voids too early in the hand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|frankbo: 6 rut|pg||
nt|rodal f: Går mot slem. 6@D på B9|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3round @h and all ruffs...|pg||
nt|bebechira: France in 2c|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: And burn ure own hand if wrong. @H hook is 50% 4@H and @CA at E is a lot less|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|loe48: pent. er nok den beste slemmen|pg||

nt|richie: ladies and gentlemen, another wild hand!|pg||

mb|4D|nt|spenny80: bid|pg||

nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|spenny80: could be|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think she will|pg||
nt|marionmi:  then 3@s-5@d?|pg||
nt|richie: that would shut out NS bidding completely |pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, 1@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3 nt in open room |pg||
mb|d|nt|oosb: Another example of a pushy dbl|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes, but isn't mp|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's easier to adapt your bidding methods than give away your years |pg||
nt|mrdct: some goods 10s and 9s|pg||
nt|richie: horrible hands!! they open multi and EW face these hands... |pg||
nt|richie: dbl probably and then 5@d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but south will bid something, wont she?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, and then its up to north|pg||
nt|marionmi:  who hasnt shown any suit yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I can only agree :)|pg||
nt|richie: north will just do 5@s, solid enough|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ticha trying to trap the opponents?|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably not the contract here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|richie: 3@c now and then 3NT would work well and is likely  to happen|pg||
nt|marionmi:  into doubling them?|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: in other room netherlands girl think as me|pg||
nt|ntmon: may die out at 5@S|pg||
nt|richie: well bid |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 tricks :(|pg||
nt|richie: 6 or even 7@d is making, you need to rebid @ds for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: hehe|pg||
nt|oosb: But then again, I'm never opening this 1@C|pg||
nt|josj: should not be too difficult to locate @CQ|pg||

nt|spenny80: with 2 suiter in est and seeing 2@s in E, Q@c can't pay|pg||

nt|spenny80: 6@d?|pg||
nt|josj: -2 I think|pg||
nt|richie: maybe:)|pg||
nt|richie: then you should pass again|pg||
nt|marionmi:  north didnt take this opportunity to bid her spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: spade lead?|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well, hold on, this 4 have just passed a hand out|pg||
nt|spenny80: better 4@s in west else 5@d....|pg||
nt|richie: declarer has to take care of her communication - she can pick up 4@h tricks but needs to be careful with her @d entry|pg||
nt|richie: 4@d is again a bit modest, the void in @h doesn't encourage her I think|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yeah but still|pg||
nt|antoniz: :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|murat e: 3 dia is the best spot but how to get there|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N somehow showed hearts?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@dX is my guess, bidding went slow enough |pg||
nt|richie: north never showed her extra values, 3NT will be the end|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|murat e: not possible w standart bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: good play|pg||
nt|murat e: covering costs a trick|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  @S is best |pg||

nt|timve:  if declarer takes in her hand|pg||

nt|richie: 5@s is down on a @h lead, bridge can be a funny game|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 3@c would have been down a bunch|pg||
nt|bebechira: you went quiet Richard ?|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT in the meanwhile makes comfortably|pg||
nt|marionmi:  still down on a heart return|pg||
nt|richie: @dQ on the K :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c pitch seems automatic, whether W can ruff or not|pg||

nt|mrdct: but not a friendly layout in @d today|pg||
nt|spenny80: I bet 2@d|pg||
nt|richie: again unlucky breaks, but NS should be able to stop in 2@h/2NT here - south should just bid 1NT and deny 3@h with these good spades|pg||

nt|richie: Magdalena has to switch to a @d to set the contract (at least not spade)|pg||
nt|bebechira: i just typed ...diamond 2 now|pg||
nt|richie: 3@h is a challenge - you will have to take @d in north and play a club towars KT9 and allow east to keep it when she puts her figure|pg||
nt|richie: only way to discard your loosing @s|pg||
nt|richie: some alternative (playing low @H first or 2x@d) is possible|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Known as Häxan in Sweden I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2h 1d and 1c ...|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  But they played not the normal one. 2@c is either any strong or 14-16 w 6+@s|pg||

pc|h6|nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
