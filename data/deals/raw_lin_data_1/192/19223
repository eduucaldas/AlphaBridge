mc|9|nt|henryb:  Since you have no real clues about the minor suit distribution, the @s coming home after AKQ is still 73% or so, the finesse through the hand short in hearts is 55%.|pg||
nt|thorvald: You will win in 6,5% of the time, but loose to Jx, or Jxx about 37% of the time, so its bad odds|pg||
