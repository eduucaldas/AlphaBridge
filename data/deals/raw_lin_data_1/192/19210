nt|rodal f: If any like to follow more than this board: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||

nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
pc|c8|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||

nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||

pc|c9|pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S needs to bid 3N|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw 4@H is much better game|pg||
nt|szalay:  3@H-4@H|pg||
nt|szalay:  it can even make for @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  but not after a low @c lead:)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|szalay:  I wd bet for @D lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: S is having all bids in hand, separating 3@s from them|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|szalay:  with QJT8x why looking better than 4@H?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  running out of options and steam|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, you may be right...4@h may be final contract |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|szalay:  if Kiss doesnt lead @D: a magican|pg||
nt|szalay:  but what are the trumps, that is the question?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd be more inclined to lead a @h or K@s|pg||
nt|szalay:  because u r lookin the hands, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  and from bidding, hard to tell that @cs are 4-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: none @d lead 3 imps if -1, @d lead +13 if =|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: but Morgan is in deep thoughts yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  they're lack of bidding NT would connotate to me the lack of @ds but, since I have 6 of them, they are probably very short|pg||
nt|andyv:  so there is a greater risk of losing a trick by leading a @d|pg||
nt|szalay:  I wd cut my hand first, but wd not lead K of @S|pg||
nt|szalay:  and u see the @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not that drastic...I just put a quarter into the jar|pg||
nt|szalay:  its rather sounds their @D is weak|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  I would prefer Kx of @s...K10 is pretty pricy|pg||
nt|szalay:  will be @D lead as well, -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now we don't have to worry about that|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@c or low @c is probably best here|pg||
nt|szalay:  Andy, somethiong for u:|pg||
pc|d7|nt|szalay:  players see only 13 cards, not 52|pg||
nt|szalay:  bridge from 52 is so boring|pg||
nt|andyv:  now I think a @d lead as way too dangerous|pg||
pc|dT|nt|szalay:  ok, 1 off, 3 imps for Scotland|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  in 4@h, you could surmise that pd had 4@hs|pg||
