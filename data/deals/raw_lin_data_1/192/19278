nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably he will leadwith Q@h|pg||

mb|5D|nt|lady007: i think i would have passed with north but i wouldnt be happy about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||

nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||

nt|timve:  hello all|pg||
nt|lady007: hi Tim|pg||
nt|gmarco24: welcome Tim|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 2 was played in 4 spades making all 22 times|pg||
nt|juan lukas: with 16 HCP and stiff @s ,  would have doubled for sure so no finesse against J @s |pg||
nt|ybob: S showed A@S KJ @H A@D and K@C, with A@S stiff not bid pass over 3@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: wery good result for F in open here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|eugenio123: 2@d by south I guess|pg||
nt|ahri:  (almost) misfit distributive hands, this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  East was squeezed on  3 - nice play by Giampetro on that one|pg||
nt|ritong: south has to invite|pg||
nt|ritong: a natural 2NT seems to match his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it'sa whole lot of losers, but too many points to do less|pg||
nt|tejjyid: great bid,the natural 2NT|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  it all depends on how do you agree what 3@h is here. some play it forcing, some play it constructive NF, I don't find any of those "wrong" :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our open table is really taking its time:)|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c is GF relay|pg||

nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 minor nS|pg||
nt|liraren: double fit for both pairs now maybee some action|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
nt|lady007: I expect west to come in with 2@h|pg||
nt|dkkello: Denmark with a great oppertunity here|pg||
nt|ybob: clear slam |pg||
mb|d|nt|possessed: 2d is- 20-22 with a five card suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: as Roland uses to say, @C suit died in 50-ties|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: probaly 21C Michael's or Ghestemish - both majors |pg||
nt|eleni: a tricky lead of small !g can keep them off slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East  not wanting to be excluded lol|pg||
nt|eleni: !g|pg||
nt|eleni: THX Todor dear for the explanations:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but east should have taken @DA earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: after the @c lead, is a claimer|pg||
nt|lady007: seems like NS are back on natural bidding now, after the overcall |pg||
nt|timve:  3NT by south?|pg||
nt|lady007: Wouldnt 3@d show 5/5 now?|pg||
nt|timve:  I think so|pg||
nt|lady007: not sure i want to play 3N with the south hand then|pg||
nt|timve:  but in diamonds you know the wrong hand will play|pg||

nt|chrisky: good bid by s|pg||

nt|eleni: it's simply indicative:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps 3NT has the same meaning in modern sytems|pg||
nt|lady007: he might bid 4C now, and if N doesnt support, bid 5@d later|pg||
nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, East hand strong after the 2 heart response|pg||
nt|ybob: on OR 2NT rebids showed 5/4 strong, 4@C was cue with @H fit from W and not clear to E |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||
nt|yusufb: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||
nt|liraren: if right guess in @d they make 4@s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  not on @d lead|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  or switch|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N it is|pg||
nt|juan lukas: maybe 4@c then 5@h would have been clearer in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: defense can get 3 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass by south, it gives opps too much room to bid|pg||

nt|pinticus: 2nt 21-23 bal|pg||
nt|liraren: but i cant see why Tofte should guess right in @d|pg||
nt|lady007: 9 tricks are no problem on a heart lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
pc|cA|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 4@C its clear to @H fit, W could bid 3@S with @S fit over 3@H ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|mamos: EW  have done their job   hopefully their teammates can do theirs|pg||

nt|ntmon: turkey reached the optimmal contract, well deserved IMPs|pg||
nt|lady007: it is actually bad news for gullberg that his partner had the jack of hearts, because it means they can set up the suit by playing it only once through declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this makes 4 @s seems good idea from ew -but  they were never inn bidding|pg||
nt|arigun: simdi @h pasi emniyetli|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vasmar: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|dkkello: This wont take long , though Niclas Ege is a very carefull player ( slow) :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: yes and he would have bid his @c suit after 2NT ( probably by transfert ) |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|possessed: a deserved 11 imp|pg||
nt|offthebend: S has done well not to bid his Club suit which may help declarer play the D's right |pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|cicus: hi Andy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|_fonzie__:  after trick 1, i can imagine many cases where it is interesting to switch to clubs and many cases where you should play your singleton @d|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  but it shouldn't be a guess|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  with singleton heart in dummy, north should be able to indicate whether he holds something in clubs (Q or K) or not by playing his smallest or largest card|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|nt|liraren: now south have been carding too honest |pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahri:  just one club for defenders |pg||

nt|mamos: ok in 5@d  not so in 6@d|pg||
nt|liraren: but east didnt trust him|pg||
nt|lady007: if declarer has KJx you probably have to give him a heart trick anyway and then you have to hope partner gets the lead before he has 9|pg||
nt|timve:  good board for the Dutch|pg||
nt|lady007: the queen also caters for Jx in dummy and is unlikely to cost a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: making games, of course|pg||
nt|bmkl: it seems the 3nt bid worked fine for Croatia|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gmarco24: Q was a nice card for the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table North didnt bid 3@d and now has to decide over 3N if he still wants to mention them|pg||
nt|lady007: think it was better to bid 3@d immediatly and get it off your chest, so you dont have to guess later|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: anybody bidding @H by W?|pg||

nt|ritong: ah|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  east probably just thought that if they could have defeated the contract, they would have|pg||
nt|liraren: rather good 6@s here but the @d Q|pg||
nt|timve:  definately better to show your 55|pg||
nt|timve:  immediately|pg||
nt|lady007: he now bid 4@d over 3N. looks a little inconsistent IMO|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|key1809: can make 4s ,here on a spade guess, but tough to reach|pg||

nt|ntmon: (i do)|pg||
nt|cicus: with a fit jump, strengthis not particularly important|pg||
nt|ritong: well he lacks the fifth @h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to play fitjumps AND splinters, hard to organise|pg||
nt|ritong: which can make a considerable difference|pg||
nt|cicus: important is at what level you are willing to play|pg||

nt|lady007: E trying to double NS out of slam :)|pg||
nt|lady007: not that they will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|lady007: i dont like that double so much|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: South will most likely TRF, and leave it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W make 3@S and N-S 3@h|pg||
nt|offthebend: North had to bring in the D suit for S to even think of slam anywhere -- with his poorish opening bid |pg||
nt|lady007: you mainly have a lot of spade tricks|pg||

mb|5C!|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
nt|lady007: and west seems to think they are in a forcing situation?|pg||
nt|lady007: or maybe he thinks he hasnt showed his hand yet :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
nt|timve:  1NT with this hand is pretty agressive|pg||
nt|timve:  would you have bid it Marion?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @c tricks needed in this so small to QJxx-to avoid later quess in that suit here|pg||
nt|frankbo: need to find 9 in cl to makes this i thk|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south choses the best 3 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
mb|6S|nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
nt|lady007: yes. i might have bid it as well, not wanting to miss a possible 4@h contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@d, @h to A@h, @d to K or...?|pg||
nt|runnerup: so handling as i sayed |pg||
nt|tez: 5@h diyecek..6 ya gelecekler|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: kestirmeden oldu|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but a tough contract..|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||

nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||

nt|arigun: bakalim 3@h yapabilecek mi .9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||

pc|d8|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||

nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||

pc|sA|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h9|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||

nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||

nt|offthebend: hand for 6C |pg||
nt|offthebend: hope they at least get to some game |pg||

nt|offthebend: 5C is much better than 3NT |pg||
mb|1S|nt|chrisky: a slam in @H or @C for ew|pg||

nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|liraren: what about light overcall , count the hcp in east :)|pg||
nt|lady007: no you will have to force to game then, but 3@h sounds more like a 5+card suit and less HCP|pg||
nt|lady007: partscore battle here|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h bilirse 3nt de|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pinticus: aggressive 1@h|pg||

nt|lady007: EW make 2@H (3 without the spade ruff) and NS can make 3D (4 without the club ruff)|pg||

nt|gmarco24: this guys are bidding like there's no tomorrow|pg||
nt|juan lukas: the 2@h opening helps EW to bid 5@d |pg||

nt|juan lukas: X for the @s lead |pg||
nt|dkkello: i was told from reliabel sources 2 @C is natural |pg||
pc|d3|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, the defence may cash  a couple of @Hs first|pg||
pc|d2|nt|key1809: still cant make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: raise to game is moot action even expecting partner a king stronger|pg||
nt|pinticus: yes,maybe W hoping for better @h suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: W could not be sure about the value of @SK at all |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so also 5@H here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: can see only S and W,the tray isnt here now|pg||
nt|cicus: where couple = 1 :) not allowing a club ruff|pg||

nt|gmarco24: ok, so "i am in trick, what now? what now?"  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: is there a chance declarer will misguess if he has the jack? i guess not|pg||

nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||

mb|p|nt|zlatan: Hi all from sunny Nicosia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eugenio123: 1nt I guess|pg||
nt|ntmon: OR is delay, we have lost immediate comparisons|pg||
nt|ritong: treating 5+@c and limit via stayman has a lot of charm|pg||
nt|ritong: @s*|pg||
nt|timve:  yeah I know its a lot|pg||
nt|lady007: NS have some thin chances in slam, but it wont make on this lay out|pg||

nt|yusufb: seviye olarak 6 oynarlar|pg||
nt|arigun: 6@h ? o da olur :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: like all juniors would|pg||
mb|2H|nt|key1809: yes, decent 5card suit, with 14, 1NT it is|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard on NS |pg||

nt|cicus: all of us would Stayman and invite, can't afford to lose a major suit game|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: welcome with us Konstantine:):)|pg||

nt|liraren: y 12-22|pg||
nt|juan lukas: agressive 2@h and 4@h |pg||
nt|ybob: they are juniors :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  2@H apparently Kokish|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  showing @H or big NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: agressive bidding all round|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||
nt|timve:  you can pitch a club on the fourth diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it seems hard to respect|pg||
nt|lady007: true|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d baþlamasý dogru|pg||
mb|3S|nt|key1809: 7 tricks, but East will face problems on pithces when north cashes clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was ose 30HP.|pg||
nt|chrisky: it has some problems on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||
nt|timve:  but I guess they wont bid 6|pg||
nt|yusufb: bence|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the point is you can use stayman as well with 5+@s, inviting values and any shape|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d baþlamasý gerekiyordu bence|pg||
mb|4D|nt|wilkinsona: south had extras so took one more|pg||
nt|ybob: agressive to bid not to punish !!|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is a bit too high|pg||
nt|tez: önce majör deðil..güç varsa önce uzun|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  6@H is much better|pg||
nt|arigun: secim slogani gibi oldu bu tezcan|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||
nt|cicus: little by little, Hungary is catching up|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||

mb|6C|nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
nt|arigun: dikkatli bir oyuna butun 6lar olabilir @c dahil|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu kadar boþa giden @c puanýyla 7 diyemez|pg||

nt|arigun: @c 8'li olsa garanti idi ama oyle deme :)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
mb|p|mb|7D|nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 2@d 3@c 3@d 4@d...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||

nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe pd was short in @S ...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||

nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||

nt|zlatan: not 5 :)|pg||
nt|eleni: right Konstantine|pg||
nt|eleni: 6 maybe due to K@h?|pg||

nt|eleni: there we go:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
nt|eleni: now Basilis can not fail the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT defeat 10 @S anyway, declarer can duck or win but short by 1|pg||
nt|dkkello: hmm , sorry I was to soon :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice multi opening:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
nt|yusufb: yaptýrcaklar inþallah yanýlýrým|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: and this may be the right contract whatever the OR result|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 off @d save this home even with @h lead-also @s 3-3 -and overtrick makeable now|pg||
nt|eleni: Now Pierre needs to attack @s and ruff twice, while he still has entry to his hand with @dA|pg||
nt|ni hao: a pretty bloody match-lots of imps:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cicus: with this lie, has to continue to have a chance to take a trump trick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|zlatan: thats why i said 5nt as a try|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|cicus: a spot-on remark from a kib: maybe W should have overtaken?|pg||
