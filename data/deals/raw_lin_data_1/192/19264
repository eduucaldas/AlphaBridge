nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||
nt|lady007: N will open 1@s, and will east overcall then? and if he doesnt, will south respond 1N?|pg||

nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||

nt|helena sp:  5@d|pg||
nt|vasmar: so phantom sacrifice|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N is quite a bid. can be a disaster if partner doesnt bring anything|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lady007: i think i would have passed with north but i wouldnt be happy about it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||

nt|possessed: and balanced|pg||

nt|lady007: maybe he could have tried to play another spade, in case partner has T9 of hearts|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, here comes one finesse|pg||
nt|lady007: oh no, wont help, he bid 3N so declarer will never play him for the stiff king|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|gmarco24: after A@d situation is pretty clear for declarer|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|Gerben42:  nice to have @H7|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I guess they play 2@c as drury|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: defence can lead trumps to defeat  easily in a  moment|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eleni: They found the correct contract |pg||
pc|hK|nt|tejjyid: That lead simplifies matters, but North had no reason to lead a @C - given that Suth didn;t open|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|eleni: well Chris:) we said helpful:) not Christmas yet for Santa to be here:)|pg||
nt|chrisky: last chance|pg||
nt|offthebend: with 9-10 points and a 4-card S suit , one has to bid more than 1Spade over a T/O double of 1D :)|pg||
nt|liraren: with the first pass u can bid 2 @d with that kind of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: site for results http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i agree with subhash, you don't bid 2@d with only 4@s and say 2@h; if LHO bids 3@D you have to guess, may miss a cold 4@s or bid a ridiculous final contract|pg||

nt|vasmar: 4@h for N-S here|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||

nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||

nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||
nt|lady007: if they dont get a ruff, 1 heart, 1 spade and a diamond loser?|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||

pc|cA|nt|Gerben42:  after -80 probably equal again|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||

nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||

pc|hK|pg||

nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||

nt|eleni: and first 13 IMPs for Croatia|pg||
nt|ahri:  first points for croatia|pg||
nt|mamos: ok in 5@d  not so in 6@d|pg||
nt|liraren: but east didnt trust him|pg||
nt|lady007: if declarer has KJx you probably have to give him a heart trick anyway and then you have to hope partner gets the lead before he has 9|pg||
nt|timve:  good board for the Dutch|pg||
nt|lady007: the queen also caters for Jx in dummy and is unlikely to cost a trick|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ntmon: making games, of course|pg||
nt|bmkl: it seems the 3nt bid worked fine for Croatia|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: Q was a nice card for the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table North didnt bid 3@d and now has to decide over 3N if he still wants to mention them|pg||
nt|lady007: think it was better to bid 3@d immediatly and get it off your chest, so you dont have to guess later|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ntmon: anybody bidding @H by W?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H would not be my choice|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  partner would expect ... well... less|pg||
nt|ritong: i wouold like to play fitjumps with north hand|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit thin, but slam can be on very easily|pg||
nt|cicus: me too, although I was told they did not exist|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: problem, then:)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  east probably just thought that if they could have defeated the contract, they would have|pg||
nt|liraren: rather good 6@s here but the @d Q|pg||
nt|timve:  definately better to show your 55|pg||
nt|timve:  immediately|pg||
nt|lady007: he now bid 4@d over 3N. looks a little inconsistent IMO|pg||
mb|4N|mb|d|nt|key1809: can make 4s ,here on a spade guess, but tough to reach|pg||
nt|ahri:  we saw how 3NT ends on the other table though.|pg||
nt|ntmon: (i do)|pg||
nt|cicus: with a fit jump, strengthis not particularly important|pg||
nt|ritong: well he lacks the fifth @h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to play fitjumps AND splinters, hard to organise|pg||
nt|ritong: which can make a considerable difference|pg||
nt|cicus: important is at what level you are willing to play|pg||
nt|timve:  I have to agree Marion|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 5@c is great, even 6@c makes|pg||
mb|5C|nt|eleni: Mr.Grosset maybe never heard of 8 ever, 9 never:):) (too young for it:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: 1@h over X shows a good suit|pg||
nt|lady007: E trying to double NS out of slam :)|pg||
nt|lady007: not that they will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|lady007: i dont like that double so much|pg||
mb|d|nt|key1809: South will most likely TRF, and leave it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W make 3@S and N-S 3@h|pg||
nt|offthebend: North had to bring in the D suit for S to even think of slam anywhere -- with his poorish opening bid |pg||
nt|lady007: you mainly have a lot of spade tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's harder to reach thatn to respect I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S to|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
nt|lady007: and west seems to think they are in a forcing situation?|pg||
nt|lady007: or maybe he thinks he hasnt showed his hand yet :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
nt|timve:  1NT with this hand is pretty agressive|pg||
nt|timve:  would you have bid it Marion?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
nt|lady007: yes. i might have bid it as well, not wanting to miss a possible 4@h contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@d, @h to A@h, @d to K or...?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C-1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vasmar: -50 instead -140|pg||
nt|gmarco24: make it simple|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: +130 available|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|cicus: so you can combine fitjumps with splinters by using cue as splinter and jump shifts as fit jumps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|liraren: more use of 4 @d that way than too use it as splinter in a competition bidding|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|vasmar: 4@C is a good bid since it can push E-W to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 4H should be bid and made -- 4S looks too expensive |pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: finally a game |pg||

nt|mamos: 4@S EW this time|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H=|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ?|pg||
nt|lady007: true juniors playing here, 6 boards and 3 doubled contracts so far|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chrisky: a @S contract for ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  is similar to the prev. hand by her (probably) sister|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h doesnt look like a very good contract|pg||
nt|offthebend: North does not really have any convenient bid over the T/O dbl -- so pass will be ok but stretched to a RDBL  |pg||
nt|liraren: when i bid TO with west hand my pd always bid 3@c |pg||
nt|lady007: this looks like 4@s by NS|pg||

nt|ritong: brutal, i d say|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, developing can sometimes be toxic|pg||
nt|cicus: the lead is favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult decision|pg||
nt|cicus: on a spade, we would go down quickly|pg||
nt|liraren: south must have  thougt that pass was forcing |pg||
mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: ahaha|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  sky being 12.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||
nt|offthebend: basically HQ on side is needed for 4H to make and 3-2 split -- failing which some minor suit squeeze may develop against W who has made a T/O double |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: right, but a @c has to be given early to opps|pg||
nt|pinticus: seem 2@s=|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vasmar: 4@H is a better contract but no way to reach it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eugenio123: probably 2@d is a relay|pg||
nt|ahri:  12 tricks outside clubs (doubledummy)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|key1809: 2D=looked like a TRF,and accepting the TRF meant as 4, i guess, as we play the same:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||
nt|key1809: ok, might be 2D as FG relay as a spec suggested|pg||
nt|eugenio123: north doesn't have an easy lead, he doesn't know it would change nothing|pg||

nt|lady007: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|key1809: 6h, a decent contract, needing 3-2 hearts, but not here with a bad break|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that LHO is a passed hand is a factor imo|pg||
nt|ritong: he is less likely to balance|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|gmarco24: i know, we beat in you in basketball, and (i really don't know how) tomorrow in bridge  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: heheheh|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
nt|lady007: this dutch team might be difficult to beat in basketball as well, they are all very tall|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||
nt|liraren: north is too passive I would have overcalled 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||

nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||

nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
pc|h4|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||

nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|eleni: Basilis has to split honors in @d anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cicus: in effect, Gazzilli tries to translate the standard opening into a strong club|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|h7|nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like it a lot|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|key1809: didnt unblock the dmds, hence 2 down|pg||
nt|eugenio123: :(|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  by the way, this hands perfectly demonstrates why you shouldn't have bid|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ntmon: then 3NT is right|pg||
nt|liraren: not if east bid pass on 2@d or bid 2@s instead of 2@h|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lady007: hmmmm....... i would have passed 3H with north|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahri:  6 tricks, just like other table|pg||
nt|timve:  me too|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe south should bid something else than 3@h? maybe 2@s or 2N?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good point|pg||

nt|tejjyid: There's a few problems with strong @C Gabor; Gazili sems like a nice compromise|pg||
nt|eleni: the @d9 was the key card:(|pg||
nt|vasmar: freak hand by North|pg||
nt|offthebend: hand for 6C |pg||
nt|offthebend: hope they at least get to some game |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  9 tables already played this hand, nobody (understandably) in 6@c|pg||
nt|liraren: i can´t imagine any bidding too 6@c so hope for game|pg||
nt|lady007: over 2@s, north will surely bid 2N and he might raise to 3 then|pg||
nt|timve:  well you can bid 2@S, but will you pass 2NT by partner? knowing you probably have a heartfit|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahri:  quite distributive set this is|pg||
nt|pinticus: only 1 round today for juniors|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, certainly the best option for standard players|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C is much better than 3NT |pg||
mb|1N|nt|chrisky: a slam in @H or @C for ew|pg||
nt|vasmar: 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: very unlucky 4@h|pg||
nt|tez: 4@s normal|pg||
nt|eleni: eaasy 6@hs|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1 @H looks sharp to me|pg||
nt|eleni: lucky break of @hs|pg||
nt|timve:  and is it invitational in your system?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tez: sonunda tabiki|pg||
nt|mamos: i think they will play 4@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahri:  east must feel alone being balanced here :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's also becoming the standard option for the best players|pg||
nt|cicus: nice shift  of word order :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|liraren: what about light overcall , count the hcp in east :)|pg||
nt|lady007: no you will have to force to game then, but 3@h sounds more like a 5+card suit and less HCP|pg||
nt|lady007: partscore battle here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pinticus: aggressive 1@h|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D even more|pg||
nt|cicus: unfriendly lie of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|lady007: EW make 2@H (3 without the spade ruff) and NS can make 3D (4 without the club ruff)|pg||
nt|timve:  but the spadelead seems normal, the clublead doesnt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|key1809: bit can make, if spade is not led|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did u know that Franch have there national day today?|pg||
nt|mamos: wrong again  forgot to allow for NS lol|pg||
nt|eleni: nah Mike! Michaels coid in @d asks for a slam|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s bid made the bidding even easier|pg||
nt|eleni: void I meant:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@H much, much more :)|pg||
nt|pinticus: X by E shows strong hand,3@d shows limit 5@h4@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  two keycards missing here|pg||
nt|vasmar: double is dangerous|pg||
nt|offthebend: but does he gain anything out of it ?:)|pg||
nt|liraren: south X is transfer to @s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  tough call for north now, it's probably not clear that 3@c would be forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eleni: (sorry everyone for my typing:) I never qualified as a secretary:):))|pg||
nt|mamos: well done fellow commentators and Greek EW  (though I think French NS helped a bit :))|pg||

nt|eleni: now Lorenzinoi has to count his down tricks:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ponaglaj¹ mnie do komentarza...co tu gadaæ - wszystko jasne|pg||

nt|tez: tam olacak 3@s ..@h dam ataðýýndan sonra|pg||
nt|ahri:  diamonds behaving, heart ten dropping early|pg||
nt|eleni: a save to 7@d would win, as E-W have no 7@hs with a @s lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: 5@h4@d*|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czego siê czepiacie jednej lewki...to tak jak ze stowy wydawaæ grosza reszty|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  good call, he knows @c king onside and just hopes for an entry in dummy|pg||
nt|offthebend: but he may need two entries if Kxx of Club is with W and S has to have at least 2 cards in Clubs |pg||
nt|gmarco24: this guys are bidding like there's no tomorrow|pg||
mb|5D|nt|eleni: Basil's hand can never pass:) sbl or no dbl:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: down 2 i d guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Quite a hard one. Let's see|pg||
nt|tez: @h kesiyorum diye 3nt demek þaþýrtýcý..9 kozu biliyor|pg||
nt|mamos: Im not sure N should be even thinking of bidding after South thought for so long|pg||
nt|offthebend: sigh of relief -- he didn't get a Heart lead |pg||
nt|lady007: worst thing that can happen in junior bridge is when you miss game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  well... this makes.|pg||
nt|ntmon: E could have passed with his collection|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, the defence may cash  a couple of @Hs first|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: still cant make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ntmon: raise to game is moot action even expecting partner a king stronger|pg||
nt|pinticus: yes,maybe W hoping for better @h suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: W could not be sure about the value of @SK at all |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so also 5@H here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: can see only S and W,the tray isnt here now|pg||
nt|cicus: where couple = 1 :) not allowing a club ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet still that @s bid deprived N-S from finding their slam|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eleni: well, up to tournament director that:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: Director is here|pg||
nt|lady007: interesting board for the defense|pg||

pc|d3|nt|eleni: did TD accept the delay?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eugenio123: he needs a gift|pg||
nt|cicus: I am asked if 2@S was a 2-suiter, any ideas?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would think in that case an alert would appear|pg||
nt|ritong: ( a small foot tap for our operator  please indicate alerts):)|pg||
nt|cicus: confirmed, it was only spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like leaping Michaels when major is unknown|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: no problem, it cannot hurt to know your bias|pg||
nt|lady007: and also for declarer|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|gmarco24: mmmmm, great|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vasmar: commentating|pg||
nt|lady007: east knows declarer wont have any more hearts (partner wont jump to 4@h on a doubleton) so only chance now is to lead a club. but which one?|pg||
nt|timve:  @CQ seems pretty obvious|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, so "i am in trick, what now? what now?"  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: is there a chance declarer will misguess if he has the jack? i guess not|pg||
nt|timve:  but indeed maybe you have to trick declarar|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gmarco24: or partner  :)|pg||
nt|timve:  he knows declarer has K J AK, probably he has @CJ|pg||
nt|lady007: declarer will think long enough to make it clear that west has to play the jack :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good point|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||

nt|ritong: naturally the @h xxxx is not a huge bonus|pg||

nt|cicus: 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  well would you have bid 5@D with south?|pg||
nt|timve:  or would you have doublet|pg||
nt|timve:  doubled|pg||
nt|timve:  with A and K in the other suits|pg||
nt|lady007: i've seen Van Lankveld overcall on much weaker hands than this one, maybe the vulnerability scared him|pg||

nt|lady007: yes i think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: i am told that 5 @h in open room was 3 down|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h looks makeable (2 hearts and a club loser)|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ntmon: turkish teams plays fien, steady game so far|pg||
nt|ntmon: fine*|pg||
nt|pinticus: yes,very regular pairs|pg||

pc|h2|nt|key1809: E-W can make 5D, as i see it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt makes|pg||
nt|mamos: 6NT maybe even|pg||
nt|ritong: impatient to know what it is  a @c ask?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a @D transfer?|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eugenio123: even if I don't agree with the jump 4@h, I would've bid just 2 @h|pg||
nt|mamos: oops wb|pg||
nt|cicus: I am told 3@D and 3@S are switched|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, it seemed 4H, was a stretch, but thats youth for u:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri:  first one of the match :(|pg||

pc|d5|nt|cicus: 3@D=spades, 3@S=diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks for specs clarifying that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|_fonzie__:  now this is definitely too high|pg||
nt|offthebend: I think East has decided that partner will have perfect cards :)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  quite surprised that they went overboard at both tables|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helgemo use to say to his pard: U did not have any 4 card color?|pg||
nt|drkvas: dbl dummy 4@h can be beaten|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry|pg||
nt|liraren: i have learned the hard way that pd NEVER have the perfect cards :) so nowdays i dont hope for it |pg||
nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||
nt|liraren: y i mean Kx onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: You can try and PIN 109 of clubs offside and K75 onside |pg||
pc|dK|nt|eugenio123: I'm a junior too, I'm there just due of health :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I'm not there just due of health|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  wont happen here|pg||
nt|cicus: pretty good contract, only that @D lie will hurt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think 5@D goes down "zero dummy"|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: he will make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @D seems normal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: But I don't know how to stop in 4@H, except by passing it|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  so new leader|pg||
nt|ritong: an other borderline decision|pg||
nt|ritong: facing 1 NT|pg||
nt|liraren: no 5 @h was 3 down in open room|pg||
nt|timve:  25 points|pg||
nt|lady007: you counted that pretty fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|zlatan: Hi all from sunny Nicosia|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 1nt I guess|pg||
nt|ntmon: OR is delay, we have lost immediate comparisons|pg||
nt|ritong: treating 5+@c and limit via stayman has a lot of charm|pg||
nt|ritong: @s*|pg||
nt|timve:  yeah I know its a lot|pg||
nt|lady007: NS have some thin chances in slam, but it wont make on this lay out|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|eugenio123: like all juniors would|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: yes, decent 5card suit, with 14, 1NT it is|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard on NS |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks normal here|pg||
nt|cicus: all of us would Stayman and invite, can't afford to lose a major suit game|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|eleni: welcome with us Konstantine:):)|pg||
nt|timve:  well if they lead a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *one|pg||
nt|offthebend: so 3 more imps to Denmark - in that case  |pg||
nt|liraren: y 12-22|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Gerben42:  2@H apparently Kokish|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  showing @H or big NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||
nt|timve:  you can pitch a club on the fourth diamond|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|eugenio123: it seems hard to respect|pg||
nt|lady007: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 7 tricks, but East will face problems on pithces when north cashes clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was ose 30HP.|pg||
nt|chrisky: it has some problems on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||
nt|timve:  but I guess they wont bid 6|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the point is you can use stayman as well with 5+@s, inviting values and any shape|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|Gerben42:  6@H is much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||
nt|cicus: little by little, Hungary is catching up|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lady007: you never know.... if there is no tomorrow ;-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahri:  hoping for partner's king to be black|pg||
nt|offthebend: undo |pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42:  5@H no, 6@H bugger|pg||
nt|offthebend: that H discard can be costly :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahri:  as he cannot have much more|pg||
nt|eleni: Konstantine is serving his military service in Cyprus:):) This is why he is not playing in this European Championship:)|pg||
nt|lady007: might make now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mamos: oh yes   you are right|pg||
pc|sA|nt|key1809: North shd have hopped up, with the Ace and cleared clubs, |pg||

mb|1N|nt|Gerben42:  after being demolished by the two huge favorites, Eggeling - Brinck have a strong performance here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|mamos: East's Diamond exit was deadly accurate here|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: hey boy! wait a few more years till you get middle aged:) Then years run fast:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|zlatan: i played 3 times in this kind of championships, and as they say: "once a junior, always a junior"|pg||
nt|liraren: NS outbid again, |pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H making for NS  and not in the bidding at all |pg||
nt|liraren: but i am not sure i open with 1@h either in second seat vuln.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: but south should've bid 3nt, not north|pg||
nt|key1809: North shd accept, he's a passed hand, and has Max for his pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Celik have told his hand well.|pg||
nt|ahri:  east showing concern about clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: H lead wd have given declarer some thought, now it will be a claimer |pg||

nt|offthebend: NOW N shd be brave enough to bid game in H |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahri:  wow|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  double game swing looming|pg||
pc|h4|nt|key1809: 2nt, starts of Leb,weak hands i presume|pg||
nt|eleni: interesting bid|pg||
nt|pinticus: X over 2nt could be penalty for one suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 6@C has the merit - it makes|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  11 from the top in @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  trump lead required to beat the 12th even|pg||

nt|ritong: :)|pg||

nt|mamos: still a long way to go in this match|pg||

pc|s5|nt|chrisky: time to get some imps |pg||

pc|s4|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|cicus: pretty idea|pg||
nt|ritong: what about purple:)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahri:  4@h would most probably propell them to 4@s. |pg||
nt|ntmon: yes!|pg||
nt|lady007: the 1@H overcall doesnt really make much sense i think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|offthebend: I suppose N didn't expect D Ace to be in the dummy - would rather have some other helpful card/s |pg||
pc|h8|nt|tejjyid: purple for ACTION|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||

nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cicus: with this lie, has to continue to have a chance to take a trump trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|zlatan: thats why i said 5nt as a try|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cicus: a spot-on remark from a kib: maybe W should have overtaken?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  if it's showing @s +@c in swedish style (thanks ukdorj) then it makes more sense to me|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|rodal f: 1@S told 3 @S+. Hhy W biided 1NT I don't know.|pg||

nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|ritong: too acid for my stomach|pg||
nt|lady007: its a nice contract but both club honours offside, as well as the queen of spades, might creat some difficulties|pg||
pc|c2|nt|key1809: in the open room, they bid 7s, and declarer finessed the 10!!!|pg||
nt|eugenio123: nooooooooo|pg||
nt|ahri:  operator: did north upgrade or is it 14-16 NT?|pg||

nt|ntmon: 3@S if forcing is unusual treatment|pg||

nt|timve:  more then some problems|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chrisky: good pass for s|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C for a balanced raise is a good choice, the bid is idle anyway|pg||

nt|ritong: philo issue|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|timve:  maybe south can read the points|pg||
nt|timve:  KQ of hearts, KQ of clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahri:  playing heart and another can sound good but it will help declarer with drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: whatever their methods are, they did not prove efficient|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: cards lie badly for NS|pg||
nt|eleni: As announced: Israel and Poland are now tied in 1st place with 101 VP, 2 ahead of Italy and 9 ahead of France|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think the only contract that makes|pg||
nt|chrisky: only j@H beat -1|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C used to be good 6-4 but those types can be handled other in ways|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: I've also seen 3 OM, but that's giving up another useful bid|pg||

nt|ritong: hi|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Well, trasnfers open's up a whole new range of possibilities|pg||
nt|eleni: a flat board that should be|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They have one good board each from here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is good for Denmark, 20 will be good for Sweden|pg||
nt|lady007: this hand looks more interesting|pg||
nt|timve:  wild board again|pg||
nt|lady007: 5@c by EW looks like it has some chances, and 3N as well maybe|pg||
nt|timve:  they both seem to make with all the finesses on|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahri:  (although he was belgian)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and Hi|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes it does... almost too many options|pg||
nt|cicus: hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|eugenio123: nice auction right now|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a 4 imp gain for Greece|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly a good tool  needs a decade to get operational, perhaps|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's extraordinary what a huge impact such a small change has with transfer responses|pg||
nt|lady007: but difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|lady007: might end in 2@s here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: and somewhat surprising it took so long to happen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Second time this set E-W in the open room bid a slam off two cashing tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 13 was the other one|pg||
nt|lady007: will east rebid 2@c or 2@d? and do they play some type of gazilli here?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Are we to see a easy major or an NT end EW?|pg||
nt|baardolav: It open one extra bidding round |pg||
nt|lady007: and now what. he might well pass|pg||
nt|lady007: it might depend on the meaning of a direct 2@s response over 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: bad now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Que with @H normaly|pg||
nt|ahri:  2@d is "weak weak two in major"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  2@h and 2@s are constructive ones, so west knows how to compite (and not to lead heart :D)|pg||
nt|ahri:  *compete|pg||
nt|lady007: I think 2@d is alerted because it shows less than 16|pg||
nt|lady007: but thats just a guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|key1809: East shd jump to 3nt , showing  a max, 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|ntmon: this will end up with @H game, although NS have 4@S sacrifice available |pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the margin will be around 20 IMPs for Denmark when the smoke has cleared|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eugenio123: should be 15 16 points |pg||
nt|rodal f: E is finned|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Win 10, flat, lose 10 most likely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: there was a french "scientist" named gesthem who advocated this long ago  only got sneering in his own time|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lady007: IF a 2@s response to 1@h was weak, and IF 2@h showed less than 16, east might have tried 3@c here as west should either have a stronger hand than a weak 2@s jump, or only a 5crd ...|pg||
nt|lady007: suit and maybe a club fit|pg||
nt|lady007: but now lets see what happens to 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks like declarer will lose 2 clubs and 3 spades|pg||

nt|timve:  wrong number of spades|pg||
nt|timve:  west has a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|lady007: yes but west has an aceless hand|pg||
nt|lady007: cant really bid 5@h with that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: que by @S|pg||
nt|ahri:  this would be interesting in 3NT, to see how E would tackle minors|pg||
nt|ritong: well done|pg||
nt|cicus: please forgive my laziness not having  searched for their conventioncard|pg||
nt|eleni: Kacper is informing me now that Miss Sakowska in S at the open table is a girl:):) we wish her all the luck:)|pg||
nt|lady007: but we've seen them bid very agressive before|pg||
nt|lady007: no, not this time|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eugenio123: this round has been a slaughter of imp|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pinticus: oh,he discarted the wrong card,so 1iMPs for turkey|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahri:  french kib (thanks) claims it's 4+@h 4+@s|pg||
nt|ahri:  4 minors to cash and then it's time to let mr. Coudert guess spades|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@H -1 6@D =|pg||
nt|eleni: E-W as they are behind they are playing a catenaccio:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|key1809: he had 8 tricks in the bag, trying for overtrciks, and rightly paying the price|pg||
nt|rodal f: Switch a @C    @S NS and EW have a nice major|pg||
nt|ntmon: this is really strange development|pg||
pc|cA|nt|zlatan: if he didnt have the lead dbl would be nice|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|mamos: what was 3@c some gadget shame if you cant bid suit like AKQJx|pg||
nt|eleni: and how can they find those Cris, as none bid them?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ntmon: EW with combined 15 HCP X their opps in a partscore for penalty|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: *slam|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: not bid in OR either|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|s2|nt|ahri:  playing @cK from doubleton didn't prove great for croats in their first match. here it was correct.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|key1809: not a bad idea to go for overtricks, but ur contract shd never b in danger all the way|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Out for a push.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|timve:  think vulnerable you should only bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|timve:  when your pretty sure you make it vs an non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|timve:  bidding for 1 off |pg||
nt|timve:  isnt good imo|pg||
nt|lady007: well, they might not double you and then its a good save if they make|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahri:  guessing time|pg||
nt|eleni: boy with all those conventions!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s4|nt|ahri:  although i doubt he'll miss.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|sA|nt|chrisky: it was a asking bit for @C|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, you should be very carefull bidding 5@h at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|eleni: simple bridge=best bridge:)|pg||
nt|mamos: no great damage done here as 5@h-1 from OR but boy oh boy these Greek boys have had so  many chances here |pg||

nt|eugenio123: thx all |pg||
nt|key1809: thx eugenio, |pg||
nt|ahri:  and some more 6carders |pg||
nt|ntmon: difficult to comment this one|pg||
nt|pinticus: really hard|pg||
nt|ntmon: let's go to final board, hope for more normal development|pg||
nt|ritong: last bullet now|pg||
nt|zlatan: anyway dbl is no almost no cost if in in other room partners dont bid slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And now the good board for Sweden. Rimstedt did well when she passed 1@H. It propelled N-S to 4@S, and 5@D can't quite make. And even better, the Swedes collected 500 when declarer ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: misguessed trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of an exciting match|pg||
nt|lady007: south might double, but north wont and might even bid 5@s|pg||
nt|timve:  yep on this board its very good to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|lady007: even if its a wrong bid in theory, it might work out very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|cicus: a tough 4@H - I think going downona @S lead|pg||
nt|ritong: this rather offtrack opening might get them out of game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many thanks to Todor, our excellent operator in Albena. Good job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: thx|pg||
nt|timve:  and preferably fast and convincing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|eleni: Last board for this round:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: we are back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden may even gain 12 IMPs here, but it won't change the result, 19-11|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|eugenio123: I'll be back at 16:20 cet to comment italian girl... who knows what my eyes will see lol|pg||
nt|key1809: :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: the lower you stop in @S the better|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N for east here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: next room could not avoid the 6@d snag|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate that 1NT|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mamos: so well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it seems they play forcing nt, another terrible convention I would never play|pg||
nt|ahri:  would be fun to see club lead with diamond underlead on 4@s. just for sake of entering bulletin.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahri:  sweating time for east|pg||
nt|ahri:  and a great lead for south|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think he is in control|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c showing any 16+ or 14-16 with 6@s|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@D showing 8+ and GF opposite 16+|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|key1809: i like to play it as SFG|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back in 1½ hours with 4 more matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: Q@c?|pg||
nt|pinticus: so,last board of this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks all for a nice segment. TKs specialy to the exelent vug. opperator. Tks aso to the specs for there nice input's. See u later.|pg||
nt|lady007: east not bothering to show his minor|pg||
nt|timve:  seems like an easy contract with both red kings onside|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lady007: vd Bos might lead a club, which wont exactly be the killing lead, setting up 2 clubs for declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|timve:  the 6 and 7 of clubs should be reversed|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||
nt|timve:  would make the lead a lot better|pg||
nt|lady007: true. nice try by van Lankveld to play the 9|pg||
nt|timve:  the second round south can take the king|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
nt|lady007: then they can set up the suit next if partner would have A7x left|pg||
pc|d2|nt|key1809: west has to cash dmds, and play clubs for mini-tel no|pg||
pc|d9|nt|key1809: north knows, he's is sunk, as both suits are open, does he sttle for 6 tricks by finessing hearts, and cashing SA|pg||
nt|timve:  and finesse Q6 in west with A7 in north|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|cicus: and no rebid problem either|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzjn: bye|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahri:  a prophet, i say.|pg||
nt|baardolav: I do not agree with that:) 1@d 1nt... is a problem... you need to pass, there is no rebid problems in nt either|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: merci a tous, was great fun for this sunday morning|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ntmon: 3NT is normal but destined to fail|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chrisky: claim|pg||

nt|mamos: bad news for Greece from OR |pg||
nt|mamos: as 3@sx=|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2off|pg||
nt|lady007: he knows partner will only have 4 (4th best leads) so the 9 is only wrong if partner led from AQ8x|pg||
nt|timve:  yep |pg||
nt|timve:  think if north plays a heart |pg||
nt|timve:  west will cash his trikcs|pg||
nt|timve:  for 9|pg||
nt|lady007: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ntmon: we have seen solid performance by both teams|pg||
nt|ntmon: but let's move to OR for final boards|pg||
nt|pinticus: thx all|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: 1@D-1NT is an  easy pass for me|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mamos: the match has seemed quite close but too many silly mistakes from Greek team |pg||
nt|chrisky: specialy in the other room|pg||
nt|eleni: The kids are stressed, from all sides we suppose|pg||
nt|baardolav: with 16 too?|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT then|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|mamos: how old are this pair?|pg||
