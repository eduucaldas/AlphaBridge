mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: hi Henry|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 5@d is on, easy 3NT as well|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hedy, Georgi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: hi Henry :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: surely they have agreements as to showing whether there is fit or not, depending on responders reply to the transfer|pg||
nt|hedyg: so probably here 3@s= no fit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  after the transfer they should get a heart lead, and then diamonds provide the entries for two club finesses|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|henryb:  I don't, Hedy, because I want partner to be able to pass 3@s with, say, five or six small spades and out|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Henry, that is why 3@s is no fit and we play in 5-2 opposite a really weak hand. if there is no fit pd cannot bid 3NT either|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  but even if opener has a 20 count and a fit 3@s is likely to be the limit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s5|pc|d6|nt|hedyg: we can try for game with fit though, not ever without|pg||
nt|hedyg: so the less there is fit, the lower we stay|pg||
nt|henryb:  you are more optimistic than I am. probably from relative (bridge) youth|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
mc|10|nt|hedyg: actually no, it is a decision i took after discussing it for hours with Pietro Bernasconi for hours and we came to the conclusion that it was important to show whether there is fit ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: or not and that without fit the hand was worth less, thus 3M, with 3card fit we bid 3NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: especially 2nd level opening|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: i think 6-5 hands are very powerful|pg||

nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||

nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
pc|hT|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||

nt|timve:  think the Dutch played better. Especially since 13 imps of the Italians came from a lucky slem|pg||
