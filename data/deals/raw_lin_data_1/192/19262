nt|ryskiel_: celne otwarcie Overbeeke|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||

nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: first blood for Netherland|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h5|pc|c3|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||

nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
pc|hK|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||

nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||

nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||

nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
