nt|oosb: to settle your nerves|pg||
nt|eleni: only she had no communication|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Dag:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to follow more than this board: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ntmon: i think the route declarer choose is the right one|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an| |mb|p|mb|3C|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
mb|3N|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||
nt|loe48: jepp|pg||
nt|oosb: Could have*|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|frankbo: når den ordner seg blir det 12|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ER  missing|pg||
pc|d8|nt|loe48: auto 12|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be doubt in north's mind now about west hold 10x|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dagold: and easts is robertson|pg||
nt|ntmon: declar can to ruff two @H in hand an make the contract|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
mc|8|nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S makeable on a good trump guess|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
mb|4H|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||

nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||

nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||

nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||
nt|josj: even|pg||

nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||

nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||

nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
mb|4C|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||

pc|d7|pg||

nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||

nt|loe48: som ville vaert et noekkelkort her|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west has opened only 1 club, perhaps because of his spade holding...|pg||
nt|josj: but I agree in a way: 2nt makes no sense here...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2nt relay|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|asig: Well, QED|pg||
nt|runnerup: should make also inspite off 4-1 distibution -10 nicely sing -but carefull you must be|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ntmon: same start as in OR|pg||
