nt|vugraphzjt: and the suit breaks 5-0 |pg||
nt|doks: 1@C opening most likely 2+, very popular in Netherlands|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: so it was 8-5-0-0 distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: very rare|pg||
nt|doks: Latvian pair play some version of 1@C=16+|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjt: very nice bid now 5@H always makes by E |pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: while from W could go down with @S attack|pg||

nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||

nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||

nt|rnmalik: N showed minimum and S hand is not that strong for the raise.|pg||

nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we all know where it is:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: 9@H a value card.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
nt|galois85: 9 tricks now for n/s, 6@d 2@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||

nt|yuval10: as oppose to the Juniors where they play one set of 20 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: per match|pg||
nt|loe48: a 2 heart opener would have caused problems|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hey Grozio :)|pg||

mb|1C|nt|yuval10: that's of course a force because only 10 teams are playing in the girls'|pg||

mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  pass on S was conservative|pg||
nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess 2@S is @S+x and 3@D inviting to @S|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: right guess of @D and they can make 7.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
mb|2D|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: dosyc szczesliwa koncowka na trafieniu pika, co pewnie wyjasni sie w 1 lewie|pg||
nt|mareczek: hm... trzeba trafic do grona komentatorów, BBO ma taka grupê|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3@C was more descriptive.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has powerhouse and EW hands match nicely with no wasted value.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
mb|6D|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Or W forgot|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So def camn take all tricks :)|pg||

nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But 7 down is a good score for EW|pg||

pc|dK|nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
nt|athene: but fortunately for declarer east can't get in again to cash that @S10|pg||

nt|yuval10: now 4NT is asking for aces excluding the @d suit, so N knows to show only 1 ace|pg||

nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
