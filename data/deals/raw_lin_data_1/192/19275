nt|vugraphzjm: hello everybody from Albena - host of the 23rd Euro Youth Championship|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: Hi Momchil|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Interesting hand to get us going|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: hi, Roland and Venky :)|pg||
nt|rv: Jespen is surely fancying to bid till atleast 5@h level though he started with 1@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: hio all|pg||
nt|rv: I believe N-S were members of world championships winning Israeli junior team|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Israel seem to be in a league of their own|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have won everything worth winning over the past year|pg||
nt|pelu: now a solid 9 card suit - yesterday a solid 8 card suit in @s - the card-program running wild?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: World Championshup, White House International|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and by some distance|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure they have been coached very well in addition to being excellent players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: commentators' curse:)|pg||
nt|rv: 2n is ostentisbly good raise in @ds|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|key1809: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: if N-S were vul and if he was on lead, Jespen might have considered a pass:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bilde-Jepsen U26 World Champions Beijing U26|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Keyzad|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Walddk2: Bilde is also reigning individual world champion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So this rates to be good bridge|pg||
nt|rv: Roland, this is battle of heavyweights then?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, apart from the fact that they are all very slim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but some of them a groggy from start :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: West's 3@d should be single suiter @hs, he would have bid 3@s with 5+@H+4@s GF hand|pg||
nt|key1809: 6@D was adecent save, but this vulnerbility, its tough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|pelu: why save when u can take the first 3 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure Bilde and Jepsen were on same wavelength, if 3@d was single suiter @hs then 4@s by Bilde should be cue|pg||
nt|key1809: @S lead beats it though|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: actually it is not probable|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  why not 2@C then bid 2@S|pg||
nt|smirny: well for me x and 3c is stronger that this hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  when he has trumphs left in dummy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rensph: 2@S relay|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so a nice start for Croatia |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  promise support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|smirny: yes i would bid 2C instead of DBL|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and 3@H instead of 2@D?|pg||
nt|smirny: and west thinks that his hand is too strong for 3H over DBL|pg||
nt|smirny: intresting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H maybe shows @Sxx @Hxxxx @Dxxxx @Cxxx|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d has some play ,but can you bid it?|pg||
nt|rensph: yes, somewhat surprised he underestimated the danger of drawing all trumps there|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rensph: no, not promising anything yet, just asking|pg||
nt|rensph: 3@H 5-5 without extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as an ok start for NS. X and 500?|pg||
nt|loe48: Hei|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Dag and welcome|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Dag|pg||
nt|loe48: Thank you Frank..forgot about time here and joined a tm :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: Even if the @s finesse wins declarer still isnt out of the woods. Needs to take care of the 3rd @c . So he has to choose between trying to ruff it and losing to 4-1 trumps or just ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: drawing all the trumps and hoping that the defense cant hold off the @d ace or that the @c Q is an entry|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2S!|nt|pelu: in CR S bid 2NT (over 2@D - multi)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: on 1@c-(1@d), 1M shows 4+cards, on 1@c-(1@h), 1@s is usually played as 5 cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would anyone double with the South cards?|pg||
nt|rv: I would double|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|key1809: immediate 3@D was weak overcall, maybe south reads that as an extra bid, hence moving forward|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: something not quite right with auction?|pg||

nt|rv: all cards lying right for declarer except for 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect he should score this inspite of bad trump break|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, the most important of all, @C is rightly placed, even the 4-1 break will not defeat this|pg||

nt|andy_h: Hi there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Jacka Ciechomskiego...po po³udniu polowanie na komentatorów jest bardziej wydajne:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West's signal is suit preference with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can stand either shift so he gave a middle card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As SouthÂ´s faher points out: 4 @D would have been a better bid - West might pick 4 @H then|pg||
pc|cT|nt|blum1956: 3@d was hardly FG |pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42:  Zimmermann will be surprised dummy has everything|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Andy|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  guess so|pg||
nt|smirny: is it better to lead 2nd/4th in trumps|pg||
nt|smirny: ?|pg||
nt|smirny: i think it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West would dbl takeout over 4@d|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Gerben42:  maybe better is small?|pg||
nt|loe48: agreed, the values of the hand is lowered now by club bid, so an understandable pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would East bid then - facing a passed partner?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Notice fisher won the @c king to induce partner to return a @H |pg||
nt|poohbear: and possibly fool declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass the TO dbl of 4@d since I have my points in @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would most of us|pg||

nt|poohbear: Declarer trying to decide if he can afford to play King here|pg||

pc|c4|nt|andy_h: The standard lead for a trump (opening) lead is usually small because you never know if any of your big trumps can be promoted (you never know!). But otherwise if they are actually ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: useless or of equals then you can use them as suit-preference signals|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad board for my poor DK anyway - they didÂ´nt make 4 @S in OR...?|pg||
nt|poohbear: interesting that Schwartz plays a @c now. Cant be right unless partner falsecarded|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rv: in my view 3n should have be strain to play and not any conventional meaning like non serious etc in last sequence|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Big swing coming to Israel on board 3. The Danes took the save in 5@D going 3 down it appears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 12 IMPs most likely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|key1809: this will go for some number|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if you open 1NT with that hand these things can happen|pg||
nt|key1809: -2 i presume|pg||
nt|rv: could Jepsen have bid 2@s to suggest 3@s and long @cs on double by South?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the club suit died 50 years ago, so no need to mention them|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: or -3|pg||
nt|pelu: a very nervous start for the danes - E know that N has made at penalty pass - why pass??|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: I don't mind off-beat 1NT openings, but this is taking it too far with no stopper in *three* suits|pg||
nt|key1809: declarer can get 2 @D+1@S+2@C+@H possibly|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: East could have redoubled as well as SOS to show 44 majors, but he is guessing and maybe felt North is passing with nothing better to do|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Call me old-fashioned, but 1@C and 2@C rebid would work for me|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT ok - 2@C OK - pass to 2@D ok but not pass after the D|pg||
nt|rv: having opened 1n with West hand, would anyone have bid 2@s to show 3 card @s and long @cs once Padon doubled 2@d|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Planning to pass any response|pg||
nt|key1809: oh he had stiff @C|pg||
nt|key1809: thats reasonable|pg||

pc|c2|nt|basu_4139: puppet stayma|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: wlc Pekka|pg||
nt|andy_h: That's certainly a common run-out structure to 1NT-X in which pass is forcing partner to redouble - not  one of my favourite conventions because you can't play in 1NTX|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||

nt|rv: Birman has min though 4 trumps and won't super-accept|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 3@H would show exactly that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Minimum with 4|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|key1809: but he has got good controls and good trumps|pg||
nt|key1809: and therefore super accepts|pg||
nt|pelu: and 4@H close to make - @CJ decide|pg||
mb|4H|nt|key1809: west might save|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s good save?|pg||
nt|pelu: now 4@s?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzjm: -100 agains possibly 620|pg||
nt|key1809: take the insurance, |pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 4@H in the other room, so @CJ is the issue there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: best defense: 2xH and then @C - no entry to the W-hand to play @S or @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark need that swing|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense can they take 2 down, no quick entry to hand to finesse @s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: @CA and another in the closed room, so 4@H should make|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: if defense cashes 2 rounds of @h and shifts to @c, declarer is odds on to go 2 down|pg||
nt|key1809: defenders cash thier @h's and exit @C will ensure -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: yes, down 2 if they defend well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 8 or 11 IMPs depending on defence|pg||
nt|rv: easier for Padon for shift if he wins second @h with @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: and S should raise when deckarer plays small @d from dummy|pg||
nt|key1809: north will be better of playing a small @H,and let south decide the shift|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for N: @h6 for @c or @h9 for @D|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect they will get defense right if Birman plays a second @h (@h6) now|pg||
nt|key1809: small @C could cost a trick, not here though|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: strange @h10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hoping declarer has Jxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then he wants a low diamond now|pg||
nt|rv: Birman may underlead a @d now|pg||
nt|key1809: South has accepted the invite ,and hence very likely to have a @C card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: somebody has to tell Birman that this does not show singleton @d|pg||
nt|rv: since Birman has 4@ds and dummy 5 of them, he may desist from underleading @DA though Padon is asking for it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rv: if Padon has stiff @d, would have overtaken @HA and played that card|pg||
nt|pelu: if S had a singleton he would overtake in @h and play b@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: yes|pg||
nt|key1809: defence erred here, but west has still to make the guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and how would you play diamonds if you had to play them yourself?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So rise with king|pg||
nt|pelu: greek gift|pg||
nt|key1809: Jepsen doesnt know the location of @h Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They lead A from AK|pg||
nt|key1809: but with D! Q , why wd north shift, so likely he will get it right|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You also have to give credit to Bilde's double of 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: first 6 teams are going to qualify for the World Championship|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is not automatic|pg||

nt|eleni: yes|pg||
nt|eleni: right |pg||
nt|panja: there is little W can do now|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 schools of thought about super accepting. Some think most 4 card support should super accept. Others think you need 4 card support and close to max|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now is should be over|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - with the defense|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  (+4)|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not sure I agree with the trump lead here - If declarer had removed 3NT to 5@D then there's a slight clue that declarer has clubs as the source of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also a clue that he was worried about a suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  maybe cashing @SAK and hope for 3rd trick|pg||
nt|eleni: wd Ron due to opps' misplay|pg||

nt|blum1956: a lively set ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer lucky trumps were 2-2 so he has an entry but even if East has 3 he would ruff the @c and be endplayed . Declarer would have to guess the @d|pg||

nt|panja: N should not pass as he know EW have a good @H fit...|pg||

nt|panja: and if E escapes to 1@H..and W raises..it will be difficult to get in later..|pg||

nt|panja: now. E will not lead @H..|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect slam missing, in my opinion North was too passive|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 @c looked very much like an under bit --if you have about 10 tricks in your own hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: lots of South hands make a slam near 100%|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: it should only be a cue, 10+ HCP...|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  not both|pg||

nt|smirny: but 3nt is too much i think|pg||
nt|andy_h: assuming no club ruffs looming I think the best play is a small trump from W (dummy). Obviously North would have a hard time ducking with Kx so if North plays low you stick in the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||
nt|andy_h: (I was talking about the trump play on the previous board)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D shows singleton @D..I guess|pg||
nt|eleni: a feature|pg||

nt|runnerup: ns ofcause|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Desi @H|pg||
nt|desinka: may 2@D vs prec club is narural|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to start the clubs early|pg||
nt|bagman: with a trump lead there's no hope of ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might not turn out well...|pg||
nt|eleni: The Greek youngsters here, as they understand they are behind, they overbid, which is sad|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: welcome William|pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe -1 after good guess in first trick, let's see...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking was reasonable; even if west plays the nine you can still lead to the ten and try and make a club trick for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Grunke is still believing in this contract|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|runnerup: north passed -many would double so ew in 2 @s without opponents bid anything -.1nt was ..something|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|blum1956: The only chance for the defense was a trump switch in the second trick|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ege cashes the @d to get a signal from Tofte. But the signal was crossed up|pg||
nt|poohbear: wont matter though|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer prob takes the @h ace then crosses to dummy to try and pitch the @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be quite a defense if North had Kxx in @h :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: at least against me :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry . I thought 9 card fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer will just take @h finesse |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Boards 3-6 = 21-21|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: These kinds of bidding scenarios shud be discussed by serious partnerships|pg||
nt|chrisky: 4@C 2@H and 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: I suspect there was a misunderstanding about 3@D here...|pg||
nt|eleni: now Peter has to play @d and discard his @h loser and a @c|pg||
nt|chrisky: in 3nt|pg||
nt|panja: S must have thought it was feature...so @H suit was likely to be open|pg||
nt|panja: and therefore, bid 4@S, not 3Nt|pg||
pc|h6|nt|loe48: even 2nt down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|frankbo: yes|pg||
nt|loe48: 2 down|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  STOP|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H can be made if EW dont play @S...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: excellent 9/10 hcp :)|pg||

nt|gmarco24: follow results on: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||

pc|h8|nt|andy_h: Observe the disparity between the 2@C (weak diamond bids) in this board and on board 5|pg||

nt|poohbear: the J of @cs gave East a lot of information. Was better to play the King|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eleni: It all depends on his inspiration for the @d|pg||
nt|bagman: The odds probably favour the clubs to run (by a slight margin)|pg||

nt|bagman: it is the best combination of possibilities|pg||

nt|gmarco24: "how about 5-1 diamonds??"  :)|pg||
nt|athene: well assuming 3@S is a slam try in hearts south has to go on past 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: he is super-max for a 3@C bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: *to|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: yes|pg||
nt|spenny80: better agaist game :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi SiSi:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome back Frank|pg||
nt|runnerup: but could have limited that to 1-down|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1@d -passed..|pg||
nt|blum1956: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|runnerup: just my guess..here bidding in this|pg||
nt|blum1956: If East opens 1@d Weat will hardly pass|pg||
nt|blum1956: West|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok-west is not passsing so north has a teasing to bid 2 @d if possible|pg||
nt|rensph: welcome David :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx    hi all|pg||
nt|ady: looks a part score hand   |pg||
nt|rensph: declarer in the other room will be making 5@D on bd 9, by ruffing a heart and giving up on the double @D finesse. More imps to Croatia|pg||
nt|ady: good lay for n/s    but think only 9 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: S for shure ment it as a good lift in @S, might there deal. Support X seems better by the long term.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see what Fisher does opposite a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|poohbear: ege might bid. I wouldnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: A Spade game for EW |pg||
nt|bagman: Declearer might have had some table feel about the clubs (e.g. NS might be notorious signallers)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  better :) thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 1NT is played now in the open room by N|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i agree|pg||
nt|spenny80: at board 6 south found killer lead but after he forgot to return trump to defeat|pg||
nt|galois85: dbl I think shows 4 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s is 500 -so good in case 4 @h makes,but there is a lot of play there|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: on board 10|pg||
nt|roussol: difficult to bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: 5@d MAKING|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - 4@H doesn't I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in practice 4@H too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eleni: a safe 4@s contract for E-W|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 4@S on 2 of three things: spade break and 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit new here. 2/1 by bought pairs?|pg||
nt|rensph: Might make 10 if you manage to ruff 2 hearts in dummy and set up the club trick, but defense might force in @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sunsamvar: as East may not lead or switch to @C in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11 on NS so ....|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|spenny80: for italy a sort of 2/1 i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: now|pg||
nt|blum1956: some pairs have an agreement that bidding the responder's suit is natural but this is rarely applicable to the opener's suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt will not make...|pg||
nt|runnerup: many nowadays -and ns now in problems|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Antway N are to reopen now.|pg||
nt|spenny80: but for germany i don't know. Could be also polish? (the meaning of 1@d is?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Anyway|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eleni: just if one of the 2 finesses work, they are home|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: If switch to @C will set up suit|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Q@d lead must be ducked|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|desinka: intresting board|pg||
nt|desinka: not easy to get sigle K@C if u pkay 6@c|pg||
nt|desinka: play|pg||
nt|famus: with a @H cue might go a notch higher|pg||
nt|ady: meantime  e/w have bought the contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: with spades breaking and @HK onside the contract makes (there are some additional chances in case 2 of the three things are not working)|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course if @s are not Jxxx in N's hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|spenny80: for me 2@c is a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: true Carl and the @S loser goes away|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C would have been better...but then, EW might have found their 2@H spot...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u there|pg||
nt|runnerup: no double -but @c lead and some hundreds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh must be careful|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a bad contract after all - near down one|pg||
nt|rensph: trumps breaking 4-1 means declarer isn't home yet|pg||
nt|rensph: other room has reached the same contract|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: brb|pg||
nt|rodal f: The polich club|pg||
nt|spenny80: but likely the final contract is ok for italy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bagman: On this lead, declarer cannot afford to duck a spade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Or now might only 8|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|famus: to b honest --50% slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wd |pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42:  nicely bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
nt|runnerup: some possibilities to miss tricks in defence but very unlikely|pg||
nt|runnerup: @c lead is orderd in these secvenses..but didnt came|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|raghavan: Nothing much to do here|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|famus: on a good day it wud b bid and made|pg||
nt|frankbo: Danmark did make 4S on B), 11 imp|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eleni: they could afford a 3@c contract anyway|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankbo: B9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Gerben42:  and there is the point that we dont know if N has successfully hidden his @S spots|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rensph: can now give S a @D ruff but that will give declarer more control over the trumps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: N a bit lucky|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzjk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: in general, if you have a bad long suit, better to play in the suit..|pg||
nt|panja: but with a good long minor....Nt might be a good idea|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes hasan you said 50% - Spade K can be under SA and so makes|pg||
nt|rensph: @H ruff I mean|pg||
nt|rensph: spade now?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|runnerup: spades and still 200 at least|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cA|nt|athene: no need to lead to the @DK first round of the suit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chrisky: -3|pg||
nt|eleni: only it wasn't a "good" long minor:)|pg||
nt|panja: y...that is why 1Nt was a big risk|pg||
nt|eleni: indeed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|famus: a @s back can spell trouble|pg||

nt|rodal f: EW was in for 800:) Swing it magistern.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: then 1@h bid would be real freestyler flight, but, as you say: just in case |pg||
nt|blum1956: a club lead restricts NS to 11 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: we see another case here...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|desinka: very intresting board |pg||
nt|desinka: and hard bidding and defance|pg||
nt|famus: @h slam coming up for the Hungarian girls|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: brb some kids.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot for Germany?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|famus: 3@h|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again you see here a slam in Hearts possibly bid by NS |pg||
nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
nt|runnerup: a game -no slam -should be avoided -here|pg||
nt|rensph: 2@S in EW fails on a number of ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|desinka: 4@H?|pg||
nt|eleni: den xero poios apo tous 2 milaei agglika|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||
nt|athene: aces and shape always beat a bunch of kings and queens and jacks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y.|pg||
nt|spenny80: do you open with north cards? me not|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, you are right =) I'd better take my coffee before! lol |pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess Ege didnt want to dbl 4@d in case that encouraged his partner to save|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|galois85: I think always 4@s-1... unless Rubino continues with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|runnerup: i down use coffee breaks when 4 optinal loosers|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now a slam has chances as the @h lead from West is tempting|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to have firm agreements in that spot|pg||
pc|h2|nt|desinka: so..]|pg||
nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||
nt|ady: down 2 around 2  if they find the club ruffs|pg||
nt|rensph: @DQ overtaken, returning a club.... looks like down 2?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||
nt|panja: let us say CJ goes to @CQ..|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Lina|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4@h is ok, but 5@c passed is excellent save  :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: major and club switch best |pg||
pc|h4|nt|raghavan: S denies Club control |pg||
pc|hT|nt|desinka: they may beat the contract|pg||
nt|desinka: but it is not easy |pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: N must simply cash his 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double on the strength of the singleton diamond|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||
nt|bagman: Makes life easier in 3@H but would have killed 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and his ace in the side suit|pg||
nt|ady: now making|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|raghavan: landed in slam|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EVERYONE--its boys here--thnks-Sisito--the VG operator corrected me--pardon me for this EVERYONE--thnks Sisito|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i wouldn't have thought of 6@D|pg||
nt|smirny: well it is hard to bid S hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Gerben42:  we cannot judge unless we know what exacly 3@S showed|pg||
nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|famus: 4@S rkc-5@hs showed 2+Q|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can take one diamond ruff and then set up the clubs losing one in each|pg||
nt|eleni: As you all know, John Oikonomopoulos is the son of Ghionis+Helena sp:) As we say in Greek "the apple falls under the apple tree" :)|pg||
nt|panja: on a bad day...@CJ could be from @CJx..|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lead direction, not invite to defence...|pg||
nt|rodal f: N will miss the @D after thid start|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes @c lead needed in slam -right |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: one problem is, he is not on lead, so if his partner has the unsupported @DA he might well not get his ruff|pg||
pc|h5|nt|blum1956: no thriller for us but good bridge after all|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eleni: Now that Mama-Lina is here I hope Peter will have better guesses:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: also with strip squeeze|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@h must take the @s after 2rounds @d and @s by W|pg||

nt|ady: can make 6@C  if seeing all the cards   meantime 5@C best|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: well played for 6H|pg||

mb|4H|nt|neobas: Though the fit will have to be found at the four-level|pg||

nt|runnerup: guessing well here+ wellplaced cards lets 4 @h to be made |pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 heart is par contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes the pass was a bit timid... maybe the 1@D opening did not promise @Ds|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  hmm other table didnt make 4@S... |pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s aggressive but he makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -but 4 makes|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, I guess 4@s!-2 is a good defense...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   shortage  agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: dont think west will do anything with such a poor opening  and over half the strength opposite the shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||
nt|helena sp:  good mornig to you all, good luck to our kids|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 1nt?|pg||
nt|rensph: given the EW hands 6@C seems like a reasonable contract, but unlikely to be made. Or reached.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, cut this and deal a goulash|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play J@S    playing north for 10X to make 12 tricks    unlikely play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rensph: With the @H finesse in reserve you can first see if the @SQ drops|pg||
nt|rensph: in this case both fail, but more than 50%|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont see why Schwartz didnt Q bid|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do u agree with the lead here Carl ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hasan tell me why Braun did not bid his 4 cd H?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rv: this is turning out to be great result for all teams chasing Israel and more so for Denmark since it will do their confidence a world of good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe another splinter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or a fit-bid in hearts|pg||
nt|key1809: they surely dont play constructive raises, hence Bilde was able to cue @D's even after a meagre 3 point raise, although he had 4cards in p's M|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: the same...4@c :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S on @DK finess - but NS has to play @D before @Hs are good|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Jepsen found the third option|pg||
nt|rv: I would have splintered here with 4@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S was never an issue. The hand is too good for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: sounds just about right |pg||
nt|key1809: agree with RV, splinter wd be a descriptive bid here'|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: I like fit-bids better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But I also like a better heart suit for that|pg||
pc|cT|nt|key1809: fit raise was an option, but bcause of a poor @H suit, splinter wd have been a good option|pg||
nt|pelu: I like not to give opp too many information :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: now if declarer plays low @h to the hand, N should duck with the Ace, otherwise @d disappears|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: S can see @hQ in dummy - easy to take @Hk and play @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: S can, but N can't see what declarer has in hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: But declarer may play a heart from dummy as Momchil pointed out|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rv: declarer best chance is both @HAK with North, subsequently fall back on @d finesse if required|pg||
nt|key1809: if declarer plays @H after drawing trumps, wd be interesting|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Heart from dummy is deceptive|pg||

nt|sharkey: a mundane 4@H....|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room 5@d were set by -1|pg||
nt|eleni: underbid by N-S so this must cost domr imps|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair it was hard for NS because they didn't really know how strong declarer was|pg||
nt|athene: so they don't know if they are trying to beat 1nt or just restrict overtricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: so is it right to bid 3nt= 100% -but no overtricks anytime or 4@s -makes some 90 % -even+1 many cases -just think about it -i dont know..-but it is difficult to bid 3nt so nothing ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: to think here |pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|sharkey: or - cud North's @H 8 come into play after @C lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW better not press by there sac.|pg||
nt|spenny80: here difficult don.t bid slam, defeat by ruff in @h|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    spades for e/w|pg||
nt|rensph: picked up a few imps on board 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 Spade loser in H contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has its merits over 4 @h but 5 must be too much|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5h |pg||
nt|raghavan: since voluntary bid of 4h shows min 3 cds|pg||
nt|ady: would not overcall|pg||
nt|rensph: 6-4 can lead to problems showing your hand with either bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says not @CQxx or better, and only 2 controls|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c I don.to know, maybe short|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3!X short or que SiSi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes carl|pg||
nt|famus: might get his !q or 10|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult hand for Peter, let us hope he counts it out really well, as he usually does|pg||
nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C sorry|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d clear splinter, but for me this isn't the hand to do a splinter in south|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT limit raise or better in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: North decided to defend|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but cant blame North for not competing|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  thought W was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT is nice|pg||
pc|d4|nt|famus: @s-@h-@d shud b the order|pg||
nt|roussol: ducking 2ice|pg||
nt|chrisky: -1 is ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not suit N to well|pg||
nt|runnerup: seaching for slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: wint pass 5D ???|pg||
nt|rensph: E showing minimum with spades.. Seems reasonable :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||
nt|loe48: so im not surprised if hey bid 4s|pg||
nt|raghavan: wont pass 5D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 3@C = ask for void/singelton|pg||
nt|spenny80: if you bid splinter and after a negativ bid you ask aces, then you didn't do a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: has led to a good spot   with some excellent cards opposite  and still not getting to high|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||
nt|athene: yes sorry 2@D might be 0-3 controls, not specifically 2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Tks:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH???|pg||
nt|runnerup: now -do west have a @s cont..|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hard to find the lead at E|pg||

nt|spenny80: no easy|pg||

nt|rodal f: If u like to follow more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and to the specs for watching|pg||
nt|henryb:  But if E opens, less so. I do not think East should open|pg||
nt|loe48: will we hear 4s and 5d|pg||
nt|athene: that sort of gets some way to showing what he has - will partner bid 7 on the strength of @CA @HAK?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Tofte has normal dbl and South is stuck. Prob should bid a fast 2@s :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankbo: Ireland did bidd 6D against Noray|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: he must abandon @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hello all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Pierre|pg||
nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||
nt|galois85: I totally don't like opening 1nt with 5-4-2-2, but just my opinion|pg||
nt|runnerup: this makes and also 3 @h -but better not bid more|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 2@s in the open room are been played now|pg||

nt|frankbo: Norway|pg||
nt|raghavan: I am for bidding 1S in 1st position when partner is yet to bid|pg||
nt|rensph: first a problem for N.... what to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: whenever defense plays @h the contract falls|pg||
nt|ady: north spades  look good enough  with 2 outside entries|pg||

nt|ady: as they fall the 87 good enough|pg||

nt|famus: ya--not suggesting that at all|pg||
nt|roussol: he heard me:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south should have bid the boring 6@S and argued it out afterwards|pg||
nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||
nt|rodal f: It often use to be right when NS are vul and EW not|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead makes difficulties |pg||
nt|ady: now the Queen|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chmitty: true : you have to discuss in depth what would 5NT mean as compared to 6@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: They should  be playing 2S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: so thanks was a bit premature|pg||
nt|raghavan: between them NS have 14 losers |pg||
nt|famus: i think he was thinking right about the final entry for running @ds if the @D fin fails or even if it works--@Sa was the right play|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time both aces @h and @c right but you surely dont want to squese table by taking @d at once|pg||
nt|blum1956: well, dummy discards two spades, three clubs and one heart. Whatever declarer then leads he is home |pg||
pc|s3|nt|galois85: switch diamonds, then -1 |pg||

mb|3H|nt|stamkreas: the last 2 boards shopuld be flat, but we made par so we can celebrate already, Denmark is always a strong opponent!|pg||
nt|roussol: y are right stam:)|pg||
nt|alati: o vasilis me to dino idi exoun vgalei 2 mans sti 2i stis teleftees ntones..|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  active NS give them a hard time though|pg||
nt|ady: meantime n/s may compet to 5@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chmitty: I dislike showing a two-suiter @s and a minor with a 6 cards @s suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or did N help a bit|pg||
nt|rensph: I can imagine N is content with defending 4@S|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@h shows a decent raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|5C|nt|famus: @s partial|pg||
nt|poohbear: now South doesnt know whether to save|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: sometimes you can rebid spades to show the extra length|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sharkey: nice stop by NS - Souths 4333 hand didnt appeal to him|pg||
nt|eleni: nice contract by Peter, as W can never return another @s|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but were is the K@c?|pg||
nt|eleni: true, but only 1 way to be played and cross his fingers that the K is with W|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course he doesnt know also the @hA|pg||
nt|chrisky: he knows the A@h is in w|pg||
nt|eugenio123: J@s would've been better|pg||
nt|rensph: lots of defense|pg||
nt|ady: my guess is down1   as long as south does not discard clubs|pg||
nt|rensph: other room played @SAK in 4@S, down 1 and 10 imps to Croatia again|pg||
nt|poohbear: had he raised @cs first his partner would know what to do|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42:  hard to find in this auction I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @CAx is golden|pg||
nt|andy_h: East, although the double fit is really good he is probably afraid of the lack of red-suit honours he had|pg||
nt|eleni: possible placing, yet not 100%|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @h was a good sacrifise vuln|pg||
mb|p|nt|alati: ara, den prokeitai na xasoume |pg||
nt|andy_h: If West had the same hand without the @HQ then slam is abysmal on a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S must be exclusion|pg||
nt|athene: so 5@H is two keys and the queen, and west will ask about @DK for seven maybe|pg||
nt|chmitty: would you stay silent with South's hand all the time ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: mortensen is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|alati: kai kleinoume tin 1i mera me 38 vps|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on hand 16 was played by east   on 10@S lead   and club was immediately finesse  so hence down|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|poohbear: Schwartz electing to go for @c ruffs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: penultimate board here|pg||
nt|loe48: as we see this contract has no chanse..bu \t a fresh try|pg||
nt|chmitty: North to South : your lead partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess west decided that with @HAQ @CA @DK east was not just bidding 4@H over 3@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: Ish Delmonte preferred bidding 1Nt to bidding the very weak @h suit, which might be passed out in a 5-1 fit. I prefer @H myself, but I can see all 52 cards. |pg||
nt|runnerup: can they solve this -i doubt|pg||
nt|runnerup: so it was too diffcult in both tables|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roussol: sure is good|pg||
nt|poohbear: the 6 is lowest for @ds|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|roussol: nice bid|pg||

nt|raghavan: I am fond  a Flannery 2D bid for both majors. a 2D bid for pre empt in diamond does not serve pirpose|pg||
nt|raghavan: purpose|pg||
pc|c2|nt|alati: afti i adam tou mikrou, evale idi ipopsifiotita gia vraveio tou prwta8limatos|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: looks that east can get 2,ruff anywaay -sorry -so this makes always ;)|pg||
nt|galois85: no finesses now... |pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wonder what he's thinking about|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, he has the exact count of the hands... so spades discarding clubs, ace of club, ruff one club, one diamond, again one clubs king of hearts, and diamond...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roussol: my blood pressure is :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bravo East (also for avoiding disastrous 5@c)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: With @C behind it became a auto|pg||
nt|runnerup: who says a sacrifise sorry -makes :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Did South in fact play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roussol: 21|pg||
nt|athene: if south had bid 3@S over 2nt then EW might be trying to get a decent penalty out of 6@SX|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess the 10 shows 0 or 2 higher thats how West knew to win Q|pg||
pc|dA|nt|alati: nomizw oti i tixi mas girise tin plati |pg||
nt|chmitty: the save in 6@s would have cost what ? 800 ?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 1@C openers that are less than 4 cards about 20 to 30% of the time, the need for a club stopper is regarded by some (not me) as a quaint and archaic concept.   |pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the session coming up shortly. Many thanks again to Monika, great concentration!|pg||
nt|alati: alla fainetai oti o danos tou vlepei ta filla|pg||

nt|loe48: brighter|pg||
nt|galois85: wow... trying to go -1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andy_h: Dare I say, maybe the solution is for West to open his hand 2@C even though it's generally not good to open 2 or 3-suiter hands with 2@C in fear of interference|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||

nt|davidb: bye all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: does 4@s have a chance here?|pg||
nt|key1809: yes , Rv , i guess i can see an opening in 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As I said before, Erik Fryklund from Sweden made it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: now yes, because Jepsen is warned about the distribution|pg||
nt|key1809: if south doesnt split, declarer is for sure through|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: @d lead no chance since it is wrong sided here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|key1809: @D lead wd be early claim of -1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A little strange that they went for spades when they know about the bad break|pg||
nt|davidb: not easy to bid NT with Axx |pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: yes, but defense can insist on @Hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|key1809: on a heart lead, declarer, has to duck a @H and finesse clubs |pg||
pc|d7|nt|key1809: end of story:)|pg||

nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
nt|athene: not sure, i guess something like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north could have doubled one of west's spade bids to emphasize his spade suit and try to wake his partner up|pg||
nt|chmitty: anyhow last hand now :) tx all and see you in a little more than 1 hour for the last match of the day @h:)|pg||

nt|eugenio123: I was thinking how to go down|pg||
nt|galois85: but luckily for declearer it was the same...|pg||
nt|blum1956: Very strange - if the declarer has @d J10x raising with the Ace still guarantees two diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set|pg||
nt|rensph: south had shown 9 already... could he have held 11=|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Germany has improved a litte getting 12 imp on Bd 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the match - many thanks to our excellent operator in Albena, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and congrats to the Swedish team on this win|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with longer spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
nt|galois85: yes, but thanks to KF and AQ it seems an impossible leading... |pg||
nt|galois85: 2nt shows 6@h and 4 in another (minor?)|pg||
