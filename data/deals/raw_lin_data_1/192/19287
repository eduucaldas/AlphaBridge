nt|Walddk2: You can combine the two and still let 2NT be a heart raise. With a limit hand for notrump you can double first and bid 2NT next|pg||

nt|gracelin: Is north aware of they are missing two key cards ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The advantage of having 2NT free as a heart raise is that you can distinguish between 3 and 4-card support (2@S or 2NT)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The number of trumps can sometimes be important for opener to know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: 2@S quite seldome there.|pg||
