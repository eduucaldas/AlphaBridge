nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||

mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Seems as we need a bit BBO help here: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Walddk4: welcome to Martin Johnson|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi johan, spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Sr2@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  S shows less then 7 HCP and 6+@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: double of 1@S is alertable?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W loves to open 1 Nt on many hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: di nuovo dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  very optimistic|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: se giocano lebenshol dichiarano 3nt, se non la giocano ora è tosta dire 3nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: maybe just misclickd alert|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  this board I would have bid 2@H with south hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|timverbeek:  but I play that as 8-11 5crd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north can not be expected to realize 4@H is cold, south had to bid again|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb:  More timidity from Ticha, who should bid 3@s after partner bids 2|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might do if NV|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Good pass bye east i think |pg||
nt|eugenio123: giocheranno lebenshol|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  not that it would change the contract|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Ahain I have a ask. Who would bid 3@S? Ain't force.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  Ticha is the player who did not bid 3@d on 82|pg||
pc|sK|nt|timverbeek:  is it forcing?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But she knows her partner who loved to use X|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  So the only boards with som imps was the 3@c -1 that Fra find 4@h in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 nt or any FG hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will be hard to stop in 2@h|pg||

nt|henryb:  The road to bad boards is paved with greed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  east is lucky north had a bid |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are playing negative free bids....which means South is slotted to have a very poor hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  thats true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the inferences work the other way too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|yuval10: W couldn't believe N opened with a singelton|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 1nt??? why not 2 or 3@C?|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with the north hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if he had @DK10 doubleton why would he lead the jack?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gronkvist:  Now she must find a pass|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzjs: cant ask her right now :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: that's why|pg||

nt|yuval10: otherwise declarer has time to develope 2 @d tricks and takes 10 tricks for a great score|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S a better contract here|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and think west should bid 4@S|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hand seems worthless in 3NT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|timverbeek:  but after a heartlead from north.....|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S is without chance|pg||

nt|yuval10: now only @c prevent an overtrick,,,,if he plays @h declarer needs to jump with the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays @h then declarer is between top and bottom - K@h means 11 tricks and a top, low @h means 9 tricks and a bad score|pg||
