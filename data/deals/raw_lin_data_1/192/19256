pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||

nt|oosb: to settle your nerves|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Dag:)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||

pc|h3|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||
nt|loe48: jepp|pg||
nt|oosb: Could have*|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Operator, South's name is  Fisher|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: ER  missing|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|loe48: auto 12|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be doubt in north's mind now about west hold 10x|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dagold: and easts is robertson|pg||
nt|ntmon: declar can to ruff two @H in hand an make the contract|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||

nt|uttam: guess he will play 4s|pg||
nt|eleni: those were their tricks, either way, with or without a ruff|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@D multi here, 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|bebechira: so the Dutch girls draw the first blood|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
nt|richie: a very thin 2@d overcall here by east in these vulnerabilities|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
mb|3H|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||

nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: Barendregt opens light, 11 with a bare ace would be a pass for me, but she likes bidding and playing, not passing :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brgpro: well, opening this hand is Ok because she has @sAQ9x, no rebid problems|pg||
nt|brgpro: but some might rather open 1@d |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|tomi2: they open 1@C on many balanced hands so 1@D tends to promise better dias in average. If I open this hand, I would open 1@C as well|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems as @D10 was correct. Else S wouldn't used the @HK|pg||
nt|oosb: But was a decent contract and a good try|pg||
nt|richie: same as France :) they have always been one of the top nations two - it's always exciting when they meet and show both quite natural but good bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|the saint: Morning all|pg||

mb|1H|nt|dagold: good morning Alan|pg||
nt|rodal f: For de som vil følge flere bord: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: det kommer nok 2nt naa|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS may stretch for a vul game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: kolata did well not to interfere since he was on lead|pg||
nt|murat e: against 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close your eyes and play @C towards your Jack - and good luck, with @D-tricks in East|pg||
nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||
nt|spenny80: now in south?|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a little bit in the dark now with a nice preempt by west|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
pc|d2|nt|murat e: hmm we can do that seeing all four hands...|pg||
nt|loe48: og 4 ganger hj er vel normalt naa og 8 stikk|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be a steal here though|pg||
nt|bebechira: now it is even easier|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's best move is probably to pass this but normal action is 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
pc|d5|nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|murat e: club queen doubleton and partner jumps on us...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Several times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Frank Bogen:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: i admit i would probably lead a @C|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
pc|c4|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
pc|cT|nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|oosb: -2 now on a @d back|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|eleni: still if ducked twice.......|pg||
pc|h4|nt|uttam: well  west was not thinking|pg||
nt|spenny80: sometimes you can make 3NT (xxxxxx@c or like) but bidding a new double you don't arrive at 3NT|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|dagold: Some players would overcall 1@s with the south hand but these Israeli players are very sound|pg||
nt|oosb: needed some @C ruffs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|murat e: yes but i think that was a restricted choice situation anyway|pg||
nt|oosb: so instead of a minor pickup, they'll lose a couple of imps here|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: God morgen|pg||

mb|3D|nt|gio 89: I may have competed to 2@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5c in the closed by W|pg||
nt|richie: or even 5, west has a strong hand (knowing partner is short in spades)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||
nt|josj: if 1@S already shows 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||
nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||
nt|richie: lol really? :) I was playing in Oz for one year but have a completely different experience :) :) :)|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... where?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||

nt|eleni: had Rosaline passed after the 2@h by Flavia, things would have been easieer for N-S|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|loe48: 3d er krav, derfor sier jeg at x kanskje er mer korrekt melding..og etter 3c. meld 3d som er invitt hand nu|pg||
nt|timve:  east west can maybe make 5@C|pg||
nt|timve:  but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  lets sea if E/W can defeat this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Lebensohl|pg||
nt|murat e: though tehe right bid here...|pg||
nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||
nt|asig: Yes, taht was a rather lucky contract|pg||
nt|timve:  normally two spade losers|pg||
nt|timve:  but on 7x hearts....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a spade discard by Ticha|pg||
nt|timve:  and I think she will pitch a spade|pg||
nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: En interresant hand. |pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||
nt|neobas: due to the operator not having the file with the hand recrods, we will probably not be able to broadcast it on BBO, regretfully|pg||
nt|richie: these north hands are problematic in many systems: many points, no stopper, no 4+@S |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: whenever i open those sorts of hands i write down -110 5 minutes later|pg||
nt|frankaus: no of @S is an important factor|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|spenny80: here 4@s could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B4 2@HE as here.|pg||
nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
mb|2N|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 slemmer står. @C - @D og NT.|pg||

nt|eleni: Margherita is right thinking |pg||
nt|frankaus: i willl see if they are short elsewhere as there are 3 comment. here cu |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: this is a typical need to cash tricks contract..a slip and it makes|pg||
nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||
nt|frankbo: kommer nok kl ess|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6 kloever , 6d og 6nt staar..vil de lande paa fotene her?|pg||
nt|frankbo: sorry han melder jo self 6 kl|pg||
pc|h2|nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
pc|c4|nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|josj: difficult to imagine for defence that E has such a bad hand...|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|loe48: there the slip came..he didnt want to listen to his pd's signal of switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C10 should have been a nice warning.|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I meant|pg||
nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: need @c back to beat|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: of course, we know .. she should take it and play @DA  .. but ..|pg||
nt|eleni: probably never heard of the rule "3rd high" and never rescue your partner either:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Just looks like a totally normal auction|pg||
nt|loe48: det staar paa at en av farvene ordner seg|pg||

nt|richie: now the problem is solved|pg||

nt|spenny80: 2@s helped n/s but i think 3@s was the normal end|pg||

pc|s4|nt|spenny80: but is strange consider W hand as strong hand.... a natural bid is better when it can|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Mange rare og harde sitser:) Se på 6@H uten @H utspill.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  1 @D from East, even vulnerable, NOT everybodyÂ´s taste, and absolutely not mine! Actually it helps N/S to stay out of a hopeless 6 @S|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland leading by 7 imps after 4 brds vs Hungary|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@h or 2@s by east have merit here|pg||

nt|eleni: For results pls go to : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|mrdct: you aren't going to get partner too overboard with a 2@h bid given that you are a passed hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: I prefer 2@s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|asig: I think I would have upgraded the South hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is nearly @h game but bad distributions again so only 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forsvinner @D fargen?|pg||
nt|loe48: der forsvant ruter farven ja|pg||
nt|oosb: Both black aces are friendly|pg||
nt|spenny80: good pass, very difficult for me to pass with W hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 2@h will surely have some @s tolerance or support|pg||
nt|richie: Hungary plays well, agressive style and putting lots of pressure - they made a pretty tough already for some top teams|pg||

nt|loe48: i believe E wanted to try 3nt..but he stopped in 3d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  But as both North and South can count on a hopeless @D-situation, we will stop in 4 @S|pg||
nt|loe48: and its not a hopeless spot if cards sit|pg||
nt|spenny80: Hxx with bad @h... i prefer 2@s|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|loe48: som vi ser 6 ruter er en fin kontrakt|pg||

pc|h8|nt|dagold: that should seal the deal|pg||
nt|asig: Killing led from Jones|pg||
nt|timve:  that is surprising|pg||
nt|spenny80: now i was better to bid 2@h not 3@c, to show raise @c (pass before) and long @h|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|frankbo: som GEO sier, 4 rut må være cue med hj, kanskje beste varianten|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c in east and 3NT by west is my guess - but 2@s is also possible of course|pg||
mb|2N|nt|timve:  hmm with north you would like to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  double as t/o is the way to do it|pg||
nt|timve:  also 2NT cannot be natural in this situation|pg||
nt|timve:  north is thinking about it|pg||
nt|timve:  3@D is down one|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c = 5/4 (not 6/4 not 5/5)|pg||
nt|spenny80: strong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 1Nt is better the dbl|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be expecting 4@h from west|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  at the other table a very nice lead from Barendregt on board 10 |pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2@h will play OK|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Puppet on so 5@Ss|pg||
nt|timve:  defeating the contract instantly|pg||
nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: west does have a hand better for playing in a suit contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: probably with 3@c denies 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: but i'm not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: que|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||

nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|loe48: if he raise club ace it makes|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 5@c i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: little try|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dagold: he had to decide how likely it is pard has a good hand with clubs when holding Qxx himself. not so unreasonable to pass imo|pg||

pc|c2|nt|frankbo: well|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even not by raising @CA u have a squize endplay.|pg||

nt|loe48: east need to blank club ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Welcome back from space:)|pg||
nt|eleni: well stopped by W|pg||
nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||

nt|tomi2: playing 2@D as weak in one major or strong in @D risks some 190 scores if partner with own dias and shortnes in majors passes this :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: why should she pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: W will know what 2@d is not, but E is thinking, probably for the overcall, they have described in CC overcalls against 2@d multi|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tomi2: what is wrong with 2@H = I have a good hand and 5+ hearts?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|tomi2: will Barendregt pass this?|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: they are on thin ice now :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: west now thinks partner has a strong hadn with long spades and looks for a slam with 10 points, yes?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...why make so much transfers after a multi opening...creats too much troubles for their own side. remember in 1993 when Dutch beat the Americans in the semi by 3 imps|pg||
nt|brgpro: in bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|tomi2: will Barendregt double 5@S?|pg||
nt|brgpro: there was a huge misunderstandin with this transfer overcall|pg||

nt|bobholl: i hope judith will not bid 7@H over 6@S :)|pg||

nt|spenny80: how possible?|pg||
nt|josj: don't think so :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: but well done to make 1N here|pg||
nt|bebechira: France having a missunderstanding in the closed |pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: E in 4s at the moment|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|oosb: 2NT showing @H + @D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I am not sure 2N says hearts...|pg||
nt|spenny80: ok correct|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s not a ridiculous spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: also 3 nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|spenny80: 3@d by north would be better (lead direction)|pg||
nt|galois85: 3nt e-w here?|pg||
nt|josj: easy make :)|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: B11. Same open same X but S bidded 3@H where S passed here. 3@S came and pass around.|pg||
nt|spenny80: dou you rebid in W now?|pg||
nt|richie: that's sad for them, two bad boards in a row doesn't give much confidence|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hawe45:  12 or 13...|pg||
nt|murat e: no risk no fun|pg||
nt|timve:  wow|pg||
nt|timve:  this is excitement (and not only in the tour de France)|pg||
nt|timve:  this is two off with the good lead|pg||
nt|timve:  but 6@S has also a chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not a friendly layout in @d today|pg||
nt|spenny80: I bet 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: can you bid 3nt that is the question here |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...well this is ok for EW, surely|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|oosb: Well I've seen a variant where it's @D + Major?  But standard unusual 2NT is @D + @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Chicken - or?|pg||
nt|frankbo: da var de for høyt|pg||
nt|bebechira: E in 5h at the moment|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT denies 3@s so 3@c is not needed|pg||
mb|3H|nt|asig: 5@c is also making|pg||
nt|spenny80: urca|pg||
nt|spenny80: aggressive bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  good lead|pg||
nt|timve:  now its-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|murat e: brave man|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: ikke enkelt..gaar mot 1 ned i denne|pg||

nt|rodal f: Info. CET13.00 Holland against, live as I'm told so fare. Not 100% shure.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norway.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit "Møllers Tran" from bough sides.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, must be|pg||
pc|d2|nt|asig: North can't prevent the fourth diamond from being ruffed - his clubs are too small|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 of @c makes a ruff j and 9 both in south true|pg||
nt|bebechira: good contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 diamonds and spade to give ...probably|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Looks better - who would lead the 2 from the Jack?|pg||
nt|loe48: korrekt spill her er liten spar mot J|pg||
nt|oosb: NS making LOTS of tricks in @C or @S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|galois85: not at all... but as you said before, we are not juniores!|pg||
nt|josj: any more|pg||
nt|mrdct: communications are a big problem here for declarer|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  One more round to-day|pg||
nt|murat e: 520 beats this one if any...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You might see the lead in board 14 this way: Chance for more than 1 trick = @C-lead|pg||
nt|oosb: North should not have passed.|pg||
nt|oosb: Stuck for a bid I wouldve chosen 3@C|pg||
nt|oosb: Or dbl.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|timve:  well defended|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@H was a good call, making EW to guess|pg||
nt|spenny80: you need 6@c and @s finess to make 3NT.... a lot|pg||
nt|richie: y|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|loe48: hvis N stikker med honoer dra J neste gang for a tippe K10 eller Q10 bak|pg||

pc|h8|pc|d7|nt|josj: after 3@H there is  no way to find out|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|asig: But 3NT surely more desireable|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: she will be able to establish a long @d but the defence will surely find their @c before she does so|pg||
nt|spenny80: W can play a 4th round in @h... I hope no|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bebechira: in 13|pg||

nt|mrdct: best to cut her losses now and cash out the @s suit - otherwise many down|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|oosb: And as one of the kibz points out, South couldve dbled 4@H|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|hawe45:  @D-ruff brings nothing here - defense needs the @S 9 also|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: ..sorry thought you meant this hand..|pg||

mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  No @D-lead now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No way to the 11th trick here, I hink|pg||
nt|rodal f: Likevel var det en kontrakt de fleste ville vert i.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like only 2 losers in 5@d but the 4-1 trump break is hard to manage|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 2@d minimum w/o 4@h|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@h relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ser det. 6@C=|pg||
nt|loe48: replay here|pg||

pc|d8|nt|spenny80: It's a bors for NT, 2 or 3 is little difference|pg||
nt|josj: hoping all the tens will come in, Fabio?|pg||
nt|spenny80: and with 3 10 i prefer more 3nt|pg||
nt|richie: normal 4h but no chance after the excellent diamond lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep|pg||
pc|dK|nt|asig: But may be hard to find|pg||
nt|loe48: ja, systemet er ikke saa godt at de faar vist trumf 10|pg||
nt|loe48: som ville vaert et noekkelkort her|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west has opened only 1 club, perhaps because of his spade holding...|pg||
nt|josj: but I agree in a way: 2nt makes no sense here...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2nt relay|pg||
pc|dA|nt|asig: Well, QED|pg||
nt|runnerup: should make also inspite off 4-1 distibution -10 nicely sing -but carefull you must be|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2h 1d and 1c ...|pg||
nt|bebechira: can not do anything about it|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|nt|ntmon: same start as in OR|pg||

nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
pc|h4|nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lucky|pg||
