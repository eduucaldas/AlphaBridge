pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||

nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||

mb|3S|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead. not sure i would have led the same but Axxx usually isnt so attractive to lead from either|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=NETHERLANDS@@892|pg||
nt|bebechira: for France|pg||

mb|4D|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
nt|raghavan: yES OTHER ROOM MADE ot TOO|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden need a 21-9 to capture the silver|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@C? strong2? seems unlikely|pg||
mb|4H|an| |nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mam ma³¹ satysfakcjê, ¿e pierwsze dwa rozdania w turnieju bryd¿a sportowego Asia rozegra³a przeciwko mnie przed 12 laty|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 loser Hand so upgraded to 2C|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: I dislike this strong2 2@C|pg||
mb|6N|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|raghavan: 5 D is likely to make |pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow...this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|iceblue: @S mb double it|pg||
nt|raghavan: IN THIS TABLE SWEDEN GIVES BACK WHAT IT GOT IN DEAL1|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
nt|iceblue: S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||

pc|d8|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 8 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||

nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 extra trick|pg||

nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||

nt|rodal f: With -1 by a @H lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: she has such a nice hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: S will not pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: I may have competed to 2@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5c in the closed by W|pg||
nt|richie: or even 5, west has a strong hand (knowing partner is short in spades)|pg||
nt|richie: they play TO dbls... otherwise West could have X-ed, maybe east can X this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
nt|bebechira: clubs break nicely for Jamilla so she will bring the contract home|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||
nt|josj: if 1@S already shows 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||
nt|richie: south needs to lead a heart, will she again find it?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  might lead a diamond |pg||
nt|bebechira: king of spades is nicely placed :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
nt|richie: horrible distribution for Claire (north), 3 down is the expected result|pg||
nt|marionmi:  JT9 looks attractive|pg||
nt|richie: I guess so, @d lead seems natural|pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||
nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
nt|rodal f: A better color so natural lead.|pg||
nt|bebechira: and West bid 1spade|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity East has not overtaken D|pg||
nt|bebechira: big mistake|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|richie: now Sigrid (east) has time to establish her clubs - won't take too long|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||
nt|richie: lol really? :) I was playing in Oz for one year but have a completely different experience :) :) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: if reversed vulnerability i will think harder :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: did you play in Sydney or Melbourne.... i will guess Sydney|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... where?|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier rather|pg||
pc|cA|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||
nt|josj: even|pg||
nt|eleni: had Rosaline passed after the 2@h by Flavia, things would have been easieer for N-S|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|tomi2: will they find out to stay in @D rather in @S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: only if showing the void is possible i guess|pg||
nt|tomi2: finding the fit is the problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|tomi2: 6@D is luckier because there the trumps split and you can discard the spades|pg||

nt|raghavan: oh |pg||
mb|1D|nt|loe48: med hand som det der kan en x nu vaere rett..etter 3c fra makker meld 3d som er invitt?|pg||
nt|richie: nice result for the French pair in Open, after the 2NT opening it will be copied|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  normal 4@H by south|pg||
nt|ntmon: she might have excited with @DQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: exited *|pg||
nt|eleni: a really weak pre-empt, but then as they are not vul, it sure makes life difficult for E-W|pg||
nt|mrdct: disciplined 3rd seat pass by west|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 5c was a flat board...|pg||
nt|richie: firm preemptive action by Carole Puillet but very reasonable, only the 3-3 majors are against it |pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab only 3c in the closed and playing there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|loe48: og ikke 3d krav til utgang|pg||
nt|spenny80: if someone open..|pg||
nt|mrdct: north may pass this out|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino count suggest 4th seat pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: i og med de aapner lett|pg||
nt|oosb: This could get dbled|pg||
nt|ntmon: defence was soft but i can imagine EW were happy to set the contract|pg||
nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||
nt|richie: good suit and green vs red are favouring this pressure bid - it's difficult for opps to exchange information but as we can see it did not work here|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is invitational|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dagold: 14 imps to israel on board 4 for making 3NX+2|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut må våre krav|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@C vulnerable is better with 6cards|pg||
nt|richie: after a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|richie: or will North do some sacrificing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen from Ticha?|pg||
nt|richie: just natural|pg||
nt|richie: 8-11 6+@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: pass...|pg||
nt|murat e: 12 hcp and double fit on the bidding is too much for me to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D should be an easy winner here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope they do not go to slam|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gio 89: E should know that W must have 4@D|pg||
nt|gio 89: since she didn't bid 3@s over her double|pg||
nt|gio 89: and opps should have 9card fit in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: 3d er krav, derfor sier jeg at x kanskje er mer korrekt melding..og etter 3c. meld 3d som er invitt hand nu|pg||
nt|timve:  east west can maybe make 5@C|pg||
nt|timve:  but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  lets sea if E/W can defeat this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
nt|richie: South surely won't :)|pg||
mb|6C|nt|richie: 3@hX in the other room...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Lebensohl|pg||
nt|murat e: though tehe right bid here...|pg||
nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||
nt|asig: Yes, taht was a rather lucky contract|pg||
nt|timve:  normally two spade losers|pg||
nt|timve:  but on 7x hearts....|pg||
nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
nt|richie: wow! south really doubled... now things become interesting...|pg||
nt|richie: on board 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... this will a swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
mb|6S|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 OR ended 3@HSX|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a spade discard by Ticha|pg||
nt|timve:  and I think she will pitch a spade|pg||
nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 2 tricks loss cannot be avoided|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  that might get expensive|pg||
nt|richie: likely to be -500|pg||
nt|richie: they led a trump which solved one problem|pg||
nt|bebechira: Mikael from Sweden recomended 6d...and right he is|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  @H King seems to come from right hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 500 enough Y|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: B3 ended 2NTN-1 and 11IMP to Norway|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|richie: but lots of work to do, Sigrid (east) is probably happy to see @HK (I would :))|pg||
nt|raghavan: On hearing a 9 card fit in Spade, others are forgotten. But Open too in Spades only|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|murat e: draw trumps play a heart north takes and must exit with another heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|timve:  yeah always hard to see for east|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ok, then its not THAT expensive since 3N made here. but on the other hand, they surely would have found the killing lead so they lost a chance for a big pickup|pg||
pc|c7|nt|richie: @d for 1 looser: you have to guess which of your opponents has Honour doubleton: either play small to JTx or play J|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We have been told, that West can always make 4 ! S - I call it double-dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: Although theres always the possibility that pd has a bust hand, and you get dbled.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankbo: den var ikke bra|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I'm not sure, but would not mind an upgrade with 2 tens|pg||
nt|uttam: -2|pg||
nt|josj: -1, next|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|ntmon: 4@S  a normal outcome of this deal|pg||
nt|gio 89: if E menages to hold it to -3/4 it could be a push since NS should make 4@H|pg||

nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||
nt|neobas: due to the operator not having the file with the hand recrods, we will probably not be able to broadcast it on BBO, regretfully|pg||

mb|p|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||

nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||
nt|frankbo: kommer nok kl ess|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
nt|marionmi:  how should she play? win in hand and play a spade?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6 kloever , 6d og 6nt staar..vil de lande paa fotene her?|pg||
nt|frankbo: sorry han melder jo self 6 kl|pg||
pc|cK|nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or draw trumps and take the double club hook?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
nt|richie: I guess you could better try to ruff 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or take in dummy and start playing clubs right away?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes same in Open too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|richie: I would try for that, and establish diamonds as we go|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but then you have to win a high heart in dummy right away and you may have to ruff 1 or 2 spades with your high trumps in hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ruff one seems to be enough for =|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am wrong it seems:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
nt|richie: that's also true- maybe @sJ9 stops the spades a bit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Seems u was right.|pg||
nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bebechira: defeating or making is a 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|richie: @s2 is disappointing... another trump would have worked better|pg||
nt|marionmi:  would easts diamonds be count? should be lavinthal maybe|pg||
nt|richie: they show count|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR the NT ended -1|pg||
nt|richie: small swing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|josj: difficult to imagine for defence that E has such a bad hand...|pg||
nt|ntmon: exactly .. there danger comes from|pg||

nt|spenny80: hi all|pg||

pc|sK|nt|loe48: there the slip came..he didnt want to listen to his pd's signal of switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C10 should have been a nice warning.|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I meant|pg||
nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: need @c back to beat|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: of course, we know .. she should take it and play @DA  .. but ..|pg||
nt|eleni: probably never heard of the rule "3rd high" and never rescue your partner either:)|pg||

nt|richie: each other|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think i would like 2@s here better by east than 2n, then you make partner aware of your spade shortness |pg||
nt|marionmi:  she doesnt need to have a very good spade stopper for a 1 level nt bid|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, usually 1nt is more like 8-10 in this situation|pg||

nt|uttam: in fact aLL Aces are friendly|pg||
nt|josj: W gets another chance now|pg||
nt|spenny80: y a minimum sure|pg||
nt|richie: @dJ lead, @s to A and @d (north spade) east LOW!|pg||
nt|richie: misclick|pg||
nt|bebechira: true..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|loe48: i believe E wanted to try 3nt..but he stopped in 3d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  But as both North and South can count on a hopeless @D-situation, we will stop in 4 @S|pg||
nt|loe48: and its not a hopeless spot if cards sit|pg||
nt|spenny80: Hxx with bad @h... i prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but maybe you can double|pg||
pc|hK|nt|loe48: som vi ser 6 ruter er en fin kontrakt|pg||
nt|timve:  3@S was a cuebid|pg||
nt|timve:  not splinter|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think one down here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dagold: that should seal the deal|pg||
nt|asig: Killing led from Jones|pg||
nt|timve:  that is surprising|pg||
nt|spenny80: now i was better to bid 2@h not 3@c, to show raise @c (pass before) and long @h|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or make something yourself, like here|pg||
nt|richie: yes, dbl is perfectly fine of course|pg||
pc|h9|nt|timve:  well....|pg||
nt|timve:  this is lucky for th Italitans, they cannot stop, while knowing they miss 2 aces|pg||
nt|timve:  but luckily for them @HK is onside|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the juniors Israel is edging ahead...they will be hard to stop.... may be Agustin will have something to say about this|pg||
pc|c3|nt|asig: *lead|pg||
nt|ntmon: such a X is normally for T/O|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly 2 down if @h misguessed|pg||
nt|spenny80: A@h is probably in W when she see Q@d K@c and probably Q@s....|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: I don't see how this can go down|pg||
nt|spenny80: it would be very strange|pg||
nt|ntmon: a thrilling contract, why not to look at|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|richie: clearly some moment of misconcentration|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2down for 1 imp?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|loe48: also a thin neg x vul from w|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if e play @h when she take with Q@d...|pg||
nt|bebechira: for sure|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|murat e: one of the well on paper but doomed slams...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I guees, many pairs will - without this anti-bridge-@d-bid - will come too high here|pg||
nt|asig: (and obviuos, too)|pg||
nt|spenny80: Gib says +1, but only seeing all cards|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree with GIB :)|pg||
nt|josj: he plays them so well...|pg||
nt|spenny80: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na widno sz³o 12 lew w BA|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Som 6@H med fargen 3-3 eller finne 10X contra KX|pg||
nt|richie: they Israelian juniors are extremely impressive... also in White House Juniors this year they overclassed all other teams - and likely to get another gold medal here too|pg||
nt|bebechira: I vugraphed Israel in the semis and in the final in Philadelphia and they are a very good team|pg||
nt|richie: professional team almost, some of the players even are pros|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|murat e: both finesses wrong trumps 3-1 clubs dont break etc.etc....|pg||
nt|marionmi:  also not too risky|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bebechira: i am looking at the comentary in the open room... and it was incredible for the comentators|pg||
nt|richie: do you agree with multi Traian or old-fashioned 3@H?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  And a later @D-Jack-switch will be a nise moment for North|pg||
nt|mrdct: tap the dummy now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|josj: on her way to 14 more imps...|pg||

nt|spenny80: A@d and @d...|pg||

nt|bebechira: lucky not doubled|pg||
mb|1H|nt|uttam: scotland has opened their a/c|pg||
nt|richie: I prefer 3@h|pg||
nt|bebechira: we integrated in precision|pg||
nt|richie: ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|richie: I think they looked at the results two years ago and scheduled accordingly: in the last match no 1 and 2 meet (Poland and France), no 3 and 4 (Netherlands and Sweden) etc|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...Friday and Saturday will be a feast|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|2H|nt|murat e: 4 of a major too high for both|pg||
nt|asig: NS may bid 4@h on this one|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice 5 @d but because ew om board -cards well placed and makes :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: can may 6@c or 6@s here if you are good at dropping Qs offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I say that North should nt take bidding to shes hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: and go 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. 6@S-1 i OR og 17IMP til Belgia.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems as def slipped at 1!NX made 7 and Netherland back in the lead.|pg||
nt|ntmon: large gain for Italy, now match almost close|pg||
nt|spenny80: they don't play polish club?|pg||
nt|mrdct: assuming the dbl promises 4@s (i have no idea if it does)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i heard polish club is out of favour with a lot of the juniors these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile Hungary has a small margin (40- 11 imps) over Sweden, no 3 at this moment|pg||
pc|c9|nt|murat e: east must avoid spade lead though|pg||
nt|oosb: Is everyone bidding 3@H here?|pg||
nt|uttam: 4h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure after the x..|pg||
nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||
nt|oosb: So I might lose imps in this deal, but I pass as West|pg||
nt|spenny80: really?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i meant by south|pg||
nt|richie: straightforward 3NT, @hK is protected so it should  not be very problematic|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|richie: in 1NT you count 7 tricks when you manage to make 3 spade tricks, best line would be to attack them a.s.a.p. and leave the heart suit|pg||

nt|bebechira: sorry.....private|pg||

nt|spenny80: lol|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|loe48: 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's better not to test partner here, being a passed hand |pg||
nt|josj: defence can take 4 tricks at most on this layout|pg||
nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
nt|richie: good question by one of the kibs, where should EW have entered the auction on board 25? I have no idea... maybe 3@d overcall by east when you play it as preemptive|pg||
nt|richie: honestly I have no idea - I am not in Albena|pg||
pc|hA|nt|timve:  good contract, but normally going off|pg||
nt|richie: aha! for the juniors!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes ... :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  No more comments to-day - this is too much|pg||

nt|richie: but I can imagine some disappointment, they had just one goal: GOLD|pg||

pc|s2|nt|oosb: @D guess now |pg||
nt|oosb: doesnt know A@S vs A@D|pg||
nt|oosb: so this is tough|pg||
nt|uttam: but did not require @d guess, dec could find out about @s ace 1st|pg||
nt|richie: just 17 imps for poland|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a llady?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||

pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Y. @SKQ and a @H shift.|pg||

nt|rodal f: 1@H=4@S+ and 1@S=3 cards I belive.|pg||
nt|richie: I think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I understand him|pg||
nt|frankbo: hadde blitt vanskelig for Ø med 3 hj fra S|pg||
nt|timve:  this pair has a better solution|pg||
nt|timve:  they use Kokish|pg||
nt|timve:  2@H is natural or very strong NT|pg||
nt|spenny80: no, She can play @h finess or @s expass|pg||
nt|richie: could be a swing board here, 6@s is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|richie: very difficult board to bid... both have a 2 suiter, you miss one ace (fortunately opposite void) and it's hard to really establish the fit|pg||
nt|richie: 1@s - 2@d // 3@c - 3@d // 4@d or 4@h may have done the job|pg||
nt|iceblue: agree|pg||
mb|5D|nt|uttam: i understand|pg||
nt|timve:  it seems E-W dont have good agreements after 2NT|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT is now played in the wrong hand, defence can take their diamond tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  cause with 6HCP I would get ideas|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table Judith Nab actually opened the door for 7@d but Rosaline Barendregt firmly closed it again|pg||
mb|6D|nt|rodal f: Ville ikke 3@S vert gratis. Spørsmål etter hold eller advanced que bid?|pg||
nt|uttam: no power|pg||
nt|josj: @H finesse seems best option as @C might be 5-3...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will have problems here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|loe48: ja er muligheter her|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3s-4d now|pg||
nt|spenny80: last board 6@s for italy and same defence|pg||
nt|richie: seems to be a push, same contract reached|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5d is closing the door as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: enjoy your coffee gentlemen anyway:)|pg||
nt|richie: here it is west who is shutting the door, in open room it was east (surprisingly)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Så etter 3@S fra N kommer 4@H fra S som sier at 3@S var et advanced que.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 now i think with the non-@c lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: ah yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: the italian girls in the other room would've been better to play count on the opening @DK lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|richie: incredibly difficult board, she had to develop @h first (@h2 to J) but who can find that?|pg||
nt|richie: you have to play hearts to take north's entry for the 4th spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: club lead in the open room by Nab and Jack played|pg||
nt|richie: I was just going to say that I think south will lead @c6 :) but wrong guess|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass always at team then Frank.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid in east showed an invitational hand with 3+@s or a mild game forcing hand, maybe with 13 and a side suit she is too strong, on the other hand Magie in west could have bid ...|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d shortness|pg||
nt|rodal f: So some national Polich players have left the Polich club it seems.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bebechira: Rosaline in 5d dbled in the closed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|richie: 500 and 1 imp to france I guess|pg||
nt|richie: 2 imps|pg||
nt|richie: might be a swing to france again :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bebechira: may be 2|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|spenny80: @c are 4/4 or Aces is in north (with Axx in south probably she takes on 1st round)|pg||
nt|josj: and another imp for Italy...|pg||
nt|josj: Judith?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark defeated Israel in the juniors .. 19-11 so Israel lead is now 'only'14 VPS|pg||
nt|richie: partscore in @h probably|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|runnerup: 3nt with @d guess or lead here|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c = gazzilli|pg||
nt|richie: south has a lot of trumps, but that's all, I guess she will pass in these vulnerabilities, north may dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 2@d positive|pg||
nt|richie: no, passing wisely|pg||
nt|bebechira: n will double|pg||
nt|bebechira: oops...she didn't|pg||
nt|richie: just made, good result for the French girls Carole and  Claire, they avoided any tragedies|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|bebechira: incredibil.... N is playing in 4s in the closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: som GEO sier, 4 rut må være cue med hj, kanskje beste varianten|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c in east and 3NT by west is my guess - but 2@s is also possible of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  hmm with north you would like to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  double as t/o is the way to do it|pg||
nt|timve:  also 2NT cannot be natural in this situation|pg||
nt|timve:  north is thinking about it|pg||
nt|timve:  3@D is down one|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c = 5/4 (not 6/4 not 5/5)|pg||
nt|spenny80: strong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 1Nt is better the dbl|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be expecting 4@h from west|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|richie: you need some tricks to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we have Israel 275-Italy 261-Denmark 235 the medals at the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  at the other table a very nice lead from Barendregt on board 10 |pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2@h will play OK|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|richie: south in open room has GREAT courage!!! she bids 2@c for majors|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Puppet on so 5@Ss|pg||
nt|timve:  defeating the contract instantly|pg||
nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: west does have a hand better for playing in a suit contract|pg||
nt|richie: can Italy still challenge Israel, you think?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|spenny80: probably with 3@c denies 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: but i'm not sure|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she will make some tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope.. I think the israelis are very strong...they will not give it away after such a start|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Kanskje GEO vil hjelpe oss litt? Velkommen.|pg||
nt|loe48: 4h and 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|frankbo: will bidd 6 now|pg||
nt|frankbo: 1 down|pg||
nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
nt|richie: small @c to K and 3 rounds of clubs, then @dA and diamond? maybe north is tempted to jump by Q|pg||
nt|marionmi:  around 8 is my guess|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marionmi:  yes but even that isnt enough if north keeps her spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, south has 3|pg||
nt|jkotor: strefa szlemowa na drugim stole pozostawia trochê do ¿yczenia|pg||
pc|sK|nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||
nt|richie: are you kidding me?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  what should she discard on the 3 clubs? a diamond, a heart and a spade?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|loe48: if he raise club ace it makes|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 5@c i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: little try|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... big misunderstanding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dagold: he had to decide how likely it is pard has a good hand with clubs when holding Qxx himself. not so unreasonable to pass imo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ikke tid. Synd.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y or H|pg||
pc|s7|nt|frankbo: well|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even not by raising @CA u have a squize endplay.|pg||
nt|frankbo: could still endplay E|pg||
nt|loe48: still possibilities id say|pg||
nt|loe48: draw 9 cards in spade and dia..so whats left|pg||
nt|ntmon: still tempting for W|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult for W not accept|pg||
nt|richie: yes, probably - even 2 hearts is OK|pg||
nt|richie: you can see that dummy is inaccessible|pg||
pc|d3|nt|josj: can W be sure of 2 aces opposite?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|ntmon: italian girls are well prepared concerning bidding system - my conclusion|pg||
nt|richie: I don't know the leads well enough, could @sT be from AJT? I guess not... |pg||
nt|richie: NS now need to establish the @h trick before it disappears... easier for North to see it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup: ok thats for that game nice peaceful a couple off down like 2 ..|pg||
nt|loe48: east need to blank club ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Welcome back from space:)|pg||
nt|eleni: well stopped by W|pg||
nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am not kidding you...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||
nt|richie: this will make now, courage has been rewarded and 6 imps to Sweden|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrdct: 3NT probably plays quite well though with the @d suit sitting nicely|pg||
pc|d7|nt|richie: problems are solved now, 9 tricks in the pocket|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|richie: maybe if she manages to make 6 tricks they will win 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: weired bidding as well|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|henryb:  One should ask for unblock or count, the other for attitude|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|frankbo: det tror jeg lars fikk en gavepakke|pg||

nt|loe48: har vi noe sluttkontrakt i spill 9?|pg||

nt|loe48: you get valuable info|pg||

nt|loe48: da har han 12|pg||
nt|loe48: saa johansen..dra ned en trump til du|pg||
nt|spenny80: but with @h 4-3 is good slam...|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe pitch @dQ here to put some doubt in declarer's mind|pg||
pc|d6|nt|josj: well, maybe not if @C 4-1|pg||
nt|spenny80: not sure...|pg||
nt|spenny80: could be the same|pg||
pc|h5|nt|timve:  well no problems in 2@H|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well, hold on, this 4 have just passed a hand out|pg||
nt|spenny80: better 4@s in west else 5@d....|pg||
nt|richie: declarer has to take care of her communication - she can pick up 4@h tricks but needs to be careful with her @d entry|pg||
nt|richie: 4@d is again a bit modest, the void in @h doesn't encourage her I think|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yeah but still|pg||

pc|h7|nt|henryb:  1N somehow showed hearts?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|murat e: not possible w standart bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: good play|pg||
nt|murat e: covering costs a trick|pg||

pc|hT|nt|henryb:  Looks like there is a loser in each suit|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  and 3@c would have been down a bunch|pg||

nt|marionmi:  spangenberg wont think her partner has 5 diamonds, so i think she should play the queen to show something weird is going on|pg||
nt|marionmi:  9 might also be neutral from Q9x|pg||

nt|spenny80: dou you rebid in W now?|pg||
nt|richie: that's sad for them, two bad boards in a row doesn't give much confidence|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  12 or 13...|pg||

nt|spenny80: I bet 2@d|pg||

mb|3H|nt|runnerup: can you bid 3nt that is the question here |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...well this is ok for EW, surely|pg||

nt|rodal f: What happend|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Well I've seen a variant where it's @D + Major?  But standard unusual 2NT is @D + @H|pg||

nt|bebechira: 3 more imps for Sweden and in the 18-12 teritory now|pg||

nt|richie: Magdalena has to switch to a @d to set the contract (at least not spade)|pg||
nt|bebechira: i just typed ...diamond 2 now|pg||
nt|richie: 3@h is a challenge - you will have to take @d in north and play a club towars KT9 and allow east to keep it when she puts her figure|pg||
nt|richie: only way to discard your loosing @s|pg||
nt|richie: some alternative (playing low @H first or 2x@d) is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: North in 4h in the open room...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|loe48: ikke enkelt..gaar mot 1 ned i denne|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: west has opened only 1 club, perhaps because of his spade holding...|pg||
nt|josj: but I agree in a way: 2nt makes no sense here...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2nt relay|pg||
nt|bebechira: french girls in 2s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. Right end.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|asig: Well, QED|pg||
nt|runnerup: should make also inspite off 4-1 distibution -10 nicely sing -but carefull you must be|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the dutch girls to grab the lead|pg||
nt|richie: how? :)|pg||
nt|richie: easy board|pg||
nt|marionmi:  pretty risky 3@s bid by north :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead, still Ticha will make at least 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2h 1d and 1c ...|pg||
nt|bebechira: can not do anything about it|pg||
nt|richie: VERY comfortable!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: but after this good lead, you may need it|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|ntmon: same start as in OR|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|loe48: helt grei 4s. med muligheter|pg||
nt|mrdct: runs into similar problems to 5@d but at least you only need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: revoke 4 clubs?|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
pc|d8|nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lucky|pg||
nt|mrdct: holding natural trumps tricks, not a good idea to lead a shortage|pg||
nt|spenny80: but better than 5@d|pg||
nt|spenny80: at 26 cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bebechira: bad news are coming now|pg||
