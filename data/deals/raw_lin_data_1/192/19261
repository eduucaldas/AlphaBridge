mb|p|nt|oosb: Straight forward 3NT to start with|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi Uttam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankbo: ok han er ikke her|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: hi Oosman bhai|pg||
mb|3D|nt|spenny80: Italy 3rd vs Poland 2nd...|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: 2@h should make in comfort, so an easy start to the championships|pg||
nt|rodal f: A invitation? Positive or negative trail? Nope.|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably ew will play in diamonds|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45:  9 lucky tricks E/! in a @S-contract|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@h in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|dagold: so going down|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Vladimir, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W|pg||
nt|dagold: In the other room north didn't sell out to 2@h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  8 ver - nine...?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Frank:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our teams this morning: The Netherlands are 1st and Italy 3rd, so it will be a thrilling match|pg||
nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ntmon: EW showed semi-forcing-to-game, NT range, E transferred to @H, W accepted|pg||
nt|josj: good morning eleni|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Vladimir|pg||
nt|ntmon: gm Eleni and Jos|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h good morning Jos:) welcome|pg||
nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||
pc|s6|nt|frankbo: :)|pg||
nt|richie: probably @s7, @sK and @dQ will be the best you can do as declarer and hope for something good|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|oosb: Since AK@S are both with @S|pg||
nt|oosb: even @C are blocked for defence|pg||
nt|uttam: 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosb: 11?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|uttam: y 11 becos of @c lay out|pg||
nt|josj: 3 rounds of spades|pg||

nt|bebechira: easier for our West in Diamonds..|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  Top on its ways to France (N/S)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|eleni: but the contract is makeable, as the @h finess works:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  WAS on tiÂ´s way...|pg||
nt|mrdct: she has a beer card too|pg||
nt|richie: 3x@h now and exit a low club will work (double dummy) hard to see with closed cards|pg||
nt|richie: not low club but 7 or 8|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table I think Rosaline Barendregt had to escape from 1@sX, it's usually bloody when opps pass a TO dbl on the 1 level, but not sure if 2@hX is such a big party|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  But still -100 should be good for N/S|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=NETHERLANDS@@892|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||
nt|loe48: jepp|pg||
nt|oosb: Could have*|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankbo: når den ordner seg blir det 12|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Operator, South's name is  Fisher|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bebechira: S in 2nt in the closed so we will have the first swing|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: ER  missing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|loe48: auto 12|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be doubt in north's mind now about west hold 10x|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|dagold: and easts is robertson|pg||
nt|ntmon: declar can to ruff two @H in hand an make the contract|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|uttam: guess he will play 4s|pg||
nt|eleni: those were their tricks, either way, with or without a ruff|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@D multi here, 2@H pass or correct|pg||

mb|2C|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S makeable on a good trump guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
nt|richie: a very thin 2@d overcall here by east in these vulnerabilities|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i can see the dutch girls lost 11 on 17|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||

nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
pc|s6|nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sQ|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||

nt|rodal f: For de som vil følge flere bord: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||
mb|1S|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: det kommer nok 2nt naa|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS may stretch for a vul game here|pg||
nt|richie: partner opens 1@c and you hold this south hand :) you're not stopping under 6 anymore!|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|murat e: kolata did well not to interfere since he was on lead|pg||
nt|murat e: against 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close your eyes and play @C towards your Jack - and good luck, with @D-tricks in East|pg||
nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||
nt|spenny80: now in south?|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a little bit in the dark now with a nice preempt by west|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: hmm we can do that seeing all four hands...|pg||
nt|loe48: og 4 ganger hj er vel normalt naa og 8 stikk|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be a steal here though|pg||
nt|bebechira: now it is even easier|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's best move is probably to pass this but normal action is 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|murat e: club queen doubleton and partner jumps on us...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Several times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Frank Bogen:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: i admit i would probably lead a @C|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
nt|richie: both north players bid 4NT, taking the initiative|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||
nt|richie: south obviously is looking for the @d cue|pg||
mb|6S|nt|oosb: -2 now on a @d back|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eleni: still if ducked twice.......|pg||
nt|richie: 6NT is a slightly better bid I think, to protect @dK|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: well  west was not thinking|pg||
nt|spenny80: sometimes you can make 3NT (xxxxxx@c or like) but bidding a new double you don't arrive at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...flat board and next :)|pg||
nt|richie: small @d lead by Magdalena Ticha?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dagold: Some players would overcall 1@s with the south hand but these Israeli players are very sound|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: she has such a nice hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: S will not pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: I may have competed to 2@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5c in the closed by W|pg||
nt|richie: or even 5, west has a strong hand (knowing partner is short in spades)|pg||
nt|richie: they play TO dbls... otherwise West could have X-ed, maybe east can X this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||
nt|josj: if 1@S already shows 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
nt|richie: horrible distribution for Claire (north), 3 down is the expected result|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||
nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
pc|c4|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... where?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||
nt|josj: even|pg||
nt|eleni: had Rosaline passed after the 2@h by Flavia, things would have been easieer for N-S|pg||

nt|richie: firm preemptive action by Carole Puillet but very reasonable, only the 3-3 majors are against it |pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab only 3c in the closed and playing there|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: og ikke 3d krav til utgang|pg||
nt|spenny80: if someone open..|pg||
nt|mrdct: north may pass this out|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino count suggest 4th seat pass|pg||
mb|3H|nt|loe48: i og med de aapner lett|pg||
nt|oosb: This could get dbled|pg||
nt|ntmon: defence was soft but i can imagine EW were happy to set the contract|pg||
nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||
nt|richie: good suit and green vs red are favouring this pressure bid - it's difficult for opps to exchange information but as we can see it did not work here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 14 imps to israel on board 4 for making 3NX+2|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut må våre krav|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@C vulnerable is better with 6cards|pg||
nt|richie: after a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|richie: or will North do some sacrificing?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|murat e: pass...|pg||
nt|murat e: 12 hcp and double fit on the bidding is too much for me to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D should be an easy winner here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: E should know that W must have 4@D|pg||
nt|gio 89: since she didn't bid 3@s over her double|pg||
nt|gio 89: and opps should have 9card fit in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: 3d er krav, derfor sier jeg at x kanskje er mer korrekt melding..og etter 3c. meld 3d som er invitt hand nu|pg||
nt|timve:  east west can maybe make 5@C|pg||
nt|timve:  but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  lets sea if E/W can defeat this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
nt|richie: South surely won't :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Lebensohl|pg||
nt|murat e: though tehe right bid here...|pg||
nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||
nt|asig: Yes, taht was a rather lucky contract|pg||
nt|timve:  normally two spade losers|pg||
nt|timve:  but on 7x hearts....|pg||
nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
nt|richie: wow! south really doubled... now things become interesting...|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a spade discard by Ticha|pg||
nt|timve:  and I think she will pitch a spade|pg||
nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H King seems to come from right hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: B3 ended 2NTN-1 and 11IMP to Norway|pg||
pc|c4|nt|richie: but lots of work to do, Sigrid (east) is probably happy to see @HK (I would :))|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|murat e: draw trumps play a heart north takes and must exit with another heart|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|timve:  yeah always hard to see for east|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|richie: @d for 1 looser: you have to guess which of your opponents has Honour doubleton: either play small to JTx or play J|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  We have been told, that West can always make 4 ! S - I call it double-dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: Although theres always the possibility that pd has a bust hand, and you get dbled.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankbo: den var ikke bra|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I'm not sure, but would not mind an upgrade with 2 tens|pg||
nt|uttam: -2|pg||
nt|josj: -1, next|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ntmon: 4@S  a normal outcome of this deal|pg||
nt|gio 89: if E menages to hold it to -3/4 it could be a push since NS should make 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eleni: -1 is a good score for Italy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bebechira: welcome to Bas van Beijesterveld|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eleni: and 3imps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|murat e: now ace and another club endplays him for the second time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|neobas: Hello everyone :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|timve:  if west has QX or Q but knowing 7@H with south, I would guess my p has the second diamond|pg||

nt|richie: hi Bas :)|pg||

nt|spenny80: with 5/5 11count and a major...|pg||
nt|richie: the more conservative approach in the open room is paying off so far|pg||
nt|richie: hello Marleen :) excited to watch your team?|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: right Vladimir|pg||

mb|1D|nt|loe48: its very fast to get out on thoose..but a cleat 1s opener imo|pg||
nt|loe48: clear|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: En interresant hand. |pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||
nt|neobas: due to the operator not having the file with the hand recrods, we will probably not be able to broadcast it on BBO, regretfully|pg||
nt|richie: these north hands are problematic in many systems: many points, no stopper, no 4+@S |pg||
nt|neobas: Not a good result for the Dutch in the OR|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|mrdct: whenever i open those sorts of hands i write down -110 5 minutes later|pg||
nt|frankaus: no of @S is an important factor|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|spenny80: here 4@s could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B4 2@HE as here.|pg||
nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|richie: Big score for the french again...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
mb|5D|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 slemmer står. @C - @D og NT.|pg||
nt|frankbo: tror han prøver med 6sp|pg||

nt|frankaus: i willl see if they are short elsewhere as there are 3 comment. here cu |pg||
nt|neobas: Surely W has a hand to get into the auction here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: this is a typical need to cash tricks contract..a slip and it makes|pg||
nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||

nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||

pc|h6|nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Seems u was right.|pg||
nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bebechira: defeating or making is a 4 imps difference|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: difficult to imagine for defence that E has such a bad hand...|pg||
nt|ntmon: exactly .. there danger comes from|pg||
nt|josj: and any mistake now will be fatal immediately|pg||
nt|spenny80: hi all|pg||

nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||

nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||

nt|richie: south will try a small @c I think|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|richie: it's good when partner either has @cT or J|pg||
pc|c5|nt|murat e: 4 hearts one off if defence can manage a spade ruff but unlikely|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s helped n/s but i think 3@s was the normal end|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|richie: even 10 tricks possible now!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|timve:  this contract is made now |pg||

nt|gio 89: missin AJ109 of trump|pg||

nt|spenny80: Final contract is not so bad at 26 cards.... at 52 is the worst|pg||

pc|hK|nt|spenny80: but is strange consider W hand as strong hand.... a natural bid is better when it can|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|ntmon: E might have tried 3NT instead of 4@D ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: could bid 3@h|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@H would give away too much i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5@d is long with a balance hand and only 5/3 trump |pg||

mb|2D!|nt|dagold: and England have avoided it|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed - the revealed points also pointed towards west holding @SQxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: another wild board! but very good result in open room for the Dutch, let's see if they find the "sacrifice" in spades here in EW|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|hawe45:  What is the link for results?|pg||
nt|ntmon: still Italy wins this half so far|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphpl5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 @D from East, even vulnerable, NOT everybodyÂ´s taste, and absolutely not mine! Actually it helps N/S to stay out of a hopeless 6 @S|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland leading by 7 imps after 4 brds vs Hungary|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@h or 2@s by east have merit here|pg||

nt|eleni: For results pls go to : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||

nt|spenny80: I prefer 2@s|pg||

nt|spenny80: good pass, very difficult for me to pass with W hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 2@h will surely have some @s tolerance or support|pg||
nt|richie: Hungary plays well, agressive style and putting lots of pressure - they made a pretty tough already for some top teams|pg||

pc|sA|nt|loe48: som vi ser 6 ruter er en fin kontrakt|pg||

pc|s7|nt|dagold: that should seal the deal|pg||
nt|asig: Killing led from Jones|pg||
nt|timve:  that is surprising|pg||

nt|athene: easy to find it :) start at the left of your hand and lead the first card you come to :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think there is a good case for @SJ seriously|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4th best from your longest and strongest berry(westra) always sais :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: her left is K@d :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: there was an article in one of the daily buletins in Poznan about minor/major leads vs 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I would lead club also |pg||
nt|tomi2: the double dummy analysis suggested spade leads from such holdings|pg||
nt|athene: a great deal depends how likely west is to have spades for a jump to 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and how likely east is to have five spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: declarer would have to work for the 9th trick.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|athene: but leading from 4-card suits is nowhere near as attractive as leading from 5-card suits|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: 4-card suits just don't beat 3nt|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bobholl: what now my love ?|pg||
nt|athene: east playing the diamonds in a mildly psychological way|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being that north might fly in with the @DK there if she had it|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts S in again |pg||
nt|athene: so you put in the nine and if it loses to the ten, you play south for the king|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm and standing for the running competitions|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile if you'd like to watch more then one table|pg||
nt|tomi2: after the opening lead south is likely to have no more than 3 dias, i think shw will bi 3334 in 80% of the time|pg||
nt|tomi2: so simply playing dia to the queen will ensure 3 tricks in that cases, now she risks to lose 2 tricks|pg||

nt|richie: Sigrid in east showed an invitational hand with 3+@s or a mild game forcing hand, maybe with 13 and a side suit she is too strong, on the other hand Magie in west could have bid ...|pg||

nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||

pc|d5|nt|rodal f: que|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||

nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hJ|nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||

nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||

nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||

nt|runnerup: should make also inspite off 4-1 distibution -10 nicely sing -but carefull you must be|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the dutch girls to grab the lead|pg||
nt|richie: how? :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2h 1d and 1c ...|pg||
nt|bebechira: can not do anything about it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ntmon: same start as in OR|pg||
nt|spenny80: you have not indication, have you?|pg||

nt|richie: french will grab extend their lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|loe48: helt grei 4s. med muligheter|pg||
nt|mrdct: runs into similar problems to 5@d but at least you only need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: revoke 4 clubs?|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
pc|hK|nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lucky|pg||
nt|mrdct: holding natural trumps tricks, not a good idea to lead a shortage|pg||
nt|spenny80: but better than 5@d|pg||
nt|spenny80: at 26 cards|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bebechira: bad news are coming now|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: but there is a danger that 3n or 5 clubs could get home|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: last board and comfortable win Polish team|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|richie: some kind of 3NT for the french without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: Nab in 1nt in the open room|pg||
