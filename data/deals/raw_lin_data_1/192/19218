pc|dT|pc|c5|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|pc|d6|nt|loe48: switch abit on values and 6 or even 7 is in range|pg||

nt|szalay:  this match wd be better with webcam, 3 of them cute for sure:) ok lets see bridge|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: I am sure you know the e/w players |pg||
nt|sybarra: we can ask Bas, re cuteness|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: I am glad to provide tableside commentary, but no comment on that one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  wise Bas |pg||
nt|sybarra: is this some funky multi?|pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay:  yes|pg||
mb|p!|an|Shows !D|nt|szalay:  I dont like multi, as u know|pg||
nt|szalay:  especially bad with this kinda agressive preempts|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not mind multi when it is disciplined,  this one is NOT |pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: Thizy has her Multi defence sheet on her lap|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: so does S bid clubs now?  that would show a bigger hand imo |pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|an|p/c|nt|sybarra: as undisciplined as E was, I am surprised she didnt bid 3 @D |pg||
nt|szalay:  cause she liked 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: Ormay is explaining X but seems to have some trouble to|pg||
nt|szalay:  thats ok|pg||

nt|vugraphzjt: Heya Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are into the fray here!|pg||
nt|szalay:  what was the reason for that?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: so much for 4 @H's |pg||
nt|szalay:  bad joke|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|eugenio123: hi johan|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: sorry I have yo comment in th open one lol bye|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  will EW find 4 Sp now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hi all:) I will comment, but in Polish - I m Ryszard Kielczewski|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ryskiel who will be commenting in Polish|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c puppet to 2@d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d4|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
mc|9|nt|gronkvist:  But W could always make it but it would be harder|pg||

nt|vugraphzjt: Not so much the Multi as the 3N bid. 3@D looked like a maker|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: remember that song, play that funky music.....   that hand reminded me of that song |pg||

mb|2H|nt|gronkvist:  who will be first to 2@h|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@h is 10-13 and 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as we need a bit BBO help here: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Walddk4: welcome to Martin Johnson|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: hi johan, spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ryskiel_: przychylne uk³ady dla WE - nawet 10 lew mo¿liwe|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Sr2@D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  S has shown 5+@h also|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gronkvist:  Even after a friendly lead, so has W much to do|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: grony wist odda³a Eggeling|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zagranie pika do waleta nie wygl¹da atrakcyjnie dla rozgrywajaæej|pg||
nt|loe48: as we see its not much communications between hands, now only dia ace and ruff to get to dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|gronkvist:  2@s for me|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|psyck: 1100's trickling into the scoresheet|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: They may target higher territories here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb:  this one should be 1400|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|loe48: a good guess by w|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|sT|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  hello Johan|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yes she did|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  only family as commentator|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@c was a good contract, 9 tricks were made after all :)|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds too biased|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Hi Tim|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|gronkvist:  S shows less then 7 HCP and 6+@h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: double of 1@S is alertable?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W loves to open 1 Nt on many hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||
nt|loe48: west is inviting to 3nt now with thoose 11 hps..as i personally would downgrade to bid 1nt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eugenio123: di nuovo dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  very optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: a very flat hand with lot of holes|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|psyck: maybe just misclickd alert|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  this board I would have bid 2@H with south hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|timverbeek:  but I play that as 8-11 5crd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north can not be expected to realize 4@H is cold, south had to bid again|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  More timidity from Ticha, who should bid 3@s after partner bids 2|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might do if NV|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Good pass bye east i think |pg||
nt|eugenio123: giocheranno lebenshol|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  U so right yuval|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: That was an averagish result|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@c fairly easy|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|gronkvist:  Its her sister in the other room|pg||
nt|loe48: she free bid 2s now..there must be a meaning by bid freely and pass|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  3N is down on accurate defense, but perhaps hard to avoid|pg||
nt|psyck: doing well to get there|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes if u could bid 1nt with a weak raise :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  2@c is nat or any strong hand|pg||
nt|possessed: 6cl not too far at this|pg||
nt|possessed: 4-1 club break a bad new|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Grönkvist suppressed her nice spade suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not such a good idea|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Jansma is wrong to bid 4N|pg||

mb|p|pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|henryb:  Can N find the @h10?|pg||
nt|athene: east might have dropped the @SJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: suggesting spade shortagein his hand and hence more heart length|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d is FG against the strong hand(if she has the strong one)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to follow other tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|eugenio123: good bid|pg||
nt|eugenio123: trump lead seems to be normal|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: South, of the other hand, can already be considered "Veteran". Ida Gronkvist is playing for Sweden in the European Championship for the 3rd time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: donno, looks too suspesious|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe|pg||

nt|eugenio123: it doesn't have any sense, if you want to do an aggressive lead  just choice between @h and @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: starting Jesolo, 2007|pg||
