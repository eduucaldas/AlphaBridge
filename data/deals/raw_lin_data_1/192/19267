mb|1S|nt|gronkvist:  who will be first to 2@h|pg||

mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: hi johan, spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2nt dovrebbe essere fit in mano debole, inevitabile 3nt da parte di sud credo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with north yes, less sure with east hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Need to play this by care it seems,|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: przychylne uk³ady dla WE - nawet 10 lew mo¿liwe|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@H is right sort of on this hand, but anti-percentage on balance|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yes|pg||
nt|pinticus: yesm10 iMPs board 1 for Italy and 1 iMP board 2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
nt|galois85: 9 tricks now for n/s, 6@d 2@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  only family as commentator|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@c was a good contract, 9 tricks were made after all :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Hi Tim|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|z_lasu: 2@d = majors|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|gronkvist:  S shows less then 7 HCP and 6+@h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: double of 1@S is alertable?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W loves to open 1 Nt on many hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||
nt|loe48: west is inviting to 3nt now with thoose 11 hps..as i personally would downgrade to bid 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: di nuovo dbl|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  very optimistic|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|psyck: maybe just misclickd alert|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  this board I would have bid 2@H with south hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but I play that as 8-11 5crd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north can not be expected to realize 4@H is cold, south had to bid again|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|henryb:  More timidity from Ticha, who should bid 3@s after partner bids 2|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might do if NV|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Good pass bye east i think |pg||
nt|eugenio123: giocheranno lebenshol|pg||

nt|rodal f: *Again|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  they would bid 3@h new trf|pg||
nt|possessed: hi all|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Some think S bid of 1@h  was weak|pg||
nt|loe48: as we see 1nt is hard enough to land here, and that should support my words|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  Ticha is the player who did not bid 3@d on 82|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  is it forcing?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|gronkvist:  But she knows her partner who loved to use X|pg||

mb|2H|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||

nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: both reds|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||

mb|4D|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks they are 5-3 he might just take the club finesse|pg||

nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess 2@S is @S+x and 3@D inviting to @S|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
mb|2S|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||

nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||

nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h2|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||

nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s3|mc|9|nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: slam was only likely if EW had 44 heart fit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cicus: seems like 5@S can be made here, declare in OR lost a trick somewhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|gronkvist:  So 1 1/2 match per day|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: last 2 boards|pg||
nt|cicus: probably playing on @Ds, not @Hs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: easy 4 @h|pg||
nt|cicus: easily the best play|pg||
nt|cicus: to let @DQ run|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|psyck: some would chose to play in NT with 4333 shape with W I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are the new leaders , but only 2.5 points ahead of the Israeli pair Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Safety to finesse that way|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|yuval10: can EW help their country-mare's cause?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: it is suggested that this should be taken in dummy and a @H led - but what if N ducks smoothly?|pg||
nt|szalay:  call hr magican|pg||
nt|szalay:  her|pg||
nt|szalay:  and give her Hermione role in next chapter|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, the @HK is not easy to duck although what will W hold to justify jumping to 3@H?|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw better to play Q: not so easy to duck|pg||
pc|d7|nt|henryb:  I have a kibitzer who says you should only play the 5-3 when the short hand has a ruffing value|pg||
nt|athene: west might have considered leaving 3nt with 4333 but his weak hearts perhaps were a worry|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure how good 3NT is with the natural @h lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|eugenio123: just a question of overtricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  another heart would give declarer problems|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gronkvist:  to late |pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: 3N would require dec to guess right which minor finesse to take|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9 tricks won't be a good success against 10 tricks in 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: 10 tricks not so easy in 4@s either|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|psyck: but he is on his way to it now|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @c prevent an overtrick,,,,if he plays @h declarer needs to jump with the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays @h then declarer is between top and bottom - K@h means 11 tricks and a top, low @h means 9 tricks and a bad score|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: but perhaps use extra diamond entry|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|yuval10: now she's in troubles|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 1 off if S plays @s's twice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|timverbeek:  yep|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes and 10 of @c|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: now only 10 with no @h tricks|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  aj|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's an opening for declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|timverbeek:  still guessing|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|yuval10: but she didn't convert this one too|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and luckily for south|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  west put the 10|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  declarer could have ruffed with the !|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  Q|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: but 10@H is a trick|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: north doesn't know declarer has the @CJ so his discards are not so obvious as they are to us|pg||
nt|yuval10: Ginossar-Pachtman surrended an overtrick here so 20% for them on the board|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and pitch a diamond on the heart|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S has AJX @s i'm not sure you can make it|pg||
