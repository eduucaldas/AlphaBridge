nt|smirny: but 3nt is too much i think|pg||
nt|andy_h: assuming no club ruffs looming I think the best play is a small trump from W (dummy). Obviously North would have a hard time ducking with Kx so if North plays low you stick in the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||
nt|andy_h: (I was talking about the trump play on the previous board)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D shows singleton @D..I guess|pg||
nt|eleni: a feature|pg||
nt|spenny80: but after 3 round in @s north MUST play @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: another part score hand, even for our agressive youth:)|pg||

nt|panja: 4@S might not turn out well...|pg||
nt|eleni: The Greek youngsters here, as they understand they are behind, they overbid, which is sad|pg||

nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|rodal f: EW was in for 800:) Swing it magistern.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: then 1@h bid would be real freestyler flight, but, as you say: just in case |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: we see another case here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: very intresting board |pg||
nt|desinka: and hard bidding and defance|pg||
nt|famus: @h slam coming up for the Hungarian girls|pg||
nt|panja: S has a good long minor this time|pg||
nt|panja: and North has the missing honour in that..so 3Nt will be easy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roussol: close to 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: this might worth  an IMP if 4@s+1 are made in the open room|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|rodal f: brb some kids.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot for Germany?|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 3@h|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again you see here a slam in Hearts possibly bid by NS |pg||
nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|desinka: 4@H?|pg||
nt|eleni: den xero poios apo tous 2 milaei agglika|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||
nt|athene: aces and shape always beat a bunch of kings and queens and jacks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y.|pg||
nt|spenny80: do you open with north cards? me not|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|desinka: so..]|pg||
nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||
nt|panja: let us say CJ goes to @CQ..|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Lina|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4@h is ok, but 5@c passed is excellent save  :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|raghavan: S denies Club control |pg||
pc|h3|nt|desinka: they may beat the contract|pg||
nt|desinka: but it is not easy |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: N must simply cash his 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double on the strength of the singleton diamond|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||
nt|bagman: Makes life easier in 3@H but would have killed 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and his ace in the side suit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: landed in slam|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EVERYONE--its boys here--thnks-Sisito--the VG operator corrected me--pardon me for this EVERYONE--thnks Sisito|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i wouldn't have thought of 6@D|pg||
nt|smirny: well it is hard to bid S hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42:  we cannot judge unless we know what exacly 3@S showed|pg||
nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|famus: 4@S rkc-5@hs showed 2+Q|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can take one diamond ruff and then set up the clubs losing one in each|pg||
nt|eleni: As you all know, John Oikonomopoulos is the son of Ghionis+Helena sp:) As we say in Greek "the apple falls under the apple tree" :)|pg||
nt|panja: on a bad day...@CJ could be from @CJx..|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lead direction, not invite to defence...|pg||
nt|rodal f: N will miss the @D after thid start|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: one problem is, he is not on lead, so if his partner has the unsupported @DA he might well not get his ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|eleni: Now that Mama-Lina is here I hope Peter will have better guesses:)|pg||

nt|rodal f: *this|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||
nt|helena sp:  good mornig to you all, good luck to our kids|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||

pc|s5|nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||

nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||

nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||

nt|eleni: This will give time to the open room to get closer to board 18-19, as they still are playing 16|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2SA shows @h fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: 21 hard on's at EW?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chmitty: probably 4 cards ?|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid 3@S with south|pg||
nt|athene: that would let north cause some trouble with his extra distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Artur already played for Norway, in the Nordic Championships recently|pg||
nt|loe48: what is fasinating with bridge is that the cards can be twisted in so many directions..so many possibilities..so the players do constantly have choises|pg||
mb|p|nt|stamkreas: the last 2 boards shopuld be flat, but we made par so we can celebrate already, Denmark is always a strong opponent!|pg||
nt|roussol: y are right stam:)|pg||
nt|alati: o vasilis me to dino idi exoun vgalei 2 mans sti 2i stis teleftees ntones..|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  active NS give them a hard time though|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: I dislike showing a two-suiter @s and a minor with a 6 cards @s suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or did N help a bit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|famus: @s partial|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: sometimes you can rebid spades to show the extra length|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: nice stop by NS - Souths 4333 hand didnt appeal to him|pg||
nt|eleni: nice contract by Peter, as W can never return another @s|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but were is the K@c?|pg||
nt|eleni: true, but only 1 way to be played and cross his fingers that the K is with W|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course he doesnt know also the @hA|pg||
nt|chrisky: he knows the A@h is in w|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  hard to find in this auction I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @CAx is golden|pg||
nt|andy_h: East, although the double fit is really good he is probably afraid of the lack of red-suit honours he had|pg||
nt|eleni: possible placing, yet not 100%|pg||
pc|d2|nt|alati: ara, den prokeitai na xasoume |pg||
nt|andy_h: If West had the same hand without the @HQ then slam is abysmal on a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S must be exclusion|pg||
nt|athene: so 5@H is two keys and the queen, and west will ask about @DK for seven maybe|pg||
nt|chmitty: would you stay silent with South's hand all the time ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roussol: mortensen is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|alati: kai kleinoume tin 1i mera me 38 vps|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: penultimate board here|pg||
nt|loe48: as we see this contract has no chanse..bu \t a fresh try|pg||
nt|chmitty: North to South : your lead partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess west decided that with @HAQ @CA @DK east was not just bidding 4@H over 3@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: Ish Delmonte preferred bidding 1Nt to bidding the very weak @h suit, which might be passed out in a 5-1 fit. I prefer @H myself, but I can see all 52 cards. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|roussol: sure is good|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|roussol: nice bid|pg||

nt|roussol: 10 of @c|pg||

nt|roussol: nice lead Q wins|pg||
nt|raghavan: I am fond  a Flannery 2D bid for both majors. a 2D bid for pre empt in diamond does not serve pirpose|pg||
nt|raghavan: purpose|pg||
pc|c2|nt|alati: afti i adam tou mikrou, evale idi ipopsifiotita gia vraveio tou prwta8limatos|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|roussol: my blood pressure is :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: With @C behind it became a auto|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roussol: 21|pg||
nt|athene: if south had bid 3@S over 2nt then EW might be trying to get a decent penalty out of 6@SX|pg||
pc|sK|nt|alati: nomizw oti i tixi mas girise tin plati |pg||
nt|chmitty: the save in 6@s would have cost what ? 800 ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Over 1@C openers that are less than 4 cards about 20 to 30% of the time, the need for a club stopper is regarded by some (not me) as a quaint and archaic concept.   |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the session coming up shortly. Many thanks again to Monika, great concentration!|pg||
nt|alati: alla fainetai oti o danos tou vlepei ta filla|pg||

nt|famus: last 2 bds might fetch a handful for the german boys|pg||
nt|loe48: brighter|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andy_h: Dare I say, maybe the solution is for West to open his hand 2@C even though it's generally not good to open 2 or 3-suiter hands with 2@C in fear of interference|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|h9|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
nt|athene: not sure, i guess something like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north could have doubled one of west's spade bids to emphasize his spade suit and try to wake his partner up|pg||
nt|chmitty: anyhow last hand now :) tx all and see you in a little more than 1 hour for the last match of the day @h:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you tomorrow|pg||

nt|spenny80: yess see you all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: ty Fabio and Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Germany has improved a litte getting 12 imp on Bd 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the match - many thanks to our excellent operator in Albena, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and congrats to the Swedish team on this win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  although this hand...|pg||
nt|andy_h: he could bid 4NT a two suited takeout*|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@s due to the extra spade|pg||
