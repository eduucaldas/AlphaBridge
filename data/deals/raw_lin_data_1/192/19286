nt|gracelin: A mis fitting hand to start.  Gu and Lu, though missed the 2009 Venice Cup win, won the 2010 world championmships in Philadelphia.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Lu and Gu play a very agressive style, which helped them to win tons of imps.  But here, their opponents are teaching them a lesson. |pg||

nt|gracelin: LP wang found a good lead by deduction, not spade, not Heart and not Diamond. The club lead would have been more powerful if suth had two hearts.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: either an early spade shift, or a passive defense here, will beat 3NT by 2 tricks|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: The slam will be good if East has 6-4 or 5-5 in her two suits.  West is not too enthusiastic as the opening is limited t 15 HCP.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East is pondering as she has a maximum 15 HCP and West showed slam interest with the 3H Cue.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but I think she will pass as there are some soft points |pg||
mb|4H!|nt|gracelin: WF Wang used to play with Liu in past world championships.  We see her playing with another wang, also a veteran, in this competition. |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: wonder if they play kick-back so that 4H is RKC for D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|gracelin: drrmd not.  4H is a cue and Gu honored partner's sign-off (though Lu may not mean that way).|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|gracelin: even 4NT is not a safe contract if south has HQ.|pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi Sveta, srry, missed yur ealier messag.  |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: the trouble is that even 4NT is not a sure thing.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  especially after foxy @sQ from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's described in each book falsecarding, but...|pg||
nt|gracelin: after the nex H stopper removed, declarer has better try to establish some club tricks rather than in other two sits.|pg||
nt|gracelin: north must win with the Q, or declarer will guess why south didn't take her SQ.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south has followed H10 on first trick, so north knows heart continuation will be safe.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c7|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: but she also knows declarer has 2 more stopped there, so was counting whether a more agrressive shift is called.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  N distribution is clear now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no more @h, 1 @s and 1 @c - wich one? |pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer should know north has SJ and HQ in her hand and only has one club left.  Playing CQ cater for south holding CKxx and KJx|pg||
nt|gracelin: the longer she thinks the more likely she will guess it right.|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe south should have kept her last Heart.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or N - drop the @hQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  keeping small one|pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: what north should bid over the 1D opening is interesting.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sveta:) U're right, 04,37 local time.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW may satisfy with just 200 in this partscore after @d ruffs|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  or even juicy 300|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: yes, North choose the wrong moment to overcall a 4-card major to wrong-sided the contract.|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  kind a contract where defense takes first tricks before declarer gets lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh! that's nice|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|gracelin: the 4-1 trump split will probably still sink the contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  but even this start wouldn't help N|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W will be endplayed with @s lead from the table|pg||
nt|gracelin: East may find a double over 4H which will make the lead of D3 more likely a singleton.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gracelin: still -2 if West can find the D ruffs.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe north's 1S already showed a distributional hand which prompted south to choose 5D rather than 3NT.|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6S is a good contract here but will go down with both major suit Ks wrng.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for pure percentage - wrong, but may be there were any clues?|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's true.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: in a strong field you wouldn't mind to go down in such good slam, because you know your opponents will be there, too.|pg||
