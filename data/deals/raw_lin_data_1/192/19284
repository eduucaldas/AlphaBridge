nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||

nt|liraren: anyone know anything about EW system please tell me|pg||
nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||

nt|ntmon: par here is 4@CX |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: only partials here -even thought -4 @s doens seem so bad |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 4@h seems a great contract for B-S|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the bad break|pg||
nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
mb|d|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably he will leadwith Q@h|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it is really lucky 4@h. i'd love to see it playing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with hearts 3-3 is ok for 10 it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: hi to everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: Hello Basilis:):)|pg||
nt|lady007: NS also have some chances in 5@d played by north. but it wont make today|pg||
nt|dkkello: He will make i comfort witout a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|ybob: not necessary after this lead ...|pg||
nt|frankbo: now 4 might makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: bye the way the result will be -1 , it's impossible to find the 7th trick|pg||
nt|eleni: Thx operator of this transmission:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D start will kill 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: doubled  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: as we don't exactly know what 3@S promises, it's not easy to tell who 'upgraded' - sure is 4@S has no play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree but still good save|pg||
nt|vasmar: hello|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 5 i think bill|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree with 1NT in 3:rd seat with 14 and a nice hand , harder for opps to deal with|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lady007: i think i would have passed with north but i wouldnt be happy about it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||

nt|tez: 27 puanla þlem..zor benim için|pg||
pc|c6|nt|possessed: 3sp probably means invitation with 4 card|pg||
nt|possessed: and balanced|pg||
nt|lady007: but even the king of club return wont give declarer an overtrick as he cant untangle his tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: especially as 4@h going down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI folks, sorry about the delay|pg||

nt|liraren: hi and welcome|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ntmon: good guess by declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lady007: maybe he could have tried to play another spade, in case partner has T9 of hearts|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, here comes one finesse|pg||
nt|lady007: oh no, wont help, he bid 3N so declarer will never play him for the stiff king|pg||
pc|cT|nt|arigun: zeynep'in eli zor, bu eli 1@d-1@s-3@c baslamak lazim belki, simdi gucunu anlatamamis olmanin heyecaniyla 3nt'ye birakamadi|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gmarco24: after A@d situation is pretty clear for declarer|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table east opened the bidding and then EW missed 4@h|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|juan lukas: push board |pg||
pc|sA|nt|lady007: not that it is a contract you want to be in when you only see 26 cards..... but it makes|pg||

nt|arigun: 1@h|pg||
nt|yusufb: atak sayýsý biraz garip|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Pass by S should show some interest in bidding ON -- with no interest he should have bid 3S immediately |pg||
nt|offthebend: and they have arrived in the right game contract |pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe 2@h could be brought home by EW|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, maybe. The Dutch EW are going to try that now :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  nice to have @H7|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|eleni: well Chris:) we said helpful:) not Christmas yet for Santa to be here:)|pg||
nt|chrisky: last chance|pg||
nt|offthebend: with 9-10 points and a 4-card S suit , one has to bid more than 1Spade over a T/O double of 1D :)|pg||
nt|liraren: with the first pass u can bid 2 @d with that kind of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: site for results http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i agree with subhash, you don't bid 2@d with only 4@s and say 2@h; if LHO bids 3@D you have to guess, may miss a cold 4@s or bid a ridiculous final contract|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eleni: now Q@s will give Stankovic  his discards|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course a @d ruff now, then a @cruff in hand and he is home|pg||

mb|2N|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||
nt|dkkello: Bergen raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||

nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||
nt|ybob: p p X ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, south has to move|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d played with 4-2 fit ew in other table --so both rooms in 2 @d|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||

nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||

nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||

nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||

mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||

nt|lady007: 9 tricks are no problem on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||

nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
pc|cK|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|_fonzie__:  after trick 1, i can imagine many cases where it is interesting to switch to clubs and many cases where you should play your singleton @d|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  but it shouldn't be a guess|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  with singleton heart in dummy, north should be able to indicate whether he holds something in clubs (Q or K) or not by playing his smallest or largest card|pg||

nt|mamos: ok in 5@d  not so in 6@d|pg||
nt|liraren: but east didnt trust him|pg||
nt|lady007: if declarer has KJx you probably have to give him a heart trick anyway and then you have to hope partner gets the lead before he has 9|pg||
nt|timve:  good board for the Dutch|pg||
nt|lady007: the queen also caters for Jx in dummy and is unlikely to cost a trick|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ntmon: making games, of course|pg||
nt|bmkl: it seems the 3nt bid worked fine for Croatia|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gmarco24: Q was a nice card for the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table North didnt bid 3@d and now has to decide over 3N if he still wants to mention them|pg||
nt|lady007: think it was better to bid 3@d immediatly and get it off your chest, so you dont have to guess later|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ntmon: anybody bidding @H by W?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H would not be my choice|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I like to play fitjumps AND splinters, hard to organise|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
nt|timve:  1NT with this hand is pretty agressive|pg||
nt|timve:  would you have bid it Marion?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @c tricks needed in this so small to QJxx-to avoid later quess in that suit here|pg||
nt|frankbo: need to find 9 in cl to makes this i thk|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south choses the best 3 card suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
nt|lady007: yes. i might have bid it as well, not wanting to miss a possible 4@h contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@d, @h to A@h, @d to K or...?|pg||
nt|runnerup: so handling as i sayed |pg||
nt|tez: 5@h diyecek..6 ya gelecekler|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tez: kestirmeden oldu|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||

nt|ahri:  i imagine french staying calm|pg||

nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
nt|arigun: bakalim 3@h yapabilecek mi .9|pg||
mb|3H|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||

nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|timve:  also that|pg||
nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: suprice lead and 7 first -@d and ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: There was called TD about previous board |pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: 4@D was made with hesitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||

nt|juan lukas: W can overruff the 3rd round in @h |pg||
nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
pc|s9|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||

nt|tez: diðer masa da sarýgozun 3@h e nasýl battýðýna inanmak zor|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
nt|tez: @s çaktýrmayý düþünüyorsa  büyük @s oynayarak|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
nt|tez: artýk 3@h tehlikeli|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||

nt|tez: ortaðýnýn ne dönmesi gerektiðini söylemeli|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||
nt|tez: hala @c kaybý duruyor..batacak|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like it a lot|pg||
pc|dT|nt|key1809: didnt unblock the dmds, hence 2 down|pg||
nt|eugenio123: :(|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  by the way, this hands perfectly demonstrates why you shouldn't have bid|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|ntmon: then 3NT is right|pg||

nt|juan lukas: X for the @s lead |pg||
nt|dkkello: i was told from reliabel sources 2 @C is natural |pg||
pc|dA|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, the defence may cash  a couple of @Hs first|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  so also 5@H here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: can see only S and W,the tray isnt here now|pg||

nt|lady007: and also for declarer|pg||

nt|lady007: east knows declarer wont have any more hearts (partner wont jump to 4@h on a doubleton) so only chance now is to lead a club. but which one?|pg||
nt|timve:  @CQ seems pretty obvious|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, so "i am in trick, what now? what now?"  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: is there a chance declarer will misguess if he has the jack? i guess not|pg||
nt|timve:  but indeed maybe you have to trick declarar|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or partner  :)|pg||
nt|timve:  he knows declarer has K J AK, probably he has @CJ|pg||

nt|ritong: wimp:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C stand out inmy view|pg||
nt|ritong: one more time, the fact that pard is a passed hand is a factor  way less chances to have 3 NT cold|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence had to be precise to beat it..|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|cicus: ah this must be an agreement I am seeing for the first time|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally the @h xxxx is not a huge bonus|pg||

nt|timve:  or would you have doublet|pg||
nt|timve:  doubled|pg||
nt|timve:  with A and K in the other suits|pg||
nt|lady007: i've seen Van Lankveld overcall on much weaker hands than this one, maybe the vulnerability scared him|pg||
nt|timve:  I think you can make a case for double|pg||
nt|lady007: yes i think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: i am told that 5 @h in open room was 3 down|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h looks makeable (2 hearts and a club loser)|pg||
nt|liraren: but then u have to start with the @c Q |pg||
mb|2N|nt|ntmon: turkish teams plays fien, steady game so far|pg||
nt|ntmon: fine*|pg||
nt|pinticus: yes,very regular pairs|pg||

mb|p|nt|key1809: E-W can make 5D, as i see it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt makes|pg||
nt|mamos: 6NT maybe even|pg||
nt|ritong: impatient to know what it is  a @c ask?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a @D transfer?|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt depence on lead -if @s -down but if you lead @h K-it makes -this has no future|pg||

nt|drkvas: sry|pg||
nt|liraren: i have learned the hard way that pd NEVER have the perfect cards :) so nowdays i dont hope for it |pg||
nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||
nt|liraren: y i mean Kx onside|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: agressive bidding all round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||

nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||

nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||

nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||

nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||

nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||

nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||

nt|lady007: lets see|pg||

pc|c6|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||

nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||
nt|dkkello: no :)|pg||

nt|chrisky: only 6-6 in minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: something like:)|pg||
nt|mamos: ansd a 17 count|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last board until the break |pg||
nt|cicus: 8 IMPs for us!|pg||
nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: gabor, behave!|pg||
nt|lady007: i think EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, also from honours so maybe east thought his partner had the queen|pg||
nt|timve:  thats a good explanation|pg||
nt|yusufb: ilkdevrenin son eli|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt oynanýr|pg||
nt|yusufb: aydin iyi atak yaptý ben yapmazdým @c A atagý|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  (and that partner's possible club strength is in shorter club hand... and ... and... :))|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: oops, was private :))|pg||
nt|ritong: np  eheh|pg||
nt|zlatan: after 2 sleepy boards time for some action|pg||
nt|eleni: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|zlatan: i wont be surprised if they reach 7 of a major|pg||
nt|eleni: Let us hope Finos choses 5@s:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Dinos|pg||
nt|zlatan: after double 7@s looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|zlatan: not 5 :)|pg||
nt|eleni: right Konstantine|pg||
nt|eleni: 6 maybe due to K@h?|pg||
nt|zlatan: 5nt i think he choose now|pg||
nt|zlatan: and then 6@s|pg||
nt|eleni: he may chose a 6@d bid though promising both|pg||
nt|tez: teþekkürler herkese..ikinci yarýda görüþürüz|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yusufb: 30 imp geriyiz fakat yetiþebiliriz |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW play transfers after 1-level overcall, but not after X ?|pg||
nt|cicus: no 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|eleni: there we go:)|pg||
nt|timve:  I played 2nd/4th, but this disadvantage is the reason I stopped playing it|pg||
nt|timve:  also its in more situations hard to read|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen@h@h Bonjour a Toutes et Tous@h@h|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt batýyo ama yaptýrýlabilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  Im back to good old attitude switch|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, don't speake too soon...|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
nt|eleni: now Basilis can not fail the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT defeat 10 @S anyway, declarer can duck or win but short by 1|pg||
nt|dkkello: hmm , sorry I was to soon :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice multi opening:)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
nt|yusufb: yaptýrcaklar inþallah yanýlýrým|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: and this may be the right contract whatever the OR result|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 off @d save this home even with @h lead-also @s 3-3 -and overtrick makeable now|pg||
nt|eleni: Now Pierre needs to attack @s and ruff twice, while he still has entry to his hand with @dA|pg||
nt|ni hao: a pretty bloody match-lots of imps:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: with this lie, has to continue to have a chance to take a trump trick|pg||
nt|yusufb: ernin eli 2@h pas demezdi|pg||
pc|h2|nt|zlatan: thats why i said 5nt as a try|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cicus: a spot-on remark from a kib: maybe W should have overtaken?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  if it's showing @s +@c in swedish style (thanks ukdorj) then it makes more sense to me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ni hao: sorry,private|pg||
nt|yusufb: yere antre yokmuþ sory:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: uyuyorum:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: 1@S told 3 @S+. Hhy W biided 1NT I don't know.|pg||

nt|runnerup: hi|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: it does not matter much as W's trumps could have been coup-ed|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: but that would not have gone without risk|pg||
nt|eleni: and good morning Todor, our great operator:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4@d sayýyorum ama yere geceri yokmuþ:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dkkello: why didnt he cleared @S ?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|key1809: but i can see many who wd open the hand 1nt, or open 1c, followed by 2nt|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yusufb: byeeee|pg||
pc|d2|mc|8|nt|ritong: "small @d please"|pg||
