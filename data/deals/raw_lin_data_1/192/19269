mb|4S|nt|spenny80: Italy 3rd vs Poland 2nd...|pg||
nt|rodal f: *specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: 2@h should make in comfort, so an easy start to the championships|pg||
nt|rodal f: A invitation? Positive or negative trail? Nope.|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably ew will play in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  9 lucky tricks E/! in a @S-contract|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@h in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|dagold: so going down|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Vladimir, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W|pg||
nt|dagold: In the other room north didn't sell out to 2@h|pg||
nt|richie: two strong pairs facing each other in this match, it will be interesting to watch I expect|pg||
nt|richie: hi Rodal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4s in the open room as well...so quiet start to a decisive match :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 ver - nine...?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Frank:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our teams this morning: The Netherlands are 1st and Italy 3rd, so it will be a thrilling match|pg||
nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we saw, NL use invitation jacoby.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: EW showed semi-forcing-to-game, NT range, E transferred to @H, W accepted|pg||
nt|josj: good morning eleni|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Vladimir|pg||
nt|ntmon: gm Eleni and Jos|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h good morning Jos:) welcome|pg||
nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankbo: :)|pg||
nt|richie: probably @s7, @sK and @dQ will be the best you can do as declarer and hope for something good|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hi all|pg||
nt|richie: hi Marion :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|oosb: Since AK@S are both with @S|pg||

nt|oosb: 11?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|uttam: y 11 becos of @c lay out|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Marion:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  Top on its ways to France (N/S)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sT|nt|eleni: but the contract is makeable, as the @h finess works:)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  WAS on tiÂ´s way...|pg||
nt|mrdct: she has a beer card too|pg||
nt|richie: 3x@h now and exit a low club will work (double dummy) hard to see with closed cards|pg||
nt|richie: not low club but 7 or 8|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table I think Rosaline Barendregt had to escape from 1@sX, it's usually bloody when opps pass a TO dbl on the 1 level, but not sure if 2@hX is such a big party|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  But still -100 should be good for N/S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|richie: straight forward line will succeed here, taking 1 rounds of trump and ruff 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c8|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Har d for S to find the @H lead?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||

pc|h6|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||
nt|loe48: jepp|pg||
nt|oosb: Could have*|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|frankbo: når den ordner seg blir det 12|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Operator, South's name is  Fisher|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bebechira: S in 2nt in the closed so we will have the first swing|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ER  missing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|loe48: auto 12|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be doubt in north's mind now about west hold 10x|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dagold: and easts is robertson|pg||
nt|ntmon: declar can to ruff two @H in hand an make the contract|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|richie: intesting line of play :) she's playing rather fast|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|richie: probably she did not play the K|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|eleni: good play by Judith:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ntmon: key play was a club to K in case E has less than 4 hearts |pg||
nt|eleni: she has to keep it up cross-ruffing though |pg||
nt|josj: what is (not) happening?|pg||
nt|eleni: Minko?|pg||
nt|eleni: what is happening pls?|pg||

pc|c2|mc|11|nt|tomi2: 5@D can be theoreticly beaten by a club ruff. Zmuda started well to lead a club|pg||

mb|1N|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||
nt|richie: depends if Magdalena Ticha decides to bid 2@c for majors, then it must be easy for east to bid 4@s?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk4: Fish got his  ER       time for Robert to get his   SON|pg||

mb|2H|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S makeable on a good trump guess|pg||
nt|richie: 2@hX is also profitable :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
mb|3C|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i can see the dutch girls lost 11 on 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
mb|3D|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re:)|pg||
nt|richie: we are back- apparently some conn problems in Albena|pg||
pc|h6|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||
nt|eleni: nowhere to discard the losing @h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His son is in the East seat|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|uttam: hi w/c|pg||
nt|oosb: Ah ! Hi |pg||

nt|richie: in fact the third one already|pg||
pc|c4|nt|richie: yes, the discards are interesting, but main problem was in the bidding|pg||
nt|bebechira: in fact on a club  switch..-2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bebechira: wow...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|murat e: also fourth diamond may be problem since spade finesse id wrong|pg||

nt|richie: same as France :) they have always been one of the top nations two - it's always exciting when they meet and show both quite natural but good bridge|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bebechira: easy 6nt|pg||

mb|3S|nt|the saint: Morning all|pg||

nt|rodal f: For de som vil følge flere bord: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||
nt|richie: 4@s is a make in NS, EW do well to "sacrifice"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H and @S home so a nice sac at 5@H.|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: det kommer nok 2nt naa|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS may stretch for a vul game here|pg||
nt|richie: partner opens 1@c and you hold this south hand :) you're not stopping under 6 anymore!|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: kolata did well not to interfere since he was on lead|pg||
nt|murat e: against 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close your eyes and play @C towards your Jack - and good luck, with @D-tricks in East|pg||
nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||
nt|spenny80: now in south?|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a little bit in the dark now with a nice preempt by west|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
pc|hA|nt|murat e: hmm we can do that seeing all four hands...|pg||
nt|loe48: og 4 ganger hj er vel normalt naa og 8 stikk|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be a steal here though|pg||
nt|bebechira: now it is even easier|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's best move is probably to pass this but normal action is 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
pc|h9|nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|murat e: club queen doubleton and partner jumps on us...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Several times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Frank Bogen:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: i admit i would probably lead a @C|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
pc|d5|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
pc|dK|nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
nt|richie: both north players bid 4NT, taking the initiative|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||
nt|richie: south obviously is looking for the @d cue|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|oosb: -2 now on a @d back|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||
pc|d3|nt|richie: seems to be too difficult, you have the majority of the points and quick tricks in defence - I have sympathy for not finding the sacrifice|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eleni: still if ducked twice.......|pg||
nt|richie: 6NT is a slightly better bid I think, to protect @dK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|uttam: well  west was not thinking|pg||
nt|spenny80: sometimes you can make 3NT (xxxxxx@c or like) but bidding a new double you don't arrive at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...flat board and next :)|pg||
nt|richie: small @d lead by Magdalena Ticha?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|dagold: Some players would overcall 1@s with the south hand but these Israeli players are very sound|pg||

mb|p|nt|gio 89: I may have competed to 2@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5c in the closed by W|pg||
nt|richie: or even 5, west has a strong hand (knowing partner is short in spades)|pg||
nt|richie: they play TO dbls... otherwise West could have X-ed, maybe east can X this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||
nt|josj: if 1@S already shows 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
nt|richie: horrible distribution for Claire (north), 3 down is the expected result|pg||
nt|marionmi:  JT9 looks attractive|pg||
nt|richie: I guess so, @d lead seems natural|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||
nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
nt|rodal f: A better color so natural lead.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||

nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|richie: now Sigrid (east) has time to establish her clubs - won't take too long|pg||
pc|c6|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... where?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||
nt|josj: even|pg||
nt|eleni: had Rosaline passed after the 2@h by Flavia, things would have been easieer for N-S|pg||
nt|spenny80: last board 3Nt was down 4 because south has played x@s tu the 9! I don't know why...|pg||

nt|gio 89: 110 for NS where EW can make 3@S|pg||

mb|3D|nt|timve:  normal 4@H by south|pg||
nt|ntmon: she might have excited with @DQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: exited *|pg||
nt|eleni: a really weak pre-empt, but then as they are not vul, it sure makes life difficult for E-W|pg||
nt|mrdct: disciplined 3rd seat pass by west|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 5c was a flat board...|pg||
nt|richie: firm preemptive action by Carole Puillet but very reasonable, only the 3-3 majors are against it |pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab only 3c in the closed and playing there|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: og ikke 3d krav til utgang|pg||
nt|spenny80: if someone open..|pg||
nt|mrdct: north may pass this out|pg||

nt|ntmon: defence was soft but i can imagine EW were happy to set the contract|pg||
nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||
nt|richie: good suit and green vs red are favouring this pressure bid - it's difficult for opps to exchange information but as we can see it did not work here|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 14 imps to israel on board 4 for making 3NX+2|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut må våre krav|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@C vulnerable is better with 6cards|pg||

nt|richie: or will North do some sacrificing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen from Ticha?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Tks:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|murat e: pass...|pg||
nt|murat e: 12 hcp and double fit on the bidding is too much for me to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D should be an easy winner here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gio 89: E should know that W must have 4@D|pg||
nt|gio 89: since she didn't bid 3@s over her double|pg||
nt|gio 89: and opps should have 9card fit in @H|pg||
pc|sT|nt|loe48: 3d er krav, derfor sier jeg at x kanskje er mer korrekt melding..og etter 3c. meld 3d som er invitt hand nu|pg||
nt|timve:  east west can maybe make 5@C|pg||
nt|timve:  but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  lets sea if E/W can defeat this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
nt|richie: South surely won't :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||

nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
nt|richie: wow! south really doubled... now things become interesting...|pg||
nt|richie: on board 5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
pc|s9|nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 OR ended 3@HSX|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a spade discard by Ticha|pg||
nt|timve:  and I think she will pitch a spade|pg||
nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  that might get expensive|pg||
nt|richie: likely to be -500|pg||
nt|richie: they led a trump which solved one problem|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  @H King seems to come from right hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 500 enough Y|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 ended 2NTN-1 and 11IMP to Norway|pg||
pc|d7|nt|richie: but lots of work to do, Sigrid (east) is probably happy to see @HK (I would :))|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|murat e: draw trumps play a heart north takes and must exit with another heart|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|timve:  yeah always hard to see for east|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ok, then its not THAT expensive since 3N made here. but on the other hand, they surely would have found the killing lead so they lost a chance for a big pickup|pg||
pc|c9|nt|richie: @d for 1 looser: you have to guess which of your opponents has Honour doubleton: either play small to JTx or play J|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  We have been told, that West can always make 4 ! S - I call it double-dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: Although theres always the possibility that pd has a bust hand, and you get dbled.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankbo: den var ikke bra|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I'm not sure, but would not mind an upgrade with 2 tens|pg||
nt|uttam: -2|pg||
nt|josj: -1, next|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S  a normal outcome of this deal|pg||
nt|gio 89: if E menages to hold it to -3/4 it could be a push since NS should make 4@H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eleni: -1 is a good score for Italy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bebechira: welcome to Bas van Beijesterveld|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h and 3@h were a bit too much...|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  South could have counted the hand out and got a second undertrick safely there, but in a long event it is often far less strain to just get the contract down|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  (on the other hand, this is really the final so expending more energy is probably a good thing)|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|paulg:  did West want a spade lead?|pg||
nt|tomi2: winning something like 2 or 3 imps on rethinking in the end position is a nice effort. If i get 2 imps everytime I think I would be world champion|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|tomi2: if partner had the spade king this might be the needed entry to get 2 @D ruffs this spade trick and one outside trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hajru:  Yes, I think that there are more useful meanings for X of 3@s|pg||

mb|2S|nt|rodal f: En interresant hand. |pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||
nt|neobas: due to the operator not having the file with the hand recrods, we will probably not be able to broadcast it on BBO, regretfully|pg||
nt|richie: these north hands are problematic in many systems: many points, no stopper, no 4+@S |pg||
nt|neobas: Not a good result for the Dutch in the OR|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrdct: whenever i open those sorts of hands i write down -110 5 minutes later|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: B4 2@HE as here.|pg||
nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|richie: Big score for the french again...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
nt|richie: I guess Magdalena (west) will lead a trump|pg||
pc|h3|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
nt|marionmi:  now what will Ticha lead? ace of spades, trying to shorten declarer? a trump to prevent the ruffs?|pg||
nt|richie: it's often good with 4 small trumps to lead them|pg||
nt|marionmi:  you know her better than i do :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 2NTW and a swing to come.|pg||
nt|richie: we made it to some kind of rule :) 4 small trumps = trump lead|pg||
nt|marionmi:  a lot of bad breaks here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||

nt|neobas: Surely W has a hand to get into the auction here|pg||
nt|richie: depends on your perspective|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||

nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
nt|marionmi:  how should she play? win in hand and play a spade?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||

nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
nt|richie: I guess you could better try to ruff 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or take in dummy and start playing clubs right away?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|richie: I would try for that, and establish diamonds as we go|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but then you have to win a high heart in dummy right away and you may have to ruff 1 or 2 spades with your high trumps in hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ruff one seems to be enough for =|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am wrong it seems:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
nt|richie: that's also true- maybe @sJ9 stops the spades a bit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
pc|s7|nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Seems u was right.|pg||
nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bebechira: defeating or making is a 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|richie: @s2 is disappointing... another trump would have worked better|pg||
nt|marionmi:  would easts diamonds be count? should be lavinthal maybe|pg||
nt|richie: they show count|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR the NT ended -1|pg||
nt|richie: small swing|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: difficult to imagine for defence that E has such a bad hand...|pg||
nt|ntmon: exactly .. there danger comes from|pg||
nt|josj: and any mistake now will be fatal immediately|pg||
nt|spenny80: hi all|pg||
nt|eleni: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|eleni: welcome@h|pg||
nt|josj: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|spenny80: thanks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|loe48: there the slip came..he didnt want to listen to his pd's signal of switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C10 should have been a nice warning.|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I meant|pg||
nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: need @c back to beat|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: of course, we know .. she should take it and play @DA  .. but ..|pg||
nt|eleni: probably never heard of the rule "3rd high" and never rescue your partner either:)|pg||
nt|richie: big swing at stake here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well 5 here and 5 there make 10 for me:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Just looks like a totally normal auction|pg||
nt|loe48: det staar paa at en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|richie: it seems they did not have this tool of 1@s so rosaline Barendregt decided for 2@c|pg||
nt|richie: now the problem is solved|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...8 tricks for the taking... and 1 imp for France|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankbo: der håkon og lars spillte 3N minus fire meldte det 7kl dbl med 800|pg||

nt|mrdct: all that remains for the defence now is to duck one round of @d|pg||

nt|mrdct: at least 3 now :)|pg||
nt|spenny80: lol|pg||

mb|p|nt|murat e: club lead made last board interesting u are right|pg||
nt|loe48: yes club 10 was a clear warning..no more club now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Spillemeldig ser det ut som.|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 2@c?|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice of Magda Ticha in OR to stop low|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: han har 7 stikk, saa er grei nok 3h..man regner alltid med litt hjelp fra makker|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: her blir det noen beter ja|pg||
nt|loe48: ja hjerter ut her hadde gjort susen|pg||
nt|rodal f: Netherland got one IMP at B4 2@HE+1 here and = at OR|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT is very thin, 2NT will be hard enough :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  This is now a 5 @C X for 300|pg||
nt|spenny80: reasonable bidding|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|richie: yes but I think even the other 3 countries (Sweden, France and Italy) have a chance for silver or even gold when they perform well in the next three matches - they all play against ...|pg||
nt|richie: each other|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think i would like 2@s here better by east than 2n, then you make partner aware of your spade shortness |pg||
nt|marionmi:  she doesnt need to have a very good spade stopper for a 1 level nt bid|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, usually 1nt is more like 8-10 in this situation|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: getting @s right will be helpful and if you can get east to open-up the @d suit you are in good shape|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but she does have nice heart honours|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankbo: tar nok en desperadokutt i rut|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ntmon: here Flavia not so cautious|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c is strange I think is gazzilli but she isn't strong...|pg||
nt|josj: maybe she thinks she is...|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe :)|pg||
nt|richie: slam on a finesse - both tables stay out of it |pg||
nt|bebechira: W had a very good hand...depending on what 4s was|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i doubt this contract will make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|asig: North will be disappointed when he discovers the trump split|pg||
pc|s8|nt|frankbo: god skift|pg||
nt|oosb: top 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3N may be bid now though..|pg||
nt|richie: and another small swing... here west may make 8 or 9 tricks, after this lead and lucky singleton @dQ|pg||
nt|richie: south will try a small @c I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|richie: me too but we can never be sure|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|richie: it's good when partner either has @cT or J|pg||
pc|s2|nt|murat e: 4 hearts one off if defence can manage a spade ruff but unlikely|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s helped n/s but i think 3@s was the normal end|pg||
nt|mrdct: east may need to unblock the @cK to avoid being endplayed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|richie: even 10 tricks possible now!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|timve:  this contract is made now |pg||
nt|spenny80: I think with 3@d she has show 5/5 strong|pg||
nt|josj: 5-5 is right|pg||
nt|gio 89: NS landed in an unmakebla slam|pg||
nt|gio 89: missin AJ109 of trump|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ntmon: wonder if they have method to show medium 5-5|pg||
nt|spenny80: Final contract is not so bad at 26 cards.... at 52 is the worst|pg||
nt|josj: I doubt it...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|spenny80: but is strange consider W hand as strong hand.... a natural bid is better when it can|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|asig: 6@d slightly better contract because of the trump suit quality|pg||

nt|oosb: board 5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|loe48: han tok den rett vei, men bogen er ogsaa kort i spar, saa ikke mye glede av den finessen|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|loe48: bogen signaliserer spar naa|pg||
nt|ntmon: E might have tried 3NT instead of 4@D ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: could bid 3@h|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@H would give away too much i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5@d is long with a balance hand and only 5/3 trump |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|spenny80: :O|pg||

nt|eleni: For results pls go to : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||

nt|spenny80: I prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  this contract will make, but 2@s might make as well|pg||
nt|richie: pass over 1@d by west looks strange but her philosophy is that an overcall should be useful for the lead, @sA9xxx is worse than @sKT9xx, then she would surely overcall|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|asig: I think I would have upgraded the South hand|pg||

nt|oosb: Both black aces are friendly|pg||
nt|spenny80: good pass, very difficult for me to pass with W hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 2@h will surely have some @s tolerance or support|pg||
nt|richie: Hungary plays well, agressive style and putting lots of pressure - they made a pretty tough already for some top teams|pg||
nt|marionmi:  NS can also make 3@d but it wil be difficult to get there after the 1@c opening from north|pg||

nt|loe48: then 3c-3d|pg||
nt|richie: yes, look at the other matches: Poland will play Italy, Netherlands, France and Netherlands will play France, Poland Sweden |pg||
nt|bebechira: i play some sort of multi|pg||
nt|richie: you can say whatever you want, but it's not boring|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: scotland has opened their a/c|pg||
nt|richie: I prefer 3@h|pg||
nt|bebechira: we integrated in precision|pg||
nt|richie: ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|richie: I think they looked at the results two years ago and scheduled accordingly: in the last match no 1 and 2 meet (Poland and France), no 3 and 4 (Netherlands and Sweden) etc|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...Friday and Saturday will be a feast|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|murat e: 4 of a major too high for both|pg||
nt|asig: NS may bid 4@h on this one|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice 5 @d but because ew om board -cards well placed and makes :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: can may 6@c or 6@s here if you are good at dropping Qs offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I say that North should nt take bidding to shes hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: and go 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. 6@S-1 i OR og 17IMP til Belgia.|pg||
nt|loe48: med 2 langfarver so i den 6nt de meldte her er beste kontrakt alltid  6nt..for det er nok en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as def slipped at 1!NX made 7 and Netherland back in the lead.|pg||
nt|ntmon: large gain for Italy, now match almost close|pg||
nt|spenny80: they don't play polish club?|pg||
nt|mrdct: assuming the dbl promises 4@s (i have no idea if it does)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure|pg||
mb|1N|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i heard polish club is out of favour with a lot of the juniors these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile Hungary has a small margin (40- 11 imps) over Sweden, no 3 at this moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: east must avoid spade lead though|pg||
nt|oosb: Is everyone bidding 3@H here?|pg||
nt|uttam: 4h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure after the x..|pg||
nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||
nt|oosb: So I might lose imps in this deal, but I pass as West|pg||
nt|spenny80: really?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i meant by south|pg||
nt|richie: straightforward 3NT, @hK is protected so it should  not be very problematic|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: no, well done|pg||
nt|loe48: saa 6 spar er prosentmessig mye daarligere|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|spenny80: 3@d i think is forcing...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|richie: in 1NT you count 7 tricks when you manage to make 3 spade tricks, best line would be to attack them a.s.a.p. and leave the heart suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: I hope so :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bebechira: thu we have 17.18, fri 19.20 and sat 21 isn't it?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|murat e: oh|pg||
nt|spenny80: lol|pg||
pc|s8|nt|loe48: 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's better not to test partner here, being a passed hand |pg||
nt|josj: defence can take 4 tricks at most on this layout|pg||
nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
nt|richie: good question by one of the kibs, where should EW have entered the auction on board 25? I have no idea... maybe 3@d overcall by east when you play it as preemptive|pg||
pc|s9|nt|timve:  good contract, but normally going off|pg||
nt|richie: aha! for the juniors!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes ... :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No more comments to-day - this is too much|pg||

nt|ntmon: such a splendid outcome ..|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c are 4/4 or Aces is in north (with Axx in south probably she takes on 1st round)|pg||

nt|josj: Judith?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Netherland picked up a new 6 IMPer at B8|pg||

mb|p|nt|richie: 5@s 5m|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|loe48: we need some action here now|pg||
nt|richie: it's a very low scoring match - usually I need a calculator when the dutch were playing :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: action here for sure lol|pg||
nt|richie: crazy hands this session :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Enig Frank, etter reversen fra N. Stil og avtaler i makkerparet, men...|pg||
nt|oosb: that was quick :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I can see it though|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|runnerup: 3nt with @d guess or lead here|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c = gazzilli|pg||
nt|richie: south has a lot of trumps, but that's all, I guess she will pass in these vulnerabilities, north may dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 2@d positive|pg||
nt|richie: no, passing wisely|pg||
nt|bebechira: n will double|pg||
nt|bebechira: oops...she didn't|pg||
nt|richie: just made, good result for the French girls Carole and  Claire, they avoided any tragedies|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: incredibil.... N is playing in 4s in the closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: som GEO sier, 4 rut må være cue med hj, kanskje beste varianten|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c in east and 3NT by west is my guess - but 2@s is also possible of course|pg||
pc|sK|nt|timve:  hmm with north you would like to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  double as t/o is the way to do it|pg||
nt|timve:  also 2NT cannot be natural in this situation|pg||
nt|timve:  north is thinking about it|pg||
nt|timve:  3@D is down one|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c = 5/4 (not 6/4 not 5/5)|pg||
nt|spenny80: strong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 1Nt is better the dbl|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be expecting 4@h from west|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|richie: you need some tricks to make this contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|timve:  at the other table a very nice lead from Barendregt on board 10 |pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2@h will play OK|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s? :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Puppet on so 5@Ss|pg||
nt|timve:  defeating the contract instantly|pg||
nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: west does have a hand better for playing in a suit contract|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|spenny80: probably with 3@c denies 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: but i'm not sure|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she will make some tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Kanskje GEO vil hjelpe oss litt? Velkommen.|pg||
nt|loe48: 4h and 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|frankbo: will bidd 6 now|pg||
nt|frankbo: 1 down|pg||
nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
nt|richie: small @c to K and 3 rounds of clubs, then @dA and diamond? maybe north is tempted to jump by Q|pg||
nt|marionmi:  around 8 is my guess|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes but even that isnt enough if north keeps her spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, south has 3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||
nt|richie: are you kidding me?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  what should she discard on the 3 clubs? a diamond, a heart and a spade?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|loe48: if he raise club ace it makes|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 5@c i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: little try|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... big misunderstanding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dagold: he had to decide how likely it is pard has a good hand with clubs when holding Qxx himself. not so unreasonable to pass imo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ikke tid. Synd.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y or H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|frankbo: well|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even not by raising @CA u have a squize endplay.|pg||
nt|frankbo: could still endplay E|pg||
nt|loe48: still possibilities id say|pg||
nt|loe48: draw 9 cards in spade and dia..so whats left|pg||
nt|ntmon: still tempting for W|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult for W not accept|pg||
nt|richie: yes, probably - even 2 hearts is OK|pg||
nt|richie: you can see that dummy is inaccessible|pg||
pc|c3|nt|josj: can W be sure of 2 aces opposite?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|ntmon: italian girls are well prepared concerning bidding system - my conclusion|pg||
nt|richie: I don't know the leads well enough, could @sT be from AJT? I guess not... |pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup: ok thats for that game nice peaceful a couple off down like 2 ..|pg||
nt|loe48: east need to blank club ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Welcome back from space:)|pg||
nt|eleni: well stopped by W|pg||
nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am not kidding you...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: 3NT probably plays quite well though with the @d suit sitting nicely|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|richie: problems are solved now, 9 tricks in the pocket|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|richie: maybe if she manages to make 6 tricks they will win 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: weired bidding as well|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb:  One should ask for unblock or count, the other for attitude|pg||

nt|frankbo: kl så er han vel trumfmatt|pg||
nt|loe48: har vi noe sluttkontrakt i spill 9?|pg||
nt|frankbo: nei|pg||
nt|josj: is 6@C such a bad proposition if @H are 4-3?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||

pc|c6|nt|frankbo: den kl 3 kan lure begge spillerne|pg||
nt|rodal f: The normal anyway is a hook in @H. No special signals.|pg||
nt|loe48: i mean draw spades and dias..look for possibilities..a hook is often to simple to just do|pg||
nt|loe48: you get valuable info|pg||
nt|loe48: that might make you change foot|pg||
nt|frankbo: drar han alle korta til bunns kan Ø kaste kl ess for ikke å bli innspillt|pg||
nt|loe48: da har han 12|pg||
nt|loe48: saa johansen..dra ned en trump til du|pg||
nt|spenny80: but with @h 4-3 is good slam...|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe pitch @dQ here to put some doubt in declarer's mind|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|josj: well, maybe not if @C 4-1|pg||
nt|spenny80: not sure...|pg||
nt|spenny80: could be the same|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|timve:  well no problems in 2@H|pg||

pc|s7|nt|frankbo: 6 rut|pg||

nt|richie: that would shut out NS bidding completely |pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, 1@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosb: Another example of a pushy dbl|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes, but isn't mp|pg||

nt|mrdct: some goods 10s and 9s|pg||
nt|richie: horrible hands!! they open multi and EW face these hands... |pg||
nt|richie: dbl probably and then 5@d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but south will bid something, wont she?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, and then its up to north|pg||
nt|marionmi:  who hasnt shown any suit yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I can only agree :)|pg||
nt|richie: north will just do 5@s, solid enough|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ticha trying to trap the opponents?|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: 3@c now and then 3NT would work well and is likely  to happen|pg||

nt|spenny80: 6@d?|pg||
nt|josj: -2 I think|pg||
nt|richie: maybe:)|pg||

nt|marionmi:  north didnt take this opportunity to bid her spades|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ryskiel_: spade lead?|pg||

nt|marionmi:  4d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
mb|4S|nt|runnerup: 3 times @c gives defence a chance|pg||

nt|mrdct: 1NT by EW likely contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: tes 3 tricks scored.... you hoped for 6|pg||
nt|bebechira: new leader|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: B9 Netherland picked up a new 6IMPer. Norway need to fight well now.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, hold on, this 4 have just passed a hand out|pg||
nt|spenny80: better 4@s in west else 5@d....|pg||
nt|richie: declarer has to take care of her communication - she can pick up 4@h tricks but needs to be careful with her @d entry|pg||
nt|richie: 4@d is again a bit modest, the void in @h doesn't encourage her I think|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yeah but still|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: 3 dia is the best spot but how to get there|pg||
nt|spenny80: but here is the same|pg||
nt|spenny80: normal|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably the same outcome if south did open|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  1N somehow showed hearts?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@dX is my guess, bidding went slow enough |pg||
mb|5H!|nt|murat e: not possible w standart bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: good play|pg||
nt|murat e: covering costs a trick|pg||
nt|murat e: some spec suggests 2 dia instead of 2 sp but matchpoint bidding is not that way|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|timve:  if declarer takes in her hand|pg||
mb|5S|nt|henryb:  Looks like there is a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|richie: 5@s is down on a @h lead, bridge can be a funny game|pg||
nt|richie: but 6@d makes and would therefore be a good sacrifice :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: In Italy spades are like cross|pg||

nt|spenny80: how possible?|pg||
nt|josj: don't think so :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: but well done to make 1N here|pg||
nt|bebechira: France having a missunderstanding in the closed |pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: E in 4s at the moment|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|oosb: 2NT showing @H + @D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I am not sure 2N says hearts...|pg||
nt|spenny80: ok correct|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s not a ridiculous spot here|pg||
nt|richie: Poland doing extremely well, even scoring big numbers against the top countries|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: also 3 nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 to go|pg||
nt|bebechira: dbl now|pg||

nt|josj: easy make :)|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult|pg||
nt|richie: yes, clear penalty dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B11. Same open same X but S bidded 3@H where S passed here. 3@S came and pass around.|pg||
nt|spenny80: dou you rebid in W now?|pg||
nt|richie: that's sad for them, two bad boards in a row doesn't give much confidence|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  12 or 13...|pg||

nt|timve:  wow|pg||

nt|timve:  but 6@S has also a chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not a friendly layout in @d today|pg||
nt|spenny80: I bet 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: can you bid 3nt that is the question here |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...well this is ok for EW, surely|pg||
nt|bebechira: lovely Sigrid did not want to penalize North|pg||
nt|richie: lol:)|pg||
nt|richie: it's not even down that much after a (normal) spade lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Well I've seen a variant where it's @D + Major?  But standard unusual 2NT is @D + @H|pg||
nt|marionmi:  "small" accident happened on the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Chicken - or?|pg||
nt|frankbo: da var de for høyt|pg||
nt|bebechira: E in 5h at the moment|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT denies 3@s so 3@c is not needed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|asig: 5@c is also making|pg||
nt|spenny80: urca|pg||
nt|spenny80: aggressive bid|pg||

nt|richie: lol:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hawe45:  @D-ruff brings nothing here - defense needs the @S 9 also|pg||
nt|asig: 6@s a good contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: ..sorry thought you meant this hand..|pg||
nt|oosb: I Like 3@D here as barrage|pg||
nt|oosb: Tony I havent had that much to drink... yet :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 12 imps on brd 13... |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|hawe45:  No @D-lead now...|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c is showing a shortness, not exactly the hand she has, but what to do when you have doubt about 4@s?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Undo again?:) Pass and 3@S E|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No way to the 11th trick here, I hink|pg||
nt|rodal f: Likevel var det en kontrakt de fleste ville vert i.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like only 2 losers in 5@d but the 4-1 trump break is hard to manage|pg||
mb|4H|nt|spenny80: 2@d minimum w/o 4@h|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@h relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ser det. 6@C=|pg||
nt|loe48: replay here|pg||
nt|timve:  an easy 4@S |pg||
nt|spenny80: I bid 3Nt not 2@c|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s 4+@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: It's a bors for NT, 2 or 3 is little difference|pg||
nt|josj: hoping all the tens will come in, Fabio?|pg||
nt|spenny80: and with 3 10 i prefer more 3nt|pg||
nt|richie: normal 4h but no chance after the excellent diamond lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep|pg||
nt|richie: 3@cX = I want to lead this suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: But may be hard to find|pg||
nt|loe48: ja, systemet er ikke saa godt at de faar vist trumf 10|pg||
nt|loe48: som ville vaert et noekkelkort her|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west has opened only 1 club, perhaps because of his spade holding...|pg||
nt|josj: but I agree in a way: 2nt makes no sense here...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2nt relay|pg||
nt|bebechira: french girls in 2s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. Right end.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|asig: Well, QED|pg||
nt|runnerup: should make also inspite off 4-1 distibution -10 nicely sing -but carefull you must be|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the dutch girls to grab the lead|pg||
nt|richie: how? :)|pg||
nt|richie: easy board|pg||
nt|marionmi:  pretty risky 3@s bid by north :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead, still Ticha will make at least 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2h 1d and 1c ...|pg||
nt|bebechira: can not do anything about it|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ntmon: same start as in OR|pg||
nt|spenny80: you have not indication, have you?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: many flat boards though...|pg||
nt|bebechira: they will concede the first 4 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|dagold: Israel playing in 1@c on 14 after east didn't respond|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s it is|pg||
nt|richie: french will grab extend their lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|loe48: helt grei 4s. med muligheter|pg||
nt|mrdct: runs into similar problems to 5@d but at least you only need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: revoke 4 clubs?|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
pc|sA|nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lucky|pg||
nt|mrdct: holding natural trumps tricks, not a good idea to lead a shortage|pg||
nt|spenny80: but better than 5@d|pg||
nt|spenny80: at 26 cards|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bebechira: bad news are coming now|pg||
nt|richie: good news is that they play the same board in open room :)|pg||
