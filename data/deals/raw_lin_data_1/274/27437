nt|kareno: :) was wondering about those 14 card hands, Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  NS Drijver-Brink   EW Morten[father] - Dennis  Bilde|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  We also have voice commentary in this room  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743  for instructions if you are not familiar with the voice procedure|pg||
nt|kareno: Roland :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fallout from 1@C structure   1@D/@H/@S openings for NS are [usually] unbalanced|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@s on for n/s even with (best) spade lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they'll take some rounds of bidding to get there|pg||
nt|phil:  they may not be allowed to play 4@s (good morning everyone!)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some asking about OPENING 4@S     yuk|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: players are discussing their CCs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other table or access voice commentary for our room without logging in using  www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: That's possible Phil, but east will be dragged kicking and screaming if west insists|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Drijver did open 4@S   playing 5@SX|pg||
nt|phil:  the Dutch seem to favor wide ranging 4M openings|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@s not a bad bid with 11 decent looking black cards.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this just looks to have too much slam potential 1st seat|pg||
nt|kareno: Don't get the double, though.  Nobody has spade tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S   Welland has choice to force to game [1N] or show 3-fit, 9-13 [2@H]|pg||
nt|kareno: We'll have to wait for the opening bid - slam potential yes but no defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 10@S  Dennis B led @H9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10@S = 5@SX   you'd know that if you ever went to college and cut class to turn cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I did half of those things, Al.  We didn't have a student union so not the latter|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  not that you are recommending that Al to our junior listeners... :)|pg||
nt|phil:  expect 4N from Dan|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well   i'm 1 for 1      can't get more wrong than that|pg||
nt|agumperz:  Do as I say, not as I did, thats MY motto ;)|pg||
nt|kareno: Andy, the number of great bridge players who fell out of Cornell might indicate a recommendation :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N or DBL??|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure he'll step in - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N would show ANY 2-suits, not just minors|pg||
nt|kareno: 4n - two places to play|pg||
mb|4N|an|2-3 suits|nt|phil:  and if Sabine doubles - lets hope they've discussed 5@c :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: Showing some defense outside of spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: historically  DBL pretty penalty oriented   but that has evolved   especially in balancing seat|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5S|nt|phil:  Ive wondered here if pass by Bathurst should be "pick" and 5@c = real suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it should be as you describe Phil|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|phil:  but would you have the guts to ride it out with 55 in the reds? |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: obligated to lead a 9 when holding all 4|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like the same result - east won't bid again - unless Welland raises the stakes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  A trump lead allows declarer to make six :)|pg||
nt|phil:  lot to be said for a trump lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: unlikely to get in to play 2nd trump -- Bathurst probably didn't even think about that lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Both diamonds in the pocket|pg||
nt|Henryb:  After three hearts and a diamond pitch, declarer has some problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't he ruff all @C then?|pg||
nt|Henryb:  The @s9 comes into play|pg||
nt|kareno: True.  The nine of spades can become very strong very fast.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@S probably any slam try in @H|pg||
nt|kit: After a 1@H opening East would splinter, and then reaching the slam would be trivial.|pg||

nt|kareno: Well, they're off to the races|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|an|0-3|mb|p|mb|5C|an|Q ask|nt|Henryb:  it could be that 3@s is "Goldmanesque" and shows a stiff and a slam try|pg||

nt|kit: They did well.  But if West had more wastage in spades slam might not have been so good -- and they had no way to find that out.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the psychic lead director transfer response|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: imaginative semi-psyche by Welland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "imaginative" is commonly used as description of Roy Welland's bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and opening leads|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  My comment on Roy was that he always finds a bid; whether that bid corresponds with the hand he has is accidental|pg||
nt|kit: Interestingly enough, a heart lead may be most effective lead, but will Welland believe that?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: Rusinow [2nd of touching honors]  holding 4+ suit   std honors with 2/3|pg||
nt|kit: The race for tricks is on.  Given time, declarer can get 1 spade, 2 hearts, 3 diamonds, and 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink led @CJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: +4???|pg||
nt|kit: But if the defense gets hearts going, they may get 2 hearts, 2 spades, and 1 diamond first.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or making 4|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I know the play went fast, but would you check that result please|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E & N discussing leads & carding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar -- that's a change i hope bbo will make to vugraph operator's software .... someday|pg||
nt|kit: might have been queen of diamonds off dummy, ducked, and then possibly 4 diamond tricks.|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I suspect that the hand has not yet been played|pg||
