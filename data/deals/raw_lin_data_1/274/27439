mb|p|an|forcing|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other ways to show mixed -- and with weaker hand bid higher faster|pg||

nt|dkkello:  yes , good friends , he just had a couple of new lungs 2 months ago|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@S ok (not totally clear) if pass was forcing, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: point being  on previous board if 2N can be only invite   Zagorin's PASS should NOT be forcing|pg||
nt|Dinos1: NF even at 5th level?|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: only play forcing passes in you side bid GF (not only bid game) is a common rule|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: auction has not proven it is your hand   your safefty level was 3M|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so why force at 5-level|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: so far Sabine managed to turn trouble  around|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some say PASS forces RDBL  EXCEPT when 1N bidder is 4333|pg||
nt|jeanhari: to the opponents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so RDBL becomes some 4432  and 2@C scrambling for lowest 7-card fit|pg||
