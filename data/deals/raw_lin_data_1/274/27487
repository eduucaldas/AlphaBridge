nt|LarsArthur: good lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: 2@d would be a good raise|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: and seeing the opps bid both his suits:)|pg||

nt|arvidsson: and he has now been put in a peculior situation were he has to good to pass and no real bid to choose|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: 2@d would be forcing to 3@d or bad 2@h-bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|arvidsson: ok is that the notorius Lindqvist major raises ?|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|arvidsson: good start for defenfe with a @S lead, still declare can come on top and make his contract|pg||
