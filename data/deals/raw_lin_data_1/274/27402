nt|ahollan1: for those who haven't been keeping up   Kamil-Fleisher [EW in other room] won the 3-day 6 session premiere Platinum Pairs  earlier in the tourney|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: Bathurst opened 2N  playing 3N on lead of @H3|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure what best play is here - duck the spade, hoping for the heart ace in east or just finesse the diamond and pray for rain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rosenberg will need to work harder|pg||
nt|kareno: Bathurst having a much easier time of it.|pg||
nt|debrose: Likely to go down, winning first spade and playing W for @HAce|pg||
nt|kareno: I trust Rosenberg to find the best play!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is important to get north declarer with these spade cards, or equally if NS honours were switched|pg||

mb|p|nt|debrose: Good play by Verhees figuring out partner had nothing, and therefore not to unblock the @HQ at trick one.  With no suspicion hearts were 6-2, declarer thought making was impossible ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: think he knew that as soon as dummy hit|pg||
nt|fluff:  but these players can know what happened at the OT, so they stay calm :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1:  29  Zagorin in 3N south|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: Club finesse possible but with the modern style of overpreemption, probably he won't do that|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure the heart will be overtaken in that contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can finally explain auction on previous board   NS use opening 2@H to show weak 2@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2@S = 5@S & 5@C/@D    |pg||
nt|debrose: Rosenberg must assess his chances of a trump coup when South has Jxxx of clubs.  If they don't seem good, he may finesse club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so NO weak 2@H bid|pg||
nt|kareno: curious|pg||
nt|debrose: It looks like the trump coup will work whenever West has 3 or 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops in wrong hand for that|pg||
nt|kareno: King, then ace of clubs would tell the story and west should have heart length.but he still would have that pesky diamond to take care of|pg||
nt|debrose: Ah, but W can discard a heart when a spade is ruffed, so that is not true|pg||
nt|debrose: So if W is 1-3-5-4, playing a club to the Ace and ruffing a spade will fail|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other match   4@S-P-P-DBL[auken]//P-6@H[welland]-end|pg||
nt|debrose: Tough hand to play under any circumstances, and especially during a session where one feels nothing is going right|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: I lost a trick somehow while they were running @C, but the result is right|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jeanhari: 6C went down, so lets see: in the finesse with the odds??|pg||
nt|jeanhari: is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluff:  sh make, no ?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: after the 4@S opener you might finesse for the jack of @C's|pg||
nt|fluff:  OT played finesse|pg||
nt|aldek: with spades known 8-1, finesse in clubs is the percentage play |pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but if rosenberg went down, saying he "should" make might be inappropriate|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: a kibitzer said the same thing -- named after a person|pg||
nt|fluff:  it should mean that u can relax on the second suit, so as to lie on it, no ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|aldek: The name Canapé refers to a small bite presented before a big meal. (Wikipedia)|pg||
