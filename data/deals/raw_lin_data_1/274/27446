nt|andreasw:  did north show some @d's aswell? south seemed very sure in his case of @d K seeing Q10x on table?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: weak major or 24-25 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  dont bid .. you'll get to high|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andreasw:  what now on south? |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: all normal so fare....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andreasw:  think W was considering opening 4@h but this vull and those cards dont mix|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: weak openings create problems for opps....|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: big swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  8 tricks is a least makeable and looks normal to me|pg||

nt|andreasw:  Spamming "no entry on W hand" :)) true sorry|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well good stop i guess:) not sure why the dbl was alerted but i would have bid 4@h on W hand with 3 card supp and 2 kings if pd could bid 3@h after a dbl|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|andreasw:  second @s from north should be small to to cover for Jx or Qx|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: its Jon Egil....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how many down? 1?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzbe: wd|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10-11 ... 3!N should be the contract atleast|pg||

nt|vugraphzbe: east is dealer on the table.....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  declarer you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: it was:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if W playes @c from his hand he can still make 11.. if N goes up there is 11 and if he ducks W can play a @s to 9 and then AK after.. but i think that is double dummy|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sverjohn: What was the bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: south was in with dbl.|pg||
