nt|yorkbeach:  time limits are quite generous I believe - I think it is 2 hours 15 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|smoller:  probably best to finess diamonds, if not good, hope for West to have @HA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is trying to work out why West did not open 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Peter thinking.  I look at the ceiling when I think.   Sometimes the answers are up there.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was it becuase the suit was poor or was it because the hand was too weak?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is assuming declarer knows the @s are 6-2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if spades are 5-3, West could have one or both of the @dQ and @hA and not open|pg||
nt|smoller:  West may have A98xx of spades - making @SJ a "normal" lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West has the doubleton @dQ and East the @hA, that seems to be the only time finessing @d is wrong|pg||
