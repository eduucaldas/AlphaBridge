mb|p|mb|1N|nt|OleBerg:  I have mostly seen it as 3@H though (On 1@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: but as a side, in contrast to Espen I prefer 5 cards major (if anyone was interested to know..)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|grebrof: people bid 2@h with 5card @s on the sides etc - well, they are probably not always the best players, but when Bergen raises arrived, people didnt seem to care that Bergen and Cohen ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: are/were ecxellent cardplayers - not many play Bergen raises among the to 20 pairs in USA anymore|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  One of the etarnal battles|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think 3 @d is more solid than 9-11|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  I am a system geek, but I've been forced to admit, that such differences are marginal. What is importent, is that you and you partner has the same understanding of the bids.|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure you are right Espen, bergen raises (and variations of them) are still popular over there|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: Ole makes a very good point - the best system is what you are comfortable with (sort of)|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  So, in my opinion, whether you play Bergen, mini-fitbids or mini-splinters, is of little consequence.|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  Even playing the, in my eyes, quite inferior 1M-3M = Invite, you still have to play many boards for at to make a difference.|pg||
nt|jbgood: consequence - not sure - the more frequent a bid/convention pops up, the more likely it is to bear positive consequences|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  For the board at hand: Hard for NS to diagnose that they have a spade-loser|pg||

nt|OleBerg:  But they did.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|grebrof: not many represent USA in BB anymore playing Bergen, but I know its still popular - 3card support (as you said) is a lawbreaker, so cant be 9hcp anymore - but ok - you have to play ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: what your P plays, otherwise your P will have 3 opponents - and the 3rd one will probably be much "better" than the two others :)|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  Just to highlight how intriguing bridge can be. If clubs were 5-3 for NS, the 6NT (or 6@C) would be a few percentages over the cut.|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  The reason: With 6-2 you cannot catch the Qxxx of clubs, but you can with 5-3.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|OleBerg:  Assuming of course, that the other suits ar locked up. Like they are here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  To the hand at hand: NS may have found out, that they are off an ace, and the "trumf"-queen.|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  (Just to satisfy the kibz messaging me: Exchange a diamond from South with a club from North. Then 6@C/6NT is okay.)|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  For the really interested, there are also some possible trumf-coups in 6@C, if clubs are 4-1|pg||
