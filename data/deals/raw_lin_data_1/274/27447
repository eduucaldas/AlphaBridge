pc|c3|nt|vugraphzbe: all normal so fare....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good spot:)))|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andreasw:  think W was considering opening 4@h but this vull and those cards dont mix|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||

pc|d3|nt|vugraphzbe: He has showed a normal 20-21 nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: guess it was 2 nt all pass in closed......|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@h makeabl|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: 4@h down 1 in closed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  9 or ten depending on the switch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andreasw:  with @c's 3-3 i think it can make?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|andreasw:  -1 with this defence i think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andreasw:  Think the problem was north bidding 3!N insted of waiting to see what partner would do over Haralds 2@H..|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|andreasw:  second @s from north should be small to to cover for Jx or Qx|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: its Jon Egil....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how many down? 1?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andreasw:  good shift and north can exit with a  @d|pg||

nt|vugraphzbe: not this bidding....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  cant really do much else when u play that|pg||

nt|vugraphzbe: 3@hs-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: in closed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  at pairs i would consider it but at teams i think 3!N looks good partner could have @d fit:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  If you dont wanna look around the site this is a little easier: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0124/2013-03-24.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: so @d showes @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: 3 nt w 11 in closed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  11 tricks on a small @c lead but i suspect a @s lead which also leas to 11|pg||
nt|andreasw:  leads* |pg||
nt|andreasw:  y but i dont think many would open 1@H sloppy @h suit and only 10|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzbe: you got 3 vp in match one Kjell Gaute. Dbl and take the score in:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  well it's a good lead:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Guess South opened 1NT so he  should find everything|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: 7 loosers....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzbe: wd|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10-11 ... 3!N should be the contract atleast|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: hmmmmm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andreasw:  but it looks like e-w had some misunderstandings|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andreasw:  who knows... think it will cost more then u gain but what do i know:) cant argue with success:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yeah well 3!N was a good spot... 3@c X is even better:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: east is dealer on the table.....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  declarer you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: it was:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if W playes @c from his hand he can still make 11.. if N goes up there is 11 and if he ducks W can play a @s to 9 and then AK after.. but i think that is double dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|andreasw:  think 7 maybe even 8 tricks is makeable with this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: y...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sverjohn: What was the bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: south was in with dbl.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sverjohn: A system mix up here. Furunes playing Puppet? , what Stornes was playing is more uncertain|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: agree....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  This is defently not going to make though ill take any bet on that:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andreasw:  think a @h shift is needed to beat this now |pg||

nt|vugraphzbe: 4@cs-1 in closed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3!N much easier to play then 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: 5 @d e -1 in closed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  difference on 2!N the first time and now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: 3@ss10 in closed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andreasw:  not the best slam :) think e-w are gonna reach 3!N but who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  think east took it as minors? |pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: what is 3 cl now??:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: laughing at the table, Furunes thinking.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Not a regular partnership. Probably not agreements here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if he is more then just a little unsure i think he will bid 3!N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  both like the opening from W and the 1@h bid from north|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: wd to stop here:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  landed on the ground safely:)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Got out of it nicely|pg||

nt|vugraphzbe: so a big swing for the leaders.....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzbe: big swing....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  can be pretty sure its not a singelton i would suspect north to pass 2@d with KQJ10xxx|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would have opend east hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thought 3!N was pretty standart bid on south hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: ja.....|pg||
