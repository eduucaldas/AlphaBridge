mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2H!|nt|Walddk2: 2@H is an excellent bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Limit or better with diamond support|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|runnerup:  yes and 3@d will make in practice -south leading |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@D is too much when you showed your hand already|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And partner was not interested|pg||

nt|Rosaline:  this is a normal lead imo|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The alternative would have been a trump|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes, but the new teams scoring system with decimals seems to be somewhat difficult to follow |pg||
nt|Rosaline:  precisely :)  I am much happier that Sofie led this club and let make the contract, than have a bad lead and take it down :)|pg||
nt|Rosaline:  of course this is an important match, but we have longer term aims than this tournament :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@H is an excellent slam but may be tough to bid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Rosaline:  I think this is a very interesting match to see, since this is the first (small) part of the Girls final|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You can take that contract to your bank manager and get a loan in a flash|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in other table ew where in 1nt from wrong hand and ns had 9 tricks to take (but got 6 -)so 4 @d was much better than that|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Iceland has a small population, so one can understand that they are unable to find enough youngsters, and youth bridge suffers big time in Finland|pg||
