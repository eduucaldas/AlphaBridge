nt|mrdct:  @cJ is best to time it all correctly|pg||
nt|mrdct:  interesting that north chose low @d rather than than J|pg||
nt|mrdct:  ordinarily the 3rd and 4th undertrick in a green vs red sacrifice is really important as it's the difference between -3 and plus 5 so 8 imps|pg||

nt|mrdct:  @dJ dropping|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but too late for defence now as there is no entry back to south to lead @c through twice|pg||
