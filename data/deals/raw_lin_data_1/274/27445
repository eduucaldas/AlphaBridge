mb|p|nt|andreasw:  what now on south? |pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzbe: all normal so fare....|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  think W was considering opening 4@h but this vull and those cards dont mix|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: weak openings create problems for opps....|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: big swing|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|andreasw:  second @s from north should be small to to cover for Jx or Qx|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: its Jon Egil....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how many down? 1?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andreasw:  good shift and north can exit with a  @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|andreasw:  at pairs i would consider it but at teams i think 3!N looks good partner could have @d fit:)|pg||

nt|andreasw:  11 tricks on a small @c lead but i suspect a @s lead which also leas to 11|pg||
nt|andreasw:  leads* |pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzbe: you got 3 vp in match one Kjell Gaute. Dbl and take the score in:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  well it's a good lead:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sverjohn: Guess South opened 1NT so he  should find everything|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: wd|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10-11 ... 3!N should be the contract atleast|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: hmmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  but it looks like e-w had some misunderstandings|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  who knows... think it will cost more then u gain but what do i know:) cant argue with success:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yeah well 3!N was a good spot... 3@c X is even better:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzbe: east is dealer on the table.....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  declarer you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: it was:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if W playes @c from his hand he can still make 11.. if N goes up there is 11 and if he ducks W can play a @s to 9 and then AK after.. but i think that is double dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|andreasw:  think 7 maybe even 8 tricks is makeable with this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: y...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sverjohn: What was the bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: south was in with dbl.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sverjohn: A system mix up here. Furunes playing Puppet? , what Stornes was playing is more uncertain|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: agree....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  This is defently not going to make though ill take any bet on that:)|pg||
