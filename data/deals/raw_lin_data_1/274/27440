mb|p|mb|3D|nt|fluff:  theoretically grand slam here in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C must have been Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|kareno: Puppet?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|fluff:  muppet fantunes style maybe :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok  in Muppet  3@D guarantees a 4-card major|pg||
nt|fluff:  rite|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm not sure. Verhees asked "Puppet?" and I thought Morten shook his head and said that 3@d showed no major, but of course looking at Dennis' hand ...|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe showed no 5 card major?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can't be regular stayman else Dennis bids 3@C-3@S|pg||
nt|fluff:  reverse smolen ?|pg||
nt|kareno: So 3@c asked a 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Well, no, normal Smolen - he has 4 @ss and 5 @hs|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d showed at least one 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told Dennis has been known to hide 4M when 4333|pg||

mb|5N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5N pick-a-slam|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Pick a slam?  Surely not GSF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grand slam force is almost never used anymore [especially with RKC]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And that was indeed the correct explanation. Dennis now explained to vP - "Stayman ... no Major ... 5 @hs and 4 @ss"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And 5NT = pick a slam|pg||

nt|ahollan1: smaller link http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=6061    then there are multiple links for Bilde  you want the card for Dennis & Morten  [in Danish]|pg||

mb|3D|nt|jeanhari: indeed very difficult, 3@D now and they have some chance|pg||

nt|Henryb:  The answer is that it was donated for the Olympiad Teams, which is now the Mind Sport, and donated in 1960|pg||
