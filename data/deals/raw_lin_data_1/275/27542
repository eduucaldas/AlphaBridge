nt|vugraphzem: which was completely normal of course|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzem: slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I expect Hammarström to make a slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: in either hearts or clubs, can they bid it?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzem: http://tinyurl.com/c4fdjrt for running scores by the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he needs to punt it now|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzem: looks like pick a slam to me|pg||
nt|Peacokk: 7@DX is only 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: a good bid|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is better than 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although  if hearts are 4-0, South rates to have 4 and can give partner a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: but over 6@C you are allowed to sacrifice in 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 6@C by West is top spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As it is, nothing matters|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  i like the bidding here, dont know if i would sit for it with the south hand though|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You take out insurance?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and hope they don't bid 6@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: 6@D was 800 i think|pg||
nt|bt:  vulnerability isnt what it used to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: as East can get a spade ruff|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Peacokk: The 80's? :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bt:  was almost before your mother was born :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 1880's when Lasse and I were young|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzem: will Sylvan risk another bid?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|bt:  it makes sense to balance now. 3@D would imply 64|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzem: i think 3@D would imply 5-5, 2NT is 6-4 for me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: I agree with Micke|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: Sylvan catered for 2@S X by doubling though|pg||
nt|bt:  i would usually show my suits immediately wit 55|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: But with 5-5 your hearts might be much better than diamonds|pg||
nt|bt:  anyway, this is promising for north, might run out of trumps though|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: he could always correct 3@C to 3@D so he was always ok this way|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Then even you prefer 2@H over 2@S|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|d8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: as hearts are breaking he should be ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: xx  AKQxx  Jxxxx  A     do you bid 2@H or 2@S, Lasse?|pg||
nt|bt:  that is the only 55 I would bid 2@H with|pg||
nt|bt:  looks like 64 doesnt it?|pg||
nt|bt:  declarer is comfortable here, cant go wrong|pg||
nt|bt:  generally showing your hand immedately isnt the worst idea|pg||
nt|bt:  making life easy on partner is a forgotten virtue|pg||

nt|bt:  west has some ammunition here, could get interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzem: a pretty wild deal, yes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Double or 1@S. I am a 1@S bidder|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bt:  in 2nd position a 4@H opening looks wrong to me|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt:  yes getting your suit in is usually good, like i said on the previous hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: with the good suit and lack of defense i like 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: might have ended in 4@S X even then|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bt:  this is a hand where you want obligatary tempo break over 4@S and the double|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|Peacokk: Im a 1@S bidder as well, when you get support, the west hand i huge|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|c5|pg||

mb|2C|nt|bt:  2@C was a little light but very right for ew|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H!|mb|d|mb|3H|nt|bt:  south has a huge hand over the presumably non-forcing 2@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzem: Arnberg looking at a huge double fit|pg||

mb|5H|nt|vugraphzem: taking out insurance|pg||
nt|bt:  if south leads @CA on this auction it must be a single, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: yeah, but he still needs to find his partner's ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: and he's likely to get that wrong|pg||
