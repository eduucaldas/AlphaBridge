mb|p|nt|rv: though this match is very close, we might see a different match on Vugraph in last segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb:  i guess this auction will be kinda trivial to 2nt |pg||
nt|rv: normally organizers balance closeless of match and equity (giving all teams a chance) in chosing Vugraph match|pg||
nt|jjsb:  then after its either a decision to accept the invite |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rv: this should make even on best @c lead?|pg||
nt|jjsb:  basically in practice vulnerable IMP u will just accept unless bad 15 |pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: 2@h shows 4@h may have 4@s as well, normally you bid lower suit with both 4M|pg||

nt|jjsb:  ok i take all my comment back about "trivial" ... |pg||
nt|rv: Samir's 2@h is very strange|pg||
