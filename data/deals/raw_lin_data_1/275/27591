mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|psridhar: the EW slam here needs one out of 2 finesses -in 6@d entries for taking both exist|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|psridhar: in 6@H they need specifically @c hook which is on as cards are-but a lightner X may lead to @d ruff on lead|pg||

nt|psridhar: i wd hv forced to slam with W hand-via 5@s over 4@s-may be overbid but has the adv of alerting pd that u hold 2 suits|pg||
nt|psridhar: here E acted on the assumption his pd held a single suiter |pg||

nt|psridhar: well i wd rather bid grand off a key than pass 1@H on these cards|pg||
nt|rv: some play 2 level jump bids in bal seat as good hand and 3 level as pre-emptivem, not this N-S pair|pg||
nt|psridhar: putting the trophy temporarily in Kushari's hands|pg||
nt|rv: all of us keep remembering saboo|pg||

nt|psridhar: when the 12 the trick is taken , kushari will feel like tearing up his cards ....lets sympathise with him , his bid was a loser as it turned out but VERY reasonable for his cards|pg||
