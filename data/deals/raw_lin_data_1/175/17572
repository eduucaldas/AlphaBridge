nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: the problem with stripping side-suits and hoping for some elimination is that it's always really obvious what you are doing|pg||
nt|athene: so opps know to throw their kings brilliantly from Kx and stuff like that when it's needed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like making now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/iceland/jonsson-baldursson.pdf|pg||
nt|april7: 6@H or 6@D is an option for EW but hard toeach|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@S perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: a making contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: but he wimps it|pg||
nt|april7: actually its a laydown slam if @H is played towards E|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|april7: now 5@D by E and 6 by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: don't know about that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure I understand 4@S at these colours|pg||
nt|henryb:  Good morning|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well he's bidding it to make, and fair enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT was allowed to make in the other room on board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morning Henry|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I don't understand why South did not bid 4@s the first time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: According to the Law of Total Trumps, he should bid 5@S first time round!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I bet that would have got him a better score than this auction|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|h3|pg||
mc|11|nt|jbennet: over 4sp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But of course, the whole hand is a total guess, so I wouldn't take aim at any of the bids made|pg||
pg||

nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
mb|2N|an|20-21|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|3D!|an|transfer|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||

nt|jbennet: bidding probaly should go X-4NT-5D.p.p.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|april7: now we have a grand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think "bidding should probably go ..." is correct on this hand, whatever the rest of your sentence :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: 1 sp - 4 d (void showing)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|april7: or 4@C fragment bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: how about 6 clubs now??|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A splinter over a splinter?|pg||
nt|jbennet: y|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland Bermuda Bowl champions 1991, Yokohama, Japan. Thorlakur Jonsson and Jon Baldursson were in the team but not as partners|pg||
nt|bjacobs: don't think I've ever seen that concept before|pg||
nt|jbennet: or perhaps 5 clubs.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|april7: 5@C exclusion BW|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: yes I think 5@C is probably a better idea ... hoping to hear 5@D|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Walddk2: 100% record for Iceland; qualified once and won it. Now they have qualified for their 2nd BB in the Netherlands in October|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: yes but perhaps 4 D only showed singleton or void.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Just like the previous board, there's no obvious way to solve this hand.  Bidding a grand slam off two aces is too much of a challenge|pg||
nt|april7: 5NT grand slam try or Josephine?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: My guess is that it was a void-showing response to Blackwood|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbennet: and if so then 4 d only showed shortness (1 or =0)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: right|pg||
nt|jbennet: which is a weakness in the system.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c5|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbennet: one should have mechanisms in the system that makes distinciton between singleton and void.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: How do you distinguish in your methods, Johan?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jbennet: this is recommended:..|pg||
mc|13|nt|april7: sould have ruffed a @D first, because if @H don't break N might go down|pg||
nt|jbennet: direct splinter = void.|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SA954HAKQJ95DCQT3,SHT63DAT53CK87542,SKQJ732H8DKJ8762C,ST86H742DQ94CAJ96|sv|e|nt|mgb81: oh|pg||
nt|mgb81: are you sure it's 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|athene: if you go all the way round the bend, that's 360 degrees isn't it :)|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - East didn't overtake @cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: yes...I'm sure :)|pg||
nt|dburn: so a heart loser went away|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Still sure...|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think we should just rely on Stephen to have it right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: was also the auction...lol|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't tell anybody|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too late|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
mb|1S|an|8+|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|asking and supp|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|an|voidwood|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: people sometimes panic when they hit a 5-0 trump break|pg||
nt|copeyj: they shouldnt find out about ot until it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|copeyj: just cash winners and x ruff|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree, source of tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: but they only bid 6 in the other room so a push|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it's easy to bid from up here but they didn't find it at either table.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c2|nt|copeyj: 2@D 1@S 1@C and at least 6 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: but playing one round of trumps would have been ok if declarer had then remembered rule 1 of crossruffing (take side suit tricks early)|pg||

nt|jbennet: and then 4 d |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which makes 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, well there are a lot of system implications in that advice.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not everyone plays that|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes it does.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jbennet: with a strong hand we uses 1NT rebid as various strong hands.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that an Anders Wirgren invention?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jbennet: so what do we do with 5332 and 13-15 balanced.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wirgren and Bennet are regular partners|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I can distinguish in all auctions except 1@h-1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|jbennet: we often open 1 club treating it as a 11-14 NT.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jbennet: some of the gadgets are skinnets.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another method is to let a jump shift to the 3-level be a singleton (mini-splinter) and let 2 of opener's second suit be a one-round force|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|april7: the Q of @D betters the hand so a 3@H might have been a possibility , so 4@H makes because of good distribution|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, 4@H is a dreadful contract - more or less needs two 3-3 breaks, so this auction is just fine|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Another way is to play the jump reverse is a raise (e.g. 1@c-1@h-3@d) and singleton splinters follow with direct splinters showing voids|pg||
nt|bjacobs: because he's not an idiot|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: sorry, private|pg||

nt|henryb:  as I said, it can be done in all situations except 1@h-1@s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbennet: after 1 h -1 sp - 2NT = a) good hearts and 0-2 spades or b) 4 card spade support and good hand (1h-1sp-3H= excatly 3 spades)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|mc|10|nt|Walddk2: What to do with an ordinary 18-19 balanced?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what do you bid with 18-19 balanced?|pg||

nt|copeyj: and another good result for England from next door here|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: N/S probably 10 tx in @h but not enough in high cards to bid it|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||

mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Thats how most experts do, Johann. Many still play 5N asks S "how many kings"|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  No, not an insult at all. Just that the evolution of expert practice takes years to filter down|pg||
