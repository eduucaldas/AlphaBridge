mb|4S|nt|pelu: hi all welcome to the 2. half of the Nordic junior matck denmark U-20 - denmark U-25|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Preempt with 5c support might not always be the right descision, they should read Mike Lawrence books|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Urban - do u realy belive in the LAW?|pg||
nt|pelu: a guide-line, but not the 8. wonder of the world :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: not even the 7th :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Not necessary Peter but it can be a guide in difficult situations if you know how many trumphs both side have|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Scores after 1st half: Finland vs Faroes Islands 90-6 - Sweden U25 vs Sweden U20 50-19 - Norway U25 vs Norway U20 26-36|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  they are a very experienced team|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway U20 won 17-13 against Norway U25 last night|pg||
nt|sater1957: this opening might lead to a 4@h game|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 3@h should make when @d 3-3|pg||
nt|kemperg: system includes light opening:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure this age group play partscores...|pg||
nt|roswolf: a featureless 10hcp - hmmm we are in the nursey ok:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: NS 5 card major, EW 5 card @s and 4 card @h - both strong NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: cards lie favorably so may make|pg||
nt|roswolf: north is a girl - how many more at the table/event?|pg||

nt|pelu: standing in top: Sweden U25 94 VP, Den U25 82, NorwayU25 81|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s avoided 3nt anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: his doubleton diamond kills his hand for slam purposes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957: which happens to make, if you do things right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone!|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  dont take it as a proof that you should open this|pg||
nt|jr7: a lot af things must he do right :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry :( ,missed the s |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should lose 2 spade  1 diamond and 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ady: difficult for east to play the 8 on first trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: after the 10, not sure he should |pg||
nt|ady: sorry should lose 1 spade  not 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  because I think you shouldnt, if East opens you are still very much in the race|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@C 1 down|pg||
nt|peachy: Maria attempts a cunning underlead,|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need more coffee, don't y'all think so....|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: for sure :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: decision time|pg||
nt|roswolf: ducking looks normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hey all.. Wellcome back for 2'nd Half of this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer can afford to lose 3 @Dtricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ducking twice is best %effort|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He has @d 2 at the right of his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Gundesen wants to play this hand|pg||
nt|hawe45: Right = wright|pg||
nt|roswolf: east though has the bit between his teeth|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Hmm, why not 4@h if youre interested with better cards? Now N could x for the lead do defeat an eventually slam, strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Emil looking suprised.. He is not sure what is going on i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: surprising choice of trump suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sater1957: this should solve the @c|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like a well earned 130 for N-S|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: you never know what do do with the North hand - picture partner with @CJx and 3@c may not be so hot |pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure East did not know what the 4@d bid meant|pg||
nt|ady: dangerous to be above 5 level|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: sorry 10 played|pg||
nt|roswolf: also south with @CA and @DAQJxx South might have opened|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: No matter now what he does.. 10 tricks..|pg||
nt|roswolf: as the crds lay - but it will take too much time -sigh|pg||
nt|hawe45: I often have read about killing defence - was this time killing the defence to lead a @C - or? I did´nt see 1st trick!|pg||
nt|roswolf: suicide defence more like|pg||
nt|kemperg: can't go wrong now|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have lead a heart notwithstanding east's stayman bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes henry|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: strange @CK|pg||
nt|roswolf: mind you the contract is icy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Still, impressive that the Faroe Islands can field a team, with just 50,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|sharkey: So the Swedes play "standard" system - transfer bids after 1@C opening |pg||
nt|henryb:  110 after not playing @d immediately|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: equally unsuccessful|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: @D ace would have been a great lead!|pg||
nt|kemperg: @DAce only down start|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: Many cities with more than 50,000 don't even have one junior in the clubs|pg||
nt|sater1957: North was thrown in at trick 0|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  might as well be in 5 then, same finesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: normal play after E has show: @HAK + @C QJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you're not doing anything over 3@H, so it doesn't really matter|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a little farfetched|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42:  better hand for chinese poker than for leading against 4@H|pg||
nt|sater1957: now a small @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this safety play in trumps will set W on a @s guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: So I think it´s better to win with @hA and play another @c|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: but still guesses in @s and @d|pg||
nt|sater1957: @d goes on @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: pergaps I should have said @s or @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps....|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: @s goes on @c @d he can always guess right while if @s AQ on back|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42:  oops :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes But S will return a @c|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|nt|peachy: 4C is easier to set than 3D|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: there might be a defence to beat 3@h, but this isn't it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42:  its convenient to get @D right on this line|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hesse: declearer has to get a @d trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer not fooled by the ¬@SQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: the Danes' system also standard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub17/Turneringer/KampResultat927.html  for results and standing after round 4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Gerben42:  in this situation they could play good/bad then 3@D shows a "real hand" and E can cooperate|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: is declarer really playing this way?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
mc|11|nt|kemperg: will make|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - she will prevail as impossible go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: unusual play|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Hahaha... what else|pg||
nt|yuval10: i've heared they made a hugh prograss in Football|pg||
nt|hesse: part score deal on its way|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 level in red for both sides|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Michael Rosenblum|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|hesse: hi|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but still can go for @S|pg||
nt|jr7: a good 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|jr7: not down that way :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good evening Hedy|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 5@d seemes like a fair shot here... Either no @h lead or @d K in place:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hey Hedy|pg||
nt|jr7: 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing the heart king first would have guaranteed it without anguish|pg||
nt|roswolf: how restrained will east be!?|pg||
nt|sharkey: so a good start for the Danes - may not be bid next door|pg||
nt|kemperg: with screens impossible:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another slam zone hand |pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  on trump finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: this one against the odds|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: With 2 aces out i should not be the |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: ending contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  tough @H break here...|pg||
nt|jr7: or 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H is good also|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@dx even better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hey Yuval|pg||
nt|jr7: a lot af loosers in 5@D :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand for a Raptor 1NT in S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes agood start to the morning|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jr7: yes 5@D is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@H or 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: what do u prefer?|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont like 2 x A|pg||
nt|peachy: Definitely worth biddingm vulnerable, if N knew South's had is that good|pg||
nt|hawe45: An awful 2 NT - but what is better?|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 HCP by NS - can they stay out of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 1Nt by N now|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a possible feisty animal if south takes the fav colors too seriously|pg||
nt|hawe45: Best lead against 4 @H = @C Jack... - good luck, without screens|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT but won't live|pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|mdgraham: 2NT probably specific - hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@h?|pg||
nt|jr7: Dbl?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2/1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: shows 4@s|pg||
nt|hesse: I think I would have bid 2NT|pg||
nt|hesse: Bakke showing a decent @h raise|pg||
nt|hesse: yes, and the @s break is not much better, so E/W better stay at low level|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  slam-killing 2NT opening bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: Raptor 1NT = 4 card M + 5+ minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes hans imagination and/or x-ray vision required|pg||
nt|hawe45: 1 H = Double of 1 @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H =?|pg||
nt|roswolf: TY|pg||
nt|hawe45: of 1 @H naturally|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks very normal to be reached and will probably go off|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yuval10: N should be desciplined and pass here|pg||
nt|pelu: when close I perfer the bid with max presure on opp|pg||
nt|pelu: = 2NT|pg||
nt|jr7: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: An easy 4@h here irrespective of the lead, E can get back in tr to ruff last @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: otherwise he can find himself very quickly in a hopeless 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: make a note - Jørgen agree with me :):)|pg||
nt|hesse: :)|pg||
nt|jr7: never happend again :)|pg||
nt|hesse: Hagen is showing minimum values|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could make 5@D as they lay    but would have to guess diamond position   and club finesse has to be right   so poos contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bet he doesnt either , but that is what they gave him|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h probably best from South as his defensive assets are rather poor, else bid 4@d|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pass...|pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt in N sh show 8-10 - exatly her hand :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are into a murky swamp now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|milton_se: hopeless, yes, but a good result|pg||
nt|ady: this is hopless on a heart lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will scare the declarer to death |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: only chance now should be to play for @c Kj in place|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  but systemic for most of the planet|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: in fact I do not see how to make it|pg||
nt|sater1957: 6@c is not *that* good|pg||
nt|henryb:  Kokish inversion|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: It's not "that" hopeless Yuval... as a spectator said, even with tr lead 4@h makes because of the good @c break so it is a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|yuval10: especially since unoubled|pg||
nt|pelu: I might be wrong, but a @H-lead will defeat 4@h??|pg||
nt|nubmaster: nope, you can play on @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: well usually not too many good things can do when you stretch your hand like N did here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|pelu: interesting point: what is the weakest bid by E? Pass or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jr7: with @H 4-1 is this not good|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT shud be off 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: very difficult to stay out of game i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed - especially VUL |pg||
nt|kemperg: @D K onside is enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: east leaving nothing unsaid|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little agricultural|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yuval10: you could very well play in 4@h X|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H is -1 or making depends on @D ruff|pg||
nt|ady: needs K@C onside and 3-1 split for slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: the good part of 2/1 is you have more room to explore|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: can happen even|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so probably making|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hesse: good morning :)|pg||
nt|hesse: good spot for E/W, should be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hesse: a @c lead may set it|pg||
nt|pelu: my ex partner, Thomas Berg had a rule. when pass is an option its the weakest bid!|pg||
nt|hesse: this may be 2 down at best defence|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@D wins|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but unlikely after the opening|pg||
nt|kjadams: with a 4th best spade lead 3N down off the top.   On a passive club lead, 3N has a play, although very difficult|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: ouch a tiger double?|pg||
nt|sharkey: any explanation of 2@D Andreas?|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will have her work cut out here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: but 2h weaker than 2d|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its not |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good point|pg||
nt|jr7: 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Ehh yes.. But i dont know it :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: curtains|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5th best spade will work too!|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  trump promotion?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5 first tricks to the defense plus the @hJ|pg||

nt|hawe45: Bilde will play back a @C...|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hesse: yes, this should be easy for Hagen|pg||
nt|roswolf: set up her 8th trick in spades ie not take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: will she accept down 1 or play for a mirackel and finess in @d? |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: She can be sure @d K by karlsson|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think she'll take @D finesse....|pg||
nt|kemperg: no she plays @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: could well be fat if so - without the double no reason not to take the finesse|pg||

nt|vugraphzct: Td saying that they have to hurry started to late..|pg||
nt|hesse: good defence by Rimstedt, and Norway is -200 in a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|blum1956: a cold slam for NS but not straightforward to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not easy at the table to put the k of @D on the table|pg||
nt|henryb:  straight guess, Shirley|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a decent game for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt on NS|pg||
nt|jr7: nice fast play|pg||
nt|sharkey: well judged by Maria|pg||
nt|roswolf: more fun here|pg||
nt|sybarra: Nice signals N but no more hts left in S |pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder why the inversion to play this auction as NF and presumably 2@c-2@d-2N as forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: So even tho we started a bit late we are ahead! YES! :)|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks for n/s in spades|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 4+@H and 5+minor weak|pg||
nt|hesse: Gullberg showing 4 card@h+5+ minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: must be 4@H and longer minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  so much easier from here|pg||
nt|ady: only 21 hcp between them   might not reach game|pg||
nt|yuval10: Mikael used to have a dark hair when i played with him back in the 2008 Orebro Bridgefestivallen, and Ola had a blond. Was easy to differ between them that time :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 30 min: 2 boards :(:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many @D will east bid eventually|pg||
nt|sharkey: I note following on the Swedes cc: "Sound openings, 11 HCP balanced is usually passed"...|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: dont like rdbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: try to type faster :)|pg||
nt|hesse: :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  especially since 2@C wont excite N|pg||
nt|hedyg: drury?|pg||
nt|jr7: maybee 10 tricks in @H - if they play right|pg||
nt|yuval10: not anymore|pg||
nt|pelu: NS will prob bid to 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: But it tells the WHOLE story at once, what else?|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hello Andreas!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jr7: I dont know anyone to play that in DK|pg||
nt|hesse: Hagen did not find his hand good enough for 3@c, and I do agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is why we watch junior bridge :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hey John:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: refreshing change from the prelunch sessions|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we have the "need for speed" table  |pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: what rebid do you prefer in north?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they dont play drury..|pg||
nt|hedyg: why is 2@H alerted ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: last weekend a ladies international teams event was tied because one of the leaders suffered a slow play penalty|pg||
nt|pelu: X sh be takeout here|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll see if NS are in tune now - agreements in order|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D at red - juniors know no fear|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl is clear cut here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well in my youth i would bid 1nt or even pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Just wait.. My table allways end up being the last one to finish some how :)|pg||
nt|ady: also in no-tumps as they lay|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzct: Yes now they are both blond|pg||
nt|pelu: ???|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|sharkey: from our vantage point it is...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzct: No i dont think that there have been any penalties yet|pg||
nt|hesse: Not easy for E/W to win the part score contract|pg||
nt|hesse: ...after 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey they are jrs.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: I dont know :) he alerted it so..|pg||
nt|jr7: 8-11|pg||
nt|jr7: and only xxx @H|pg||
nt|kemperg: sensible pass, Chance majors are 41|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has 8 points and may not have been sure - downside may also be minimal|pg||
nt|sharkey: pd may not have Major either...|pg||
nt|hawe45: From the moment, where East doubles, E/W MIGHT be in trouble! We are not here to help the opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: why no double of 1nt?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Becaus he has minimum and no good leadm therefor|pg||
nt|pelu: he has show his 10 HCP - now it up to partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: then why rdbl - seems inconsistent to me|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H 4th suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: No alert but i think so :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: how is 3NT? - make on @H or @S leads - @Ds blocked forNS, so a bad contract with a lot of play|pg||
nt|blum1956: if they play 2/1 2@c may be not that disappointing|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what other than 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: as south i would have bid.....................something|pg||
nt|sybarra: S always passing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 4@c showes the void|pg||
nt|ady: some might raise only to 2@H with north hand  with a number of soft value cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could lead to 2@Cx|pg||
nt|kjadams: I am a 3C bidder with the South cards.   You have heart support and want the lead.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hesse: they may end in slam now|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  recently we had a long discussion on what 2NT should show here in a standard bidding context|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  12-14 or 15-17|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i dont´t like that 2nt on N with only @c10x. 3@d is better|pg||
nt|jr7: I agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: AQJ is as good as a 4-card support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D is probably best then S bids 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, not doubled. No trouble then|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if north had doubled at the colours south has a classic pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3 @H bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Easy 4@s with probably 4 tricks only|pg||
nt|sybarra: sad news for all of us,  Mike Gold (lestergold) a fellow commentator from England, died yestereay |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: claimed 9|pg||
nt|jr7: easy play|pg||
nt|pelu: she also risk that 3@D making - and gameNS - a pass here is = guessing game :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: To tell partner what he has - not stupid|pg||
nt|pelu: if u dont RD u teel: I dont have 10 HCP - Pass = 0-9 - for RD is 100% normal action|pg||
nt|ianmcc: E/W are close to 4@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: better than pass certainly - the innocence of youth perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Unless the @d ruff is found i think 4 is a make|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT 100 percent forcing|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Strange claim last one, 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Played to fast for me .. yes 12 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jr7: 2Cx = 7 tricks (I think)|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is smoked out of her deceptive manoeuvres|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure the TDs shal push the players - but I still dont understand why the scedule are so gard - only 110 min for 14 boards - international standard = 119 (indl 1 min pr. bords ...|pg||
nt|pelu: with screens) and only 10 min break???|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 2@h alert mas misswrite sry:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play AK@H now to avoid a @d ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry i think n/s cheated themselves out of the club fit as soon as rdbl hit the table|pg||
nt|kemperg: without rdl it might have been 1@S dbl , interesting contract|pg||
nt|ady: did not see the last few tricks   maybe west discarded too many spades|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pelu: wrong defense @HJ in trick 2|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe East discarded some @h's... then West will be squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: got easier with diamond discards on spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW need to get the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: yes :)|pg||
nt|pelu: too late|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Or as you said David...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is the kind of bidding situation that should be discussed for a few hours at training camp|pg||

nt|roswolf: wouldnt be the first time peret!:):(|pg||
nt|roswolf: peter|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: The @dJ may look as a keycard feom S's point of  view...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: good stop here|pg||
nt|ady: 4NT a little risky on a club lead if spades not so well placed |pg||
pc|h6|nt|jr7: 6 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hesse: with an opening pass in south, som pairs may end in 3NT|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway defends in 4@sx in board 16!|pg||
nt|hesse: should be 1100|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ouch|pg||

nt|ady: yes   I was told this morning    sorry to hear |pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|kjadams: and tough to get ruff and set up heart.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Even if it is, the @h loser goes away. the defense can get the ruff or the heart but no fourth trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: right :)|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  new leader|pg||

nt|peachy: that is what I meant, he played it right to make 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he did|pg||
nt|jr7: an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c was a really dangerous bid on that auction - 1@d-1NT |pg||
nt|roswolf: spade partial likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w competing in @D's?|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer were to play king or queen of spades 1st round and east ducked with AJX   could go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: another slamzone hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be bid|pg||
nt|ady: shortage of  entries in north hand |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But if vest started with 5c @h's and the ace of spades...|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jr7: 3@S against 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c|pg||
nt|jr7: 6@C ? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as unless the 1Nt bidder has diamonds, it is highly likely that his only suit is clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only if E opens in third seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: should do but depends on who opens|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ady: another game for n/s   either 4@H   or 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Very hard to bid now A nice bid from Maria!|pg||
nt|hedyg: might bid 4@s|pg||
nt|jr7: Now is it over - cant find 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: was just going to say I bet E opens|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Im suprised S did not do anything on 2@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems odd|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: pass or 1Nt?|pg||
nt|kjadams: NS can make 8 tricks in spades, but might be forced to try for 9 and lose 100 in process.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  With good guesses N-S can make 6@h or 6N. Not likely to bid either|pg||
nt|sybarra: my thought would be, N will opted for 4 @H|pg||
nt|ady: as the cards lay can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I once had a teammate, and he alwayslooked AKQJ as a 5-card suit:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  pass|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the question is, what should W do now|pg||
nt|sater1957: Hand plays bad for NS, might as well let EW play :-)|pg||
nt|jr7: How ofen do you have EKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: I agree - 1Nt sh be 8-10|pg||
nt|sharkey: Denmark picked up 9 IMPs on Bd 1 - the @H suit wasn't even mentioned in OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: north slips away to spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 2@c and now 3@d i think shows 9 and a half tricks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: 1 or 2? |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pragmatic 4@s bid, has my sympathy|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Easy 10 tricks..|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably 11|pg||
nt|pelu: close to 6@H but I cant find the 12. trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Which is no tragedy since E-W make 110 in diamonds|pg||
nt|kjadams: e/w can make 9 in diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: as does 2@H - THE SPADE fit may well be lost|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But 2@c is two-way with weak 2 in @d or any strong so in might be dangerous to act round one with Souths cards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: if 1@S P P X P now 1NT 4-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: very restrained by everyone|pg||
mb|5D|nt|blum1956: 4@s easy while 4@h may be tough|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  !|pg||
nt|pelu: No N open 1NT on the solid @H-suit (5 card) |pg||
nt|pelu: again 1Nt on 5 with 5 card major strike back|pg||
nt|pelu: on @H-lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree with 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: seems a long way to 6@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: impossible now|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 6@h wins aswell ? only 6 but?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@H is possible though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: not seo very often, but once I had that @h and rebid. after that we played the only game in 4@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  really I think W cannot run with this kind of hand|pg||
nt|sater1957: Now S has the blocking hand to play. Luckily he is only in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: @s from N and I think alså 11|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: A really nice 6@s here which makes when tr breaks and the @h finesse works|pg||
nt|jr7: Diamond - and down|pg||
nt|sharkey: may make - 3@H losers and 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD BE FINIS|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But if East bid 5@d now after a slow bidding, letting NS investigate... why not just bid 5@d directly over 2@h...|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s have been hunbugged -classic case that you must show both suits as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: humbugged|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Amazing indeed|pg||
nt|ady: poor hand for norway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: bad luck for EW|pg||
nt|jr7: nice to see - they dont ply 1-3-5 from xxxx|pg||

nt|ianmcc: wait till he sees the opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet he glance longingly at the red card |pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|marlowepi: on a red-suit lead you may not even need trumps to break|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 balanced hand with 30 HCP are not often slam-going|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jr7: good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Told ya ;)|pg||
nt|kemperg: S has ti play @H in second trick |pg||
nt|kemperg: to|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is a bit unlucky - we have alll been in worse|pg||
nt|pelu: I see|pg||
nt|hawe45: Read my book: "Always lead a trump" by Hans Werge|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: and give away the Q:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is ok too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nubmaster: If West shows 22-24 I really dont understand Easts 3NT... sure he has a 4333 but...|pg||
nt|hesse: wooops|pg||
nt|pelu: @D5 = @C back, @d6 neutral|pg||
nt|kjadams: at IMPs, overcompeting for part scores does not get punished as it does in match points.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jr7: @C 5 is a importent card|pg||
nt|ralfwil: contuínue with @c|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you continue @C you are not setting up @D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: North needed to have method to show a 2 suiter   certainly then south would have done a lot more|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: there is no good discard on dummy if S plays a @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but in junior bridge the sight of blood is common|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Gerben42:  i guess in 1NT you are more relaxed just need another @S|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|nt|hesse: the bad @h-break will be bad news|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have bid 3@D AS NORTH and would have doubled 2@C as south|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzct: he claimed not knowing about @c K|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  He did not need it: diamonds and spades provided enough discards|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: ohh right .. did not see @s :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump is necessary now|pg||
nt|hawe45: With 7 HCP it seemed the ONLY lead possible - going for a @D-ruff...?|pg||
nt|kemperg: not too difficult|pg||
nt|roswolf: no taking out dummy's side entry could have been important too|pg||
nt|pelu: easy for us, but I exp that Grönkvist will find out|pg||
pc|c4|nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sadisme pure, West has long time ago decided to play @H - wants to give South som hope|pg||
nt|kemperg: :))|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4333 with three unsupported honors and the 4 card suit is terrible. it is easy to understand, even if u dont agree|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hesse: minor play now will give -2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  enough tricks but no way to take then|pg||

nt|jr7: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Claimed 8:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i wonder how 1@Dx or 1@Hx would have done|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 5@c seems  to make here altho hengs on @cK in place..|pg||
nt|jr7: Told ya :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: West had to ditch the @H losers on @S and @CK - overtake @SQ|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best play - could discard 2 @H on black Kings|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s may well try 4@S|pg||
nt|hawe45: A fair 4 @S, one down because of the bad @H-break|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting possibilities here|pg||
nt|ady: routine 3NT for e/w|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Nice act by Dennis but agree with you Geoffrey... that was some underbids by NS here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|pelu: unlucky for EW if they bid 71D and find @Ds 3-0|pg||
nt|milton_se: unlucky 3-0 break in @Ds sets a good grand|pg||
nt|yuval10: very unlucky grand here|pg||
nt|pelu: N cant play @DJ = 2 discards for @c-losers|pg||
nt|hesse: 1NT= 9-12|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i very much like this mini NT at this vuln.|pg||
nt|sater1957: THis prob is 3NT, not playing well|pg||
nt|granguru: 1NT is probable the best play here--not easy to stop there|pg||
nt|jr7: I have bid pass on S|pg||
nt|jr7: or 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: ;)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice direct auction there|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: 6@s is enough|pg||
nt|hesse: this opening will help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol 2 bid auction?|pg||
nt|roswolf: an invite or punt?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might take some liberties here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: would u bid 1@H in N - for me an easy 1@H - good suit |pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think N will join the bidding|pg||
nt|hesse: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely 3 nt here |pg||
nt|hedyg: and finding @hs|pg||
nt|peachy: The trick is, to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|peachy: or any NT :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV - punt...|pg||
nt|roswolf: YES the cards are spitting against n/s|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10 tricks in spades, but you have to bid to get there.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have opened the north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: indeed he did|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at favourable it is acceptable to give up some bidding precision to make opponent's life tough|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S looks like a good save against 5D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hesse: bold call from west|pg||
nt|blum1956: The defense needs the club lead to beat this|pg||
nt|granguru: 24 combined points and only 6 visiblee tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: a natural invite - hmm a rare bird nowadays|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry, have to leave you soon, big golftournament waiting for me|pg||
nt|woozle: Although Grokvist isn't helping by forgetting to raise|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S have lots of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: what do you think of norths opening bid?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|fabsayc: fits the system|pg||
nt|pelu: its there system - so..:)|pg||
nt|ady: might get overboard here|pg||
nt|jr7: 2nt must show @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: true kieran|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has another chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: @D lead = 7 tricks|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: 3s better be forcing though, not clear to me it should be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  normal contract reached though|pg||
nt|hesse: and a very aggressive double from north|pg||
nt|jr7: sorry 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 8 if @c guess |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h presumably shows some values|pg||
nt|sharkey: i miscounted - think you have to invite with 9 vs 15-17|pg||
nt|sharkey: just have to locate @CJ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah in my youthful days there was no such thing as an invite|pg||
nt|roswolf: as does south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i trust the young norwegian team will benefit from this experience|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Only 800 vs 1370, amazing 4@d bid...|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 2 @D sort of slowed everything down |pg||
nt|kemperg: surely with two important 9''\s:)|pg||
nt|pelu: we will see no bids from W!|pg||
nt|roswolf: not today looking forward to lunch!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may see a low ht lead |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s were paralyzed here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nubmaster: Well, it is juniors...|pg||
nt|ady: slam mainly on diamond finesse and brake|pg||
nt|jr7: He can not win this 3NT - I think so! :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  probably best try is to duck a @C and hope for good breaks elsewhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which of course are not there|pg||
nt|sater1957: I was just wondering if EW, top of their form, can let this make....|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, by either side, actually|pg||
nt|kjadams: I would have overcalled South for sure, and opened North depending on partnership.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have at least overcalled spades,  even if pard didnt open|pg||
nt|ianmcc: South has a 6-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: N has a passed partner, but still: 4@D for major is not in my book :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might regret his 4@d bid if his team-mates bids to the grand on the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: but of course it's a great result|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But N thought that... (my partner passed and I have 6 p in non vul and 5440... let's make a try to preempt)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Hans this is a good start :)|pg||
nt|jr7: maybee first a small @H from both hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  beer card in first trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I meant N or S|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for the @d suit..|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Might get a dbl here..?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT over 2@s would have described the hand perfectly in N|pg||
nt|hawe45: This lead, declarer would have loved - being in 4 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and he can complain to pd: u sh have Q10 in @C not in @d :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 3@c @s KQ and J back for @h J ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 1100 then :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Now youre faddish :) But it is correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  and finding a place for declarer's third spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: i assume that 2@H by E shows a good raise in @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know how young n/s are?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Under 20 :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: then probably lack of experience|pg||
nt|roswolf: gf checkback i assume|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: asking for the minor and the bid @S either F or strong invit depending on agreements|pg||
nt|jr7: 5@C = 1 ace|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  can only count on about 10 HCP from partner, two Aces might not beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: What a waste!|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  gotta be a prize for that too|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  duck a @H next|pg||
nt|granguru: 8 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|sater1957: could this lead to a @h @c squeeze on East?|pg||
nt|granguru: playing @HAK and @D...fouble dummy of course|pg||
nt|granguru: double*|pg||
nt|granguru: now he needs only @C 3-3 to get 9|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  is it that double dummy? W bid @S and led @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think the best play is ducking a @c but will not succed this time|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what does he have|pg||
nt|jr7: after @D lead he know the hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  duck @C and duck @S - gotta get your loser count right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but W can have a 2-card @c and a stiff @h|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  probably best is to duck TWO @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  lose 2@D 2@S and turn the table on E|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: take @h ace and play @h Q back to maximize|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: 2@D rebid kept them out of trouble    some might rebid 3@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: 9s wud be upgraded to game...|pg||
nt|kemperg: you mkust be younger then me:)|pg||
nt|pelu: have to knock out @CA and then finess to N - to keep S out of his long @ss|pg||
nt|roswolf: style over substance - hippys and the summer of love :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|granguru: @S7?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this wasn´t a winning line|pg||
nt|jr7: intra-finess in @H and 3@S maybee 9 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Nope, seems to be 630 now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: ohh well..:)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not now then|pg||
nt|hedyg: who will let them play 3@s?|pg||
nt|kemperg: w won't be happy seeing the dummy:(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
nt|hesse: good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok excellent auction|pg||
nt|blum1956: still may switch to clubs|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  there isnt really one because you need EW help to rectify the count|pg||
nt|jr7: no one :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hesse: I would not have doubled with a pd showing 9-12|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @HK and play a @D?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: duplicated across the field no doubt (not)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vul may have put south off|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: pass in N and 2@C by S not so easy|pg||
nt|granguru: dont forget S does not know opponents exact distribution ...he can still expect @C 3-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  after the @D lead its safe to assume that is not the case|pg||
nt|granguru: it is against odds I agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another @S seems best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some players use Lebensohl (2NT) in these auctions. That has a weakness in that if opener raises responder's suit, it can be awkward for the defence to sort out which suit they ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: have and whether to bid on or not      |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42:  @C 3-3?|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??|pg||
nt|roswolf: age memories:)|pg||
nt|pelu: S tryed to make a "smart" defense, but with @Cq in dummy?? |pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: in standard 2c by south and later splinter by north accomplishes the same|pg||
nt|kemperg: no clue why|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt need a place for 3rd sp |pg||
nt|ianmcc: now a club|pg||
nt|ady: prefer diamonds immediately     because of spade switch|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Gerben42:  W cant lead @S back so will turn on @H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: another diamond....|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jr7: No more @S|pg||
nt|pelu: place sweden Ew then Pass i N and 2@H in East - and then bid trouble for NS|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 more is Ok - can still ruff 2 x@C and discard on @DAK|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont think he will win - @D 4-3 and @C 5-3 or catch @DJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has to ruff 2 clubs and tak pitches before drawing rest of trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: he will make - a bet? :) a coke?|pg||
nt|jr7: Y|pg||
nt|fabsayc: make mine bourbon and coke|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  very close contract - down 1|pg||
nt|hesse: but well defended, and 200 instead of 100 for Sweden :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: should play a spade in order to create an illusion|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim now|pg||
nt|pelu: just a gift to decl|pg||
nt|hawe45: East can say: My faute, I should have bid 2 @D...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|sybarra: he got a spade lead and has 3 sp tricks|pg||
nt|ady: hearts were 3-3   and jack could have been doubleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer not claiming?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not going to get killed in 1 @S |pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42:  then you play @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hesse: Sweden won 11 imps on their good 6@s in board 17|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: not that it will matter|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jr7: V has only 13 cards - dont play @C|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Certainly... now N knows that Vest isn't afraid of @c's|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: why is East wasting time - cant get rid of @D loser - Next...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: West|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: also chances of a club trick    apart from the opening spade lead   and a possible opening heart lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: win some time:(|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hesse: and they are now ahead|pg||
nt|hesse: west have to play @d to the 10 now, but that will fail|pg||
nt|blum1956: If South has a club less and a spade more the contract could come home. But it may be 2 off if declarer plays for that distribution|pg||
nt|hesse: west probably counting points now, and find that south has to have @dK|pg||
nt|woozle: hey...sarcasm is usually my job|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
nt|hawe45: Welcoma then|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: just to prove that 4@S could'nt win :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (most likely) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|blum1956: No reason for the diamond finesse, the @dK being with South for sure|pg||
nt|hesse: yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: ok 2 cokes and a bourbon on stake - tx :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jr7: play safe|pg||

nt|sater1957: no|pg||

nt|henryb:  In a hypothetical slam, declarer needs to pick up diamonds and find another trick. Lots of chances to find it, but ...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt?|pg||
nt|granguru: nevertheless very well played by S|pg||
nt|sater1957: 6@c probably best slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 13 tricks|pg||
nt|jr7: 14 tricks because @DD is falling|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT is the best slam|pg||
nt|jr7: OK - first time I do this - have mutch to learn|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if North had @HK he would be endplayed - but that doesn't leave much for South |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@C 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: once saw zia take an hour to bid and play 1 hand played the next 7(!) in 4mins!|pg||
nt|roswolf: unclear but should be good for n/s?|pg||
nt|woozle: certainly a plus position...only way to do better is to double 5D and beat it|pg||
nt|hawe45: 10 top-tricks in 4 @S with THAT lead - as I saw it|pg||
nt|roswolf: now lets see if n/s get into the auction|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Gerben42:  routine to reach another hopeless 4@h|pg||

nt|hesse: no we will see a @d bid, since @c already taken|pg||
nt|hesse: 2@d may be a good start?|pg||
nt|jr7: but how many|pg||
nt|jr7: a good 6 NT or @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S shud be off 1 - NS may make 5@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may regret that 4@S e/w is decent|pg||

nt|sharkey: what's N to do here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah not many are brave enough to penalise the great man|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass|pg||
nt|pelu: she could X and then bid 3@H = invit|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Allready -1 at that point :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2D 1H 1S 1C|pg||
nt|roswolf: north doubles?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx Andreas|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet he doesnt |pg||
nt|roswolf: a coke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: a clear dbl in my book... non vull- vs vull|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure  |pg||
nt|sybarra: mimosa more like it pls|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: East has 15 HCP, and a terrible rebid problem if it starts 1C P 1S.    I would start that hand with 1N if playing 15-17 NT.|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|kjadams: the actual 1H response has saved him punishment.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north thinking?|pg||
nt|kjadams: her|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  s will accept an inv.|pg||
nt|sater1957: sorry I meant 7@C is best grand|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S, 1 ruff in dummy, 3 @H - and 2 @C|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 3S is a puppet to 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Yes i think so|pg||
nt|kemperg: must be|pg||
nt|woozle: Bilde might take the opportunity to double, although it won't help|pg||
nt|roswolf: you win shirley|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt seems sensible now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: a bit on the aggressive side, I thnk "good" is an overbid without seeing all hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: S lets at least raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score  spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|sater1957: diamond ruff possibility|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  requires 4-3 break - not so good|pg||
nt|hedyg: good because J@H drops?|pg||

nt|pelu: ok :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow 4!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|kemperg: take the short cut|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: would you bid 2@h in south?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: club lead to beat|pg||
nt|pelu: do u need a @C-lead to defeat 5@h?|pg||
nt|hesse: south considers his options|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not seem a double would be lightner |pg||
nt|fabsayc: more likely south thinking of 6d|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  why not?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess N-S do not play Drury|pg||
nt|sater1957: I said best, not good....|pg||
nt|granguru: ditto|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  something for the Norwegians - there is a history with them|pg||
nt|woozle: Bilde does double, but the strong EW spade pips wil protect them from the lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: E could pass the double|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double sequence - for the Law freaks|pg||
nt|ady: sequence should show strong than immediate 1NT overcall|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kjadams: 2H is a slight underbid and a close 4H is missed.|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|nubmaster: And a @d lead which makes it easy for N|pg||
nt|nubmaster: y|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Hans van Staveren|pg||
nt|blum1956: Does North know South's hand??|pg||
nt|sater1957: hello|pg||
nt|ady: probably spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if 2 @C is drury bid, or if clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Maria's and Matias System|pg||
nt|hedyg: great! ty Andreas :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the real game try - let the man TRY to make it|pg||
nt|kemperg: see what W does|pg||
nt|hawe45: Double of 3 @S = I do´nt think, that a @D-lead is good for us...|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT was 22-24|pg||
nt|hawe45: Service-double, it´s called...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: the alert on 1@S = 9+ black cards|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3NT might work, probably a @h lead from S and then it's diffucult to defeat|pg||
nt|nubmaster: difficult|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D very favorable|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: with 4-4 in @c+@s East has to rebid 1NT - not my style, but very popular  among some "experts"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plenty of work to do even after i heart lead i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Was not alerted so..|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: problebly @c|pg||
nt|jr7: what now - 4@D color or cue?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: No alert.. but then again it is on 4'th level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: We all know people who would bid 2@h as South over 1@s |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: To high now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jr7: 5@H could be very wrong - gambling :)|pg||
nt|pelu: @DA and @d will cost NS a number|pg||
nt|ady: spades kind so should do well|pg||
nt|hedyg: can you get NS as well?|pg||
nt|woozle: I note that EW can send back 3S and make it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzct: Hagen was about to lead when pd did it ;)|pg||
nt|sater1957: This is with screens, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: yes|pg||
nt|granguru: N hand is worth 25 points..If 2NT is a nat bid, it does not make honor to it... |pg||
nt|sater1957: Thyen alerts above 3NT also need to be made|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yuval10: those guys are aggressive alright|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make - lose 2@C and a @D|pg||
nt|pelu: why 2 @Cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm east knows his fate|pg||
nt|nubmaster: West must discard the right black suit now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Aggression is ok if you have something to be aggressive with |pg||
nt|mdgraham: like a large stick, for example |pg||
nt|woozle: and it's a youth game - I expect no less|pg||
nt|kemperg: not without risk, could give 3@S x +??|pg||
nt|hawe45: But it works well now - I must admit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|granguru: Said...|pg||
nt|granguru: the 2NT produced this disaster|pg||
nt|roswolf: the power of the beer card|pg||
nt|pelu: hi I am called to Open room :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: Bye Peter|pg||
nt|hawe45: Shall North kill the @C-entry or go for a miracle in @D???|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sater1957: South's call is slighly pessimistic, but as it happens rightly so on this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  welcome Hans - if the computer makes mad distributions - it's Hans' fault as he wrote one of the most used computer dealing programs in the world|pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: in my opp u mis some @s-partscores and the gain is very ??|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks at least I would think|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: may well make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jr7: Raulund shows 22+|pg||
nt|ady: now time for 2 club finesses|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: sry - 1 @C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hesse: 2@d is a bit too hard when @d K is 3 of 9 points yes, but with the points elsewhere south may show a good raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/CCSS.pdf|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

pc|h5|nt|jr7: 4 clubloosers|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|Gerben42:  South was spot on with 2@H, I would have guessed N might bid again |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|granguru: it was then s mistake|pg||
nt|ady: and west under pressure from the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: super cruch time|pg||
nt|roswolf: crunch|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 180|pg||
nt|ady: is east on lead with 2 winning diamonds?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Ohh well.. you found it :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Normally, it often pays to cover with a doubleton, here as well|pg||

nt|hedyg: great , thanks|pg||
nt|jr7: if E had @S 7 he had to cover|pg||
nt|peachy: The six seems to be good enough as well|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: surprise   only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kjadams: good bye spade losers.|pg||

nt|hesse: north maybe passed due to all the small @ds?|pg||
nt|hesse: but surely worth a gameinvite|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 9.. He claimed wrong.. and so did i:)|pg||
nt|sater1957: South probably thought 4NT was minimum|pg||
nt|granguru: if 2@D doesnt show a positive hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT was a bit on the heavy side..|pg||
nt|jr7: sorry - yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Small brake here..|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Break*|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: very nice play acculy!|pg||
nt|roswolf: more fun |pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C or 3 NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 6@c might win here ;)?|pg||
nt|roswolf: north needs restraint here|pg||
nt|ady: seems 11 tricks   |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Dennis laughthing a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: i think he did not touch @D becouse he did not want to squezze his pd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: N "knows" that W cannot have 6c @d with KQJxxx and also the ace of @s |pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@H where S "forgot" to tahe @SA - 11 imp for Norway - sh have been +5 for Sweden - sp @sA to 16 IMP :)|pg||
nt|hesse: yes, Norway played 3@c-1|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway stopped in 6@s in open room|pg||
nt|jr7: normaly must say 2@D|pg||
nt|sater1957: come on, defend one....|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  apparently the story of the grand slam on the 4-2 fit is no longer online|pg||
nt|jr7: 8 tricks in 2@S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C 1@S 3@C P, 3@S P 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: based on what we have seen from N/S that should be no problem,|pg||
nt|sybarra: if this goes X south will sit |pg||
nt|roswolf: caution ofter pays|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 1@h 2@c 3@c or pass on N?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42:  now we can ask if N should raise - I say no|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: "Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far". Theodore Roosevelt, Chicago, 1903 |pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, did his very best|pg||
nt|hawe45: But no overtricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Geoffry, I can leave now, must be on the first tee in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|roswolf: doubt it will be bid|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Nice paly by Tor but Emil should've played the K in @s of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont like that double|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20  |pg||
mb|1N|nt|hesse: (board 5)|pg||
nt|jr7: why not 2@D in N|pg||
nt|sater1957: not if the last board is an indication|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it will not go X  |pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: and a 13 imp gain for the grand slam|pg||
nt|granguru: NS might win 3NT here|pg||
nt|kjadams: double would be takeout if playing negative doubles, so west stuck.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: vul and no singleton, bad bid :)|pg||
nt|hesse: I think pass is the best bid in north|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  did W penalty pass?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks all, see you again soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  wow N will like this|pg||
nt|sater1957: all the more reason for North not to raise :-)|pg||
nt|granguru: 5@D 2@S and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|granguru: with a lucky lie of the cards....|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  might stay in 2@Sx also|pg||
nt|sater1957: Can go two down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Dbl must show a penalty pass of 1@H|pg||
nt|granguru: which will permit them to win 3@D 2@S and 2@C now in defense|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont think Dbl mens @H - he bid 2@C - after pas - Yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: N must compete to 2@s, he knows about the 8 cards fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: not that defending will be so bad for NS either...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2!Q = 20-21 bal|pg||
nt|hawe45: 1 @H from North - NO comments...|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ah - for the lead...|pg||
nt|roswolf: routine junior vul overcall isnt it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: and opposite a passed pard too|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will play very well|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Gerben42:  quite a view, @H65 are not good intermediates|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah the pitiful crutch of Bob H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: practical 3NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But what is better than x?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42:  still this is not made yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: I would have preferred 2NT with West's hand|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  looks ok for n/s  but will have to contend with a bad side suit split|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 6+ @ss or 17+ any|pg||
nt|roswolf: science being applied|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@C|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = 20+|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 4@c!!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: and bad @D breaka as well |pg||
nt|roswolf: slam try|pg||
nt|roswolf: well judged but will west co-operate?|pg||
nt|hawe45: This (1 @H) moves the probability for making 6 @C a winner. More likele K x in North, than 10 x in South|pg||
nt|roswolf: he should imo with his shape and crisp major controls|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Td saying we are passed half time mark..|pg||
nt|hesse: @s lead had probably been better|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|jr7: OK - 1 nt Better :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Gerben42:  btw its in spanish but here is the story from Helgemo & Groetheim: http://jredard.blogspot.com/2008/06/grand-slam-en-el-fit-4-2.html|pg||
nt|granguru: but they must hurry their tricks in order not to give W the chance to  discard on @HK|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sater1957: West put himself in a problem: calling 1NT, or optimistically 2NT at first round would solve his problem|pg||
nt|ady: the good news is that east will be ruffing with 3 trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm dont like the upgrade|pg||
nt|kemperg: I do|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: even with 2 keycards missing the overcall indicates finesses will work|pg||
nt|hawe45: Do they play the same system, E-W?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jr7: it crashes abyway|pg||
nt|granguru: juan pablo redard is a chilean player|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok , everybody knows W did NOT lead from the Q@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's good enough|pg||
nt|pelu: @S to J and @hJ back = first 5 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think north may progress|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think many would rebid 2 NT after 1@C - 1@S with Soth's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: :(|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42:  3NT is making EW|pg||
nt|pelu: ned to take @SK to win|pg||
nt|roswolf: all comes down to finesses|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 21C looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10 tricks at this point no problem.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: yes, that's enough bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jr7: anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 2@c 2 @s to lose...nice lead by East either way|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kemperg: 59 Kleinmann points = a good 19|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Not home yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: too good for a 2NT rebid in my system|pg||
nt|sharkey: and then guess where to get 9th trick from - @D finesse or @HA favorable|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 x @C and follow the discards - some information|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He was afraid of @h tru his hand so should play for @d Q then|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West likely to pitch @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: cash out a few winners shrug your shoulders and take the finesse like a man and :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: another @h to @dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The evening match at 19.30 local time will be Denmark U25 vs Sweden U20|pg||
nt|granguru: an uppercut might be produced here|pg||
nt|jr7: he play small from table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and N will discard|pg||
nt|granguru: but N must discard a @C if W ruffs high|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @dAK play @hQ and discard...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: E squeezed|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks are there   but North does not see what we see|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: he can take 5x@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: claim|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sharkey: just what grandma wud have done...|pg||
nt|kemperg: that will teach the lady:)|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like the @D-play - just to tell opp his problem|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kjadams: 11 now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: thats a claim |pg||
nt|nubmaster: You are "sort of" squeezed in the bidding with 16 balanced and Ax in opening suit and AJx in the other major|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: best chance now sh ? take @S and finess in @H = 6@s trick + 4@hs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade and rely on heart finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: It was i think|pg||
nt|hawe45: The clue is: Because of Norths genious 1 @H, they missed the smal...|pg||
nt|hawe45: slam|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|granguru: @DAK and @CQ|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 1NT might work but mostly you partner has so few points so it will be the final contract. And that time you miss the 44 in m or in worst case 4-3 in th other M. At least you might ...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: be able to ruff some on the shortest hand|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h5|nt|yuval10: now comes the Q@d and the hand will play itself|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hesse: he tested for single @hQ first|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now a chance for EW cash @D, give pd a ruff and draw trumps|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jr7: @S|pg||
nt|granguru: best|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Yes @s and if K/Q then duck|pg||

nt|vugraphzct: Wd!|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: on balance 1nt is a good place to play|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But I can agree... it will be difficult to show your 16 p balanced after the x|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: he can afford to lose 2 @s trick, better play them before opps manage to promote another |pg||

nt|roswolf: now danger lurks|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @D |pg||
nt|kjadams: perhaps the alert is "better than wjs?"|pg||
nt|ady: handf 18th  slam was not reached   but still Denmark piled on the imps playing 5@S   making wwhere e/w went  down 3 undoubled in 5@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jr7: good start|pg||

nt|roswolf: walking on eggshells|pg||
nt|ianmcc: would you wjs with 4 hearts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: playing 2/1 many would respond 2@H|pg||

mb|2N|nt|jr7: 2@D?|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: to come to 7 tricks S will play for the drop of @Dq|pg||
nt|sater1957: 4@s coming up|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if we play it here |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Lebensohl i do know ;) Ty Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: some play lebensohl, some rubensohl|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: I think so too.. But i did not say when he should take the finesse :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: if my hand bad enough, yes.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not much of a heart suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will now feel he might have underbid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  If you open the west hand you cannot game force with East|pg||
nt|yuval10: how to find the @s fit in EW....perhaps if E can bid 1@s as 4+|pg||
nt|pelu: here we are almost 3 boards late|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzct: This is where Maria should say ok.. if you cant play 3nt lets try 6@d :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mentioned Rubensohl because their CC says they play a lot of transfer bids|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont like Matias 1 nt - he had a good revers|pg||
nt|peachy: Neither of EW was able to count 12 top tricks, understandably|pg||
nt|hedyg: 16 is a bit short..|pg||
nt|peachy: The controls alone IMO speak strongly, so not too weak at all, combines with good suits|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT down on spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: in 3nt play iis interesting on a low spade lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hesse: E/W playing puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: good lead|pg||
nt|kjadams: this can make, but easy to imagine going down by playing too many trumps.|pg||
nt|ady: cant see how it can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Only way then is to hope E-W will mess up and Duck the first @s and hope next time it will be @s ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Or put @c ace by W :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hesse: west showing 4 card @s with his 3@h-bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: E was worth a 4NT bid here|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: So this will problebly be a big swing for sweeden..|pg||
nt|hedyg: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|peachy: EW must get a heart ruff, otherwise this will a very sad ending|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzct: Wow They might just do that!|pg||
nt|peachy: Sweden has a chance of big swing here if they get to the slam|pg||
nt|kjadams: needs to cross ruff the hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed i expect some 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: slightly more complicated than that east may have to unblock|pg||
nt|ady: now they have gone past 3NT   may settle in 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: no  |pg||
nt|nubmaster: S should duck the @s lead in tempo, then West might think that East have 4 and continue with the ace... this must be done quickly|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4nt is an excess of imagination|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jr7: 7@D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kjadams: down now.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956: NS with their 16 PC may probably make 4@h while for EW  8 tricks in spades is a top|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt anybody can get to a slam with the EW hands|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Double dummy it would have been better to let the @H run to dummy and play @S Q. IF West covers, North has 110|pg||
nt|kjadams: west should clear those trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: wondering if he should take care of @s K first|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: should just get home  though could make an overtrick ruff finessing the 3rd round of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N get out with club now? or ? |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will make his contract easily|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: even if small @d i think he would finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: Opening 1NT it will be difficult|pg||
nt|jr7: why not 1@C -> 2@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hesse: DJ in @h is not worth much for E/W in this deal|pg||
nt|nubmaster: no...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: problem was there is no sure fast entry to south hand on this line|pg||
nt|kjadams: this looks best for defense.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: declarer may feel foolish not playing Q@S if west has A@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: trivially down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kjadams: oops.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: and N will slip under the table?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|peachy: There should be a way to identify 12 top tricks, somehow :)|pg||
nt|jr7: why not try|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c7|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: he will not pass a 1@c opening either?|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ady: fortunate for n/s that 3NT does not make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: No, he wont|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4th trump while club blocked, and no free finesses would be better.|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: And endplay will be up on Rorhberg soon|pg||

nt|roswolf: 6@S by east looks the bid|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 4@C (splinter) but west only have 1 real H-card|pg||
nt|roswolf: being a junior it is automatic|pg||
nt|sharkey: If in 6@S East may ditch a @H on !K and play S for @HK....|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 5@d makes also when A@c is onside|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@S for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: on Ns hand I prefer to show a 2-suiter instead of dbl|pg||
nt|sater1957: will probably stay in patscore|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: C'mon Maria @c lead ;)|pg||
nt|jr7: Now they had to be sharp again :_ - but 4@S is good!|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Would be cool to see!|pg||
nt|hedyg: tststs  Andi, are you partial?|pg||
nt|hedyg: she will lead..........the A@S!|pg||
nt|roswolf: feisty bidding|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But as one spectator said, the @s's could break 44 with both aces in West's hand... nice to not put up the Q in that case :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: W had nothing to say, and E vulnerable against not.  Normallyu the hand with shortness in their suit has to be aggressive, but here, passing is normal, too risky to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Partial? i dont know.. im not rooting for anyone... but you must admit.. It would be cool to see perfect defence again:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOUTH WILL LEAD 1 OF HIS ACES I THINK|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: whatever 3@C is, i dont like it|pg||
nt|hesse: 1@d is showing @h|pg||
nt|pelu: but Carl - he dont need to find @HK - there are just 12 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: if so I'm still working on it Peter...:)|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff 4@ds in hand and disc a @H on @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: of course |pg||
nt|roswolf: initially a game try|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: If N could be tricky and remove the 6@s to 6nt so it will be playes on his hand it might win! :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a later @d bid will show a stronger 2-suiter as I bid|pg||
nt|granguru: 5@D is down because there is no fast entry to S hand|pg||
nt|jr7: Treldes 10 show @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: still can beat it|pg||
nt|ady: duck in both hands works only against 6-2 split  and west is more likely to have overcalled with 6 spades  even with no A@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: won't reach 6 now|pg||
nt|sharkey: sometimes we overlook the obvious|pg||
nt|roswolf: CLUCK CLUCK as my peers would say|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: maybe 3@C = any minimum? that's quite common these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the hand is not minimum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 54 automatically one extra trick|pg||
nt|athene: true, but as far as slam potential goes it's pretty bad, with those minor suits|pg||
nt|ady: club lead ducked best|pg||
nt|yuval10: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
nt|pelu: still only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: with 6 @Ss W could have bid 6 now|pg||
nt|sybarra: anyone a k cue on the way with S?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hesse: if 3@c=minimum, then north has to have a better bid over 3@d|pg||

pc|h6|nt|sater1957: 1S denying 3H, but what is 2@C?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 even|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would be tempted but temptation should be avoided more often than not|pg||
nt|kjadams: perhaps helpsuit game try?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|peachy: Well, Sweden "needed" this break :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: you don't risk your contract by playing @c towards the Q|pg||

nt|hawe45: Sorry, N/S are "end-played" for 140|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: 5@d can be made if N play a @s to dummy. @d are k54 to 7x so after @sJ dne @dJ and @d8, there is another @d entry or N can finess in @h|pg||

nt|vugraphzct: Some problem here with a bracke one of the players took.. Td has been called to table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: v friendly lie for 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Matias saying sry.. He did not notice that Andre had that good of a hand :) Case Closed!|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Strange bid anyway with 4504|pg||
nt|roswolf: bidding test for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand   likely 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D prob void-wood - so he has to bid 5@S - and now @DK for sure bas value|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: do u prefer 2Nt GF or Invit+? I am for GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c -2|pg||
nt|hedyg: but only if S bids them|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks all too easy to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H shud make...|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5,  the south got into bidding and the 4 @S was found|pg||
nt|ady: both 4@H and 3NT down to a club lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: 1@h - 2@c - 3@d - 3NT (?) - 4@c...|pg||
nt|jr7: 3@D must bee nat|pg||
nt|yuval10: X can help, now that West knows his K@s is probably well-placed and that opp also has values in @d|pg||
nt|nubmaster: An interesting deal here... 4@h is one down but 4@s has good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 1@c by Flått! wow|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a modern 1@S bid (denying @S)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 4@d....|pg||
nt|jr7: much better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the East hand is huge|pg||
nt|yuval10: with AQ @c and Q@s E should go to 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, huge cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: i wonder how many @c's did the 2@c promised|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hedyg: Andi?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@SX would be bloody|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: west will bid again|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be not - stuck with 2 @C losers...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With this lead, West must take the @S-finesse, good luck|pg||
nt|kjadams: Do you Invite or bid game with west cards?|pg||
nt|roswolf: invite|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hesse: I prefer GF|pg||
nt|hesse: or maybe not...|pg||
nt|jr7: only 4|pg||
nt|yuval10: some pairs who plays 2/1 prefer playing 2@c as 2+ , whereas 2@d is 5+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@c seems slightly wimpy. West did bid 4D, after all|pg||
nt|nubmaster: East must discard on the third club|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: pass now I hope...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: GF for me so can go slow and find out everything, use some other bid for invites|pg||
nt|jr7: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|jr7: 2@D = 4.color|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  doubtful W has shown his hand with 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub17/Turneringer/Resultat924.html  results from last night's round 1|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  that's the point of 1@S|pg||
nt|sater1957: N should have bid enough....|pg||
nt|ady: 8 tricks likely |pg||
nt|hedyg: undo pls|pg||
nt|roswolf: will end up in 4@H I reckon|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|granguru: S needs a little more form the Western Cue bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Ty sry..|pg||
nt|hedyg: np|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh well|pg||
nt|yuval10: should've done a lot more, maybe the X made him affraid of distributions|pg||
nt|roswolf: another tiger double|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 aces and1 king was enough on the last board|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be an endplay on S - x may give clue|pg||
nt|sybarra: depends on what pard is like |pg||
nt|sybarra: or what his/her opening bids are like|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: With all his 10 and 9's i would bid 3.. especially in team|pg||
nt|roswolf: or both:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: for me, depends on partner.   Opposite sound opener,  12 and 12 is better than even money game.|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Smolen|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4c with 5c @h and FG|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to bid a 7 card fit to game with an 8 card fit available in other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Good|pg||
nt|pelu: after 4. suit (for me GF) 3Nt is the weakest bid in the book (11-12)|pg||
nt|hesse: I normally prefer 2NT as the stronger hand after 4th suit |pg||
nt|jr7: so must 4.color = game|pg||
nt|pelu: tes|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Sabine Auken's advice is to bid 2C over their 1D whenever it is remotely possible, few partnerships are well equipped to bid over that|pg||
nt|jr7: @DQ ??? - now they can clean the other colors|pg||
nt|jr7: sorry - no|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: im guessing @d ace was a downer on his minimum hand..|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a bid bunch|pg||
nt|sybarra: *big bunch|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: But dont understand W's 4NT bid with 4333, what has he shown first two rounds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 2nt showed 14+|pg||
nt|hesse: but my prefered system makes my rebid 2@s after the @h response to show reverse with this distribution|pg||
nt|pelu: when u play WJS (weak jump shift) - here 2@H first time, then 3@H would be forcing and a better bid for Ns hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: i think only 27 minuts left for these 5 boards not sure tho..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C only slam that makes|pg||
nt|pelu: only slam with a chance is 6@C, but - as I se - a @S lead will defeat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is to knock out late entry to dummy, yes spade leads beat 6@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: really?|pg||
nt|sharkey: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: and will play it from the wrong side|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree, it's easy for us commentators... at the table none whould bid the 4-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: all very normal ish|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: wow great judgment|pg||
nt|roswolf: these guys have a lot going for them|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: declarer wont like that|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nubmaster: Oh, I see, only 14+ vs a GF 2-over-1 bid I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: ya|pg||
nt|hesse: south makes a practical bid, but he will probably go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  you think Hamman would have bid 1@S - 2@S again 50 years ago?|pg||
nt|sater1957: no ruffs for EW, this should come in|pg||
nt|ady: I think a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Holy s__t, think it's a bidding error here that turns out to a success|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nubmaster: Then I agree with his last slamtry|pg||
nt|athene: might make on a major-suit squeeze against west|pg||
nt|athene: ....ok, or on a diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|jr7: UPS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|blum1956: diabolic lead! Now the trump switch beats the contract|pg||
nt|granguru: @DK instead of @CK would have been better|pg||
nt|granguru: and the 4333 pattern diminishes S hand value as I am correctly told|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry -2|pg||
nt|jr7: he had to find the Lady|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W is really a minimum for a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|yuval10: and if you're making a slam against a mere minimum....|pg||
nt|roswolf: she will assume a game swing away|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: was it 2@c over 1@d only or any suit?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: usually you lead passively against 6nt but perhaps there was a case for an active lead here with dummy known to have a trick source in hearts|pg||
nt|hesse: Hagen with a very aggressive and unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|athene: but still south insisting on notrumps he really has to have a double diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes now...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well  |pg||
nt|nubmaster: now E is squeezed|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|peachy: Over 1D|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He should have ruffed @c ace|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: he was afraid of the hearts but i think there were clues to normal passive lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CK first|pg||
nt|roswolf: no needed to cash the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He should have drawed @c  K to win|pg||
nt|roswolf: club exit is very obvious|pg||
nt|roswolf: why the thought?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR decl in trick 2 played @D10 from dummy to King and S then had 2 exit-cards in@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: south is likely to do the wrtong thing if he thinks for much longer|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: but the pace of play is far too slow - |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: never knock the lucky player - Napoleon would make him a general|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|Gerben42:  too late now but nice move by Gundesen|pg||
nt|hesse: yes, he found the magic lead|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry small @D to J and later @D to 10 and @HJ to king - and was endplayed to open @Cs from hand - not the best play when S has overcalled|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3 impsto Denmark|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42:  I didn't know Faroe had a bridge team, let alone a junior team - I'm impressed|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Only 50,000 inhabitants|pg||

nt|roswolf: whoops |pg||
nt|ady: still needed making     though could have done it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzct: Niklas had minium points not values.. but 4@d showed shortness and im guessing he downgraded @d ace at that point|pg||

nt|vugraphzct: N now complaining a lillte to pd asking him *How many @s did you have:)?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Complaining? The only contract that had a chance... lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: needed a spade lead versus 6nt also to break up any squeeze|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway did not find the @s lead in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H or X?|pg||
nt|jr7: 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|peachy: That is the age-old question.  For me, I bid 1S when 5-4 and Dbl when 4-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: the TD should just take the bds away and fine both sides|pg||
mb|2H|an|alert|nt|ady: might get Q@C lead|pg||

nt|granguru: good luck|pg||
nt|roswolf: pards are like that:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He was not angry at all :) a kinda happy way to say to pd that he bid 4@s on a 4-3 fit knowing they had 5-3|pg||
mb|2S|an|alert|nt|athene: actually maybe 6nt was cold anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: No - West has to discard after S - so no @s-@d squeeze|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= @D+@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: there was a three suit squeeze without spade lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: might |pg||
nt|henryb:  Q or low makes no difference|pg||
nt|ady: with the diamond situation should make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I like Fit Jumps in competition, takes away room and allows to identify side fit if any|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: I would dbl.. giving pd some cards so he can bid his suit.. |pg||
nt|hedyg: W pulling the emergency brakes|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely E in the tank|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I would have found 2 @H  or multi on S |pg||
nt|kjadams: agree, and look at how hard the auction would be after 2H!|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Yes a Sound suit so defently worth a multi or weak jump shift bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes getting the first blow in is often vital|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzct: an easy dbl from Mikael in my book..|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: Information and results og this Championship can be found here: http://www2.bridge.dk/NBU.aspx?ID=5456|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the 3-suit squeeze might work even on a spade lead but it doesn't quite|pg||
nt|blum1956: There was time to recover - it is not necessary to make a FIRST spade lead|pg||
nt|hesse: so this could be a crucial point of the match|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  double game swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7@D even better than 6|pg||
nt|roswolf: blue card gone out of fashion|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nubmaster: If 1NT shows at least 2c @h, do you agree bidding 2@h over 1Nt?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not N|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: A good 7@d and an even better 6@d ;)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this auction isnt going ell|pg||
nt|roswolf: well|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think those @h should be suppressed|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/v,  just too good to pass up a 2 level bid,  (such a junk hand) |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: im guessing maria is to strong for 4@s(ofcourse) and to weak for 3@s so she is taking the middle row :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might just close up shop with 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Slam only need  club queento be found|pg||
nt|hedyg: no! not a good grand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Both hengs on same so might aswell bid 7|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's more of a X than the last board...|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Exacly :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You need some fairly firm agreements about splinter jumps in that kind of auction - one requirement should be a pretty good first suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: better is normally to lead second high from xxxx(x)|pg||
nt|jr7: and Dbl gave them the way :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @ds no worse than 3-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm perhaps he would|pg||
nt|ady: this looks at least 1 too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: What was the x from E?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: no Andi|pg||
nt|sybarra: the cue and we are off! |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4D here should be an "inferential Q-bid"|pg||
nt|roswolf: WHERE TO?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west wont be enthused|pg||
nt|kjadams: lets see if west on same wave length.|pg||
nt|roswolf: DISRESPECT FOR OPPS|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: goes all out and played hearts twice from the north hand  can make 11   but that is too risly|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: The power of controls again (Aces and kings and good suits)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|nubmaster: A fairly good tr and points in only two suits will often be better in tr play|pg||
nt|pelu: 76-27 is a big diff - but in 3 boards U20-team has lost 57 IMPs on tecnical errors - board 18 cost 22 - the 6@S was home but.. -11/+11|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In fact the decl only finessed @h ONCE Peter on the 6@s board... amazing, he had entries|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but lead comes thru strong hand & 5332 is not that good for suit play, and your outside queen is in pds suit so maybe 4-5 tricks ther|pg||
nt|jr7: who has @CQ|pg||
nt|granguru: so here N goes with the odds playing the @CJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe he was|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: not everyone uses bw with void |pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  Only risky if West, strangely, did not lead a @h from AQJxx|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42:  yes - not bad getting 790 when opps are cold for a grand|pg||

nt|granguru: and losing  at rick|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd,  (not sure I want to be in 7 on finesse) |pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: however i dislike the 5@D bid, there is no rush! bid 3@H and lets see|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 6 Sweden as NS was pushed to 5@h - but got an reward - a X so +5IMP for sweden - why X when u exp down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice @D cue by E |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Give east @d 9 and 7@s is a 100% Slam? |pg||
nt|ady: club back now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kjadams: do not follow that logic.|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Or very close... ofcourse @s could be 5-0 or some other suit besides @h sitting bad..|pg||

nt|ady: wonder how 3NT was reached in OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: a chance for a swing here in favour of Denmark|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: They have chosen to play fast now..:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm not sure of that logic 52.5% is the true odds i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: No way.. give east @d 9 and should be close to 100% |pg||
nt|roswolf: but with goodeyesight sure 1000%|pg||
nt|kjadams: on BBO, some of my opponents are 100% on 2 way finesses, but not most.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be interesting in a macabre way|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957: the latter I am afraid|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @C-2 nt -3nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  East was in a "mystery squeeze". Did not know whether South had four hearts AK or three diamonds A|pg||
nt|yuval10: East on the OR didn't jump with the A@c for the defeating @d switch|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: have to guess spades though|pg||
nt|granguru: they must read Lajos Linczmayer "Natural therapy for defense disorders" |pg||
nt|kemperg: missed 1 trick, trump promotion|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42:  1@D = @H again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N can Dbl this for T/O|pg||
nt|granguru: a must for players who pretend to be top players|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a lucku 3nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting. Presumably Easy led a spade against 3NT - so how did it make....   |pg||
nt|yuval10: E didn't jump with the A@c when N smartly played @c frum dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, East only has one entry |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s got uncomfortably high in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only North has an opening bid - but let´s what happens, before he is in turn...|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 dueces in S,  will takea that hand in poker any day |pg||
nt|roswolf: south has a classic pass|pg||
mb|r|nt|pelu: no can discard a @S on 4. @c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a well hidden clue but maybe legit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  probably 1@H shows that |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|hedyg: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|peachy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card, if anyone wants to see what the @D7 in last trick means :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmm i am not too certain about that|pg||
nt|roswolf: but alls well that ends well|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes pass |pg||
nt|roswolf: north needs caution|pg||
nt|sybarra: pass should warn N |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: I mean... Lets say you play 7nt.. it hengs on lets say 4 finesses.. You can finnesse both ways on all of them.. That should be 100%?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east waits for any indiscretion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: lucky... my keyboard can´t spell:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Nothing - where are the juniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957: NS in possible trouble|pg||
nt|ady: north opened 1@C open room  east passed  and south responded 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would double also with N hand|pg||
nt|granguru: a 344 pages book which analyzes all defensive signals situations...a marvelous book|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you were faster, sry|pg||
nt|roswolf: the fast play i mean|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a pooibility    but defence can take 2 diamond ruffs and 2 hearts  |pg||
mb|3S|nt|nubmaster: try @c first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this should keep EW out of game|pg||
nt|hesse: 2@c shows a good raise in @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not diamonds?|pg||
nt|hesse: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: u still have lot of sopades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh, sry Peter :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: no, 100% means you can't go down taking normal lines, does not assume seeing all the cards.|pg||
nt|roswolf: there might even be a tiger double|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: That's  why I strictly prefer the systems with 11-16 opening range - in that kind of system the 5@d (or4@s) bid from South after partner's double is clear|pg||
nt|ady: trying some evasive action if e/w had game    not wise red against green|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11-13 balancing 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 100% means you have AKQ AKQ AKQ AKQJ for example in 7nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 2@c probably showing equal legth in the two unbid suits|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this auction is why transfer walsh belongs on the front page of the int. CC|pg||
nt|hedyg: N a bit optimistic|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that seemed to peter out quickly|pg||
nt|hawe45: This might bring a +-score N/S. But rememberm that @C´s are 3-3 and the King on-side|pg||
nt|kjadams: yes  :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well nicely judged by south|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: u dont get to discard a spade from S hand on the long club in S hand|pg||
nt|milton_se: better payoff in this :)|pg||
nt|jr7: I play 1-3 from sequence|pg||
nt|granguru: dont forget this tip if you are an expert and want to became a world champion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should probably duck this|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s need to show suits|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hesse: I got the systemcard here, and they have specified this auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: they did|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jr7: small spade from S|pg||
nt|roswolf: eexcept the Hideous Hog of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: The what?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hesse: the 3@s looks hard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then over 2s west should try with 3d not 3s|pg||
nt|sater1957: should be a wash afte3r all|pg||
nt|jr7: E had to use @SK|pg||
nt|roswolf: suprised e/w sold out at these colors|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H suit preference for diamond|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45: Too late - this trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: Victor Mollo character |pg||
nt|sybarra: HH|pg||
nt|roswolf: a famous fictional bridge character|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He Can finesse @h  so should make|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you havent read Mollo you MUST |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Never hear dog him..|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: Whn all or most of the HCP outstanding are in one hand, it is wise to bid to aggressive bames, but I think N went too far in that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: of*|pg||
nt|kjadams: any book by Victor Mollo is a must read!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he teaches great bridge in a fun way|pg||
nt|roswolf: only the Rueful Rabbit is better but then he eats chocalate almond biscuits|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Gerben42:  well a bit tough to dDbl NS in their 8-card fit|pg||
nt|peachy: games|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pelu: down 1 if EW dont open the @C-suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: the 5@D in OR look like a misunderstanding - 4@D x by N and many players would just pass in S|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: If he had a source of tricks in a five card suit or some other redeeming feature, then fine|pg||
nt|peachy: but he only has three tricks|pg||
nt|jr7: come on @D9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: but East almost endplayed now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow |pg||
nt|jr7: bad|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West had to play low. Not easy|pg||
nt|jr7: only chance to play low|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Defence is difficult, isn't it......|pg||
nt|hawe45: Cross-ruff-lesson now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: 9 tricks   will lose a club|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  If declarer had ducked that he would get home|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: now an easy double-squeeze for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: At this time no.. but if yo think about it.. if S only needed K he would prob place East with it and go on @h and finesse ..|pg||
nt|yuval10: Denmark scored a very surprising 12 imps on board 25|pg||
nt|yuval10: 23 rather|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 9 lätta nu|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: declarer played small @h over the lead and that gives the def. the tempo to play @s before A@c was knocked-out|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s8|nt|jr7: Maria - Maria ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: partner i opened 1@d, not 1@H :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: And she got for @d Q.. She should know that pd has @c ace and @d K|pg||
nt|peachy: well, now we can see if declarer is up to it|pg||
nt|jr7: test :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Well.. She wants @h Q @d K and @c ace ;)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42:  i thought after W responded they might go to 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer need the double heart finesse which is almost marked on the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: Andreas, the are all classic bridge books,  and agree  MUST  READS |pg||
pc|c6|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|nubmaster: sry, English is preferable :) ... 9 easy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|jr7: yes I learnt some new smiley|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hesse: but I do understand Bakkes raise to 4@s with good trick potential on a minimum hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: here come the double-squeeze....automatic|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|granguru: together with Helge Vigne's book, Lajos' is the best |pg||

nt|ady: 300 in each room   12 imps for Denmark|pg||
nt|jr7: only squezze|pg||
nt|kemperg: fast:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room a certain junior double|pg||
nt|roswolf: you will have fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a gentle contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: lol.. Im not really a *Book* kind a guy :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: sorry I just got a cup of coffee - 5@D was down - and misdefended :(|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway bid 4NT in board 10|pg||
nt|hesse: wo boards left of this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Board 25 was only 12 not 13|pg||
nt|hesse: *two|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S is close if anybody is crazy enough to bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w have a minor partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: coudl've worked when K@d is in either hand of defenders|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You play a different game from me, Yuval, if you describe double squeezes as automatic :)   |pg||
nt|jr7: yes works agains both - but not double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: where's Roland? How good is 6@s? |pg||
nt|hawe45: Double was correct, normally juniors bid higher with such cards|pg||
nt|ady: have to be sharp  to defeat 3@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hesse: they got a @d-lead too|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@H must be easy to get|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT= @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scheduled re-start isin 12 mins|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are on amazon download them into your kindle|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Anyone for a dbl on S?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nubmaster: Correct Marshall but it was a beautiful play in the other room, elimitated @cs and @hs and opps tr and then played K of @s fron N... E was endplayed... wery well done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 5D can be  beaten if E unblocks trump king under ace? entry issues....anyway unlikely plays w/o DD access:)|pg||
nt|milton_se: anyone more than me who dislikes X?|pg||
nt|hesse: so the match tightens up|pg||
nt|hedyg: transfer bid|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, second half begins shortly, scheduled in 20 minutes http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|jr7: 2nt = @H|pg||
nt|jr7: I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w can make 3@S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3@h with one down was good for NS at the other table, 9 easy in 3@s...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: maybee 4 loosers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might make on this lead|pg||
nt|hesse: @h is not a good lead, you cant expect your pd to have @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 6@s is a very good slam.. either you missing an ace and have to finesse for @s Q or you missing @s KQ and only need them not to sit Kqx behins ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit too rich for me|pg||
nt|kjadams: not me.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nor I|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: baah chickens ;)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: noway|pg||
nt|roswolf: no just older and wiser|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: the possibility of that  line is why i said at the outset that NS have a lucky game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vwd indeed|pg||
nt|granguru: so Norway took the lead now by 6 imps|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry, 14 is last. Where is that coffee when I need it :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: N pass: no @c fit ?|pg||
nt|pelu: try again Andreas :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 1nt was of the mininal variety|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont make neg X with out a few more points  (like 9 of so)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I am old fashioned|pg||
nt|ianmcc: much and less in that order|pg||
nt|roswolf: never:0|pg||
nt|kjadams: depends on the level.  here, double commits to 3 level, so need more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: on 1 lvl i might but i agree here tho :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: This might lead to A|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S    a make for e/w   unless miss guessing diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: No 4@s goes down 1@s 2@h 1@D|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3@s should be a 6c suit in this situation... don't you agree?|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   meant 3@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL SPOTTED|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957: 3@c, junior bridge|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe he doesnt believe his eyes, partner shows hearts and he is staring ar AKJ109|pg||
nt|peachy: just kidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Shows xx in @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Andi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: probably double dummy though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yikes|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like more than 50%, especially after the 3@h|pg||
nt|jr7: had to play @s from home|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: sry..|pg||
nt|pelu: np|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Andres, do  we have a site for results?|pg||
nt|granguru: this hand should be a tie|pg||
nt|roswolf: same tricks to lose here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: maybe 3S can be beat with a club ruff|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So therefor it's unneccesary to find another suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, meant as private, sorry to interrupt|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: i confess i would bid 3N rather than X|pg||
nt|milton_se: any day in the week|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad that this is 2. last board - back to the 5@D : very well played and very diff to defeat - sleep well - I do :)|pg||
nt|granguru: good lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  Looks like a probable down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c looks like  a @d cue IF 2NT was @cs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jr7: 2 x A but nor Q|pg||
nt|yuval10: both players in W go "by the book" , they missed a key-card and the Q of trump so they stopped in 5|pg||
nt|jr7: not Q|pg||
nt|nubmaster: NP Marshall|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nubmaster: Agree Marshall... pass or 3NT in a sunny day|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe i'd pass at my funeral, but facing a PH it could certainly be the winner:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot go wrong in @s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: too many hearts, danger dummy wins for pitch, the reason for the preempt|pg||
nt|roswolf: still 1 bd to play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: west very quiet here    might have offered red card|pg||
nt|jr7: they cant hurt the contrakt|pg||
nt|hedyg: so a quiet push|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: still I do not neg. X with  5 points |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|nubmaster: hahaha|pg||
nt|sater1957: difficult to score better than -2 I would guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  -2 would be a success with this dummy wont you think|pg||
nt|sater1957: Exactly|pg||
nt|sater1957: but heart finess on, A@S bare ...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42:  i was thinking 2@C-2 but it's 3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  trumps 3-3|pg||
nt|henryb:  and seen them run to 2@h?|pg||
nt|sybarra: even on 1 level |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|granguru: s goes again with the odds playing a @C honor from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: OR bad result on 24 - 3NT-1|pg||
nt|yuval10: E being too practical with the 3NT bid... don't need to rush|pg||
nt|roswolf: trying to ruff in the west hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant see how this goes down |pg||
nt|kjadams: I would have doubled 1S...|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the good spades on view - defence must cash fast|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzct: :) |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|nubmaster: in the other room East ducked first @c so K and A fell on second one for +3 in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes...with 6430 shape, West might have removed it |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|milton_se: 3NT often makes even when it's chanceless with open cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: going back to 5D, declarer did play nicely but the real star was E, who according to the hand record did indeed go up with D king on first round of suit. when declarer won this in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy, contract can now be defeated. W needed to led nine of spades but continued hearts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: u are right - but decl can duck @DK - so 51D is cold :)|pg||
nt|hesse: the @h switch may give Sweden some well deserved imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: nobody likes this defense, to the point of SHOUTING|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub17/Turneringer/KampResultat925.html  site for results|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: when E played D king , declarer needed to duck....really have nothing to losde by doing so and nothing to gain by winning ace. so declarer's performance was flawed...only E rang ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bell|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, right, my point was that if hand record is accurate then it is E who deserves the primary kudos on the hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: now the last board |pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru: best is @D and @D |pg||
pc|h2|nt|hesse: probably -4|pg||
nt|granguru: now @C|pg||
nt|hawe45: I´ll be there for the next board - this is too fast for me... |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe this can be defeated|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not to-day!|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Dono but my guess is he will defeat it himself...|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Thank you all, see you soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Last hand for today.. Ty All|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: restart in an hours time after lunch|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: But if you decide to bid 4@d then probably 5@c will works and it did on this deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand of the segment |pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks all, nice work Andreas|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nubmaster: x now for a push?|pg||
nt|ady: suppose +200  for e/w was a reasonable scorfe   and a good one in the light of their team mates pick up 100|pg||
nt|hedyg: and thanks to Andreas Plejdrup our outstanding operator who has been at it since over 12 hours today! well done Andi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Ty :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: ty :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: Great fun watching the young guns|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Geoffrey:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: great result for the danes in the other room -double game swing likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: thanks all|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hesse: Bakke showing 3 card @h|pg||
nt|jr7: 1 looser in each color in 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: there are 4 losers in 4@S if n/s can cash them|pg||
nt|nubmaster: they might end up in 2@h now|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: EW will not arrive at 4@H here |pg||
nt|granguru: which is in fact an exagerated contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always enjoy the jrs.  thery are creative and interesting|pg||
nt|ianmcc: thx all a very competent set of players|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Better watch out here.. 3nt wont make while 5@d will|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hesse: 2@h weaker @s raise then 2@d it lookes like..|pg||
nt|yuval10: good judgment by the Swede EW to reach 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup tthey are changing the reputation of juniors very few -1400's|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we saw some inexperience in N/S  those few year make a difference,  and that is not to be critical |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to andres our brilliant operator.  great job  |pg||
nt|hedyg: as well to my fellow commentors Raija and Joergen for donating their time and sharing their wisdom :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Hedy!|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here a trump lead can be fatal - if the King|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: So last board of thios match.. Ty all hope to see you at the next match aswell :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting gamble by S, whose limited values he knows will all be working|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well N get punished for his micro opening in vul vs nonvul...|pg||
nt|sater1957: NS have no reason to do anything wild, so probably no slam|pg||
nt|jr7: very good start - he looked enemies card :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: E/W will probably end in @d at the 4 level|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are running a bit late. The second half is supposed to start in 2 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: p-----a---s----s|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks for joining us, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@C and 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can't defeat 3NT with that lay of the cards, it seem|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the way to 6@D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet so |pg||
nt|ianmcc: this looks like a huge swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Down when @h ace out|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hesse: this match will end with a comfortable victory to the swedes|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes a victory but lots of swings - exciting junior bridge|pg||
nt|jr7: a red squeeze against N = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: tiger double again -  3 this session....|pg||
nt|ady: will do well to make     idd well to make 1NT in OR|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: punishment is +3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Henry and David, my co commentators.  We appreciate your insights |pg||
nt|ady: 5@D a decent save   though 5@S makes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2-3 down I think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru: @H return is confusing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will be slightly worried when he sees his partner's @C9 |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Problebly another push :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Spectators were awfully quiet today, please remember that the commentators are here only for you, messages and questions are welcome!|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@S better with misfit in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|pelu: again a X to +2/-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: You need to double finesse @c to win ..|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a spade lead I bet |pg||
nt|roswolf: YES BUT DENMARK WOULD STILL GAIN ON THE BOARD|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so it is - too late for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He is hold @s ace ..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: indeed !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Restart in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|sharkey: but they work - hard to argue with success...|pg||
nt|roswolf: restart scheduled in 25mins approx from now|pg||
nt|roswolf: intelligent lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: well pard (N) an not have too many @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: *can not|pg||
nt|ady: no not that bad|pg||
nt|nubmaster: bad start for the defence though|pg||
nt|ady: ruffing spade finesse will help|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes, must do that immediately|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jr7: to bid enemys color shows fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Nordisk Bridge Union for bringing this fine tourney to BBO |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last session today|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but reassured now|pg||
nt|sharkey: doesn't make it right though...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs, of offer advice and humor  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|nubmaster: But 5@h from S was that clever either... as Marshall said... mor elike a gambling, hoping to get the bonus in vul|pg||
nt|sater1957: brrr....|pg||
nt|granguru: great plays by Simonsen|pg||
nt|kjadams: Qx in either hand is more likely than Qtx onside, and leading hearts up first gives chance of club pitch.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@c looks challenging as opposite to 3NT|pg||
nt|hesse: @s ace onside helps|pg||
nt|sater1957: might just make, but is iffy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unblock?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: y|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: A squezze on S?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: K of @h was better.. to protect an eventually trick in @d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jr7: he must play @h now - yes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: good club switch |pg||
pc|sK|nt|nubmaster: wasn't|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3 ways to win by bidding|pg||
nt|hesse: this contract need careful play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hesse: spade continuation is probably best for the defence|pg||
nt|granguru: another @C and an uppercut for the defensive hand of the year|pg||
nt|roswolf: crash bang wallop - not today|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry NOT |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But as it lays declarer have all the @d tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: bye all for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: So that was it.. Hope to see at 14.00 Bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup BIG OUCH|pg||

nt|blum1956: thanks all - colleagues and spectators|pg||
nt|hesse: @d might be as good as anything else|pg||
nt|nubmaster: and there was no endplay that could deny S to have his tricks, but well done to make this contract and sad for S with the @d lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hesse: (@d discard)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: as Peter points out lose 170 points if contract makes - gains 50 points if off 1|pg||
