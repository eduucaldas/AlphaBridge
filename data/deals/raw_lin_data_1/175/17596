nt|doks: double dummy @C can be played for no loosers, in real life no|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  not void but maybe KQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or AQ|pg||
nt|doks: but @S void highly possible|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps the double might help declarer get out for -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: G-DKR need to make a move soon|pg||
nt|patricck: so flat board and still 34 difference|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty, Daiva|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|shevek: 4@s might have some chances here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|patricck: yes, but you possibly need to guess the Q@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzku: 7 top tricks now ..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if not such a vulnerability, 5@c could have been the best bid|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|shevek: west is already endplayed :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But if @SK was at E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: only lead to make it|pg||
nt|kemperg: S bid 3@H ment as forcing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: almost|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont help their cause|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure South won't like his quacks, but hard not to bid with that shape|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like a push - W has 7 top tricks and 2 more - natural came in majors |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I wonder in what system|pg||
nt|patricck: if you can throw a @H after setting up a @D, then the fortunate @C position might be enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Slam:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  here, they may find 6@s|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, very true|pg||
nt|r_tibre: right.. and can be reasonably sure the contract will be duplicated|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here they had problems to read there cards good enough. OR had it easyer.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the play must be very fast here - nothing special|pg||
pc|hK|nt|shevek: entries might be a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|patricck: In the other room they failed because they never led a club to the 19 while they were in hand|pg||
nt|patricck: a club to the 10 :)|pg||
nt|shevek: clear cut :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I just made the game a whole lot harder.... 19 cards per suit :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  the 4-1 break should doom it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzku: brave 1NT overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: W has only 13 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 14 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT vul with 14 HCP - and what a success!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes earnt a swing for his team|pg||
nt|ady: can really fault the lead    unforunate|pg||
nt|cicus: on a major suit lead 4 tricks difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: the die seems cast|pg||
nt|cicus: simply incredible, that 1NT - it would not occur to me even after thinking a week|pg||
nt|roswolf: cometh the hour cometh the man|pg||
nt|patricck: North's values being KQ@C and one other card are the worst possible from declarer's point of view|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  and 6@h has no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  flannery people (Roland's favorite opening), would have to problem getting to 6@s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: NS in OR will be pleased with the result|pg||
nt|andyv:  so despite missing game and slam, Poddar will get imps out of this|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|shevek: I think he'll make it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: to bid that at this time takes a lot of courage|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for now, it's hard to imagine NS can do something|pg||
pc|sK|nt|patricck: now, for sure|pg||
nt|shevek: at the other table declarer played @s to K|pg||
nt|shevek: first time|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a huge bonus for poddar :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|shevek: 11 imps to Shrikant|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  and, as a spec points out, 6@s is cold...just have to ruff one club|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: they may have lowered point count to be able to cope with nebulous 1@D more easily|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|doks: now 3@C minimum|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  4-4 fit is nice though|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  depends on agreement|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I play Lav always|pg||
nt|doks: in trumps also?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  especially in trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: as it happens, the contract looks hopeless anyway|pg||
nt|doks: other room 3NT down 2, can be big swing for Daugava|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  looks like "nothing to add" board - EW will definitely find a way to the game |pg||

mb|3N|nt|kemperg: well deserved:)|pg||

pc|d6|nt|patricck: the 3 card diamond support is key|pg||
pc|d2|nt|shevek: easy to bid (I thought)|pg||
nt|patricck: really should have been enough to bid 7@D in this room as well|pg||
nt|shevek: operator , go 1 step back :)|pg||
nt|patricck: at the moment the 6@D by North is an error, will be by east|pg||

nt|shevek: why give up when you got the right answer, I dunno|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: yes more imps likely to I-VVU|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|xenya: must avoid any game here -- a bit hard to achieve that|pg||
nt|doks: 2@S 11-13 exactly 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  4@S probably best shot|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  survives 4-2 break|pg||
nt|doks: not here, 5-1|pg||
nt|xenya: in theory yes|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|xenya: as the card lie, 3N offers best chances|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  you mean if opps fail to take their @D quickly|pg||
nt|xenya: practical chances i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|doks: 9 top tricks, if no @D lead of kind of blocking|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|doks: in S bid 3NT, @D lead not the obvious for W|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: so they managed to pinpoint their weakness in @Ds, and 5@C looks quite reasonable|pg||
nt|doks: I know experts, who never underlead 4th A to 3NT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|doks: and sometimes they are right|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: they are discussing the board with a @C lead|pg||
nt|shevek: they did well to bid 6@h here|pg||
nt|shevek: very poor slam|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm....that is one way of looking at....I'd prefer to say that they were lucky to make an anti-percentage slam|pg||
nt|shevek: on the @h finesse and 3-2|pg||
nt|patricck: no, it isn't quite as bad as that because the @H pips give you extra chances|pg||
nt|patricck: K@H onside, or J10@H onside|pg||
nt|patricck: run the 9@H to begin with and then finesse the Q@H the second time|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 6 comparisons to go, and 48 to recover|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or so, indeed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one looks better for kibs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT bound to be bid e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Second segment is scheduled to start about now, so we are running 20-25 mins late|pg||
nt|shevek: still...|pg||
nt|shevek: doesn't look like a good one to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: time is running out for G-DKR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 boards to go and then they have to score up|pg||
nt|patricck: I don't think there is any way back for PD now, even if they bid the grand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, still less than 50%..... but quite a bit better than 34% which is K@H and the 3-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: pass was also alerted|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  pretty decent slam here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E will definitely bid once more|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead  might have a chance for defence|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, I know a bunch of players opening with E hand|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk4: 20-25 minutes almost as being on time in India where time is not much of an issue|pg||
nt|kemperg: :))|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|nt|rodal f: How was the def at 3@S in the OR?. NS have 2.7@S on.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not the best choice in red, but not forbidden by the Law :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it's might right by E.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cicus: it may be a @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well might be found|pg||
nt|ady: not a clear cut make|pg||
nt|cicus: @H lead requires less support from partner|pg||
nt|ady: still not a definate make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|cicus: he might as well lead his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tell them that they are off two keycards for spades and that they should stop in 4, then give them 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead only thing that makes it difficult|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with him |pg||
mb|p!|nt|cicus: now Nanev already knows there are no 5-carders against him|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: sorry no alert on pass|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: This is excruciatingly slow|pg||
nt|patricck: 57 to recover now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with such a weak hand, if E opens and opponents will play - the opening makes their life easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: even on this lead  might try spade finesse for 9th trick   still not home|pg||
nt|cicus: might duck @H10 first|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: @H ducks seems safe enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5IMP for NS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to park his fourth @d or ruff it - lot of work, actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if partner is stronmg enough, E will get his chance to bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: well if defence wins heart   and cash clubs and play spade from south   then what?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Daiva? U are always forgiven. U with the hardest job here.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|shevek: In bd 3, 4 & 5 Shrikant got 37 imps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: if I-VVU wins, who is going to be the 3rd pair?|pg||
nt|cicus: a valid point, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: how do you cash clubs? no it is safety again to raise with the A|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and this plan promotes second trump trick for W|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   since south has won heart needs spade now|pg||
nt|patricck: There are vacant spaces issues which complicate the maths, but I'll take a stab at 43%|pg||
pc|d7|nt|shevek: ok, patrick I go with that :)|pg||
nt|shevek: so much for our analysis|pg||
pc|s7|nt|patricck: after finding that South has only 1 spade and 2 hearts it should be easy to guess to finesse the Q@D that way|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  and here defenders will get one more @d trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4IMP now|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|patricck: South will be known to have 10 minor suit cards to North's 5 which essentially gives you 2 to 1 odds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: another push|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even with this helping hand declarer remains helpless|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  bad trump break|pg||
pc|c3|nt|patricck: that makes against k@H signleton offside, but it wasn't the best percentage play|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|patricck: don't tell me declarer is talking himself into a losing line ??|pg||
pc|c6|nt|patricck: ah, finally|pg||
nt|shevek: ah well, they can afford it now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|r_tibre: @C discards by N putting additional pressure on S?|pg||
nt|patricck: the more South squirms the more certain it is that declarer will finesse that way|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||

mb|5D|nt|rodal f: Partscore for NS and fin?|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: close match, thanks Sukalyan, Andy, Ajay and specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  also thanks to our commentators, Germ, Sukalyan and to all the specs for joining us.|pg||
nt|andyv:  optomistic raise by W|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or EW to fight til 4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or @h game for EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2NT IS PRECISELY?|pg||
nt|cicus: precision players often assign this type of hand to 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|cicus: strong 6-card suit, balanced maximum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kaubash in the other room was 99% certain that he could beat 5@H because partner had shown diamonds, so he doubled and did indeed defeat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: without 3 cards in spade |pg||
nt|ady: problem is if 3T the contract  may be wrong sided|pg||
nt|kemperg: E could have been much stronger|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now E can be reluctant to introduce his @h|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  vuln isn't promising for NS, but N sees double fits in majors by EW|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: will east compete as happened in the other room?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|cicus: some pair play that it evenpromises 3-card support as well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and when in with @HA he underled diamonds to the king and got a spade ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this sacrifice may well be made :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even 6@D was ok, but this should be a winner NS.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Well thought out|pg||

nt|kemperg: wait for the 2nd @H have a signal|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: What do pass mean from E after W opened? A small "hum"?|pg||

pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good point be spectator: if W sells his hand as s two-suiter, EW may well find 5@h  |pg||

pc|d3|nt|andyv:  5@h by W|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|patricck: perhaps East, knowing that hos side has 31 Imps to recover threw in an early psyche to make things happen?|pg||

pc|cK|nt|ady: cards lay well for e/w in both games|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT a bit heavy, isn't it?|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|shevek: Shrikant had a 27imp lead after 1st session which they have maintained after the 2nd sesion|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|patricck: A difficult situation to be in 49 behind with 14 to play|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ritong: he has nine on top|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has to play for the hearts to come in|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|patricck: both 2@D and 2@S are fairly straightforward|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: There are 6 possible losers, but declarer should be able to either ruff a club or pitch one on a dimaond|pg||
