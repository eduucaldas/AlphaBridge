mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|mamos: current rankings -- based on first three matches and half time scores in current matches  http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lark20: Good morning all. Welcome to match D Scotland v England|pg||
nt|highshore: Afternoon Mike|pg||

nt|sybarra: *foot|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello and welcome David|pg||
nt|sybarra: now need methods for minors |pg||
nt|highshore: I've been trying to find out the current position - anybody know?|pg||
nt|highshore: Thanks Shirley|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: good morning from sunny Manchester |pg||

nt|lestergold: Good afternoon Mike and specs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi ,welcome back|pg||
nt|roghog: Hi all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my partner bid something similar to the west hand recently |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Morning everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unfortunately they cashed the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kath, Beryl, Geoffrey and Roger|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is  S Punch  operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has a nice choice dbl is recommended|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: i approve|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: Welcome all, Hi John|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR result ????|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch and McGowan play a weak no trump, 4 card majors and 3 weak twos|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch is one of Scotland's more aggressive players|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass and then bid 4@S/@H later|pg||
nt|roghog: South is worried partner may expect more, but she can't bid anything here|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but tanking like this is dangerous it may inhibit partner in later rounds of the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may feel her herself ubder ethical pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: also there is the stamina fator|pg||
nt|roswolf: operator who are screenmatesa?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|eamongall: the old scores seem to be still there ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: McGowan/Youngs|pg||
nt|highshore: I think that with the singleton HK even a trump lead doesn't beat six clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not op|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Hi Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: the real score is about 78-15 |pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Germ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: Scotland lead overall but Ireland and England close behind 72 70 65|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy game for e/w - there shouldnt be any accidents|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems better from N :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of thiose annoying hands 3N cold 4@s off|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: a diamond lead isnt obvious|pg||
nt|mamos: hello   Scotland and England are equal first with 88vpos a sI understand it  but England are currently scoring 23 and Scotland have more scope for improving their score|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: well north has a choice i would bid slam since for me south has shown values|pg||
nt|lark20: exciting auction for the first board|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  best I have at moment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello David and Mike x 2|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of tricks on this lead though|pg||
nt|highshore: Lizzie Godfrey showing fine appreciation of her hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi roland|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: 4th best spade turns out to be the best lead|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|capercliff: afternoon folks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: yes and a sound result for n/s|pg||
nt|mamos: i could be wrong shirley but I think thats ok for Matches 1-3 but half time for Round 4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: but into declarer's bid, unlikely :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We have a few typos in the N-S names|pg||
nt|roghog: must manage the entries to ditch the @D on a @S|pg||
nt|highshore: That what I think Mike|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mamos: hi roland|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: ONISHUK   LINDOPP|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hej Ralf :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Chick!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi cliff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lark20: not many entries to the South hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Simon|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk5: Operator, please use surnames only. No room for both|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: lively start|pg||
nt|roswolf: but enough|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Godfrey    Nash     Caplan    Connolly|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Godf, Capl and Conno do not make a lot of sense|pg||
nt|highshore: Hi Roland and Mike squared|pg||
nt|lestergold: squared we are both... round....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chilloncan: hi cornelia and specs:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mikeirl: undu|pg||
nt|highshore: Hi Simon|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: now clear the spades|pg||
nt|lark20: north will be pleased to see @HQ drop|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant be|pg||
nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hi Simon :) |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|capercliff: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not quite|pg||
nt|mamos: we were claiming :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure she did this right :(|pg||
nt|highshore: Needed to throw the HQ on the other top spade and then ruff two diamonds in dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|highshore: nothing for it but to run the spades and hope West discards two clubs|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|highshore: An opportunity lost|pg||
nt|lestergold: even ijn a bidding comp everyone would reach 4@s|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|chick: Hey Marshall :)|pg||
nt|highshore: then East is squeezed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: west is not listeni9ng|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|mamos: West hasnt exactly got anything else to keep|pg||
nt|lestergold: what on earth is west doing holding on to the 13th @d?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention the 32 @hs|pg||
nt|highshore: indeed - obviously the 3 and 2 of hearts are far more important|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: not sure that she is|pg||
nt|lestergold: even my dog felix is barking in horror|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: ? something wrong here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: w kept her hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: i think it was a n op teasing you guys|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|c1|st||md|3S9754HQT43D97CAT8,SHAK62DAQJT8532C6,SA63HJ985D6CQJ532,SKQJT82H7DK4CK974|sv|o|nt|athene: interesting that north began with stayman in the other room - i guess she was intending 1nt - 2@C; 2red - 2@S as constructive?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|athene: the problem with stripping side-suits and hoping for some elimination is that it's always really obvious what you are doing|pg||
nt|athene: so opps know to throw their kings brilliantly from Kx and stuff like that when it's needed|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||

nt|ralfwil: must be corrected for the score|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|highshore: my two are just looking hungry but they won't get fed until this is over|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: east will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: even the ruff wont threaten 4@h here|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W have a profitable 5@d|pg||
nt|highshore: Looks normal to get to 3NT - preferably by S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chilloncan: when i said "from either side" i didnt mean EW|pg||
nt|roghog: not sure what happened, but it can be made|pg||
nt|lark20: Liz has been opening 1NT with 11 points quite often this weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 6@de on N is a fine contract|pg||
nt|chick: 6@D makes easily|pg||
nt|lark20: But this is made clear on their CC|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now for the magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S should imply a @D fit|pg||
nt|capercliff: I suspect West will bid 5@d over 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: that starts it out right |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: did declarer really go off on the previous board?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i love that 3@D bid|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@d hmm|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: 4h but tight verfy tight|pg||
nt|chilloncan: from either side|pg||
nt|highshore: some might bid 4@s but Susanna has done well so far not too|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: there we go :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: practical auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should teach her not to!|pg||
nt|mamos: I've heard of 6-4 come alive but East's pre-empt is not exactly textbook|pg||
nt|mamos: 6-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends which textbook mike|pg||
nt|mamos: ah  1Nt got the Spades stopped|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: mis type  (mis-rhyme)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6/5 come alive|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: t/o obviously this second double|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: I suppose 4nt was from N|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure this will get fixed quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: would one always do well not bidding 4@s here heart game is cold and 4@s is a little unlucky to go 2 off|pg||
pc|hA|nt|highshore: 800 on best defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as u said susannah had done well so far....|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lucky to find a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: at these colors south should probably go for the game now that opps have found a fit|pg||
nt|roghog: always lead a trump if this happens, but perhaps not so obvious with a bare K|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may well leave this|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mikeirl: need to avoid Nt here|pg||
nt|capercliff: very hard decision this|pg||
nt|roswolf: sindeed but the 5 level belongs to the opps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sally knows her partner has values for her double|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably knows she won't get rich from double   is 5@h worth the risk ?|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps a better start for North would have been to bid 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she can also guess the singleton @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4@S bid sounds a warning|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes spade promoted very unlucky for Sussabah if they play this accurately|pg||
nt|highshore: if you are going to bid 4@s it is laways better to do it immediately|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: yes 4@D from north a good idea|pg||
nt|highshore: nice passive lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: that wont do much for defence|pg||
nt|chick: the Open Room will drop their jaws :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi ralf:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mikeirl: difficult to lead from North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: you can smell the ruff surely|pg||
nt|lestergold: here here!!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: unfortunately the ruff kills her|pg||
nt|capercliff: holding a stiff @d you know opponants will sacrifice in 5@d, best to set up the 5-level bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: Scotland put the pressure on here to good effect|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: west has to lead them|pg||
nt|roswolf: and does:(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: s didn't open, optimistic 3NT by N|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mikeirl: very, passing 1h reasonable?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lark20: N/S do have 3NT on|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes hide that 4 sally|pg||
nt|capercliff: S falscards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed will west work it out?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and now E can hold the 4@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what other choice?|pg||
nt|roswolf: club?|pg||
nt|capercliff: holding the A@h she knows the @d trick is going anywhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@D yes  |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: @D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: there is a danger of south crashing the trump king here|pg||
nt|roghog: I wonder how many ruffs the defence will get?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcomyn: very easy now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: with a reasonable expectation of 8 tricks in offence and only 1 or 2 in dfence i would bid 4@s on first round|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|highshore: oh dear the defense has gone astray|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: well done looks like -2 only|pg||
nt|lark20: North doesn't want to have to lead|pg||
nt|roghog: @SJ, perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup |pg||
nt|mamos: long way astray|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kemperg: No|pg||
nt|highshore: this could go either way|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|jcomyn: sdpade|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H was|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|mamos: im afraid she will hook Spade|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: shouldnt I think |pg||
nt|highshore: now a club to the ace and a diamond|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lark20: @SJ correct but it gives away quite a bit of information |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: hmm another trick to the defence|pg||
nt|lark20: trick 8 a bit strange. If North had had 5 spades, she may well have bid them|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|kemperg: and 3@H after 2NT|pg||
nt|highshore: well played|pg||
nt|mamos: ok noow :)|pg||

nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
mb|d|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||

nt|jcomyn: me mammy always said lead 4th highest of longest and strongest|pg||
nt|chick: 4@S only depends on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|mikeirl: normal 3h over 2nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: assuming E has the A@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is that|pg||
nt|highshore: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely a nice profit to england now|pg||
nt|highshore: I see your keyboard skills are about on a par with mine Mike G|pg||
mb|1C|nt|copeyj: nicely done by Caplan - after her difficult first board. Amazing hand here|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: routine 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@C = 2+|pg||
nt|sybarra: and where does this end (at the 6 level) |pg||
nt|lestergold: another eason for bidding r4@s immediately opps do not always find correct bid or correct defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: anyway 5 imps to england a triflr unexpectedly|pg||
nt|copeyj: might end at the 7 level|pg||
nt|mamos: or bryond shirley :)|pg||
nt|mamos: beyond|pg||
nt|copeyj: but not that likely I suppose :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Simon |pg||
nt|highshore: NS need to save in 6H over 6m by W. Needs SA lead to beat 7D!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: a classic 1@h vul overcall !:)|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes i expect game to be bid|pg||

nt|copeyj: is possible|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@S now from Lizzie|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the heart suit even get into the auction |pg||
nt|copeyj: or perhaps 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H might be good now|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: or perhaps even an inspired play of the club suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: thats that with NS 4-4 h fit|pg||
nt|highshore: there is a saying that if God gave you 5 trumps you should lead one - lets see if Sally agrees|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: that hardly excites South|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i prefer to bid 4@C to show a splinter and 4@S to show no shortage|pg||
nt|roswolf: a straightforward 3nt now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @H??? |pg||

nt|Walddk1: Don't tell anybody|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too late|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||

nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kemperg: pass by E??|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: The Irish pair are often to be seen in international events|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: where will this end up|pg||
nt|highshore: does anybody else share my experience that supposedly random hands often become very wild at the end of a tournament|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thye have their work cut out in 3N|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: asptro?  @S and other  i assume|pg||
nt|lark20: On the lie of the cards 6@S is a possibility|pg||
nt|capercliff: will do well to stay low here|pg||
nt|mamos: too high I think|pg||
nt|mamos: North probably bid 1@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: or when you are tired they just seem wild?  (agree is my point) |pg||
nt|mamos: EW dont have a great fit so shouldnt get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: wouldn't favour 1NT opening with that hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 2@S?|pg||
nt|capercliff: the @c suit will be hidden, and E/W have stoppers in the majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: naturrellement|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d cant fail |pg||
nt|mamos: suppose they can make three NT|pg||
nt|highshore: 1@h x would have been quite  a good spot |pg||
nt|highshore: East thinking of higher things?|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the 3@d rebid it will be hard for east not to feel that slam muist be on|pg||
nt|lestergold: I like the old fashiomned idea that this jump bid guarantees a suit with one loser at most|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mikeirl: very concentrated points - 1@H would seem more superior|pg||
nt|roghog: 4441s open the suit below the singleton usually|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably - 3nt is a possible spot i fancy which SHOULDgo off|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@d rteally?|pg||
nt|capercliff: undu operator|pg||
nt|capercliff: E bid 3@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north will have passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: now west does not know whether to back peddle furiously or show the spaxde control|pg||
nt|highshore: they'll do well to stop now|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps a cautious 4@d is called for now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: it could well be bid imo|pg||
nt|mamos: this is an excellent start to this half for Scotland|pg||
nt|highshore: a club lead beats 4@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: Lizzie Godfrey happy to pass that with her 6 card suit|pg||
nt|chick: they will never look for slam on this auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H always "transfers" to 4 @S |pg||
nt|mamos: lol couldnt believe Pass by East  she doesnt use Pass cards much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: well done:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not necessarily with the odds but it does make|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass has been missed out|pg||
nt|roghog: thanks, operator. N bid 4@D|pg||
nt|mamos: WEst's suit is poor in context|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mikeirl: tho it actually works here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops another there goes another rubber tree plant|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have no idea how N should find a club lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: the 2@d bid works well here|pg||
nt|kemperg: she wants 3@D therefore not 2@S, good thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is west going to do after pard bids the expcted 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: i still think 3@h looks wrong|pg||
nt|copeyj: nor I|pg||
nt|mamos: can hardly avoid cue bidding now|pg||
mb|p|nt|highshore: quite - heart normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: if lucky wins K and unleads ace of hts, etc.  but wow,  I would ask where the mirrors are in the room|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: claim|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ady: surprise south entered    looks like landed ok   2 diamonds down 1  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: E has a lovely D piece and controls and source of tricks. i did not expect them to bid slam but thought E might look|pg||
nt|lestergold: has east passed the buck or is east even thinking of the possibility of a grand?|pg||

pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: why not make oppos suffer :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no gloating Mike and remember pride comes before a prattfall|pg||

nt|mamos: oh gosh maybe 7?|pg||
nt|lestergold: whsojke form of grand slam try for sure|pg||

nt|roswolf: play will be quick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont really blame north except a spade was the expected lead by opp and therefore is likely to be well covered|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzaz: lost the enmd of the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: no it was the old fashioned grand slam force bid 7 if you hacve 2 of the top three honiours!!|pg||

pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: it's a bit risky at that vulnerability yes|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: To take 12 tricks E must play @sJ to pick up @sQ765 on S|pg||
nt|highshore: I don't think S doubled|pg||

nt|ady: north diamonds too good for any trump promotion|pg||

nt|copeyj: and another good result for England from next door here|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: the hand under AQ@S had overcalled a vulnerable @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, they surely knew that :)|pg||
nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||
nt|athene: there is a lot of action|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all in east's mind at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: she sees a big, fat 920 at the end of the rainbow|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||
nt|mgb81: as predicted she wheels out the woolley cue bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  East's first Lady Milne, I do believe, and the first of many, I'm sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: true speak Sarah|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Absolutely, she is only 24|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what does X show?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: it does suggest spades but....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe it shows @S|pg||

nt|roghog: Not completely without hope when you see dummy|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: @H play importent here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: the standard meaning of 4@C is certainly that it isn't inviting partner to do anything on her own|pg||
nt|ady: spec 3@H  aggressive  low point count    |pg||
nt|kemperg: a|pg||
nt|roswolf: quite correctly|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they got there|pg||
nt|capercliff: not a single wasted value, other than the Q@h:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: probably one down,  i cant see why she would finesse in trumps|pg||
nt|capercliff: bidding this slam would require the hand records|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: why not 3@s from S on 3@d?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1 down? @h are 3-3|pg||

nt|yo_yo: kibs are saying that West should have doubled|pg||
nt|mamos: hopefully :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c6|nt|ady: likely to go wrong   and try 3 rounds of spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: it's that horrible 9 count that creates difficulties|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sometimes you're damned if you do and it goes off, and damned if you dont and 4 is cold|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|athene: i think it is ok to open either 12-14 OR 15-17 NT with that north hand|pg||

nt|copeyj: they are having a horrible time of it|pg||
nt|mgb81: So in the other room Ruth Connelly, who is somewhat of an agressive bidder, bid 1C, then 2C and gave herself 5C when 4S came back to her|pg||
nt|mgb81: Sally Brock though long and hard whether to bid 5S, but after some though she doubled for penalties.|pg||
nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|athene: maybe she felt it might help in the play to have concealed the side suit|pg||
nt|mgb81: It doesnt even look like 4S is that easy - if south plays ace, king and ruff s diamond low east can overuff the 7 with the 8 and bang another turmp back|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mgb81: Moya Kelly as south had a few choices after 1C P 1H - she could double, bid 2NT, or just 1S.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Um, I'm with Simon on this one|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you show the 5-5 you can't really show the values - 2nt would usually be weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: Why Sarah, what does Simon think? :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: she doesn't know but she knows you will be right|pg||
nt|athene: i'm with you too|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|steshome:  Yes, you're right Bill made the 4NT comment.  But of course I'm with you in any event|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not help England's cause that the Welsh are committing suicide at the moment|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mgb81: eek! I can understand both of EW actions (unlike -360 against 1S X) but this is going to get murdered on a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will probably be 1100 as well|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I think we all agree that 3@H was an overbid|pg||
nt|mgb81: how about "6-5-2, that wont do"|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: people often bid too aggressively when they have shortage in opps' suit but not that big a fit for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Friendly defence may keep this to 800|pg||
nt|athene: these hands are really difficult to control|pg||
nt|athene: when the ruffing value is with only 2 trumps - even with 3 trumps it can get out of hand very easily|pg||
nt|mgb81: Alice can get pout for 800 now - it looks like she can cross ruff but the 7 of hearts will come into play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Scotland let a 4@S through that should have gone down as the play went, so +29 only now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|athene: north would have done better to keep the spades|pg||
nt|mgb81: hello|pg||
nt|mgb81: this looks like she's in the game now....|pg||
nt|athene: just let a little club go - what use is that?|pg||
nt|mgb81: that is a very expensive slip from south - turned 800 into 300 if declarer reads it right|pg||
nt|athene: if north had kept all her spades this was 1100 just the same|pg||
nt|athene: just ace and a trump, end of story|pg||
nt|mgb81: now eats has virtually claim on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk1: This is the board where Wales were allowed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bit barking to play at the 5-level on a grotty 8-card fit.  Mind you, the opponents played at the 5-level on a grotty 7-card fit |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: north wondering whether to ruff ace in other to return that desperately-needed trump, i suppose|pg||

nt|vugraphzaz: THEY ARE NOTGOING TO WIN THE SLOW PLAY AWARD AT THIS TABLE|pg||
nt|kemperg: misclic |pg||
nt|yo_yo: on 8 , as was pointed out, west isnt too happy if  K@S is in dummy and you expose the finesse position by doubling|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: Bathroom break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the fact that so many good players are bidding 4 might mean it's not silly :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: silly only when you see the full hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: rerehi|pg||
nt|mamos: NIBU giving Ireland a rough time in their match so these two teams are probably the leading teams in the competition  with Scotland some way ahead |pg||

nt|yo_yo: lebensohl on its way by west?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now how does she show 4@H and values, lets see|pg||
nt|roghog: 6@c for the imaginative now. yes, you'd make it|pg||
nt|highshore: 3NT succeeds as @cK onside|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 5@D would be a save if vulnerability level or reversed|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that imaginative - you have a lot of points and a lot of clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah that's how she showed it :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and with the slam in the bag the scots are in the box seat|pg||
nt|highshore: England doing their bit but as Mike says its all down to Scotland|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mikeirl: nice bid 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: four hearts, on the other hand, is imaginative|pg||
nt|yo_yo: liz daren't bid 6 with those 4 small spades|pg||
nt|roghog: less imaginative|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: 3@D is a bergen raise,  4+@H and 10-12 points (or thereabouts)|pg||
nt|lark20: The benefit of weak 2 openers|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it will make, so it may not be an excess of imagination|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with lebensohl there are ways of showing 4@H with a @S stop or without a @S stop|pg||
nt|dburn: just spoken to the England captain - or rather, I was speaking while he was chuntering|pg||
nt|dburn: so I hope he doesn't see 4@h make on this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: another coffee hand |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Lizzie Godfrey probably safer to win this|pg||
nt|eamongall: True ... they want to make sure they arrive in plenty of time for the tea and biscuits|pg||
nt|kemperg: on pass W had a problem already, would u have bid?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: ace looks safest here; you don't want king - ruff - diamond to ace - club ruff|pg||
nt|highshore: looks like 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if that is a weak jump overcall then i think it is perverse|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: in case it's a singleton|pg||
nt|roghog: has to avoid losing three trump tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm so your law isnt foolproof david?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, we shall see|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has to time this quite carefully to make i fancy|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer needs to draw two trumps, cash four diamonds, two clubs and a spade, then lead a spade towards @h10 en passant|pg||
nt|dburn: the trick is to begin by cashing the diamonds - then, you know that four of them will live|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i could work all that out as fast as you|pg||
nt|dburn: but if you decide not to believe North's @hQ on the second round, you may go astray|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, further astray than you have already gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes timing is the issue plus declarer must forsee the hoped for distribution and ending|pg||
nt|capercliff: ive seen worse|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe more|pg||
nt|highshore: yes on a trump promotion|pg||
nt|highshore: yes trump promotion available for 800|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: lucky for N that E has no entry|pg||

nt|kemperg: courageous|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|roswolf: granted but there is no real gain since it merely pinpoints the defensive assets when they dont win the auction|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: not entirely true:(|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eamongall: onishuk has been a regular in recent years at the Brighton Summer Congress ...making the A teams final on at least one occasion |pg||
nt|mamos: I'm afraid for England supporters that there were too many missed opportunities earklier in the match v Scotland  -- even a couple more Vps woiuld have put the Scots under pressure|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: no   neither can i|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's the operator :)|pg||
nt|athene: she led a heart to the ace i am sure, on the basis that if anyone was void in trumps it would be west, given the (apparently) short-suit lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: also the possibility opposite a passed pard of going for a telephone number is very real|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|eamongall: A misfit hand for NS |pg||
nt|mamos: I think it's a question of style Geoffrey - EW bid like this  it works for them|pg||

nt|capercliff: by East yes, but W has to swallow it now I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: insurance comes into it here i think|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is indeed going off, so its not a double game swing|pg||
nt|highshore: could get trumps wrong here|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: onishuk should manage a noise ...but this noise was unexpected |pg||
nt|chick: a noise like a very loud double :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another way to find game:)|pg||
nt|mamos: still double figure imps|pg||
nt|mamos: or close|pg||

nt|vugraphzaz: possibly?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: there is a huge difference between having a singleton and a doubleton in partner's long suit - it's a reasonable decision to take a shot at 3nt with that north hand if you think ...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: jeepers no excitement here at all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bryony did well to bid that awful suit|pg||

nt|athene: playing three rounds of clubs might run into a club ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for round 1 results|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too flat to get excited|pg||
nt|eamongall: Wales need to stem this flow of imps as Ireland have another 5 pluses to score up in this room |pg||
nt|roswolf: egg all over scottish faces|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: (i am sure she wont mind me saying that)|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s putting on the pressure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: might try 6nt here|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 6h but difficult to bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S now|pg||
nt|highshore: 3NT on top, 5@d by virtue of the lucky spade situation|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: have known Dianna for many years   good steady and reliable|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S asking for minors i assume|pg||
nt|mikeirl: off to a good start|pg||
nt|highshore: I predict that the Scottish lead will shortly be down to 23 imps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: sensible as the 4-4 fit might well produce an extra trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2 of those 5 are partscores that could easily have been in game, so it's not clear they are pluses for the IMPs |pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start|pg||
nt|mikeirl: excellant so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: playing 4 card majors, I think I'd find a 1@S bid with S's hand|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 4s will get them there|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy make|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably 12 tricks even|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@C presumable shows majors    a little flat|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@c/@d also an easy make|pg||
nt|mamos: 23 is the crucial number for them|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kemperg: 4@H not positive|pg||
nt|highshore: Is E holding the same hand that we can see? Some action was surely appropriate|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mikeirl: ok  nv|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have A SKITE|pg||
nt|eamongall: sure I accept that but plus scores mean you won't lose terribly on the board |pg||
nt|kemperg: didn't like the splinter|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no but 2nt was & fit showing|pg||
nt|kemperg: of coarse|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but they are not in it|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually only 6@d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: she will take the spade finesse early and then try to cash everything hoping for 3-3 clubs or a heart-club squeeze i imagine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|athene: entries slightly tangled though|pg||
nt|chick: true :)|pg||
nt|highshore: exactly. If they knew the score they would certainly feel under pressure with so few boards to go|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of competing when balanced |pg||
nt|athene: south probably decided it was love all and hence vigorous partscore competition was the order of the day|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzaz: Toilet break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who for :)|pg||
nt|ady: south got opps of the hook   no real fit  and not a lot of power    but has found a suitable dummy|pg||
nt|athene: one alternative plan was to pass, wait until opps bid spades, and then double for takeout - if partner passes, you are happy, but if she bids clubs you go to diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but with Kx you aren't expecting partner to be passing a t/o x very often i suppose|pg||
nt|highshore: Come on Sally - they've given you the chance|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: maybe give up on the spade finesse since no chances for 4 spade tricks anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is ok due to the lucky @H lie|pg||
nt|roghog: tempting to bid 4@h on such a good suit, but 3NT should be OK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: luckily for Punch the clubs are behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she will have a few anxious moments though|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup actually a very fortunate hand - the scots cant complain too much about their good luck in this set so far|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eamongall: I am expecting 180 imps shared after 32 boards once Wales start scoring a few goals|pg||
nt|capercliff: but I think this is impossible to bid|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|athene: and of course this plan has the flaw that there is no "double (takeout)" card in the box - only a double card|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: so if you think partner might misunderstand double...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|athene: east can see she has to keep that @C10xxx whatever else :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: I think if you play three Diamonds you will go down|pg||
nt|highshore: I think the only way to make it was to take the club finesse - not clearcut|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|mamos: East doesnt know if she's making this yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: she soon will|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes i am always nervous when making a take out double in these positions|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats the trouble with the system it gives the club game away|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: maybe safer for Caplan to double 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: GIVE UP!!!|pg||
nt|eamongall: It is reported to me that the Irish pair in the open room are playing and bidding very well ... |pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzaz: ACTUALLY PLUS 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is this correct?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s just have to grit their teeth and follow suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzaz: yes|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: now she wants to cash the @HA as a vienna coup and then run the spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe Kaye should have risen and tried @C|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|athene: @S10, @HA, @CK, spades|pg||
nt|athene: in textbookland, east has four clubs and the @HK and concedes gracefully|pg||
nt|athene: sadly, in the real world, these plays are not always rewarded|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but this aint textbook land|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|hT|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|athene: unlucky, well played anyway :)|pg||

nt|athene: maybe the moral of the story is, don't go raising partner with a doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not matter much what happens at this table from now on. It is being decided in the Scotland-Wales match|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye <waves a daffodil>|pg||
nt|mgb81: Yes <waves a leek>|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Poetry in motion|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mgb81: in the event of a tie....is it the head to head match that counts? |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Investigating|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead very costly in the other room|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: after 2nt they are likely to end in 4@H the same in here|pg||
nt|athene: then east just has to lead a diamond rather than a spade|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|mgb81: I am told that Maida Grant has just found the onlylead to beat a game against Wales that her team-mates missed|pg||
nt|athene: there's surely a good case for just bidding 4@H over 2nt with that north hand?|pg||
nt|mgb81: so it might be 6 to Scotland instead of a possible 10 to Wales|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|steshome:  Checking back for the 4-4 spade fit - might play better|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|mgb81: Here North south employ a common treatment whereby 3S is forcing with 4 spades and 4 or 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No one seems to know how they break a tie. I asked 5 'competent' people|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H and 4S north bids 3H waiting to hear a 4 card spade suit from south|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|mgb81: Oh apparently the Scots have just let through the game....|pg||
nt|mgb81: This means Wales have pulled to within 1imp|pg||
nt|athene: i have quiet confidence in wales to do what needs to be done|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mgb81: and England are Leading the Lady MIlne for the first time this tournament!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 54-0 to Wales over the last 8 boards, two of which were flat|pg||
nt|mgb81: Mean while in 4H North had no way to avoid losing 3 trumps to go with the king of spades and another completely wasted ten imps to England|pg||

nt|eamongall: a 7-5 hand non-vul should be allowed a few bids |pg||
nt|mikeirl: 6s here |pg||
nt|roghog: correctly playing a @D now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: all to no avail though|pg||
nt|highshore: well done east had to play a diamond for West to ruff  and then a trump promotion|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: 3nt here might depend on getting the diamonds right|pg||
nt|roghog: ...rather than running all the @H|pg||
nt|highshore: the difficult red save available to NS over 4M|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1@S $@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: 4@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: e/w  may get to 4@H    should be down 1|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C or not 4@C?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: too much to pass|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead, ace and another diamond...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if W wont bid with that hand, i dont know where she thinks 36 IMPs are going to come from|pg||
nt|roswolf: a polish 1nt would have been useful here|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@s ?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@s wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|capercliff: she is worth 2 1/2 @s's|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kemperg: no|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: what would double be?|pg||
nt|athene: @DQxx is bad though |pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4 of the other major + longer minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: and decent values|pg||
nt|highshore: What would double by S have meant?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kemperg: too good for that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: double again or 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: I prefer to double again now, but 3@d is fine|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled @H may be lost now|pg||
nt|dburn: it is fine if it implies hearts, but that is not a universal treatment|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate it when partner jumps in @C|pg||
nt|mamos: Scotland are damaged by Wales  |pg||
nt|mamos: lead below 23|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you are very fearful of east leading a short diamond against your club contract and getting ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: also south is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump promotion|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 loser hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible spot|pg||
nt|mamos: whats this 4@D ?  psychic cue?|pg||
nt|highshore: I mentioned on Friday that Zia would never pass on a hand like Easts. This  a perfect example of why. Firstly the opponents have aneasy run  in the bidding but also a heart lead ...|pg||
nt|highshore: would have put paid to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs trump leads  and 3 too hiigh|pg||
nt|athene: now if you play the queen and opps carry on with hearts you are doomed - but if south attacks spades, declarer might get home with two spades, four clubs, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: worth noting that north leads a heart rather than a spade - that's pretty much routine|pg||
nt|athene: with only four card suits you lead the one NOT headed by the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but south might find it hard to take the deep finesse against dummy - i think she should, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont blame north for passing|pg||
nt|mamos: Ah EW have agreed @ds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|athene: well done|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|eamongall: what do we suggest she bid and when |pg||
nt|chick: I think she is showing good discipline, knowing her partner is stacked in whatever trump they land in|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: WALDDK7 -WAS THAT REMRK SENT TO ME\/|pg||
nt|eamongall: a partner of mine always says ... "if you got a bidding issue , give me a suggested auction " |pg||
nt|dburn: nor I - this is usually just a strong jump overcall in diamonds|pg||
nt|highshore: West thinks @d's are agreed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: i feel Bryony should have bid on here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|highshore: a heart lead will beat this|pg||
nt|eggy: Maybe west thinks that because they have|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: now is it restricted choice on the diamonds?|pg||
nt|mamos: ah NS can ruff Heart|pg||
nt|highshore: good lead!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: stuck with this play|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8-1 for super trump fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 more imps to england on 25 scotland in 51DX -3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@DX|pg||
pc|hA|nt|capercliff: is she thinking to ruff this high?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 26 england in 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: play north for KJx not J10x|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: this  way also good enough|pg||
nt|chilloncan: passing at any and/or all turns MIGHT be right of course on any given deal....but if you dont bid at favorable  with 75 shape and approximately a 4 loser hand, you'll be fighting a ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seriously uphill long-term campaign|pg||
nt|capercliff: are we disconnected again?|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|capercliff: :(|pg||
nt|mamos: disconcerted|pg||
nt|mamos: how likely weas West to have six Hearts?|pg||
nt|mamos: AKxxxx|pg||
nt|mamos: would have opened 4@h with that|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: there was not much risk to a second double - partner did pass over 2@s, so will probably not jump in clubs (or anything else)|pg||
nt|lark20: 4@H is on I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: ANOTHER 15 IMPS TO ENGLAND ON 26 82- 58 NOW|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: well done by south again not to be tempted by that spade singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if you are going to try for diamonds you better do it right|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: now trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: :(|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: although @SQ K A, the defence would survive if north worked out to return a heart, as she probably would i think|pg||
nt|mamos: ?|pg||
nt|mamos: @sJ?|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant be right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: nah|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roghog: yes, just ruff a @D|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|athene: @H10 should perhaps be suit pref for spades there|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: since north is known to have @H109 at that point|pg||
nt|jcomyn: one dowen|pg||
nt|athene: two down on @SQ now|pg||
nt|athene: south knows her side needs one more trick outside hearts anyway|pg||
nt|athene: i think @SQ can't hurt can it? if partner has a club trick she will always come to it|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kaye hopes the clubs misbehave|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: well, they will be satisfied with one down|pg||
nt|eamongall: well if we want her to bid is it not only fair that we have a suggested action |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|athene: when defending your instinct is to force when declarer has a 2-suiter especially in only a 5-3 trump fit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh just look at the scores  Irish ladies doing very well|pg||
nt|athene: but after north has ruffed from three trumps she knows a force isn't going to be so good|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am a little puzzled as to how she could KNOW that partner is stacked in both suits after just zero or one round of bidding....why couldnt each side have a massive fit?|pg||
nt|chick: the only action I could see was Unusual 2N after the 2@D bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: but it's a 5-6 loser hand in practice, so the 3 level might be too high already|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, there are four ways to show the other 2 suits on the second round of bidding. perhaps EW have not assigned meanings to all four, but any one of them would seem a worthwhile ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: effort |pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: THE CLAIM IS UNDER DISCUSSION|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|athene: so trump to stop diamond ruffs was definitely something to consider|pg||

nt|mgb81: I really wish the players would hurry up and finish so we can switch to the Wales match!|pg||

pc|d2|nt|golfsquash: great defence|pg||
nt|ady: east did well not to touch diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: the only way declarer might have got that one right is if she somehow knew the hearts were 6-3|pg||

nt|athene: well, it's still one down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry she didnt think at all|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer wondering, is this a Grosvenor i see before me?|pg||
nt|chick: whatever it is called :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for those unfamiliar with Tartan Twos -- or their popular cousin, Muiderberg -- the underlying philosophy is basically: "let's push the opps to a game they might well not bid ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: otherwise, and also tell them how to make it when they might well go down if we stayed silent"|pg||
pc|s5|nt|capercliff: did 4@s go off as well?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: this is true|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer might go wrong and rise with the king on a small diamond return|pg||
nt|athene: if she tries the queen and it loses, the defence can take the spade ace out of dummy before the clubs are unblocked|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: so she is going more down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: David your idea is not universally popular |pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: the tables are disconnected|pg||
nt|highshore: Why not in tournaments above a certain level?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: maybe on restricted choice you should|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: if east wins jack and returns small you play her for AJx rather than QJx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: may go wrong and cash club|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: bet e discards another h and karl will have kittens|pg||

pc|sT|nt|athene: actually, no, sorry|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c8|nt|athene: because if west had something like @DQxx she would win the diamond and exit a club there|pg||
nt|athene: and then east could sit waiting with @DAJ|pg||
nt|ady: may have clawed some points back for England|pg||

mb|2N|nt|highshore: correction - should be a dull board!!|pg||

nt|roswolf: on 12 the identical auction happened in the other room for a push|pg||

nt|capercliff: the South hand protected in the other room, not sure that was a good idea|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: yes and staying low should gain imps|pg||

nt|athene: that is a mildly evil 2@C overcall|pg||

nt|athene: maybe she feels that as a passed hand it is ok|pg||
