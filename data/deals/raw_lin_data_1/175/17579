mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: tartan usualy 5/5,  maybe  a diam. in with his clubs? |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45: Difficult bid for North now|pg||
nt|peachy: Bow North has a lot of info to convey, perhaps the only choice at this point is heart cuebid|pg||
nt|peachy: *Now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The Law is not protecting E-W very well here, 9 card fit but even 2@H might be expensive|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar is thinking. Shall I check if he has hair on the cheast? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Easily 200 in 2 @H D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe more|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3NT seems to be reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1NT 18-19 Bal|pg||
nt|mgb81: This is why you should play 1C 1H X as take out without 4 spades - you have to make stupid passes like the one hre|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: However she came to the party on the next round which is good|pg||
nt|copeyj: in fact you should play X as 4+@S and 1@S as takeout with 4@S in truth Michael :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK despite poor guard in @c|pg||
nt|hawe45: I vote for 500|pg||
nt|peachy: S takes the plus, not unreasonable these colors|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: cards friendly for declarer |pg||
nt|ianmcc: which red suit would you go for?|pg||
nt|hawe45: When you double hard - defend well|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|steshome:  The play isn't going to be very interesting here|pg||
nt|hawe45: This is about the first penalty double, I´ve seen for months|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mgb81: bah that's too modern for me|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk1: They have a system they are comfortable with and that's what matters|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|peachy: Low level doubled partscore is a rare bird at IMP scoring|pg||
nt|hawe45: East has no way to his hand for playing @H|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mgb81: Indeed it is playing a natural system where you can raise clubs, but it feels like having to pass th west cards after 1C (1H) isn't a good idea.|pg||
nt|hawe45: This @D Jack is candidate to worse defence in april 2011|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now North can not play @S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|nt|hawe45: We might be close to 670 instead of safe 500|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the 200 will be the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer still has to work on @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If South stays away from them|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: he has to open up the clubs now, to get another entry, well done|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianmcc: I think he's in trouble|pg||
nt|santyclz: @ds need qx, 10x or 3-3, plus it's easier to pitch three times from dummy, so I'd of course do the opposite of what the world class players do.|pg||

nt|copeyj: I am with you Michael|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is bad for the home internationals for the same team to win on all occasions|pg||
nt|dburn: useful result for ENgland, this - East-West can make 3NT, and North-South can make 1NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: would definitely open 1|pg||
nt|mgb81: The north hand feels worht an upgrade given the good suit and quality of the controls|pg||
nt|dburn: or at any rate, did make 1NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|athene: i think it is ok to open either 12-14 OR 15-17 NT with that north hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's right on the borderline and the extra tactical advantage for 1nt opener means you bend it as necessary|pg||
nt|santyclz: To view more than one table at a time: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  Open 1 browser window per table.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|mgb81: England have got another brucey bonus board coming on 24, but all the imps in the world wont matter unless scotland lose some|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  North will lose her @cA if she does not take it|pg||
nt|peachy: A lot of 2/1 players use 3C here as invitational with long clubs, passable or bid 3NT |pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: But to be clear, I am not familiar with their method of course|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @C is no bad contract. Without a @H-lead, it might succeed even with a bad @C-break|pg||

nt|copeyj: they are having a horrible time of it|pg||
nt|mgb81: So in the other room Ruth Connelly, who is somewhat of an agressive bidder, bid 1C, then 2C and gave herself 5C when 4S came back to her|pg||
nt|mgb81: Sally Brock though long and hard whether to bid 5S, but after some though she doubled for penalties.|pg||
nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||
nt|hawe45: There is a faster method to get 660 - just claim after the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: maybe she felt it might help in the play to have concealed the side suit|pg||
nt|mgb81: It doesnt even look like 4S is that easy - if south plays ace, king and ruff s diamond low east can overuff the 7 with the 8 and bang another turmp back|pg||
nt|sybarra: some part score here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: thin 4@s here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 2 sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Moya Kelly as south had a few choices after 1C P 1H - she could double, bid 2NT, or just 1S.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Um, I'm with Simon on this one|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you show the 5-5 you can't really show the values - 2nt would usually be weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: Why Sarah, what does Simon think? :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: can they get to it (nad do you want to be in it?|pg||

mb|3D|an|alert|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mgb81: eek! I can understand both of EW actions (unlike -360 against 1S X) but this is going to get murdered on a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will probably be 1100 as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Wish I knew their methods, but I dont|pg||

pc|d3|nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@C probably puppet to 3@D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||

nt|santyclz: I think we can all agree with that discription of 2nt...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: I think that doesnt take into acocunt the 1vo slow play fine does it sarah?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mgb81: 1vp*|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|peachy: Looks like NS play weak NT first seat? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes. Hard to stay away from hopeless 3NT here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@S might make. Possibly 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good bidding might lead to 4 ! h - also down|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk1: Stephen, can we leave the table open for confirmed results, please?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: So both significant swings so far have gone against Vestri.  |pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: South now knows about 2-2 in @Cs|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S can make 620 - "can"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And he actually knows that 4@D is most likely the "right spot"|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S is he right spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But vulnerable at IMPS he will guess some game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: I would rather try a Moysian than 4D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mgb81: Declarer made a unusual play when she ducked the club lead in both hands|pg||
nt|peachy: if ten tricks are makeable some way|pg||
nt|hawe45: Why did South NOT support partners 3 @S - instead of bidding what he had allready showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well bid by N-S I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mgb81: had she ducked the second club from dummy she would have made 2 tricks which would have been enough. as it is a spade switch will lead her to down one I think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: After AK clubs located and now SK, the HQ will not be hard to locate as with opening hand, E likely would have said something on 1D|pg||

nt|mgb81: so there is literally everything to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Sarah, Michael and Bill|pg||
nt|mgb81: here north has made an inverted minor suit raise and south indicated a weak no trump hand|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello Roland! |pg||
nt|mgb81: north might be thinking of a slam, but even the 5 level might be too high.|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|mgb81: a misguess in spades is all it takes to go one down, as the two discards are useless to the south hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: ah thats a practical shot|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is penultimate bd of this set |pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't find that lovely @c preempt and e-w got to 6@s-1 for Vestri's 1st big score.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mgb81: One of the kibbitzers has suggested north might raise to 4NT, but if souths bid 6NT with something like KQJx, KJx, J10xx, Kx there will be a small problem in the ace department|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT is often played in this auction as "two places to play"|pg||

mb|6H|nt|athene: east might get vaguely interested facing drury i suppose|pg||
nt|mgb81: 2C here is drury showing 9+ and 3 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: some danger with this - if it persuades West that @cK is a good card for slam purposes...|pg||
nt|mgb81: 3C is some sort of long suit try|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand if 3@C is a long suit try, west must feel that at least some of those spade cards are wasted|pg||
nt|mgb81: wets might bid 3S now...4D from east 4H from west will east then pass it?|pg||
