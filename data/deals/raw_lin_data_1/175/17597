nt|vugraphzdy: welcome all|pg||
nt|eleni: As Aris Sapounakis and partners is playing against his wife's team, Mrs. Kyriakidou:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pef: I believe we are now down to 12 teams in the main event, with 4 unbeatens and 8 who have lost once.  It's sort of a double elimination format (sort of because placement in the ...|pg||
nt|pef: round robin counted towards whether you went into the knockout stage with one or zero losses recorded)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he passed on that hand??|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||

nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everybody, welcome to the first round of the KO phase of this prestigious event, Yeh Bros Cup from Wuxi, China|pg||
nt|panja: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|pef: does anyone know sementa and duboins methods well enough to explain why sementa's hand didn't quality for a non-vul weak 2 bid?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Joe, yes the top 8 qualifiers got two lives|pg||
nt|fluffy: I am no expert on neither pair's system, I am surprised that Sementa didn't open with a preempt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here is the system card for the great Duboin-Sementa pairing http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hello everyone and welcome to set 2 of the scheduled 4 set final|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here is the EW cc http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@hGood morning Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to this 4th Segment of Swiss Teams in the Balkan Friendship Festival of Thessaloniki-Greece|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mrdct: ew could quyite easily make 5 of a minor here|pg||
nt|frankaus: link to tourney webb site  - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson, your commentator for this match.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: These were the standings after the qualifying 10 rounds of Swiss http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=10&tourid=902|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome all to this prestigious Yeh Brothers toruniy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not good enough I expect|pg||
nt|fluffy: It might be simply a suit quality problem given the position|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h Welcome back Ladies and Gentlemen to this 2nd segment of Swiss Teams, in the Balkan Friendship Tournament of Thessaloniki Greece|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: good morning|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to be in 3NT rather than 5@d here|pg||
nt|jcwla: A singleton ask will get them there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or not needed.|pg||
nt|kemperg: change the names please|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Germ, all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Germ and Gonzalo|pg||
nt|fluffy: Open room saw north open a weak NT, wich buried the diamond fit after the heart overcall, now south is poalying 6@c with the bad split|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Raija |pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|pef: east west rate to end up in 4 of one of the majors|pg||
nt|fluffy: second position is the worst position to preempt and you want the preempts to be pure suposedly. Third position, on the other hand is a different story as Mark Lair just showed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hold on we will get names in |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrdct: west showing his minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: 5 of a minor will likely make e/w but n/s have a huge spade fit so they will likely not sell at that level.|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US 100,000 to winners !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d by east is best to minimise the chance of a @c ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|mrdct: welcome back to wuxi|pg||
nt|bg: pass by W strange if 1nt =15-17|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello. Nice to be not alone.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 4th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
nt|pef: I'm a bit surprised duboin doubled instead of bidding 3 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome all|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h Welcome back to the 3rd Segment (and last for tonight) of Swiss Teams in the Balkan Frienship Festival of Thessaloniki-Greece|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants online at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: very pretigious event each year |pg||
nt|mrdct: east telling partner he has equal length in the minors|pg||
nt|kareno: West likely will bid clubs - then we'll see what north does.  Exciting from the get go!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile NS are cold for 5@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederieke|pg||
nt|kareno: Welcome Henry Bethe :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats ok if all else is well|pg||
nt|kemperg: has squeeze possibillyties|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 6@c you have 2 ways of going down (@d-@s squeeze and the wrong finese)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think 4NT is natural|pg||
nt|fluffy: showing a minimum hand with good hearts not willing to go to the 5 level|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|mrdct: this match is from the top half of the draw so the winner plays another undefeated team from the top half and the loser plays a winner from the bottom half of the draw|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Lavazza were enormous in the first set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here is the cc for Duboin - Sementa http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|panosk: back for the last round of the Swiss teams event|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: And that he wants to compete :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly that was just the contract not the auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  Greetings|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt by south works fine!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Gary.|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Not the real auction, but i got here too late|pg||
nt|frankaus: team members ay - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|kareno: South's double doesn't make sense to me - he doesn't want to defend.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fine auction:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Gary and Jordan|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi G|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi G.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is an aggresive start from N here to Dbl in balanced posision here|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if it was singlesuited  |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess RE DBL is best from N now|pg||
nt|sybarra: which barely qualifies for me as such|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: @HAQ protected now, although @s lead and @h through will put some presure on declarer|pg||
nt|benjy: Would you guys bid 1@S over a X? I wouldn't dream of it|pg||
nt|pef: they were going for 4 in 4c, but hard for sementa to do anything but bid 4 hearts there|pg||
nt|pef: this should be pretty dull in the play--making exactly 5 would seem completely normal|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match very close at the half|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 6 of a minor still a good save|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine Precision e/w|pg||
nt|peachy: The USA Hampson team both pairs play Precision type system|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not exactly a predicted auction but they've gotten to the normal spot.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Prakash good to see you again|pg||
nt|panosk: aeras team has a descent lead in VPs as i;m told|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like -1 , -1 is good bridge some say|pg||
nt|frankaus: i play lots of good bridge  by that measure|pg||
nt|fluffy: Mark had just 1 shot to decide for a contract, and he settled for slam in clubs, the suit quality had a great impact|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D = ?|pg||
nt|eleni: nice bid by John Manolas, to find out his pd's distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs using transfer responses over 1@C  and as we see here -- in competition|pg||
nt|kareno: When you save over the five-level you have to be RIGHT.  If they cannot make 5 you are wrong and if they can make six and bid it, you are wrong.|pg||
nt|kareno: You need mirrors to defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes its right to take out insurance enen if ur -1 in both directions|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually if west ducks the improbable heart lead, it will make too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be a bad start to the match to defend 5@cx making when you are cold for 5@s yourself|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting hand to get us on the way|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d - anyone know what that is?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a limit raise of @s with no shortages|pg||
nt|frankaus: duessing  - good @S raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm hearing limit, no short suit ... and Bergen.|pg||
nt|kareno: In any event, Bocchi's sniffer is working hard!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: CC from 2010 Euro is  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he bids one more....your guess?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bochhi's hand hast little defence|pg||
nt|kareno: The 4-1 split may make things rocky for declarer.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like some sort of lebensohl variant here with south probably showing 4@s and no @h stopper|pg||
nt|mrdct: 8 top tricks and 9th can come in either red suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: He's all offense and no defense!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Friederike, all|pg||
nt|kareno: But happily for declarer, that is quite unlikely - more likely with the auction, however.|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Xu|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes i play great bridge  ( i go -2) LOL|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there is the 9th trick - now looking for a 10th|pg||
nt|panja: this can go down on promotion|pg||
nt|mikael_w: lol. I agree Shirely :) But do we know is singlesuited or do we guess that ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guessed |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: some specs, better players than me said that having 3 spades, specially with a honnot is a negative factor for preempting in another suit, I don't agree, but they are better than ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: me so they should know! :)|pg||
nt|eleni: same ending of the bidding in the open room, by more conventional bidding by Mrs. Mihalakou and Mr.Nikitopoulos|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: easy make on the @s lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: system aside, opening a hand with 8.5 losers and a 4333 11 count is swimming against the current|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, the idea is you want to have a singleton ask in place in case your @D's were say headed by Q instead of K.|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unable to enlighten you as to all these meaningsm sorry|pg||
nt|panja: thx Gary, Good evening...morning here, of course|pg||
nt|panosk: 1 team from athens (aeras) and 1 team from Salonica (xatzimpalis)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: @h lead less attractive now|pg||
nt|sybarra: you sound like an auctioneer Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i think joe will run for border|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Peter|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perhaps Fredin forgot it was still teams|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Michael Rosenblum|pg||
nt|granguru: (most) probably Sementa will go -1 here|pg||
nt|blum1956: hello all|pg||
nt|granguru: losing 1 black trick in each suit and 3 trumps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Michael|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: Are e/w names surnames or first names, Operator?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: np Andrew welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about his pass particularly if south's first bid showed as many as four spades with invitation.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Hackett|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 5th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
nt|panosk: gd contact bad break|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h welcome back to this last segment of the Swiss Teams in the Balkan Friendship Festival of Thessaloniki|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugrapha4: Hi Gary, I'll check when I can|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's customary in most parts of asia to use first names|pg||
nt|fluffy: he risks facing dummy with @c singleton and decent diamons (even 5 cards possible), but what he doesn't want in any way is to face @dQxxx or @dJxxx|pg||
nt|granguru: hi Mike|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude    Klinger-Mullamphy odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: surnames only please|pg||
nt|peachy: I, too, think Jow ill take his nine and then see what is left|pg||
nt|peachy: *Joe|pg||
nt|panja: no more entry to Dummy to finesse trumps..if defenders don't help|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: late afternoon here and the 4 day break starts tomorrow|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this will not make, but e/w will make 1 nt so it will not be a big swing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: Nice competitive bidding to push EW to the limit|pg||
nt|fluffy: and play in 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, 10 actually already|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well defended|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am guessing that the 3D was artificial allowing E to distinguish later between a supershapely hand with slam intrerest and same without slam interest|pg||
nt|chilloncan: we  dont know|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these names are left over from previous match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down 2 but give Netherlands an IMP.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing that EW  are Verhees - van Prooijen|pg||
nt|henryb:  You do not know whether declarer's @h are that robust. Coult easily be AJx|pg||
nt|chilloncan: my idea is that a direct 3H over 2N might have indicated slam interest|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: Declarer relieved I'm sure.  And now diamond finesse for safety.|pg||
nt|kareno: It can be effective - it's perfectly normal for Meckwell, one of the world's premier pairs.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also normal for a lopt of ineffective pairs. i have a strange hunch Meckwell would occasionally win even if they didnt open these:)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi spec's can u explain 1NT on 5 card @s by Cheek - bluff??|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrdct: as first name is usually but not always the family name|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes need to hook or duck a @d to maintain communication to the entryless dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: I am told: first name. Hiroki Yokoi and  Kazuo Furuta.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and now we see 2 @s was played in OR as well|pg||
nt|blum1956: no reason to double at all, but the IMP deficit is toolarge|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: 12 is a nice start|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed, in a short match too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: running scores: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume this is a round robin phase.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 10 rounds of swiss|pg||
nt|panja: no, not 1@S for me, I would never...|pg||
nt|benjy: I think North should get this right|pg||
nt|benjy: the only time it is wrong to play a @C is when west is 4432 without the @DQ|pg||
nt|benjy: but if he held that hand then he prob wouldn't bid 2@H|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n may be concerned that s has spade king|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we are bemused by S's 1NT|pg||
nt|granguru: whenever you have trumps troubles: establish your side suit first -  at any cost...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eleni: Afther segment 3, Vroustis team (N-S here) were 1st while Mihalakou team (E-W here) were 3rd|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk3: http://tinyurl.com/3dtwfd9  for standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederike|pg||
nt|kareno: I knew those were first names - but I have TWO first names so wasn't sure :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done!!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: such an agreement could be very useful, but it might more or less oblige opener to raise 2D on three fairly freely. thought they might have a way around that too|pg||
nt|eleni: For results of the 3 first segments pls click on: http://www.hellasbridge.org/apotelesmata/34071|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panja: South's @S7 should indicate he does not have @SK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at the moment Lavazza walk on water :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: Hi Friedirike|pg||
nt|wygbe1: souths carding was pretty informative though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these bids are not even about winning IMPs on the immediate deal. they simply send a message "you are in for a fight at every turn"|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: when i used to work in Indonesia I was always called Mr David by my staff|pg||
nt|blum1956: does this switch make chance to bring it home?|pg||
nt|granguru: a @S at this moment from Fallenius would have permited to trump a @S and obtain 2 down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru: any red now for -1|pg||
nt|eleni: You can have those results (in Greek, but np as it's names and numbers) at http://www.hellasbridge.org/apotelesmata/34071|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: no problems left|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well, declarer does not know that yet.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lookes like a double squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably need page 234 of system notes for them|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D not 31|pg||
nt|fluffy: the way it has gone, he now also has another way to make: score his trumps separatelly!|pg||
nt|eleni: It is in Greek, but still names and numbers|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room they stopped at 3NT by N|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: More information: both professional players. W:20's, E:early 30's.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: if trumps behaved wud have been a winner|pg||
pc|h5|nt|baldfriede: Going down three now. Commentator's curse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only person who calls me 'Miss Karen' is my doctor's receptionist :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have pitched a @s from dummy, cashed one high club before running @d|pg||
nt|benjy: A chance missed|pg||
nt|chilloncan: my copy was stolen by nternational jewel thieves|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and there Bocchi for sure treated N hand as single suited :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pef: and now a quick claim|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: in Open, W  only bid 2@S and S is now in 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: just ruff down hearts and spades, and make his 6 trumps tricks with 3@s and @dAK +@hAfor a total or 12|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h8|nt|fluffy: in the last trick @dQ and @cJ will kill each other|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: marked finesse|pg||
nt|panosk: still spade finess was needed anyway so not best line of play|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|chilloncan: depending on trick target and entries, low to the ace may be better. it drops the stiff king when such obtains, and it  can make the second round decision easier|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: No matter, I don't think a squeeze would operate.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: i don't think we'll see a @c finesse here|pg||
nt|kareno: Had south ducked this, west would have been in trouble.  |pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kareno: But that's more elegant :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: NS must be Burgess-Courtney   since they're playing 4-handed|pg||
nt|henryb:  Cheek and Grue do not like to pass partner's opening (limited) opening bids, and will respond 1N with very bad hands no matter what their shape|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: thx H and welcome|pg||
nt|eleni: in N-S Karagiannopoulos and Kotinas are a team from Thessaloniki, while Vroustis/Doxiades from Athens|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kareno: @s ace?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: talking in islation, not in context of any particular layout, as circymstances alter cases|pg||
nt|kareno: Can't get back to dummy.  Transportation was just too tough on this hand.|pg||
